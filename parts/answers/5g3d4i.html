<p>When we sleep, that blood needs much less effort to go to the head. So there's more blood, think of it like completely harmless swelling. Just standing up and walking around will get everything back to normal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As to how to make it go away, putting something under the head of your bed to raise it an inch or two helps keep too much blood from going to your head, and is hardly noticeable when you're laying down. In my experience, it helps a lot, but YMMV. Also, you can put 2 spoons in your fridge at night, and then if your eyes are puffy when you wake up, you can press the backs gently on your under eye area to help reduce the swelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
