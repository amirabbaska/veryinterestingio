		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dillution technique isn't being used anymore, because it is subjective. Every persons tolerance to capsaicin is different and actually rises, the more of it you intake.</p>
<p>Today a <strong>high-performance liquid chromatography</strong> is used. The heat producing chemicals in a chili are observed, measured and then transfered into the scoville system, because it is the familiar one. Every chili or sauce has different components with different amounts of capsaicin in different parts of the plant, therefore it is often difficult to measure the exact &quot;spice-level&quot;. It is still more usefully and accurate than the old procedure.
There are a lot of crazy methods for classifying hotness, for example the <strong><em>Dremann Hotness Scale</em></strong> where the chili are measured in their spiciness in relation to the salsa they are in. </p>
<p>Hope this helps and I apologise for any grammatical or orthographical errors, English isn't my first language.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Originally, the Scoville Scale was a human-driven test. The dried peppers were powderized and diluted in sugar water, and a panel of 5 humans tasted the dilutions until a majority of them detected spiciness. If that dilution was, say, 1/1000th of the original solution, then the scoville rating was 1000 * 100 = 100,000 Scoville Units.</p>
<p>But this scale had flaws: Between labs, you could easily get a 50% difference in ratings. So a new unit was developed: Scientists established a standard curve for spiciness, and then looked at what chemicals were in each level of spiciness using a tool called High Performance Liquid Chromatography. They made a new scale based on <strong>American Spice Trade Association Pungency Units.</strong> But because Scoville was already publicly known, they came up with  a conversion between ASTA Pungency Units and Scoville: 1 ASTA Pungency Unit = 16 Scoville Units.</p>
<p><strong>TL DR</strong> Originally, Scoville ratings were done with an elaborate taste test. Today, Scoville ratings are calculated by a lab test based on chemical composition of the peppers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They take a small, exact amount of the dried pepper in question, dissolve it in alcohol, then mix this solution into a cup of sugar water.  They have 5 tasters drink that concoction to see if any of them can still detect the heat of the original pepper.  If 3/5 tasters can detect the heat, then they'll dilute the solution further until they can't.  </p>
<p>The more dilution needed before the heat can't be detected, the hotter the pepper, and the higher its score on the Scoville scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
