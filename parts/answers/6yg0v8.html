		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a multitude of reasons. I'll cover what I think are the major ones:<br />
1) Supercars are impractical<br />
1a. Most tend to be 2-seaters with not much room for cargo.<br />
People who drive supercars don't care about practicality as much as us 9-5ers because generally the supercar isn't their primary mode of transportation (or they have other ways to get around the limitation such as having other people to deal with moving their luggage from one place to another or just buying everything new at their destination)<br />
1b. Supercars are low<br />
With a lot of them, even going over a normal speedbump in a parking lot is a challenge.
1c. Supercars have intricate, delicate bodywork
Tap your Honda's bumper into a wall or hit a tall curb with it and it's probably no big deal. It's made to take a bit of abuse. In a supercar that would be some cracked carbon fiber or fiberglass</p>
<p>2) Supercars are kinda big<br />
2a. Supercars are generally somewhat long with a wide wheelbase<br />
On an economy car with a smaller engine that would hurt acceleration and gas mileage. Plus it'd be a pain to park (This could almost go under impracticality)<br />
2b. Supercars have big engines<br />
Economy cars have small engines in general, because if you can't afford an expensive car you probably can't afford a ton of gas either. Supercars have no such constraints, so they tend to be bigger with a wider wheelbase and make up for the weight with more power (They also mitigate their weight from their large size by using expensive lightweight components)</p>
<p>Put all that together and you get a situation where nothing in the economy market <em>quite</em> looks like a supercar. A lot of things have some elements of supercars though:  </p>
<p>The 1st generation Toyota MR2 (<a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/SwLiUPu" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/gallery/SwLiUPu</a>) had 2 seats, not much room for cargo and lots of sharp angles. But it had a relatively sane ride height and bumpers that wouldn't crack at the slightest provocation.  </p>
<p>The current generation Honda Civic Si (<a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/XugAg" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/gallery/XugAg</a>) has all sorts of crazy angles and vents on it that are typically reserved for much more expensive cars, but the format is a 2-door 4-seater with a decent trunk. That makes the overall shape look a lot more &quot;normal&quot;</p>
<p>There's lots of other stuff to mention such as engine placement and the effect that has on the overall shape of the car (and how that contributes to the impracticality). Going to quit here before I write a novel, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of comments are missing another factor: Car companies don't <em>want</em> their cheap cars to cannibalize sales of their high-end sports cars. Let's suppose for a moment that they are in fact able to make a Dodge Dart look like a convincing Ferrari without increasing the cost. Further, let's suppose that people wouldn't heap disdain on the fancy-looking Dart for being a shitty car posing as a nice one. Both of those things are probably iffy prospects, but not outside the realm of possibility. That would be a great thing for Dodge, right?</p>
<p>Except, Fiat owns both Dodge and Ferrari. So what they've actually done here is to replace some of the sales of a $2-400,000 car which probably earns them $50,000 or more in profit, with a $17,000 car that earns them probably closer to <del>$1500</del> $200 profit. These companies aren't <em>supposed</em> to compete with each other. </p>
<p>Edit: As several have mentioned, I was probably overestimating the profit margins on the low end. Honestly the correction only makes this logic more compelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the things that make Lamborghinis look cool also make them impractical. They are small and low with the engine behind the driver and with no back seat. Their sloping roof lines limit headroom. They have laughably small trunks. They are difficult to see out of. </p>
<p>If you want to build a cheap car that will sell you need to make it higher off the ground so people can easily get in and out of it, so they can have a good view of the road and so they feel like they are high enough up to be safe. You need to make the passenger compartment taller - there needs to be a lot of headroom and useful storage space. You want to put the engine in the front because it's cheaper to manufacture and because it leaves the back open for a large back seat and a large trunk that can be made larger by folding down the rear seats. </p>
<p>You can buy relatively inexpensive cars that look cool. Mustangs are designed to look cool and they aren't all that expensive. But, just like Lamborghinis, they sacrifice practicality in favor of looks, so most people buy practical sedans or SUVs instead.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are, sort of, they're called kit cars. Kit cars are often laughed at in the car world because it's like wearing a fake Rolex and often times they're lacking quality. The companies that make them don't have/can't afford to use things like carbon fiber and even the really nice ones only look legitimate from about 50 feet away. Most super cars are made of very expensive alloys and carbon fiber. The attention to detail as well as the materials are what really makes them so expensive. The only exception I can think of is the Shelby cobra kit cars, but they're still expensive. You get what you pay for. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
