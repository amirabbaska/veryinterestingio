		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main risk with leaving an air bubble in a syringe is inaccurate dosing. With the syringe partly full of air, the amount of liquid won't be accurate to the markings on the syringe.</p>
<p>Getting air into a vein isn't a significant hazard unless it's a huge amount - like a whole drip tube full or someone squeezes a drip bag in, including the large air bubble. </p>
<p>The air will circulate in the veins and reach the lungs where it will lodge and get removed in a few minutes. The lungs will filter out the air so it can't travel to the brain except where there is also a &quot;hole in the heart&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A small amount of air in an IV will not hurt you. We were taught in school it would take at least 10mL of air injected at once to possibly kill someone. </p>
<p>They have a test called a “bubble study”, it can”identify potential blood flow issues inside your heart. For the bubble study, you will get an intravenous (IV) line in a vein in your arm. A saltwater solution called saline is mixed with a small amount of air to create tiny bubbles and then injected into your vein”, Harvard University. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's unpleasant and causes hydraulic issues with the heart and arteries. It can also lead to clotting just like blood exposed to air. </p>
<p>Ever hear about a mechanic complain of air in the brake line? Same concept, air compresses and most liquids do not, it affects hydraulic flow and can cause foaming. </p>
<p>Imagine a bottle of liquid hand soap that has no air in it, like a brand new bottle. Shake it up and what happens? Nothing. Now do the same with an air bubble in it, and you end up with foam that takes a long time to dissipate. The heart doesn't like foam and neither do the VERY narrow capillaries all over the body. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart is fundamentally a pump, if you were pumping water out of a ditch and air got mix into the pump with water, the sudden changes in fluid medium (type) would cause various pressure and flow changes that could potentially damage the pump. I guess that's a layman's way of looking at it haha. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing would happen. It takes around 50 mL of gas to be injected into a vein very rapidly for it to cause serious problems like an air embolism. </p>
<p>As a nurse, I've routinely pumped around 1mL of bubbles into a patient's vein very quickly during a &quot;bubble study.&quot; </p>
<p>And unless you're using a 1mL insulin syringe, a small bubble in the barrel of a syringe isn't going to mess up your doses all that much. Even a small bubble in a 3mL syringe isn't going to make that much of a difference.</p>
<p>So for the most part, nurses who thump syringes to get rid of bubbles are doing it because they've seen it done on TV or on the floor and are just imitating what they've seen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
