		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The entire reason that ad blockers work is because ads are generally stored on <em>other servers</em> because advertisers <strong>don't trust websites not to cheat</strong>.  Without a trusted method of serving up ads, the online advertising market is worthless.  Crafty advertisers will also constantly find ways to work around any rules the ad blocker tries to implement in order to differentiate between real contact and ads.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <em>actual amount of money</em> advertising companies are <em>willing to pay</em> for ads does not depend on the number on clicks. It depends only on the number of sales those ads bring.</p>
<p>Fake clicks don't increase the number of sales =&gt; they won't increase the amount of money that enters the system =&gt; they cannot increase payouts to websites (in aggregate).</p>
<p>If fake clickers become more popular, the amount companies are willing to pay per click on ad will decrease. That will be the only effect.</p>
<p>(Also, your ad blocker isn't really depriving websites of revenue. If they claim that, they are misguided. This is because many tests have already shown that you are a person who uses an ad blocker, you are also most likely a person who won't click on the ads anyway. Most of the large sites have already realized this, they tolerate ad blockers and focus their efforts elsewhere. These annoying messages are mostly shown by small sites.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
