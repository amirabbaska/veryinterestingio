		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't be able to accelerate at a constant rate without slowing. As you get faster, it takes more and more energy to accelerate. Assuming that the object has some engine with a constant energy output, the acceleration will reduce as the speed increases. It would keep getting closer and closer to the speed of light, but never get there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What if they weren't affected by gravity from nearby planet, stars, black holes etc but were able to travel straight, would they eventually reach their max speed and stop accelerating? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the responses everyone! So from what I can tell objects travelling through space do not just continue to accelerate without being acted on by some force (like gravity or propulsion) as I previously thought. So I then assume they will hit a certain speed dependant on their mass and will remain at this speed until acted on by another force.
Chheeeeers spacefans!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
