<p>“Fetal behavioral states, also called sleep states, emerge during the third trimester of pregnancy and involve multiple interconnected neuronal networks. Functional (re)organization of sleep cycling likely occurs around 28-30 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), 36 weeks PMA, and 48 weeks PMA (i.e. 2 months after birth). From 36 weeks’ gestation onward, the low-risk fetus exhibits two states of sleep and two states of wakefulness. [...] Fetuses normally pass through sleep cycles of non-REM (quiet) sleep and REM (active) sleep, which last about 70-90 minutes (Visser et al., 1992). The time spent in wakefulness is usually less than 10%.“</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The origin of sleep and circadian rhythms development is found during the fetal period. Both quiet (NREM) and active (REM) sleep are distinguishable during the last 10 weeks of gestation ...  ... A further development in sleep organization characterized by increased slow wave and spindle activity during quiet sleep and coupling with circadian rhythm takes place during the first 6 months of life in both term and preterm infants.&quot;</p>
