		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. Nuclear winter is currently still a guess, which is centered around how much soot would be injected into the stratosphere. If enough is sent up, we could end up with a scenario like the dinosaurs experienced. Soot of that magnitude would require a significant event - like continuous firestorms, with perhaps the entire nuclear arsenal detonated as ground bursts. If the entire nuclear arsenal was detonated subterranean, or as airbursts we would likely be fine. As a note, 1megaton warheads are not as common - Missiles are generally geared to carry ~300kiloton warheads, and multiples of them as MIRVs, as that is more efficient in terms of destructive capability. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter" target="_blank">Here's some info</a></p>
<p>Edit:
I initially wanted to keep my answer short-ish, but I'll throw some more fuel on the firestorm, and discuss a few points that have been brought up - My comparison of the effects of nuclear winter to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event" target="_blank">K/T extinction event</a> might be fairly contentious. I won't steal the fire of posters below, but it is still being discussed in scientific circles - here's a wikipedia excerpt: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The global firestorm winter, however, has been questioned in more recent years (2003â€“2013) by Claire Belcher, Tamara Goldin and Melosh, who had initially supported the hypothesis, with this re-evaluation being dubbed the &quot;Cretaceous-Palaeogene firestorm debate&quot; by Belcher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A paper in 2013 by a prominent modeler of nuclear winter suggested that, based on the amount of soot in the global debris layer, the entire terrestrial biosphere might have burned, implying a global soot-cloud blocking out the sun and creating a nuclear winter effect. This is debated, however, with opponents arguing that local ferocious fires, probably limited to North America, fall short of global firestorms. This is the &quot;Cretaceous-Palaeogene firestorm debate&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To give an idea of scale, it is estimated that the Chicxulub impact generated 100,000,000megatons of TNT equivalent energy, which makes the entire modern nuclear arsenal look like firecrackers. Something else that may cast some doubt on nuclear winter theory - the oil fires following the 1991 gulf war that were lit by the retreating Iraqi army burned for months, and it was theorized that they might produce a similar cooling effect. The soot and clouds were massive, but didn't end up making it to the stratosphere. Another excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a 1992 follow-up, Peter Hobbs and others had observed no appreciable evidence for the nuclear winter team's predicted massive &quot;self-lofting&quot; effect and the oil-fire smoke clouds contained less soot than the nuclear winter modelling team had assumed.
The atmospheric scientist tasked with studying the atmospheric effect of the Kuwaiti fires by the National Science Foundation, Peter Hobbs, stated that the fires' modest impact suggested that &quot;some numbers [used to support the Nuclear Winter hypothesis]... were probably a little overblown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel I should address my offhand comment on nuclear yield as well. The largest operational nuke in the American arsenal is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B83_nuclear_bomb" target="_blank">B83 nuclear, free fall bomb</a>. It has a variable yield warhead up to 1.2megatons. The largest device used by the U.S. was in the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/y1E6vyu.png" target="_blank">Castle Bravo</a> test, which had a yield of 15megatons(incidentally, 2.5 times the expected 6) - note the height of the cloud compared to Hiroshima. The most prolific warhead currently in the American arsenal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W76" target="_blank">is the W76</a>, having a yield of 100kilotons. The newest warhead being deployed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W88" target="_blank">is the W88</a>, having a yield of 475kilotons - to replace the W76(primarily on submarines). The most common warhead for land based missiles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W87" target="_blank">is currently the W87</a>, at 300kilotons(basis for original generalization). Something overall to keep in mind - the U.S. has conducted over 1000 nuclear detonations, many in the same year, with no signs of atmospheric change resulting.</p>
<p>So, next question - what common event CAN change the weather outside of nukes and asteroids? Volcanoes. Volcano relative power is measured on a logarithmic scale, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_Explosivity_Index" target="_blank">Volcano Explosivity Index</a>, or VEI. As a reference, Mt. St Helens is considered a VEI5 event. Krakatoa(1883) is considered VEI6, with an estimated thermal energy release of 200megatons. The last VEI7 event occurred in 1815, and it was nicknamed 'the year without summer' - global temperatures dropped 1.5C for that event(attributed mostly to the SO2 ejected). Yellowstone's last major eruption occurred in 630,000 BC, and is considered a VEI8 event. VEI8 events are thought to occur every 50,000 -100,000 years, but it's been a while since the last one....

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The entire concept of nuclear winter has a rather questionable foundation in science.</p>
<p>The core concept is that nuclear bombs will set off raging infernos, and that the soot they release will block out the sun and destroy the world.</p>
<p>There are two issues with that theory:
First, cities are unlikely to firestorm. Even Japan's notoriously combustible construction in WW2 didn't burn in one of the two blasts. Modern construction is even less likely to, as evidenced by the lack of fire on 9/11, which included two jumbo jets full of fuel. If all the burnable material in a city is covered in concrete and steel rubble, it's not going to burn.</p>
<p>Second: the cooling effects of soot are likely extremely exaggerated in these scenarios. During the first gulf war the retreating Iraqis set almost all the oil wells in Kuwait on fire. They burned for months, spewing thick black smoke the entire time. This wasn't enough to have any significant local effect on temperature, let alone a global one.</p>
<p>So if the bombs don't start firestorms, and firestorms don't have significant climate impact, then nuclear winter isn't a concern. Ultimate, we'll probably never know for sure though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of nuclear winter, iirc, is hotly debated. </p>
<p>The mechanism, as I am sure you are aware, is the propelling of reflective particulate into the upper atmosphere which reflects the sun's rays away from the earth. The particles can't simply be put into the atmosphere -- they must be put into the very top of the atmosphere where rain and weather aren't able to bring them back to earth. To create a nuclear winter, this would require a tremendous amount of particulate, and a tremendous amount of energy to raise them up near space.</p>
<p>The idea was that nuked cities would burn and the plumes of smoke would reach far into the heavens. The closest analogue we have had was the burning oil fires in the Middle East. However, there were no long-term or even really important short-term effects on climate from these fires. There are serious questions about whether or not a burning city would burn hotter and with more particulate than fresh petroleum squirting out of the ground. </p>
<p>I hope this helps explain the debate around the threat of nuclear winter caused by the strategic use of nuclear weapons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>Modern nuclear weapons are nowhere near 1MT. Tens to hundreds of kilotons is the norm. The logic is that it's better to carry many smaller MIRV-capable warheads and hit many targets than it is to carry very few, very large, weapons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While this is slightly off topic, there is evidence that the entire concept of &quot;Nuclear Winter&quot; was a facet in the Soviet propaganda campaign to take advantage of the peace movement in the west. Not that there wasn't a possibility of a cooling event from a large amount of dust thrown into the atmosphere, but that even in the largest nuclear exchange, you are likely orders of magnitude below the energy that would be necessary to cause a large change in atmospheric dust levels.  </p>
<p>Leading credence to this was the disappearance of one of the initiators of the theory in 1985, Vladimir Alexandrov. Granted, some of his research went on to aid in our modern understanding of global climate changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
