<p>Is it something to do with Base 8 Numbers (8/64/1024) not Base 10 (10/100/1000)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost there. Computers don't use base 8 they use binary, ones or zeroes. It is (2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024) as you increase in binary digit places. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To expend on what has already been said. Imagine a small box where you can store a 0 or a 1. That’s a bit. Now imagine that you have 2 of them side by side. To control in which one you’re going to read/write you put a switch before them. If the switch is in one position, the bit goes in one of this box, and if it’s in the other position it goes in the other box. Now imagine that you want 3 boxes instead of two. If you have only one switch that’s not going to cut it. The switch can decide only between 2 positions. So you need one more switch. But if you put 2 switches then you can decide between 4 positions and not just 3. Putting only 3 boxes is then kind of wasteful when with the same circuit you can put 4 of them.</p>
<p>Now use the same logic with very big numbers and you’ll understand why everything is base 2 with semi-conductors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1024 is a nice round number in binary. It's 10000000000. So for many purposes it's easier to take 1024 bytes as a unit than 1000.</p>
<p>There are different definitions of units like KB, MB, GB and so on. Hard disk manufacturers in particular take 1GB to be exactly 1000MB instead of 1024.</p>
<p>Supposedly 1024MB is actually one Gi<em>bi</em>byte, but barely anyone calls it that. Most people would call it a gigabyte.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bit is the smallest possible piece of information I can query. It can be in two states: 0 or 1; on or off; up or down; etc</p>
<p>So one bit gives me two possible states. If I have two bits then I have 4 possible states: 00, 01, 10 and 11. </p>
<p>So if I have n bits I can have 2^n possible states. </p>
