		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A number is divisible by 9 exactly when its digits sum to a multiple of 9. So 1836 is divisible by 9, 1936 is not. More exactly, a number and the sum of its digits both have the same remainder when we divide by 9. For example:<br><br><em> 3823 divided by 9 is 424 remainder 7. Also, 3+8+2+3 = 16 divided by 9 is 1 remainder 7<br><br></em> 92838845 divided by 9 is 10315427 remainder  2. Also, 9+2+8+3+8+8+4+5 = 47 divided by 9 is 5 remainder 2.<br><br>So if I want to know the remainder of a number after dividing by 9, I can just look at the remainder of the sum of its digits. They'll always be the same.<br><br>Now, remainders work nice under addition, subtraction and multiplication. If the remainder of N divided by 9 is 3 and the remainder of M divided by 9 is 2, then the remainder of N+M divided by 9 will be 2+3=5. If I add numbers, I can just add remainders. Same thing with subtraction and multiplication. Sometimes you might have to take an additional remainder, but it's good. For example<br><br><em> The remainder of 40 divided by 9 is 4, and the remainder of 55 divided by 9 is 1. The remainder of 40+55 will be 4+1=5.  So 40+55=95 has remainder 5 after dividing by 9.<br><br></em> The remainder of 43 after dividing by 9 is 7 and the remainder of 80 after dividing by 9 is 8, so the remainder of 80-43 after dividing by 9 is going to be 8-7=1. In fact, 80-43 = 37, which has remainder 1 after dividing by 9.<br><br><em> 3823+92838845 will be divisible by 9 because 3823 divided by 9 has remainder 7 and 92838845 divided by 9 has remainder 2. So 3823+92838845 divided by 9 will have remainder 2+7=9. But 9 can't be a remainder, and 9 divided by 9 has remainder 0 so 3823+92838845 will have remainder 0, which means that it is a multiple of 9.<br><br>In particular, if N and M have the same remainder after dividing by 9, then N-M will be divisible by 9. Their remainders are the same, so subtracting them will give remainder zero, which means that it must be divisible by 9.<br><br>If you have a number, then reordering it's digits won't change the remainder after dividing by 9, because this does not change the sum of the digits. The remainder of 435 after dividing by 9 is the same as the remainder of 4+3+5=12, which is 3. The remainder of 354 after dividing by 9  is the same as the remainder of 3+5+4 = 12, which is 3. This means that 435-354 will have remainder 3-3=0, so it is divisible by 9.<br><br>So, because reversing the digits does not change the sum of the digits, the difference will always be divisible by 9.<br><br>The field of math dealing with remainders is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic" target="_blank">Modular Arithmetic</a>.<br><br>EDIT: It works for 11,22,33 etc and palindromes, 313,2332 etc, because 0=0\</em>9, which means zero is a multiple of 9.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Any two digit number can be written as 10x + y. (So 52 = 10*5 + 2). Reversing the number gives you 10y + x. Then:<br><br>(10x+y) - (10y+x) = 10x+y - 10y-x<br><br>= 10x - x + y - 10y<br><br>= 9x - 9y<br><br>= 9(x-y)<br><br>Which is divisible by 9 so long as x and y are integers.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>It has to do with the fact that you are writing the numbers in base 10, and 9 is one less than that.<br><br>I'll do a general calculation here, so you see what's going on with N digits. Hopefully you will see the point where our base-10 system comes into play. So, taking something like<br><br>     AB...XZ = A<em>10^N + B</em>10^N-1 + ... + X<em>10 + Z<br><br>the reverse would be<br><br>     ZX...BA = Z</em>10^N + X<em>10^N-1 + ... + B</em>10 + A<br><br>Now let's subtract the bottom number from the top one:<br><br>     AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  <br>     =   A<em>10^N + B</em>10^N-1 + ... + X<em>10 + Z -  <br>       - Z</em>10^N - X<em>10^N-1 - ... - B</em>10 - A<br><br>I'm gonna gather up the numbers from the coefficients A and B and ... and X and Z, so that we get<br><br>     AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  <br>     = A(10^N - 1) + B(10^N-1 - 10) + ... +<br>                      + X(10 - 10^N-1) + Z (1 - 10^N)  <br>     = A(10^N - 1) + 10 B(10^N-2 - 1) + ...-<br>                      - 10 X(10^N-2 - 1) - Z (10^N - 1)  <br>where I have extracted the lowest common power of 10 from each parenthesis, and switched the signs where we get something negative.<br><br>Notice the look of each parenthesis now: They all are of the shape (10^something - 1). You probably know already what happens when you subtract 1 from a number like 100000...0000; You get lots of nines! Like 9999...999. So,<br><br>     AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  <br>     = A(99..N-1..99) + 10<em>B(99..N-2..99) + ... -<br>                  - 10</em>X(99..N-2..99) - Z(99..N-1..99)  <br>     = 9<em>A(11..N-1..11) + 90</em>B(11..N-2..11) + ... -<br>                  - 90<em>X(11..N-2..11) - 9</em>Z(11..N-1..11) <br><br>We can now take all of this and place parentheses around, and then extract a number 9:<br><br>     AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  <br>     = 9 [ A(11..N..11) + 10 B(11..N-2..11) + ... -<br>                  - 10 X(11..N-2..11) -  Z (11..N..11) ]  <br>and you can therefore see that the number will be divisible by 9, since all the stuff inside the parenthesis are integers.<br><br>If this was done in, say, base-4, we would not get 999...999 inside the different parenthesis, but 333...333 instead. But because we wrote the number in base-10 as AB...XZ, and then subtracted the mirror image, the result is a 9-divisible number!</p>		<div class="replies-controls">
