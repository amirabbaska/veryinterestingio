		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A number is divisible by 9 exactly when its digits sum to a multiple of 9. So 1836 is divisible by 9, 1936 is not. More exactly, a number and the sum of its digits both have the same remainder when we divide by 9. For example:<br><br><em> 3823 divided by 9 is 424 remainder 7. Also, 3+8+2+3 = 16 divided by 9 is 1 remainder 7<br><br></em> 92838845 divided by 9 is 10315427 remainder  2. Also, 9+2+8+3+8+8+4+5 = 47 divided by 9 is 5 remainder 2.<br><br>So if I want to know the remainder of a number after dividing by 9, I can just look at the remainder of the sum of its digits. They'll always be the same.<br><br>Now, remainders work nice under addition, subtraction and multiplication. If the remainder of N divided by 9 is 3 and the remainder of M divided by 9 is 2, then the remainder of N+M divided by 9 will be 2+3=5. If I add numbers, I can just add remainders. Same thing with subtraction and multiplication. Sometimes you might have to take an additional remainder, but it's good. For example<br><br><em> The remainder of 40 divided by 9 is 4, and the remainder of 55 divided by 9 is 1. The remainder of 40+55 will be 4+1=5.  So 40+55=95 has remainder 5 after dividing by 9.<br><br></em> The remainder of 43 after dividing by 9 is 7 and the remainder of 80 after dividing by 9 is 8, so the remainder of 80-43 after dividing by 9 is going to be 8-7=1. In fact, 80-43 = 37, which has remainder 1 after dividing by 9.<br><br><em> 3823+92838845 will be divisible by 9 because 3823 divided by 9 has remainder 7 and 92838845 divided by 9 has remainder 2. So 3823+92838845 divided by 9 will have remainder 2+7=9. But 9 can't be a remainder, and 9 divided by 9 has remainder 0 so 3823+92838845 will have remainder 0, which means that it is a multiple of 9.<br><br>In particular, if N and M have the same remainder after dividing by 9, then N-M will be divisible by 9. Their remainders are the same, so subtracting them will give remainder zero, which means that it must be divisible by 9.<br><br>If you have a number, then reordering it's digits won't change the remainder after dividing by 9, because this does not change the sum of the digits. The remainder of 435 after dividing by 9 is the same as the remainder of 4+3+5=12, which is 3. The remainder of 354 after dividing by 9  is the same as the remainder of 3+5+4 = 12, which is 3. This means that 435-354 will have remainder 3-3=0, so it is divisible by 9.<br><br>So, because reversing the digits does not change the sum of the digits, the difference will always be divisible by 9.<br><br>The field of math dealing with remainders is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic" target="_blank">Modular Arithmetic</a>.<br><br>EDIT: It works for 11,22,33 etc and palindromes, 313,2332 etc, because 0=0\</em>9, which means zero is a multiple of 9.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>It has to do with the fact that you are writing the numbers in base 10, and 9 is one less than that.<br><br>I'll do a general calculation here, so you see what's going on with N digits. Hopefully you will see the point where our base-10 system comes into play. So, taking something like<br><br>     AB...XZ = A<em>10^N + B</em>10^N-1 + ... + X<em>10 + Z<br><br>the reverse would be<br><br>     ZX...BA = Z</em>10^N + X<em>10^N-1 + ... + B</em>10 + A<br><br>Now let's subtract the bottom number from the top one:<br><br>     AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  <br>     =   A<em>10^N + B</em>10^N-1 + ... + X<em>10 + Z -  <br>       - Z</em>10^N - X<em>10^N-1 - ... - B</em>10 - A<br><br>I'm gonna gather up the numbers from the coefficients A and B and ... and X and Z, so that we get<br><br>     AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  <br>     = A(10^N - 1) + B(10^N-1 - 10) + ... +<br>                      + X(10 - 10^N-1) + Z (1 - 10^N)  <br>     = A(10^N - 1) + 10 B(10^N-2 - 1) + ...-<br>                      - 10 X(10^N-2 - 1) - Z (10^N - 1)  <br>where I have extracted the lowest common power of 10 from each parenthesis, and switched the signs where we get something negative.<br><br>Notice the look of each parenthesis now: They all are of the shape (10^something - 1). You probably know already what happens when you subtract 1 from a number like 100000...0000; You get lots of nines! Like 9999...999. So,<br><br>     AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  <br>     = A(99..N-1..99) + 10<em>B(99..N-2..99) + ... -<br>                  - 10</em>X(99..N-2..99) - Z(99..N-1..99)  <br>     = 9<em>A(11..N-1..11) + 90</em>B(11..N-2..11) + ... -<br>                  - 90<em>X(11..N-2..11) - 9</em>Z(11..N-1..11) <br><br>We can now take all of this and place parentheses around, and then extract a number 9:<br><br>     AB...XZ - ZX...BA =  <br>     = 9 [ A(11..N..11) + 10 B(11..N-2..11) + ... -<br>                  - 10 X(11..N-2..11) -  Z (11..N..11) ]  <br>and you can therefore see that the number will be divisible by 9, since all the stuff inside the parenthesis are integers.<br><br>If this was done in, say, base-4, we would not get 999...999 inside the different parenthesis, but 333...333 instead. But because we wrote the number in base-10 as AB...XZ, and then subtracted the mirror image, the result is a 9-divisible number!</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Time too answer is good, but it's coming at it from a direction I feel isn't the easiest to understand.<br><br>Let's take 321 as a basic example.  We want to subtract 321 - 123 and know if it's divisible by 9.<br><br>We could do a number of things to verify the remainder of each number, add them together, etc. But instead, let's just look at the two numbers in front of us and break them down, literally.<br><br>321 = 300 + 20 + 1  <br>123 = 100 + 20 + 3<br><br>Let's reverse the lower number.<br><br>321 = 300 + 20 + 1  <br>123 = 3 + 20 + 100<br><br>Now let's subtract the second row from the first, but we take it one column at a time:<br><br>(300 - 3) + (20 - 20) + (1 - 100)<br><br>If you have an odd number of digits, then the middle will cancel itself out, like we see here.  Since 20 - 20 = 0, we no longer need it in the equation.<br><br>Now 300 - 3 is just 3x (100 - 1).  In other words:<br><br>321 - 123 = 3*99 - 1*99<br><br>All of your chunks here will be some number multiplied by 9, 99, 999, etc .  This holds true for any number, since you can always  rearrange the columns to match the original digits.<br><br>And since it's plain to see 9999... is a multiple of 9, any number minus it's reverse will be a multiple of 9.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A number is a sum of powers of ten times its digits. So if the digits are a and b, the number is 10a + b. Reverse the digits you get 10b + a. Subtract one from the other and you get 10a + b - 10b - a, which is 9a - 9b or 9(a-b). So for every a and b, the result of this formula has a factor of 9 in it. Doing it for bigger numbers results in the same situation. 100a + 10b + c - 100c - 10b - a = 99(a-c). And so on. No matter how long the number is, you are subtracting numbers that are in ratios by powers of 10, leaving multiples of 9.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Here is an answer that might use some more technical jargon than the others. Anyone here fammiliar with modular arithmetic?<br><br>In modular arithmetic, you say two numbers are 'congruent mod n' (in a way, equivalent) if their remainder by n is the same (where n is an integer).<br><br>For example, let's say we're working mod 4. Then 5 is congruent with 1, and any multiple of four is congruent with 0. See if you understand why.  <br>Congruence behaves well in regards to addition and multiplication, so you can add and multiply things without much trouble. For example, a fact that we will use soon is that we have, mod a: (a+1)^k == 1^k == 1, and we got this result without doing any actual powers (except of 1) just by knowing a+1 == 1 mod a<br><br>How does this apply to our case? Well, all we need to do is use mod 9. Any number in base 10 can be represented as:<br><br>a + 10b + 100c + ... + 10^n z<br><br>That is, as a sum of powers of ten. Well, ten is congruent with one mod 9, so it is all congruent with:<br><br>a+b+c+...+z<br><br>This also gives us a nice justification for why a number is divisible by nine iff the sum of its digits is divisible by nine.<br><br>Now, take this number and subtract it by any permutation of its digits. Mod 9, what do you get? Zero, because the two numbers are the same (mod 9, because addition is commutative).<br><br>These permutations also include a reversal, the result you desired.<br><br>However, with modular arithmetic, it was easy to generalize to whatever combinations you decide to use: as long as two numbers use the same digits the same number of times (you can include trailing zeros), their difference mod 9 will be zero, and as such it will be divisible by 9.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>It's &quot;simple&quot; really. You know the trick where you can add the digits together to see if a number is divisible by 9? The reason that works is because when you are adding the digits what you are actually doing is calculating the remainder of the number when you divide it by 9. So by reversing the digits you aren't changing the remainder and when you perform the subtraction the reminders cancel out and you are left with a multiple of nine.<br><br>What's interesting about this is that you can actually rearrange the digits however you like before you perform the subtraction and you will still end up with a multiple of nine.<br><br>for example: 71426 - 46712 = 24714 = 2746 x 9<br><br> <br><br>TL;DR: It works because we use a base ten number system and 10=9+1.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>From the perspective of someone who isn't huge into maths, I don't have a formula or super complicated explanation for you. However, I can approach this logically. Without much thought, this for some reason makes a lot of sense to me. This may not have any mathematical backing, but think of all the number pairings (let's do 2 digit numbers to keep it simple) and arrange their digits on a number line from 1-10. For example, take 49 and 94. 9-4=5. In other words, 9 and 4 are 5 steps apart. To me, this means that the difference of the two numbers will be 5 times greater than 9, or exactly 9<em>5. Let's check. 94-49=45. 9</em>5=45. Yep!<br><br>My logic behind this goes back to the number line. Think about how when you take the average of two numbers. You add them together and divide by two. Alternatively, you start at both of the numbers and &quot;take steps&quot;, or count one number at a time, towards the other number, until you meet in the middle or at two consecutive numbers, in which case the average is right between them. For example, take the average of 15 and 25. You could do 15+25=40. 40/2=20. Therefore, the average of 15 and 25 is 20. Alternatively (and I promise this is going somewhere), you can &quot;count steps&quot;, as explained before. You start at each number, so 15 and 25, and start counting, so we go from 15 towards 25, which is up, so we now have 16, after counting one step. Doing the same for 25, counting down this time, we get 24. So now, we have set B (16 and 24), instead of set A (15 and 25). These sets have the same average [16+24=40. 40/2=20. average is still 20], but different values. If we repeat this process, we go from 16 and 24 to 17 and 23. Then, 18 and 22, to 19 and 21, until our last step, which is to either move the numbers down into the same spot or to take the average of the two numbers, which yield the same result: 20. As a rule, you could just take the average of two consecutive numbers at the end of a step.<br><br>Now: we can apply this concept to our &quot;divisible by 9&quot; problem. Let's take a number. Say, 27. Its opposite is 72. Using our original method, we can do 7-2=5; 5 steps apart, meaning that the difference of our pair should be 9<em>5, or 45. 72-27=45. Yep, again! Let's place our digits on that number line and take those steps. This time, one step is not only representative of moving up one set (moving up to a pair of numbers that have the same sum, and therefore same average, but different values), but also a multiple of 9. Moving up one step essentially means separating our actual two digit numbers by 9. So, going from 2 towards 7, so up, to 3, and from 7 towards 2, so down, to 6. Now, we have 3 and 6, have moved one set, and moved our numbers collectively by a value of 9. Phew. Now to repeat this process until we meet in the middle again. We move from 3 and 6 to 4 and 5. At this point, we can't take any more steps, so we're done here!<br><br>Let's plug this into our two digit numbers and see what happens. Starting with 27 and 72, we replaced the 2 with 3, so we now have 37 and 73. Still opposites. We also replaced the 7 with 6, so now we have 36 and 63. Again, still opposites. Let's repeat. We move down to 46 and 64, then to 54 and 45. Once again, we arrive at this number. This is what I'd like to call the midpoint for the two digit. This is a point when the numbers are only one step apart (this is where our last step comes in because, if you'll notice, we took 5 steps from 7-2, but only did 4 steps in getting from 27 and 72 to 45 and 54). In other words, 54-45=9. Exactly 9. This means that any &quot;consecutive opposite pair&quot;, meaning a pair of opposite numbers that are as close to each other as possible (or separated only by one step), such as 12 and 21 or 87 and 78 [this can also be described as a number whose digits are consecutive. This works because if you look at a number line of 1-10, the greatest distance apart any two numbers can be is 9. Adding another dimension (i.e. going into double digits) means that once you go past 10, you just go back to one, so this rule holds up.], will always have a difference of 9. Thus, going outward by any number of steps only increases that difference by a factor of however many steps you took. If you start with 34 and 43, then you are only one step apart and the difference is 9. Going one step out to 35 and 53, you are now separated by two steps, and the difference is now 9 (which is the original difference, or &quot;constant difference&quot;, obtained by the above explanation in brackets) multiplied by the number of steps out you are. Therefore, 9</em>2=18, and 53-35=18. Indeed.<br><br>This can be viewed at on its most basic level by not leaving the realm of the 1-10 number line. Take the only existing opposite pair here, 1 and 10 (this is an opposite pair because you can assume a zero before the one, i.e., 10 and 01), and applying the previously mentioned rule of: the greatest distance any two numbers can be from each other is 9, we can do 10-1=9. There we have it.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Here's another way to think about it. Any number can be written as a sum of 1s, 10s, 100s, etc, without rounding, and you can do your operation on each one of those pieces.  Example, 1030=1000+10+10+10.  When you reverse the digits you get 1+100+100+100.  Then when you subtract you get 999-90-90-90, obviously a multiple of 9.  In fact each term will always be of the form 99..99900..000 for some numbers of 9s and 0s, and obviously a multiple of 9.<br><br>Then again there's nothing special above about reversing the digits, the same works however you rearrange the digits. This gets into the classic test for divisibility: a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.  more precisely the remainder when dividing by 9 spends only on the sum of the digits and not on their order.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

That's important to remember because we can pick any other base or representation system (such as base-16, binary, or roman numerals) and there the &quot;interesting&quot; properties of a number based on its representation are not necessarily related to the number itself, just its representation.<br><br>That said, why is the particular property of base-10 representations of whole numbers as you say? That's pretty straightforward, for two-diget numbers you have this:<br><br>  a <em> 10 + b - (b </em> 10 + a)<br><br>  Or: a <em> 9 - b </em> 9 = (a-b) * 9</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
