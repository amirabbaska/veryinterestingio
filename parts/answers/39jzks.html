		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am going to piggy back on this question to ask a follow up.  We know that a single mating pair would not be enough to keep humans alive.  But what would be the actual result?  Assuming the humans are 100% dedicated to creating as many offspring as possible, there is no incest taboo, everyone breeds as soon as their body is physically capable, and environmental factors are disregarded, how many generations can we expect to get from this single pair?  And how many genetic abnormalities can we expect?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Blue Book (&quot;Viable Populations for Conservation&quot;) quotes 50 to 1000 individuals for 95% probability of survival for more than 100 years.</p>
<p>As you can see, the variation is huge depending on species size, gregariousness, reproductive strategy (r-strategists vs k-strategists) and the genetic past of the species: a previous genetic bottleneck makes the population more fragile to external threats but at the same time much stronger against followup bottlenecks: while the species has shed most of its diversity it's also shed most of its genetic deficiencies, leading to much lower minimum viable populations.</p>
<p>A strong example of that is the Mauritius Kestrel, which was restored from only 2 mated pairs (there are now ~800 mauritius kestrel in the wild).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Entomologist here: when we attempt to introduce a population of insects to provide biological control of a pest it is not uncommon to start with 30 or so individuals. We travel to the homeland of the pest insect and collect a variety of predatory  or parasitic insects, test them to ensure they won't have adverse effects in the introduced range. After a few years of testing a release of the predators is attempted, with varying levels  of success.</p>
<p>The original collection of predators may be even smaller, as it may include cryptic species which will not interbreed. It is not uncommon that this original population is not augmented, ie.  it is challenging to go to the original host range and collect MORE individuals in part because it is challenging to ensure they are of the exact species.</p>
<p>Not all biocontrol attempts are successful, of course, but some are very successful and establish in the introduced range. The original 30 or so individuals start the lab populations which are reared in quarantine for years, then mass reared to produce hundreds of thousands of individuals for release in the introduced range.</p>
<p>tl;dr We have dozens of insect populations in labs, started with 30 or so individuals, kept for 5- 10 years;  at 10-14 days per generation, that means they have remained viable for hundreds  of generations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
