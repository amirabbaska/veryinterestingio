		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Fisheries scientist here.  I am seeing a lot of incomplete or partially correct answers here.  This might be more ELI15.<br><br><strong>Freshwater fishes</strong> tend to have much higher concentrations of ions (like sodium) in their blood compared with the concentrations in the water.  Their bodies are designed to expel large volumes of very dilute urine frequently.  This works to their advantage in a freshwater environment because they are surrounded by water with low salt concentrations.  So, just pee a lot and hang onto what little salts you have.  They also have specialized cells in their gills to allow them to directly take up sodium and chloride from the water to fine-tune the salt balance in their blood and cells.  <br><br><strong>Saltwater fishes</strong> face the opposite problem. They need to maintain salt concentrations in their blood that are much lower than the surrounding environment.  To do this, they actively drink water and form a highly-concentrated urine to expel the excess salts. They also actively expel salts at their gills.<br><br>So the basic freshwater strategy is to <strong>pee like hell</strong> and absorb salt. The basic saltwater strategy is to <strong>drink and hold it</strong> so they can absorb as much of the water (while leaving behind the salts) as possible.  Put either of these fishes in the opposite environment, and these critical systems fail to function. The &quot;pee like hell&quot; strategy will quickly deplete cells of water in a saltwater environment, while the &quot;drink and hold it&quot; strategy will completely water-log them. These salt concentrations are critical to many bodily functions.  Just think about what happens to people when they get dehydrated or, in some cases, drink TOO MUCH water. They are at real risk of death.  Same for these fish.<br><br>What about things like salmon?  Or sharks?<br><br>Many <strong>salmon and their relatives</strong> live in both fresh and saltwater at different points in their lives. Pacific salmon (e.g., Chinook salmon) are born in freshwater.  They have nice, normal freshwater adaptations.  However, when they reach a certain age and are ready to leave their rivers, they go through dramatic physical transformations during which they develop the necessary adaptations to live in a marine environment.  When they are old enough, and are ready to breed in freshwater as adults, they undergo yet another transformation.  This, and the energy required to to migrate and produce eggs/sperm, exacts such a toll on the fish that they almost always die immediately after spawning.  Moving between fresh and saltwater is not easy.<br><br>What about <strong>sharks</strong>, like bullsharks?  How do they move between fresh and saltwater? Sharks are very different from what people normally call &quot;fish&quot;.  They also have a completely different strategy for surviving in saltwater, which will inform us about how some survive in freshwater.  Rather than deal with the threat of constant water loss by drinking saltwater and excreting the extra salt, a shark's blood is filled with urea (a nitrogen-based compound that makes your pee stink [EDIT: the stink is actually from the urea decomposing into ammonia; urea is odorless on its own]).  In fact, they store so much of it that their blood ion concentrations are actually close to that of sea water. Sharks that can spend time in freshwater are able to expel excess urea (which is just a metabolic waste product, hence why it's in your pee) rather than retain it in their blood. This allows them to adjust the levels of dissolved ions in their blood so that they can flexibly move between salt and freshwaters.<br><br>Now, this doesn't cover everything (there are 25,000+ fish species), but hopefully it gives a more complete overview...<br><br><strong>EDIT</strong>: There has been some confusion regarding my use of the word &quot;fishes.&quot; My use of this word is completely intentional.  &quot;Fishes&quot; has a particular use among ichthyologists and fisheries scientists. &quot;Fish&quot; can be singular or plural. We use it as a general plural, as in, &quot;there are 20 fish over there.&quot; &quot;Fishes&quot; is used when one is discussing multiple types (species, genera, whatever), as in, &quot;a red fish and a blue fish makes two fishes&quot;. When I say &quot;fishes&quot;, I am referring to more than one type. When I say &quot;fish&quot;, I am referring to multiple fish of the same type. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>To add to what's already been said here. The differences between freshwater and marine species can be explored through examining the changes salmonids (salmon and trout e.g.) go through when they leave the lakes or rivers they're born in, to go to the sea to grow further. This is a process called &quot;smoltification&quot; and is basically a list of changes which marks the differences in anatomy, behavior and bodily functions.<br><br>Apart from things like developing a more silvery color (camouflage), slender shape etc. it has to be able to rapidly tolerate a huge change in the amount of salt. <br><br>In freshwater the gills, as some other people here probably have already explained, has to pump salt (ions) into the body in order to keep up normal body functions. As the environment in freshwater contains very low numbers of these, this is a energy costing activity. The fish will also not ingest any water if it can avoid it, and its urine will be heavily diluted so it doesn't lose salt this way. <br><br>Now the salmon feels like the river is too small, and the ocean too tempting, it starts thinking about leaving the place of its birth. It starts swimming with the river and not against it. Nearing the mouth of the river , the salmon finds itself in a state called &quot;Smolt window&quot;, where it is perfectly adept at doing the earlier mentioned fast change. Right beneath the cells that pump salt into the gills (and thus into the bloodstream) there are cells with just the opposite role. As soon as the fish nears saltwater, these badboys pops out and start doing their job. This, along with a change of behaviour (starts drinking water) allows the fish to get rid of salt, along with gaining the necessary water it needs. This water is filtrated heavily before exiting the fish in a heavily concentrated form as to not lose too much water.<br><br>Why is it a battle to fight against concentrations you might wonder? Particles such as salt (ions) tend to prefer to stay evenly distributed as long as there is now perfect barrier between them and the next space. This means that the freshwater fish has to fight against loss, and the marine fish against getting too much. <br><br>Source: fish biologist in last year of masters degree.<br><br>And to finally answer the question; why can't most fish do this? Salmon can't usually do this very well either. What makes them able to survive this transition is the fact that they in the mentioned Smolt window are perfectly ready for change. A readiness they've spent some time developing for.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Both freshwater and saltwater fish have roughly the same concentration of sodium in their blood.  This is accomplished by saltwater fish having a biology that rapidly expels salt, while freshwater fish don't have that adaptation.<br><br>So put a freshwater fish in salt water, and it gets <em>way</em> too much sodium in its blood and dies.  Conversely, put a saltwater fish in fresh water, and it expels <em>too much</em> sodium, and dies because its sodium levels are too low.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>As a saltwater aquarium hobbyist, I cannot give a proper ELI5 answer as some other top posts here, however I can say that it IS entirely possible to acclimate certain freshwater fish into saltwater (unsure about vice versa). If you take certain freshwater fish, say, a <a href="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/aquarium/images/7/73/Black_Molly.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120607044313" target="_blank">black molly</a>, and slowly add a bit of salt into their water across a span of days (possibly a week or two), they will become accustomed to it and will have full potential to live in a saltwater system at the proper salinity levels needed for basic saltwater fish.<br><br>This is not to say that all freshwater fish are capable of this, however. <br>Black mollies are considered to be &quot;brackish&quot;, meaning that they originate from areas where freshwater meets saltwater. So they are able to tolerate certain salinities (level of saltiness in the water).<br><br>From personal experience, I had a buddy who was able to fully acclimate his black mollies into his saltwater aquarium, living amongst clownfish and the like. They proved to be great saltwater algae-eaters! <br>Neat stuff.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>It's about the movement of water (osmosis). If you put a fish that is accustomed to a salty environment in a low sodium environment the water will move into the fish and it will swell up and eventually burst. If you do the opposite and put a fish accustom to a low sodium environment and move it to a salty environment the water will move out of the fish and it will shrivel up and die from dehydration. Water will always move where there is a high concentration of molecules to regain equilibrium. <br><br>Source: Bachelor degree in biology </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
