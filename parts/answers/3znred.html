		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the arachnid family in general lacking most of the social skills nessercary for estabilishing a bond, it should be said that spiders behave very differently since it is a huge order (araneae) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_behavior" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_behavior</a>. Some might have more complex brain structures/complex behaviour than expected <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/science/mapping-the-tiny-brain-of-the-aristocrat-of-arachnids.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/science/mapping-the-tiny-brain-of-the-aristocrat-of-arachnids.html</a> Although I highly doubt that this would extent to anything which would make it possible for a spider to bond with a human. It simply lacks the social intelligence. Birds vary a lot, but some are highly intelligent, such as crows, particularly ravens. In general you can train/bond with many species of birds, in a whole different way than you ever would be able to with a spider. As with reptiles ... Whew ... That's a toughie, although it is generally said that they are unsociable, we learn new stuff everyday, and a lot of animal species are still not properly examined (nor discovered), and then it comes to analyzing their social structures and behaviour we still have a long way to go. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
