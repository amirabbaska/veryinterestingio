		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple of general questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I noticed that the path behind Florence is showing the water cooled (because Florence is taking energy from the water).  Does this ultimately help cool the Earth because the heat is transferred into the atmosphere where there is more surface area for it to radiate into space?  Even if this effect is minuscule -- is it still possible?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What temperature does the surface water have to be to sustain a hurricane?  Does it depend on the atmospheric temperatures because a hurricane is basically just a heat engine?</p>
</li>
<li>If the surface temperature of the ocean was near boiling, how much more powerful could hurricanes become?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How does this hurricane compare to Hugo? I live in the Charlotte NC area and hurricane Hugo is still deep in the memories of the people around here. Should we be expecting another Hugo level event or just a pretty strong storm?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question: Does anyone know how the storm surge affects an island? My grand parents say that during Hurricane Hazel that the storm surge on the island is not that high. However, they are not trying to evacuate the island, neither is my entire family who lives on the said island.</p>
<p>If the typical storm surge for a CAT 4 Hurricane is 12', can we expect that surge to reach that height on the island as well?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is less directly related to hurricanes and a bit more generic. Are there ways to measure wind speed other than anemometers? Can we calculate wind speeds remotely e.g. from satellite imaging, or pressure differentials?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
