		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm on my phone so I can't find a good link. But the phenomenon is called gyroscopic coupling. </p>
<p>Consider that there are three available axes of rotation. The tool also has a moment of inertia about each of the axis. In other words it has a &quot;preference&quot; for how it would like to spin once it's started.</p>
<p>What's happening here is that a significant enough part of the induced rotation is in the non-dominant direction. Due to gyroscopic coupling, when an object is already spinning a rotation about a second axis will also induce a rotation about the third axis.</p>
<p>In this case the main axis of rotation is along the length of the tool (horizontal on the screen). However there's a little bit of rotation in the axis that goes into the screen (the astronaut didn't spin it &quot;perfectly&quot;). This causes rotation in the axis that's perpendicular to the first. This axis is vertical on the screen and the tool flips in that direction.</p>
<p>Normally this procession is much slower but the aforementioned arrangement of the moment of inertia are such that the &quot;flip&quot; due to gyroscopic coupling is very quick. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(Note, this might be a bit of a simplification, but it's in the spirit of ELI5, so...)</p>
<p>Thing is when you're talking about rotational physics, the analogy to mass is a concept called the <em>moment of inertia</em>. Inertia being the ability to resist change and moment explaining that it depends how close the mass is to the centre.</p>
<p>While you can try and rotate an object in any direction, there are only three directions that in theory don't have any wobble, and all other directions will wobble due to a complex interaction of the motion about these three directions.</p>
<p>Two of these directions are somewhat intuitive. </p>
<p>There's the one with the <strong>minimum</strong> moment of inertia, where all the mass is bunched up as close to the middle as possible (think a spear or spinning bullet). There is somewhat of a stabilising influence here because inertia is all about resisting change and the other two directions with higher moments of inertia resist the change like a truck resisting someone pushing it.</p>
<p>Then there's the one with the <strong>maximum</strong> moment of inertia, where the mass is further from the centre (think a frisbee, discus or DVD). This is also somewhat stabilising, like a runaway train is going to resist attempts to slow it down and the object resists the attempt to rotate in a direction with lower moment of inertia.</p>
<p>There's a third <strong>intermediate</strong> moment of inertia perpendicular to the other two. Mathematically, if you're exactly perpendicular to the other two, there's no rotation about the other two directions to worry about and there's no wobble. But even a slight deviation isn't stable and a slight hint of rotation in one of the other directions will be amplified. You're not at the maximum or minimum, so you can conserve energy and momentum while wobbling and transferring some of the rotation to the other directions. It's not clear whether the moments of inertia should resist speeding up or resist slowing down. In the end, the stabilisation is backwards and actually unstable. Rotation about the maximum and minimum directions increase until is gets flipped around and the process starts again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
