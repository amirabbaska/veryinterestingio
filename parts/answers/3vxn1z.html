The preferred method of eoundmanagnent is primary closure sutures, stables strips etc.</p>
<p>This is a fresh clean wound.</p>
<p>If not fresh and therefore likely to be dirty we do not want to close this as it'll trap the shit in there.</p>
<p>So we go to heal by secondary intention</p>
<p>So we clean it and hold it open. This way the body can heal from the bottom up clearing and fighting and pushing infection out.</p>
<p>Without the packing the skin would heal first ( skin heals very fast compared to deep wounds) so the skin would close the body off forming a pocket.</p>
<p>Then the pocket could become a site for infection.</p>
<p>I'm on my mobile so will maybe elaborate later.</p>
<p>Edit: Will try and answer all replies and then burn this account.
BTW: house_fag_87 was another one of my burners... so much karma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of wounds. Surgery for example is a purposeful, sharp wound that can be closed with suture and heals by what we call &quot;primary intention&quot;. The tissue edges are nicely apposed (brought together) and allows for faster healing and better cosmetic appearance.
Counter that to a traumatic wound, where there is significant tissue damage, and some tissue is already dead or contaminated with debris and bacteria. Depending on the severity of the wound, and the ability to close it with suture by primary intention, we may elect to use specific bandages to let the wound heal by &quot;second intention&quot;. This is where you can't appose the skin edges together nicely without tension, and therefore elect the have the wound heal from the bottom up. So the exposed subcutaneous or muscle tissue will heal and form layer upon layer of &quot;granulation&quot; tissue (aka, temporary healing tissue) that is later replaced by fibrosis (scar tissue). Generally second intention healing is not nearly as cosmetic and requires a lot more care in the few weeks following the trauma, with frequent bandage changes and monitoring.
There are sometimes &quot;reconstructive&quot; surgeries that move nearby skin flaps over to the wounded area in order to allow for primary intention healing. These are awesome in certain scenarios, but tension can become a bigger issue sometimes.
Tension is your biggest enemy in surgery. If the apposed skin edges are under tension, there is a much greater risk of failed wound healing and &quot;dehiscence&quot; (separation of edges, re-opening wound).</p>
<p>TLDR - bandages leaving wounds open is usually because it cannot be closed in the ideal way with sutures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you sew/staple the skin together over a dirty wound, you're essentially trapping the bacteria inside where they'll cause the infection to just worsen.. next thing you know you'll have an abscess or worse..</p>
<p>By leaving the wound open, you're preventing the skin from closing over the wound.. the purpose of the &quot;packing&quot; is to keep the skin edges apart to prevent closure.</p>
<p>Instead what happens is that the wound granulates from the bottom-up and heals from inside-out..</p>
<p>it takes a bit longer, but it minimizes infection, so overall it's the preferred management..</p>
<p>so for DIRTY wounds, packing is beneficial and faster for healing.. For CLEAN wounds, we just sew them up.. that's why when you have surgery, we never close you up with packing, we sew you back up.</p>
<p>we open and pack abscesses and infected wounds for the most part.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>depends on the type of wound. </p>
<p>for the most part, our body overreacts to everything. swelling is a great example. </p>
<p>when we have an open wound, our immune systems sends its fighters in to deal with any bacteria. and there will be some, because bacteria is everywhere, your skin especially. </p>
<p>as these fighters die off, they inadvertently use a 'scorched earth' strategy. their dead bodies and guts make it difficult for anything to live around where it died. these fighters basically swallow the bad guys and poison themselves, eventually bursting open and spilling their toxic insides. this is a big problem for the bacteria. and a minor problem for your living tissue. as your tissue will just regrow from underneath the 'salted earth' or just walling the whole area off with fibrous/scar tissue. </p>
<p>back in the day, before modern medicine, this is a good thing. our bodies really don't like infections so an overblown response is better than playing it safe and not sending enough troops. </p>
<p>packing it with gauze is a more primitive way of using vacuum therapy on a wound. it helps to wick away some of that nasty that's slowing growth/healing. </p>
<p>This doesn't work for all wounds, and it works best for festering wounds such as ulcers or burns. its less effective against something like a really bad gash (such as a stab or bullet wound). it essentially keeps the immune response to something more sane. you keep the wound clean because the gauze is probably sterile and also likely has anti-bacterial properties. you also bolster the immune system with antibiotics. you can focus keeping the wound area primed for healing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Healing by secondary intention isn't faster, it just promotes healing from the bottom up, thus avoiding pockets of infection developing in wounds where infection is a greater risk. The gauze (e.g. iodoform gauze) is usually put into an infection (e.g. an lanced boil) and a little bit pulled out each day until the wound heals...I've heard this procedure called a 'poke &amp; pack'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
