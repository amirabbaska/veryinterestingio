		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not <em>impossible</em> (because that's a pretty high bar to clear) but I'd say it's very, very unlikely.</p>
<p>The reason is time.  Multicellular life didn't become common on Earth until 500-600 million years ago (EDIT: <em>Life</em> showed up on Earth very early. But it consisted of microorganisms).  There are a very few possible older fossils of very simple (think algae sheets) forms of multicellular life.  This is also past the point where oxygen was common in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mars never had that kind of time.  When it dried out and froze, earth was still billions of years away from its first real multicellular life. For plants and animals to have shown up on Mars, they'd have had to   appear much, much faster than they did on Earth.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Of course, stromatolites or other fossils resulting from single-celled organisms are more likely. I discussed the second part of the question, but fossils aren't limited to multicellular life.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is, we don't know, but at least on Earth, where there is water we find life. <a href="http://mail.everythingscience.co.za/emas/community/life-sciences-gr-10/diversity-change-and-continuity/lifes-history/historyoflife.gif" target="_blank">Here's</a> a simplified history of life on Earth from the 1996 Encyclopedia Britannica. <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/370/1684/20150036" target="_blank">Here's</a> a more detailed 2015 paper on the emergence of multi cellular life As you can see it took almost 4 Billion years for multi cellular organisms to evolve on Earth. <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6231/218" target="_blank">Here's</a> an article on evidence of water on Mars 4.5 billion years ago. At this stage Mars and earth would have potentially been fairly similar! And if life on Mars mirrored the life appearing on earth, microbial life could have indeed evolved on Mars during this wet period. However this early wet period is <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB091iB13p0E139/abstract;jsessionid=C1FFA225B08E6091E9A1822529D38CB5.f02t01" target="_blank">thought to</a> only have lasted until 3.8 billion years ago, the end of the noacian era. This is old data based on early photographic evidence, Mars science is changing rapidly at the moment and new harder dates and evidence for water is rapidly being found, but the big picture of a wet Mars not lasting long persists. If Martians evolved like earthlings we don't expect to find multi cellular life. But here's the exciting part, we only have one datum at the moment and we have no idea how life could have (or not have) evolved to live in such a different planet. We won't know until new missions to look for direct evidence of life, such as fossils, set foot or wheel on the surface and start digging around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay let us suppose that Mars cooled extremely fast, and life did come into being and that there were multi-cellular beings out there.</p>
<p>Even then it is possible that the life existed and died but the formation of fossils (which requires the dead to be covered in the right sediment, buried for time, and so forth) never occurred.  Much the same as not every dinosaur that lived and died has become a fossil either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a biologist I would be very much surprised if fossils bigger than &quot;our&quot; microorganisms could be found. The point is, that bigger lifeforms are way more complex and therefore also way more proned to climatical changes (and other alterations in the environment). These climatical changes are way bigger on Mars than on Earth because of lacking of an atmosphere which could reflect energetical waves (heat) as much as we are used it from here. This leads to extreme temperature differences between day and night. The reason for this is the mass of Mars, which is way smaller than the one of the Earth and so can attract less gas.</p>
<p>However on the bottom of oceans, things may look differently but it is difficult, if not to say almost impossible to make assumptions.</p>
<p>Maybe when the sun grows the Mars will be more in the middle of habitable zone, but the problem with the very thin atmosphere will be still there. And till Mars reaches a theoretically habitable zone for multi-cellular life on land hundreds of millions or even 1-2 billions of year will pass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
