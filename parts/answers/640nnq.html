And an extra thank you to the guys writing paragraphs. It seems topic is more a commentary on my perceptions more so than international beer belly occurrences. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that the difference is really as stark as you might be thinking it is.  The biggest beer drinkers in the world are from the Czech Republic.  The WHO says that over 73% of Czech men are overweight or obese.  Around 66% of all adults there are overweight or obese.  Something like 60% of German men are overweight or obese.  Germans are top 5 in the world for beer consumption.</p>
<p>The U.S. falls way down the list at #17 for per person beer consumption, but 74% or U.S. men are still overweight or obese.  So American men drink far less beer per person than Czech men, but have similar rates of overweight/obesity.  So you'll see the basically same percentage of &quot;beer bellies&quot; in the world's biggest beer drinking country as you will in the U.S., but far less beer is drunk by the American sporting that belly than by the Czech.  This is simplified of course but that means there are probably more real &quot;beer bellies&quot; on average in the top beer drinking European countries.... and a lot more &quot;burgers and fries&quot; bellies in the U.S. than in Europe.  It's more about overall diet and exercise rates than it is total beer consumption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Europe for a few months and I was able walk EVERYWHERE. And vehicle ownership was not as great as it is in the US. </p>
<p>If I needed to get somewhere that wasn't walkable I'd catch a bus. </p>
<p>Then there was the way they treat food. Refrigerators were 1/2 the size they are in the US. I'd stop each day at a market and pick up what you needed and take it home. Because there was no elevator, I'd carry those groceries up 4 flights of stairs. So I didn't have giant loads - just enough to get by for a day or so. So I didn't &quot;pig out&quot; because I would have had to leave sooner and go get more food. </p>
<p>Then there was the fact that the food was fresher. Their markets were open air, and the fruits/vegetables needed to be ripe because I was going to eat them that night. So everything was better tasting and believe it or not, more satisfying. It's night and day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is also a difference between obesity and ascites-related abdominal distension which can come with liver damage related to alcohol consumption. Many people have a big belly, but it is not related to beer, it is related to poor diet and sedentary lifestyle. The two are a different thing -they look different, and they have a different root cause. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/249985/view" target="_blank">This is ascites</a> , <a href="http://www.wow.com/wiki/Obesity" target="_blank">this is obesity</a>. A person can have ascites which gives them a very large belly without having particularly fatty arms, legs, face, or other extremities â€“ the true mark of the beer gut is that it is fluid, not just fat. It is also related to alcohol in general, not just beer.</p>
<p>Drinking beer can definitely make you chubby if you were drinking lots of it and you have a high caloric intake and as a result of the combined beer and other calories at a little disproportionate to the output of calories. But that is not really a &quot;beer belly&quot;, it is a &quot;caloric overconsumption belly&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
