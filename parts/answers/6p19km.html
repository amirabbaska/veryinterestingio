		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is related to a famous physics problem originally posed by Bernoulli which goes as follows:</p>
<p>Suppose a ball rolls from point A down to point B on a track under the effects of gravity. On what kind of track does the ball get from A to B the fastest?</p>
<p>The first type of track you will probably think of is probably a straight track connecting A to B, which is a sensible guess, but it is not actually the fastest. If you make the first parts of the track steeper, the ball will reach a higher speed sooner so the ball goes faster sooner.</p>
<p>Based on this first guess and the argument against it, you'd probably come up with a second guess: a vertical drop from point A, then a horizontal path to point B from the foot of point A. However this isn't the fastest either, because the ball doesn't accelerate throughout the whole horizontal part.</p>
<p>It turns out the fastest track is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone_curve" target="_blank">Brachistochrone curve</a>. It is the correct combination of steepness and acceleration. With that in mind, you can get an idea of how the wavy track in that gif allows the ball to roll faster than a straight flat track: shortest path doesn't mean it lets the ball roll the fastest. Even though the wavy track has a longer distance, the acceleration provided by the downward track more than compensates for the increased distance, resulting in a shorter time over all.</p>
<p>There is a misconception that you stated in your description. When something rolls WITHOUT slipping, the friction between the rolling object and the surface on which it rolls actually does not consume any energy. This is because when the ball rolls without slipping, the point of contact of the ball and the surface do not move relative to each other. It is the reason why things like wheels and ball bearings are useful, and why using tires, which increases friction between the wheels and the ground, is actually a good thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignore the bumps. Imagine you had a perfectly flat track and you put a ball on it - the ball would not move. Now imagine you had a <em>slight</em> dip in the track - the ball would move, but slowly. So a bigger dip causes the ball to move faster.</p>
<p>In the gif, the 'near' track has all those humps and bumps but the 'average' is that it goes lower in the middle than the top one does. So, it has a bigger 'dip', so it goes faster.</p>
<p>Note that since both balls come to a halt at the same altitude, energy is conserved - the second one might &quot;go&quot; faster but the extra energy gets converted back again when it has to climb out of the dip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can better understand what's happening here by looking at only part of the problem at a time.</p>
<p>First lets just observe what's happening on the upper track. The ball drops a little way and starts rolling. It rolls along its track until it reaches a slope that stops it. Then the same process repeats on the way back.</p>
<p>When the return trip ends, we can observe how high the ball rolls. This will give us an idea of how much energy the ball lost along the way. If there were zero friction, it would return to exactly the same height as where it was released at the beginning. Watching what actually happens, we see it rolls almost as high, but not all the way, meaning there was some friction, but not a lot. Also, the return trip takes about the same time as the forward trip. If there were a lot of friction, the second trip would be a lot slower, and we would see the ball visibly slowing down on the level part of the track. Conclusion: there isn't a lot of friction between the ball and the track, and for a single trip we can ignore it.</p>
<p>Now imagine what would happen if there were a track a lot like the upper one, but with steeper slopes at either end, and the level part of the track two centimeters lower than the first track. Because it starts steeper, and falls further, the ball will be going faster when it reaches the level part of the track. We have already established that there isn't much friction, so the lower
ball would be going faster the whole way, and would win the race.</p>
<p>Now imagine a third track, just like the last one, but this time the level part is 4 centimeters lower. Because the ball drops even further, it's going even faster, and it wins over the other two.</p>
<p>Reality check: it's clear that when the ball is on level track, its horizontal speed depends only on how much lower it is than the starting point. But is that really enough to win the race? Can we ignore the time it takes for the ball to drop before it reaches the level part of the track? Well, let's take the process to an absurd level. Imagine a track like our others, but with the level part a meter lower than the starting point. The ball would be going very fast at the bottom, but the drop at the beginning and the climb at the end would take so long that a marble on that track would lose.</p>
<p>A new conclusion that deserves some exploration: If friction is small enough to be ignored, the things that matter are the drop, and the shape and length of the path.</p>
<p>Now lets leave our imaginations, and go back to the actual video. The lower track is wobbly, and longer than the upper one, but it's not <em>too</em>wobbly, and it's not hugely lower. So here is the key thing: except for the beginning and the end, the ball on the lower track spends its whole time lower than the ball on the upper track, and will always be going faster. From what we observe in the video, on this particular track, the faster speed prevails, even though the track is longer, and the lower ball wins. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The track with more hills has a lower average height than the straight track. If the straight track was lower, so the average heights were the same, the balls would travel that distance at the same time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>edit: a <a href="http://imgur.com/8y9AVxA" target="_blank">pic</a>, which one would reach right faster? basically this gif is an obscured example of my picture.</p>
<p>Compare the left rail with a flat rail, which one would travel further? obviously left rail, even though it has longer distance, thus more friction and distance to travel.</p>
<p>The right rail works with similar principle.</p>
<p>The main thing to consider is that 1) friction is insignificant, 2) actually moving, or being fast doesnt consume energy. Energy is only changed when accelerating, but this is only coverting between gravity potential and kinetic energy (which decides velocity)</p>
<p>Thinking in terms of energy, let's take left example, at start, lets say ball has 10 unit gravity potential energy, 0 unit kinetic energy (arbitary unit and numbers).</p>
<p>As it moves down, at the bottom, it goes to 5 unit gravity potential energy, and 5 unit kinetic energy. since velocity = 1/2 <em> mass </em> velocity^2, the ball will move faster.</p>
<p>At the right end, the ball goes back to 10 unit gravity potential energy.</p>
<p>Since the height is lower on right rail, whenever it is lower, it is gaining extra kinetic energy which allows it to move faster, while it is lower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
