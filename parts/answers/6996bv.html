		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three main causes of death for beached mammals like whales and dolphins.</p>
<ol>
<li>Collapsing under their own weight. This applies to very large species such as sperm whales, whose skeletons are not made to support their own weight. When floating in the water this is fine, but on land their bodies are so heavy that they crush themselves.</li>
<li>Dehydration. This is common for dolphins. A dolphin is not made for being out of the water and loses a lot of water very quickly when exposed to air. If left on a beach for too long, they will dry out and eventually die.</li>
<li>Drowning. This might sound strange, but it can happen when high tide comes in. If the whale is on a slope, it's possible the water is high enough to cover the blowhole, but not high enough to submerge the entire whale (allowing it to swim/float). The whale cannot breathe and will eventually suffocate.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're <em>massive</em> animals, and they've evolve to support that mass with buoyancy. Out of the water they struggle to breathe, struggle to support their mass, they dry out and die of exposure or exhaustion. </p>
<p>In essence... you could only spend so long treading water before you just... slipped under the waves. Well... a whale or a dolphin can only spend so long <em>out</em> of the water, straining, before they can't survive any longer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>to expand on what others have already said.</p>
<p>the ocean is cold. marine mammals have THICK THICK layers of insulated skin. </p>
<p>when they are out of the water they can quickly overheat and die. </p>
<p>collapsing under their own weight is another. you know what the largest animal that has ever lived on this planet is. THE BLUE WHALE.</p>
<p>no land animal could ever compete with a creature of the ocean for the same reason that a beached whale will die out of it. collapsing under its own weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whale beaching is somewhat like jumping out an eight story window to avoid being burned to death. You know you are going to die one way or the other, but irrationally jumping is considered the lessor of two evils. Whale jumping out of the water is similar to our going swimming, a temporary thrill that lasts a short time. However the change in pressure over a long duration can have detrimental affects. Unlike our bodies, whale bodies are designed to survive in the various depth pressures of the ocean, but not out in the atmosphere. Once on land they lose the mobility they had in the water. In order to move on land they would need to lift their own weight, which they don't need to do in the water. Out in the less dense atmosphere their internal organs rupture due to expanding gasses and decomposition within the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what aelinsaar said, their bodies are not designed to walk on land. Therefore, they can't eat or find someplace to drink water. Without access to those things, they will die of starvation and dehydration. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
