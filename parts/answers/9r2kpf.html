		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General surgeon here.</p>
<p>Larger people have larger organs in general for the reasons listed above, I’ve never read any studies on it, it’s just what I see at work.  The cavities in your bodies adjust to the need for the organs IN MOST SITUATIONS.</p>
<p>Symptomatic Pectus excavatum is a good example of what happens when it doesn’t.   </p>
<p>And what happens when you have more space that needed?  Well most spaces have atleast once size that is soft tissue that will decrease in size.  But, for instance, in brain atrophy like in old dementia patients or alcoholics, the brain is actually a little “loose”, and can slosh more.  Fluid will fill around it.  You’re body never fills empty cavities with air, it’s always fluid if anything.</p>
<p>Here’s another example.  In the abdomen sometimes we have to do really big surgeries like remove half the organs for a big cancer.  At the end all we do is close the abdomen as normal.  The the abdominal cavity will slowly shrink down some, all air will be absorbed (can take a month if open air, just a few days if laparoscopic).  They may get a little extra fluid in their abdomen.</p>
<p>In terms of “making space”. People have lots of extra space inside them, especially in the abdomen.  As people get fat, they can store so much fat inside their abdomen.  So, so much.  It can make my job very difficult.</p>
<p>Even on fat people, I’m talking like BMI of 60, I can still put around 3-4 liters of air in the abdomen to do laparoscopic surgery.  The inside of their abdomen will expand with their need for space as long as the need for space happens slowly (over months, not over days.  Google abdominal compartment syndrome’ for what happens if they need a lot of space over days).</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense.  I added paragraphs out of order so hopefully didn’t repeat myself too much </p>
<p>Edit: to the dude that says that air is also a liquid and I should use the word “fluid”.......get a life.   Good lord </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just because somebody is strictly tall doesn't necessarily mean they're volumetrically larger. I mean, you obviously have tall and lanky vs. short and stout.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, there are physical factors that may directly affect organ size. The most obvious is the heart. In taller people, the hearts have to work harder to pump blood up to the heads, as well as bring blood back from the legs. This increased work load also &quot;works out&quot; the heart to increase its size, and is believed to produce extra stress on the heart, and may partially be responsible for <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/07/height_and_longevity_the_research_is_clear_being_tall_is_hazardous_to_your.html" target="_blank">lower life expectancy associated with height</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, just because something &quot;makes sense&quot; doesn't mean that's the mechanism. I'm not certain if there has been controlled studies to see if we can alleviate only the &quot;height factor&quot; to see if there's a change in heart size, or if heart size and bone lengthening are attributable to a common factor (like growth hormone). It's likely both.</p>
<p>Edit: on the topic of empty space in a body - in the case of organ donation (e.g. kidney, partial liver, etc.), the viscera (the abdomen) is really soft and moveable, so other organs (mainly the GI) fills in the space. There are only a few places in the body where space is &quot;held&quot; open (mainly the ribcage and the skull), and those can be filled with different things depending on the pathology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taller people tend to have larger livers and kidneys. When we do transplants, we are often reluctant to take a liver from someone like a 6’2” male and put it into a 5’1” female. If the liver is too big, we might have a hard time closing the abdomen, increasing intraabdominal pressure and increasing the chance for a complication. </p>
<p>Now sometimes tall folk don’t have huge livers, but it’s something we take into account. </p>
<p>It’s one reason why shorter woman may be disadvantaged for liver transplant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, yes they do. I work in organ transplant and when we’re selecting a donor organ one of the first things we look at is size, however all organs are not alike. Kidneys are basically one size fits all, same with pancreases (pancrei?). Lungs you want to be around the same size, or a slightly larger. Reason being if you put lungs in that are too small it can be a bit of a shock to the heart, and cause pulmonary hypertension. If lungs are too big you can actually downsize them a little bit, but its not ideal. For livers, they measure the donor organ on CT and recipient abdominal cavity to make sure it will fit. Sometimes it comes down to taking out a ruler in the donor OR and taking exact measurements. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
