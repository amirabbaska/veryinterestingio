		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same reason why Hydrogen has multiple energy levels in spite of the different energy states corresponding to the same two particles (a bound proton and electron). The wavefunction of the same three bound quarks can take on multiple excited configurations - the lowest energy for uud is the proton, the next highest is the Δ^(+), and then I think there are higher resonances also called Δ but with masses specified. The energy of the bound state gives the total state most of its mass (E = mc^(2)).</p>
<p>The Δ baryons have spin-3/2, so one way you can think of the Δ^0 and Δ^+ are as excited states of neutrons and protons respectively. This suggests a picture of adding the three spin-1/2 quarks up, and by the rules for adding angular momentum in quantum mechanics, you can either get total spin S=1/2 or S=3/2 with zero orbital angular momentum, and then whether an s-wave uud quark combination is a proton or Δ^+ depends on whether the spin is added to 1/2 or 3/2.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_spin_crisis" target="_blank">This picture is actually wrong though</a>, since quarks in a proton do seem to have significant orbital angular momentum and gluons apparently contribute significantly. So we have a very incomplete picture on how these quark wave functions &quot;look.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What mofo said.
A bound state of a proton and an electron (hydrogen) can have multiple excited states, some electron-volts apart. </p>
<p>The same is true for a uud bound state, but for hadrons the energy gap between excited states is much bigger,  which makes physicists rather call them different particles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
