		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's money that is literally passed through a business from one person/entity to another during a transaction and thus not taxed. For example, you buy something from ebay, send money to them that then gets passed through to the seller. That doesn't count as ebay revenue since they just passed it through. Their only revenue on the transaction is the fee they charge the seller.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add another example. If the federal government gives money to the state to build hospitals and the state gives the money to different municipalities, the state government is acting as a &quot;pass-through&quot; agency. Its very common. It's the same thing, but I got to put to use my accounting degree. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real-world example:  I work for Company ABC.  I need to buy a superwidget, like right now, but there's only one company that sells the specific superwidget I need, and I don't have an account with them.  Now, I can go ahead and set up and account, which might take a few days, and I have to send paperwork and credit references and the owner's social security number and a DNA sample and a pint of urine and such and so forth, but I REALLY need that superwidget, like right now, and I don't want to wait on all that.  So instead, I call up Company XYZ, a consultant/contractor who's done work for me in the past and who is already set up in my accounting system and I'm already set up in theirs.  I say &quot;hey I need a superwidget right now, like yesterday, I know you have an account with Super Duper Superwidget Company, so can you buy it and send it here, and then send me the bill?&quot;  They say &quot;hellz yeah brah,&quot; buy it, send it to me, and then when Super Duper Superwidget Company sends Company XYZ the invoice, XYZ sends it to me at Company ABC.  I pay XYZ, then they pay SDSWCo.  This would be a pass-through transaction, it's a procurement method that simplifies a lot of purchasing especially on an emergency basis, or when you're trying to hide a purchase from your accounting folks (&quot;hey let's go for a round of golf, if you cover the green fees you can bill me for it as a pass-through.&quot;) if you know they don't inspect the invoices too closely.</p>
<p>Another way to do it is as a markup transaction, which works exactly the same way, but when I get the invoice from XYZ I see that they've increased the price 5% or 10% above what SDSWCo charged them.  This is a common practice as well in paying XYZ for the time and effort they took to do you a solid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Property tax on rental properties is another common example.</p>
<p>Say a property company owns several complexes. Instead of paying property taxes out of the money received from the renters &quot;after the fact&quot;, most will include a &quot;pass through addendum&quot; to the rental agreement. This outlines to the renter that they are responsible for x% of the overall property tax and that it will be &quot;passed through&quot; to them as part of their overall rent along with whatever other items are included such as utilities, pool, maintenance, etc 'perks' that come with the apartment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
