		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes are the single most important part of perception as a human - People who cannot see are massively disabled and their entire life changes.</p>
<p>Likewise, it makes sense to try and protect the eyes, and closeing them increases their protection.</p>
<p>If you hear a loud noise and react, it is a defense mechanism. Your body is instinctively thinking &quot;Loud noise, potential danger, might damage eyes, close them for a moment in case something might damage them,&quot; which makes sense considering your eyes are extremely soft (Basically just balls of wet jelly) and it doesn't take much to destroy them.</p>
<p>Flying bits of debris can easily destroy an eye, even a well placed bit of tree bark, and a loud noise usually means sending debris flying, and an eye has FAR better chance to survive if it has a thick layer of skin and muscle covering it than just a thin, white membrane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Loud noises are generally made from something with a large amount of force, or an explosion of some sort. It's a good idea to close your eyes in case of both, because something might be flying at your eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
