		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ring systems aren't unique to gas giants. We have actually observed (faint and tenuous) rings around a few asteroids/minor planets/moons in the solar system.</p>
<p>It is sometimes hard to extend planetary system formation theories to general cases since we only have extensive observation of one planetary system. So what parts of our system are typical and what parts are unusual is hard to determine.</p>
<p>This is true in the case of the ring systems because we don't even really know for sure how they formed in the first place. They could be from the breaking up of moons by tidal limits, could be left over protoplanetary disk material and, in the case of some of Saturn's at least, they can be from volcanic activity on the moon.</p>
<p>I can guess on some features of our gas giants that would make them more likely to have rings, maybe someone with relevant background can cast more light on this though. They are heavier and so have larger Roche limits, they have more moons, they formed in a region of the protoplanetary disk that had more material, they are more likely to interact with (and capture) asteroids...</p>
<p>A bit open ended but that is the best I can do!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Abstract: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the gas giants in our Solar System host ring systems, in contrast to the inner planets. One proposed mechanism of planetary ring formation is disruption or mass shedding of moons. The orbit of Phobos, the larger of Mars’s two moonlets, is gradually spiralling inwards towards Mars and the moon is experiencing increasing tidal stresses. Eventually, Phobos will either break apart to form a ring or it will crash into Mars. We evaluate these outcomes based on geologic, spectral and theoretical constraints, in conjunction with a geotechnical model that helps us determine the strength of Phobos. Our analysis suggests that much of Phobos is composed of weak, heavily damaged materials. We suggest that—with continued inward migration of the moon—the weakest material will disperse tidally in 20 to 40 million years to form a Martian ring. We predict that this ring will persist for 10^6 to 10^8 years and will initially have a comparable mass density to that of Saturn’s rings. Any large fragment of Phobos that is strong enough to escape tidal breakup will eventually collide with Mars in an oblique, low-velocity impact. Our analysis of the evolution of Phobos underscores the potential orbital and topographic consequences of the growth and self-destruction of other inwardly migrating moons, including those that met their demise early in our Solar System’s history.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, they can exist around terrestrial planets, and even dwarf planets, under the right conditions, although strong enough tidal forces can prevent them from forming or being sustainable (which is why Earth doesn't have rings, due to the moon (and the sun, given it's effect on the tides are roughly equal to the moons)</p>
