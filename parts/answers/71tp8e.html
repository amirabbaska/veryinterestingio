		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have already explained this accurately; I wanted to add a bit about things related to this.</p>
<p>Consider the brain. Natural selection has determined we need to process things very quickly to react to them. In this way, the brain abstracts an output of senses into a &quot;symbol&quot; that it can process readily.</p>
<p>When observing children's pictures of houses, you will notice that after five years old or so, they will nearly <em>always</em> put a door knob on a door. Even if it's more of a handle or something else, they will put the thing there that their mind associates with &quot;mechanism for opening doors&quot;.</p>
<p>This makes drawing difficult because you need to see the world without abstraction in order to replicate it. One exercise to do so is to draw the &quot;vase or two faces&quot; picture while saying the part of the face you are drawing until you can do both sides without messing up. It forces you to remove the association of the words with the image you are making. As you get into this mental state, you will begin to lose the symbolic association your mind makes with the items in the world and see them for the shapes and colors they are.</p>
<p>This is like a grander scale of losing track of the meaning of a word. It's losing track of the meaning of everything you see while simultaneously really seeing it for the first time.</p>
<p>If you're interested in more, the book &quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&quot; is a great read. Sure, left/right brain stuff is scientifically inaccurate, but as a metaphor for linear vs abstract thought, it works.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have stumbled on to a very deep question about how we understand the world. This issue is a major concern for AI studies (Artificial Intelligence, since this is for 5 year olds)
The human mind has an amazing ability to take a single word and understand a complete concept.
Take the word &quot;chair&quot; for example. We all just know what a chair is. Size, color, shape and many other features may be in the background but your mind instantly has the idea &quot;chair&quot;. This is the default position in your mind as it is most likely what you need.
However if you start repeating the word &quot;chair&quot; your mind refocuses on the actual word. The sound, the intonation, the break down of the parts of of the word.
This feature of the human mind, the ability to move from a lager abstract concept of a single word to a specific breakdown of the same word is very interesting to anyone trying to create computers that actually &quot;think&quot; like humans. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a phenomenon called semantic satiation.</p>
<p>When you hear a word, your brain isn't really paying attention to the sounds, it is translating those sounds into an idea, and is primed to put it together with other words to form a more complex idea.</p>
<p>When you repeat a word over and over, your brain stops recognizing it as a word, and it breaks down into sounds that really have nothing to do with what the word means.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, it is similar to when you're eyes look at something for too long and don't focus as well on the thing you are looking at. The receptors in your eyes start to get too used to the stimulus and send less new information to the brain. That is why eyes move around a lot when looking at anything such as when reading and looking at television. Sounds will be similar because it would be the receptors receiving the same exact stimulus over and over again so your brain begins to focus less on the whole words and the meaning becomes fuzzy much like an image becomes less focused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's basically the same confusion and irritation you experience realizing you are manually breathing, manually holding your jaw up (neither closed or fully open), manually blinking, your ears pop when you swallow, you have to find a good resting place for your tongue, what direction your pupil is facing when you sleep, etc.
The trick is to not think about it, but now that I mentioned these things, you are thinking about them all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
