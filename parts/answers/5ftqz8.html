		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>4K means that your image is made of more pixels. More pixels = more details. <a href="http://i.rtings.com/images/resolution-4k-ultra-hd-size.png" target="_blank">Check this</a>.</p>
<p>There is no benefict in having a 4k TV if your hardware does not support it: The TV will send the image in HD resolution or below. </p>
<p>I have a 4kTV and the only times that I watch something in 4k is when I open Youtube xD. The TV-Box only supports 1080p. I must say that 1080p is more than enought for Sports, News and some Series. But 4kTV with 3D is something else</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of inaccurate answers here.</p>
<p>Will a 1080p video going to your 4k tv look better than 1080p? Probably. Upscaling can guess, reasonably accurately, what the extra pixels would be if they were being sent in the video stream.</p>
<p>Will it look as good as 4k native? No. You cannot paint a picture using 1/4 of your canvas. It just won't look the same.</p>
<p>Upscaling will get you somewhere in the middle, using surrounding gradients to approximate the extra pixels. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No but 4K content on a 1080p tv will actually look better. Was watching a video about how stuff shot in 1080 only 1 in 4 pixels I think it was contain all the info the other three have only some of the info. But a 4K converted down to 1080p has all the info in every pixel. This is dumbed down a bunch but maybe I can find the video that explains it better. </p>
<p>Here it is I think</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, a 4K panel will most likely be a better panel than the TV you are currently watching. So, while it will not increase the quality of what you are watching, you are watching it on a better panel TV. Therefore what you are watching/playing may look better. Overall the picture quality on a 4K TV may or may not be better depending on the quality of panel you currently have and depending on the quality of the panel you may purchase. </p>
<p>Bottom line, if what you are watching is not 4K then it comes down to the quality of the panel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No even though Most 4k tv's coming out now have upscalers (or hardware like game consoles do) you can't add more detail to the image than there was originally. An upscaler uses an algorithm to fill in  those extra pixels based off the lower resolution picture. It's much better than showing a raw lower resolution image on a 4k screen like 1080p content raw on a 4k screen would look terrible and horribly distorted for example but it won't give you the extra detail that the 4k display is capable of showing. Now whether or not it decreases the clarity depends on the upscaler as they aren't all built equal but it's possible because you are taking a much smaller image and trying to blow up up way bigger without distorting it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
