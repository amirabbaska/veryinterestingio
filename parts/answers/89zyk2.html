		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the how is covered, now to the why: a strong grip is more important than a strong finger-straightening. having your tendons balanced in a way that causes the fingers to curl by default means you get a little extra force to your grip</p>
<p>it's kinda like the springs in a garage door that naturally pull up, so lifting the door doesnt take much more strength than pulling it down</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your hands are evolved for grasping round objects, like sticks. Notice how your fingers are not all the same length when straightened? Now, curl your fingers like you were grabbing something or checking dirt under your fingernails. Pretty cool how all your fingers are roughly the same length at that point, huh? Your natural hand position is grasping things, not lying flat like a paw.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, multi joint muscles and tendons.</p>
<p>Think of it as a game of give and take.  When one joint is extended it stretches the tendons like a rubber band.  Tendons to be in a slack position when not in use.</p>
<p>A wieldy concept to put into words but I hope that helped</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
