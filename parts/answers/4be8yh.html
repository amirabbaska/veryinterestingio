		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Everyone so far has been close, but not quite accurate. There are three main limiting factors with today's technology: cryoprotectant distribution, the rate of freezing in complex tissues, and the interactions of multiple systems/the recovery time from freezing in a complex organism. I apologize for the large wall of text, I'll try to get it as ELI5 and cut down as I can make it! <br><br>First off, the concept of freezing an entire human (even a single organ!) is much much much harder than freezing one cell type! When one type of cell (whether it be sperm, epithelial cells, cardiac cells, etc etc) is frozen, we use what is called a cryoprotectant (literally &quot;protects from severe cold&quot;). A cryoprotectant prevents the water within the cells from freezing into dangerous sharp and pokey shapes that can literally shred the cell from the inside out, killing it. Think of putting a bunch of needles inside of a balloon; it wouldn't end well! One such chemical that I use daily for freezing human tissue cultures is dimethyl sulfoxide, aka DMSO. DMSO is added to about a 10% concentration when freezing cells, which is easy to do when it is one cell type freely floating in media. Think of it as a bowl of cereal. If you add chocolate milk to your white milk already in the bowl, the chocolate milk will be able to &quot;interact with&quot; each piece of cereal because it gets diluted into the milk and all of the cereal pieces are equally accessible. This is like cryoprotectants in cell suspensions. Each cell can easily &quot;suck up&quot; the cryoprotectant, making it easy to protect many cells. <br>In solid tissues and entire organisms, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get an even distribution of cryoprotectant through all tissues, at the same concentration, at the same time. It'd then be incredibly hard to keep it there while we tried to do a controlled-rate freeze of the organism (more on that later). We'd have to put cryoprotectants into many different carrier vehicles (think liposomes and DNA carriers, which are basically little suitcases that only open at their specific destination) in order to get the chemicals to their locations in the correct amounts at the correct times. It's just incredibly challenging. <br>These cryoprotectants are also cytotoxic (means &quot;toxic to cells&quot;) at anything more than minimal concentrations, so having it in tissues for any longer than necessary will lead to increased cell death. This means you have to quickly freeze the cells as soon as the cryoprotectant is added, and then wash out the cryoprotectant after the cells are thawed. It would be virtually impossible to efficiently remove all of the cryoprotectant from every single different cell type within the body simultaneously. The logistics are just insane! Some cryoprotectants are also incredibly cytotoxic to specific cell types, so those types would die nearly instantly. <br><br><br>The second point is the rate of freezing. When freezing in vitro (test tube) tissue cell lines, you ideally want them to freeze at a controlled rate of 1 degree Celsius per minute down to -80C, then place them in liquid nitrogen (which is at -196C). This controlled and even rate of freezing keeps the cells from exploding and dying. Again, this is easy to accomplish when you have a whole bunch of individual cells floating about in a solution, as they all cool at relatively the same rate. When you try to freeze entire sections of tissue though, it doesn't go as smoothly. The outsides will freeze very very quickly, while the inside of the tissue section will remain warm. Think of putting a thick, juicy steak in the freezer for an hour, then taking it out and cutting it open. The outside will be frozen, but the centre will still be warm and raw. This is the main issue, as the not-yet frozen cells are cut off from all outside supply (oxygen and food!) and waste removal (reactive oxygen species, cellular debris). This makes them stressed and die. The same issue also arises when the tissue is thawed, as the outer parts of the tissue will thaw very quickly (which is good, fast thaw=healthy cells!) while the inside of the tissue will thaw slowly (slow thaw = stressed cells that die). This makes it very hard to get a good, consistent freeze and temperature with complex tissues. The different rates in freezing and thawing also mean that certain parts of complex tissues (which contain many many many different systems, such as blood, lymph, immune system, inflammatory mechanisms, etc etc) will not receive the vital supplies they need! As stated earlier, if one section of the tissue freezes solid, stopping blood flow, but the middle is still not frozen, then the cells in the middle will still try to live, and will then die due to a myriad of factors (lack of oxygen, build-up of toxins, build-up of oxidizing and DNA-damaging compounds, etc). <br><br><br>This same complexity brings us to my third point! This complexity is why freezing an entire organism to be re-animated is extremely challenging. Every single different cell type is going to behave differently to freezing and thawing, and require different procedures to freeze it and thaw it. That's like trying to make 20 different recipes for dinner, all at the same time, with the same ingredients, in the same oven. It is nearly impossible, and needs an incredibly complicated approach! All these different systems will also be thawing at different times and attempting to do their jobs as soon as they're &quot;awake&quot;, but they won't be able to due to the freezing restrictions. Think of your blood cells thawing and waking up, then going &quot;GUYS. WHY AREN'T WE MOVING?!&quot;, due to your cardiac cells still not being quite thawed and viable. This would then cause your red blood cells to get very stressed and die, so then when your lung cells thaw, they'll be like &quot;OH MAN THE BLOOD ISN'T ACCEPTING OXYGEN, WHAT HAPPENED?!&quot;. The tissues everywhere will also be freaking out because their blood is not working correctly. Same goes for the immune system and the lymph system. Without all of the complex, interacting biological processes working ALL AT THE SAME TIME, the organism just simply can't survive. Its honestly amazing how many billions of different things are going on within our bodies at the same time, and they all need to be going at the same time and same rate in order to ensure our survival.<br>To expand upon the thawing issue, some cells can have a low viability (not many of them survive the freezing and thawing), so there would be tons of dead cells to contend with when the organism is thawed as well. When thawing immortal cancerous cell lines (which are INCREDIBLY hardly little buggers) you can often expect a 50-80% cell survival, with it sometimes being close to 20% or 30% if the freeze affected them bad enough. This means that if a whole human was frozen, and 50% of the cells in these tissues died, then 50% of the entire organism would be useless, dead, and be a detriment to the other living cells. <br><br><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Cryoprotectants keeps cells from dying due to damage from freezing. If you can't get the cryoprotectant to all of the cells at the same time and in the right concentration, they will die. The body is also incredibly complex, making it very very very hard to get all of the systems to freeze at the same time, thaw at the same time, and correctly interact while they are freezing and thawing. Also, lots of cells die during cryopreservation, so there'd be a whole bunch of dead cells that the body would have to try and get rid of. <br><br>Source: MSc Biology cancer researcher specializing in early stage <em>in vitro</em> modelling of anti-cancer and anti-bacterial pharmaceuticals.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I work in a lab where we freeze down cells all of the time.  We freeze our cells in a medium that contains 5% DMSO, which among other things can be used as a cryoprotectant.  However, DMSO is also toxic to cells at the concentrations necessary for cryoprotection.  Consequently, when you freeze cells in DMSO, you add the DMSO medium at ice-cold temperatures and don't allow the cells to warm up.  When you later thaw the cells, you have to dilute out the DMSO as quickly as possible without causing osmotic shock, which can pop the cells.  Such restrictions on freezing and thawing would basically be impossible to control at the level of a complete organism.<br><br>However, to contradict a lot of previous posts, individual cells can be recovered from freezing with high viability.  When performed properly (and this varies quite a bit by cell type), you can expect &gt;90% of cells to be alive following thaw.<br><br>Edit - a more ELI5 explanation that I posted further down<br><br>The chemicals that allow cells to survive freezing are toxic to the body. Keeping the cells cold minimized the damage that this chemical does to the cells. With single cell solutions, adding the chemical at ice-cold temperatures and immediately diluting it out when you thaw the cells can keep 90% of the cells alive. There's no way to do this with an intact body.<br><br>It's also worth noting that this is probably not the only reason that this technique doesn't scale to organisms.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A big difference between freezing sperm cells and entire bodies is the concept of &quot;tissue.&quot;<br><br>Sperm is a specialized &quot;cell&quot; in its own right, with a very specific function, but it is not equipped as a free-living organism.  That means it is actually a very simple thing, in a relative sense, without a lot of special environmental dependencies or functions.  Every sperm in a given sample will be nearly identical to, but separate from, every other sperm (not counting the genetic material, but that is not a factor in this context).  Therefore, every sperm may be treated exactly the same way.<br><br>In contrast, bodies are made up of a whole bunch of different tissues, which in turn are made up of many different types of cells, each with their own internal dependencies on each other.  The interconnectedness of cells within tissues may be as simple as being maintained on the same collagen matrix, or it may be as complex as sharing molecular signalling between each other for instructions on what to do next.  The differences are nearly incomprehensible, and the environmental requirements of each cell type or tissue may be very different.  To add to this, the body as a whole is made up of layers and layers of tissue, so manipulating both the solution &quot;environment&quot; of the body cells as well as the &quot;temperature&quot; of the body cells in any detailed way is very difficult.<br><br>Look at it this way:  If you could separate each cell from every other cell, breaking all of the tissues down into a solution of cells, then you would have a much better chance of carefully controlling the environment around each cell and adjusting the temperature in an exact way.  How quickly the cell contents freeze is very important, as well as the appropriate final temperature for preservation.  So if you did all of that successfully, you could then thaw them and have many of them still be alive and functioning, for a short while.  But they would no longer be arranged appropriately into function tissues, and they would be nothing like a body.  </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It's an access and temperature problem.<br><br>DMSO is toxic, but as other posters point out, you can thaw cells that have been frozen in DMSO with a very high level of viability (&gt;90%). Sure you'd have some cell loss which may be a problem depending on where it occurs and some potential long-term effects from the toxicity, but the biggest problem is that you wouldn't enable high enough DMSO concentrations for most cells just by soaking a person in a DMSO+FBS solution. And you wouldn't be able to control the lowering of the temperature (typicall you freeze the cells that are going to cryo in a Mr Frosty that lowers the temperature with a set amount degrees per hour). You'd pretty much have to slice and dice the person to get all tissues into appropriate thicknesses and pellet and freeze the cells that are in suspension.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>People are over complicating things. The easiest answer is sperm are only one cell, so it is easy to treat them with various chemicals to prevent to damage cause by freezing. <br><br>Where as the whole human has many cells which are all connected and different. Because of the complexity, it is hard to give all the cells in the human body the same treatment as the sperm get when being frozen. Also you have to figure out how treat all the cells without killing the human. <br><br>To summarize: it is easier to freeze one cell than a bunch of connected cells.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Ice crystals form when you can't freeze something fast enough. The quicker you can freeze &quot;it&quot;, the fewer crystals there tend to be. It's easy to freeze a little bit of baby batter quickly, but not an entire person. Perfectly preserving the cells also doesn't mean they necessarily survive the process - they may have to be protected in other ways too.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The problem is size. You take some peas out the freezer put them in warm water they thaw very quickly. Take out a chicken breast it takes a lot longer the outside thaws then slowly the onside follows. What you want to do is get the whole body to thaw at the same rate and that is the tricky bit. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I work with cryogenics, liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen. <br><br>There are two big problems. First off is that if skin is exposed to something like LIN or LOX, (Like if you got splashed by it) you will immediately have what's called a cryogenic burn, AKA frost bite. <br><br>So you have to make someone cold without actually submerging them in LOX or LIN. Well the problem with that is that at such a low temperature, (We're talking -297 F for LOX) ice crystals will form in the skin tissue. <br><br>So TL;DR because it would be like, SUPER bad for you. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The word is cryoprotectants. They stop the cells from freezing like water so they don't break.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>In addition to what other have said, it's important to say that spermatozoa are the smallest cells in the human body. Their surface area to volume ratio is thus small, so the effect of expansion due to freezing is less, I believe.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
