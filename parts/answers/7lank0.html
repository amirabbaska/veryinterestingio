		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a steel/chromium alloy; the chromium reacts with the oxygen in water to create a protective film around the metal and prevent oxidation (rust) from forming on the steel part.</p>
<p>At the molecular level, it <em>does</em> corrode almost instantly on the outside, but it creates a layer of corrosion so tight and thin that it doesn't interact with light, and it's not detectable without modern instruments; but the layer of rust around the rest of the metal protects the rest of the metal from further corrosion.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>straight steel is made with a mixture of carbon and iron.  iron reacts with oxygen to form brown crumbly rust.</p>
<p>stainless steel is made with a mixture of carbon and iron and a hint of nickel and chromium.      when chromium reacts with oxygen in the atmosphere, it forms chromium oxide which blocks oxygen penetration.   the surface film then protects the underlying iron from exposure and forming rust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you buy stainless steel cutlery, you normally buy 18/10, 18/8 or 18/0 steel. The 18 indicates the amount of chromium, the other variable number indicates the percentage of nickel in the steel. </p>
<p>The more nickel, the better protection against rust. With nickel, the steel is harder however, and thus wonâ€™t get scratched as easily. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the same theme of oxidised metal making chrome and nickel bearing steel alloys seem always shiny silver, and aluminum more like dull grey, there is an alloy of steel called HTLA for High Tensile Low Alloy which is an alloy of steel with small amounts of nickel, copper and other metals that makes the red rust extremely tight to the base metal underneath, so although the metal rusts like steel, the rust forms a protective layer that prevents penetration of more rust. Good for bridges, some parts of ship hulls where strength and lighter weight is worth an extra cost, and its cheaper than the stainless steels with fewer stress fracturing and fatigue problems long term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
