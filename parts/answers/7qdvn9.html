		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a property of massless particles that they travel at the speed of light. There is no acceleration applied, from the moment they exist they are moving at c.</p>
<p>It's kind of counter-intuitive, because we're used to things not moving unless acted on by and outside force (looking at you, Newton) and even then, for them to have to accelerate up to that speed. But let's keep following that concept. If they did have to be accelerated, how much force is required? For a massless particle, we can't very well use F = m*a, because then we find that a = F/0 , and whoops we divided by zero. In physics, that's generally an indicator that the way you are modeling the system is faulty. So we know that there can't be some force accelerating them, but we also know that they move, and quickly! So we are forced to accept that they move at c, immediately, and without exception.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So speed, space, and time are weird things:</p>
<p>First, think about our world in 4 dimensional space-time. We feel like we are moving through time at a constant speed. However, we are not. Instead, we are moving through space-time at a constant speed. The more we move through space, the less we move through time. This is what Einstein's twin paradox is about: the twin moving faster through space is moving slower through time, and thus when the twins meet back up, he is younger.</p>
<p>So you can think of us as moving mostly through time, and a little through space. This is because the more you move through space (and less you move through time), the more energy is required. If you pour more and more energy into moving through space, eventually you will get closer and closer to a limit that you can never reach: the speed of light. In order to go the speed of light, an infinite amount of energy is required, which is impossible.</p>
<p>However, the equation for how much energy is needed to go faster through space has an interesting component: mass. Light has zero mass, so it doesn't need any energy to go the speed of light. Therefore, light always goes the speed of light through space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reality is a little weird sometimes. </p>
<p>One phrase I always use when dealing with light is ‘all models are wrong, but some are useful’</p>
<p>It can be useful to think of light as particles (photons) travelling from point A to point B. It can be helpful to think of them as waves in other circumstances. But even these two contradictory models don’t really accurately describe reality. </p>
<p>What is light?  In the simplest terms, all that ever really happens is an electron over <em>here</em> wiggles, and some time later, an electron over <em>there</em> wiggles.  That’s it. That’s all that’s really happening. </p>
<p>There need not be anything in between them. Don’t get hung up on whether waves or particles of light “exist” in a conventional sense -you can’t have a jar of photons.  But the wave/particle duality of light and all of our <em>models</em> are useful in predicting when and where and how much that second electron will wiggle in response to the first.  Some of that interaction (where and when) is best described by waves, and some (how much wiggle) is best described as particles/photons.  But light really <em>is</em> neither. </p>
<p>Anything in between the ‘start’ and ‘end’ cannot be seen or measured - because as soon as you make a measurement in between, that point of measurement ceases to be ‘between’ and instead becomes the end point. </p>
<p>So let go of the idea of ‘traveling’ for light, at least in the sense that it implies that the light somehow exists in transit between electron A and electron B. It doesn’t really. One electron wiggles, and it makes another electron wiggle at a distance.  We talk in terms of ‘traveling’ because it is useful to predict when and where the second electron will wiggle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to look at it (which may or may not be illuminating) is to look at the photon's velocity in 4 dimensions. In 4d, all objects have a velocity of c ( 300,000 km/s ), with a portion of it being spatial velocity (which is what we usually think of when we say velocity) and the remainder in temporal velocity (which is how the object experiences the passage of time). Traditional acceleration in this perspective is simply a rotation of the velocity so that a larger portion of it is in the spatial velocity. Light has a special property because of its masslessness whereby it doesn't experience any passage of time, so it must have zero temporal velocity and this it has c for it's spacial velocity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
