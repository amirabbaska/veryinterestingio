		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there are really two questions here.</p>
<p>First, is what these people do valuable?</p>
<p>I once saw something saying that the only thing worse than having to use a lawyer is needing a lawyer and not having one. Having to go to court is bad enough. Having to go to court without the help of a lawyer? :s</p>
<p>So many of these professions may seem pointless until you need them. Until you're running a complex company and need to work out your accounts, make sure you're paying the right amount of tax, check if you're actually making money or not. Until you want to expand your business and need to borrow some money, or have made some money and want to invest it somewhere it'll earn some interest but be safe.</p>
<p>To pick the example of investment (investment banks, pension funds, venture capital, etc.). The role of these business is (or at least should be) to make sure money gets to where it can best be used for the economy. This means, for example, making judgements about which businesses will succeed and which will fail, who will pay back their loan, and who will default. This is a really important thing to do. Again, the only thing worse than having to deal with a banker is needing a loan and not being able to get one... </p>
<p>Second, why do they get paid <em>so much</em>?</p>
<p>This is more controversial.</p>
<p>Part of it is because this stuff can be complex and difficult. Accountancy rules, tax codes, laws, regulations are many and complicated, so it takes a lot of education and experience to be really good at dealing with them. It's easier to become a carpenter than an accountant. Then there's investment - to be a good investor you have to be able to predict the future. That's not an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>That said - and other people will probably disagree with me here - there's also a degree to which our economies, society and political systems have become dominated by these industries. Money and power are concentrated in a small number of hands, or a small part of the system. Governments are intertwined with big banks, big accountancy firms, they think the same way, share the same people.</p>
<p>The financial sector literally crashed the world economy ten years ago, yet bankers haven't exactly taken a pay cut.</p>
<p>How all this works is more complex to explain and I'm not sure I can give a good explanation of it, at least without spending more time thinking about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are paid based on how replaceable they are. These jobs are paid a lot because you want top tier workers, not second tier. A good accountant will help you with taxes, organizing your money, and doing a lot. A bad account could cause tax issues and more. Being an accountant takes a lot of knowledge and training so it is highly paid, similar but lesser than a Doctor. </p>
<p>People who design amazon warehouses for efficiency take a lot of planning and computing to solve complicated problems. They do not create anything but are valuable. Amazon shelf pickers are easily replaced so they cannot demand a higher salary of amazon will find a new person</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a very real sense, <em>money doesn't exist</em>. I can't hand you a bucket of wealth. Paper money, black ink on a balance sheet, digital data on a server for an online bank, all of those things <em>represent</em> wealth, but they aren't wealth. Even &quot;hard&quot; money like gold only gets its value because people agree it has value.</p>
<p>Wealth isn't an object, but a measure of utility. Every time money changes hands, both parties generally gain utility they didn't have before. (otherwise, why would they buy/sell?) In this sense, money is only useful when its being spent. This is why economic crashes are so hard to fix:  times are uncertain, so people save what little money they have rather than spending it, which makes it harder for anybody to gain wealth, making times uncertain...because all of this is ultimately based on faith that your money is worth what we all agree it is.</p>
<p>If you pay $5 for a loaf of bread, you now have food that you need to live, and the store owner now has more purchasing power. Ostensibly, you traded two items of equal value, but in reality you both now have more utility than you started with.</p>
<p>When the store owner goes and spends the money he's earned on a new store location, he has increased his utility, and so has the construction company that built it.</p>
<p>If the construction company uses that money for a down payment on a loan to fund a bunch of new equipment for a giant project that they wouldn't be able to build otherwise, they've increased their utility, and so has the bank that issued the loan, and now collects interest on it.</p>
<p>If the bank uses the interest of that loan to invest in more complex securities that can return a profit for their investors, the bank increases their utility, as well as the people selling those securities.</p>
<p>Everything is interconnected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two problems here are:</p>
<p>1) You seem to think the only way economic value is created is by people making things</p>
<p>2) You seem to not actually know what these jobs do</p>

<p>This is like asking &quot;Why does a paint store make money? They have nothing to do with manufacturing paint, and I'm the one doing the painting. They're just moving cans of paint from the truck and putting it on their shelves.&quot;</p>
