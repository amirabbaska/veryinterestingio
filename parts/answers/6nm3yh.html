		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sewer and water guy here. Finally a question I can answer! Sewer mains are gravity operated, so you can cut a hole into the top of the pipe and no liquid will escape. Sewer mains are made of various materials, from plastic to clay to concrete, but all are tapped the same way. We usually dig down to expose the main, and cut a hole in it using a cordless drill and a 4&quot; diameter hole saw. Then a rubber boot is placed on the main, and fastened using metal bands that wrap around and tighten with a screwdriver bit. We coat the pipe and the rubber boot with a type of cement to prevent roots penetrating into the pipe and causing blockages. The boot has a mouth on it that accepts a new 4&quot; plastic line that runs to the new house. It's inserted into the boot, and tightened using the same style metal band clamps. </p>
<p>Water mains are a different process. It really depends on the material the main is made from. For cast iron of ductile iron mains, we have a &quot;tapping machine&quot; that drills a hole and inserts a new tap while the main is still under pressure. The device is made of brass. We place a rubber ring on the pipe, and sit the machine on it. A chain wraps around the pipe and connects to both sides of the device. We tighten two nuts to put tension on the chain. They have to be pretty tight so the rubber ring compresses enough against the wall of the pipe to prevent water from blowing out under pressure. The device is a long tube with a flap halfway down inside, that can be opened or closed with a lever on the outside. The cap that fits on the end of the tube has a metal shaft on it that accepts a special drill bit. The bit drills a hole, then cuts threads in the hole so it will accept the new tap. The cap/shaft/drill bit assembly is slid into the shaft and tightened into place. The shaft can be slid in and out without removing the cap. A large drill is attached to the end of the shaft, and the tapping process begins. The drill is geared very low. It doesn't spin fast, but has a lot of power. The tapping device has an arm that flips up and turns slowly with the drill shaft. The arm applies downward force so the bit cuts faster. Once the new hole is drilled and tapped, the drill is removed and a ratchet wrench is placed on the shaft to back the bit out by hand. The tapping device arm is still holding the shaft, because without it, once the bit is backed out of the threads, the water pressure will force the shaft out with an extreme amount of force that could possibly impale or otherwise seriously injure the man holding it. Once the bit is screwed out, the tapping device's arm is removed and the shaft is pulled out as far as it can go. This is where the flap inside the tube comes in handy. With the shaft retracted, you pull the lever to close the flap, and release the pressure from the end of the tube. The water pressure holds the flap closed, allowing us to remove the cap/shaft assembly. We remove the drill bit from the end of the shaft, and replace it with the new shutoff. The shutoff is a brass fitting that has one end threaded so it screws into the pipe wall, and is made to accept a piece of pipe in the other end. The water can be shutoff by turning a small flat piece on the side with a wrench. A metal cap is screwed onto the shutoff, and it attached to the tapping machine shaft. The shaft/cap assembly is placed back in the tube, and the flap is opened allowing the water to pressurize it again. Once the pressure is equalized, the flap is opened all the way. The shaft is pushed down until the threads of the shutoff touch the hole we drilled and tapped earlier. The shaft is turned with the ratchet wrench until the shutoff is tightened in the hole securely. With the shutoff in the hole, the tapping device can be removed from the pipe. We take a wrench and tighten the shutoff some more if it's too loose or leaking. We attach a pipe to it and connect the other end to the customer's new water meter, completing the new water service. </p>
<p>If the main is plastic, the process is slightly different. Plastic pipe is too thin and weak to screw a tap directly into it. A saddle must be used. A saddle is a metal fitting that has a rubber ring on the surface that mates with the pipe. It has metal clamps that go around the pipe and bolt to the saddle. Once these are tightened in place, a shutoff is threaded into the saddle. The shutoff is turned to the &quot;open&quot; position and a tapping machine similar to the kind used on larger pipes is threaded onto the shutoff. The tapping machine has a shaft with a drill bit on the end inside it. A drill is attached to the end of the shaft, and a hole is drilled into the plastic pipe, inside the saddle. Once a hole is drilled, the shaft is retracted, and the shutoff is turned to the closed position. The tapping machine is removed from the shutoff, and a pipe is attached and ran to the new meter.</p>
<p>These methods of tapping a pipe &quot;hot&quot; allow new services to be added without shutting down the main at all.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the gold! I posted this before bed last night. I'm vacationing in Indiana and we're in the middle of nowhere. I have no internet at the rental cabin, so I'm on mobile. I also have no cell phone service inside the cabin and very little outside. People probably think I'm batshit crazy, walking around in the front yard holding my phone up in the air. I'll answer as best as I can. </p>
<p>Lots of people asked about metal shavings getting in the main when tapping. I can't say for sure that none get in there, but most stay inside the tube. There's no water in the tube until the drill bit punctures the main. When the water floods the tube, the shavings get sprayed away from the hole. In order for the water in the tube to get back into the main, the pressure inside the tube would have to be greater than inside the main. That doesn't happen, so I would think it all stays in the tube. If a stray metal shard did find its way into the main, it would probably just settle to the bottom. If it made it into your service line, it would get caught by the plastic mesh screen inside the water meter. If it made it past that, it would get caught in the strainer of your faucet. For it to make it into your cup of tea, there would have to be some kind of Final Destination type shit going on.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/toddlikesbikes has service lines covered, but I figured I might as well mention how water and sewer main construction is done.  </p>
<p>When water mains are rebuilt, there's really no choice but to shut down the main since they are pressurized unless you are hot tapping as has already been mentioned (you can do it with big mains too).  That doesn't mean that everybody serviced by the main will go without water for the duration of construction though.  For a planned, lengthy shutdown of a main, the construction crew will run temporary water lines to each house.  These smaller lines (usually just 2-4&quot; PVC) are hooked up to a fire hydrant outside the work area, and ran above ground through the yards of the homes.  Then, a hose is hooked up to the house somewhere, usually the garden hose spigot on the exterior of the home, and the main water supply valve is closed.  This allows the homes to continue receiving water service as usual.</p>
<p>Sewer mains cannot be &quot;shut off&quot; because they are gravity fed.  When a run of sewer main is to be replaced, the crew will go to a manhole upstream of the work and drop a hose into the manhole.  Then, they will hook it up to a big trash pump, and run more hose to another manhole downstream of the work.  Then, they turn the pump on and dam the outlet of the upstream manhole with sandbags and wait for the main to drain.  Since there will usually be sewer services within the project area, flow won't be completely eliminated, but the amount of sewage coming out of just a few houses is negligible. </p>
<p>This isn't what you asked exactly but I thought you might find it interesting as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The answer to water and sewer are separate.</p>
<p>Water: &quot;Tapping&quot; machines insert a new valve (typically 3/4&quot;-1&quot; diameter for residential) into an existing water main while it's live, and the valve is installed in such a way that it is closed when the installation machine is removed, so water doesn't go everywhere. The new valve threads right into the existing water main, which is typically made of iron, though there are other materials (plastic, concrete) used throughout the country. These machines also exist for larger buildings, which sometimes require 4-8&quot; connections for domestic water and sprinkler systems, but this process is much more expensive when you get to these sizes. In both cases, since the valves are installed closed, the contractor can then run the water pipe into the building and connect to the plumbing, then only when everything is hooked up open the new valve.</p>
<p>Sewer: Sewer mains are generally gravity flow, and are not full. As a result, you can often cut a hole in the top 3/4 of the pipe, install a new pipe to form a T or Y, and then seal up the hole without too much mess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Residential sewer is pretty much all gravity main (a pipe that relies on gravity to take wastewater to a larger gravity system that might join several neighborhoods and in most cases ends up at a pump station). You can trench to the main and tie in by drilling a hole and fitting a saddle while still in operation. </p>
<p>Water service is largely the same process but done under pressure. The process is called hot tapping a main. A special drill rig is used that fits through a saddle and valve. The residual pressure from the pipe pushes out any debris generated by the drilling process and (ideally) the line would be flushed at the end of line blowoff after drilling to ensure that this is true.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I come from we have a dense population but a significant proportion of people still are not connected to the main drain. They have cess pits to take toilet waste which are pumped out by government services as and when necessary. Septic tanks or other bio-systems are not allowed on the island as a significant proportion of the land is used for potable water capture.</p>
<p>To answer OP's question in regard to my locality, when a main drain is run under a road as the government lays more services, individuals bordering the new pipe may choose to pay to connect to the sewer via a private contractor as any pipe on their land is their responsibility.</p>
<p>The team installing the main drain under the road will leave connection points adjacent to any property along its route and cap this pipe off ready for future connection. If the householder wishes to keep using their cess pit for the time being they can do and connect to the main at a later date.</p>
<p>The last connection point I connected a house to was 10 feet below road level. </p>
<p>I ran new 4&quot; below ground waste pipe from their house to the boundary with the road. At that point my trench was already 3 feet below ground. I got the main drain pipe plan from the government office and dug down 10 feet and found the capped off main connection tee where the plan said it would be.</p>
<p>I installed something called an interceptor (a water trap like a toilet U-bend) and a vent near this connection and also an inspection chamber for the interceptor. Uncapped the tee on the main drain and connected my 4 inch pipe to it. </p>
<p>The main drain is only a 1/4 full with fluid (think of a swimming pool flume ride but with turds in it instead of people) and the connection is near the top of the pipe so you can open it up without getting covered in poop. </p>
<p>That's how we connect to sewers where I live anyway.</p>
<p>Rain water is gravity piped into soakaways - pits dug in the ground, filled with irregular rubble historically but today <a href="http://cinderbeckbarn.blogspot.com/2015/03/post-apocolypse.html" target="_blank">plastic crates</a> are used to create area for water to drain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
