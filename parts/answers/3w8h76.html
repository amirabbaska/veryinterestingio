<p>Materials Engineer here...Your brand new phone screen has billions of cracks in it.  They're just really really really small.  Now, anytime you do something to the phone (drop it, sit on it, bump your keys against it, whatever) you're putting stress on those cracks.  </p>
<p>If the stress is over a certain threshold, it can cause the crack to grow.  The longer the crack, the less stress needed for it to grow.  So every time you drop your phone, you're effectively lowering what's called the critical stress - the amount of force it can take before catastrophic failure - aka a shattered screen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming it does not crack at all (even at a very small level) then there will be no change.</p>
<p>When glass breaks it is through a brittle fracture mode, which is caused by crack propagation.  Basically, it will be a combination of how big the current crack is and the force that is acted upon it.  So if absolutely no cracks or surface abrasions occurred (very unlikely) then there will be no weakening of the glass.</p>
<p>I went to a talk by Corning, who makes almost all the phone screens.  When they do testing, they first put it through a &quot;tumbler&quot; with keys, coins, etc. (to simulate being jostled in and out of pockets for an extended period of time) before checking the strength, as the creation of small cracks from wear and tear has a large effect on final mechanical strength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is an increased chance of damage if the screen receives any form of chip or permanent deformation. This will result in the screen no longer being structurally sound(I'm not sure if I'm using this term right...a Civil or Structural Engineer might yell at me). The next impact has a higher chance of crack propagation from any sharp edges of a chip. Even if the chip is extremely small. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct, it does.  Each micro-fracture will increase the vulnerability of your phone's screen.</p>
<p>Side note:  The structural integrity of your vehicle in roll-over events is dramatically improved by having a windshield that has no cracks or otherwise damage to it.  The windshield can compromise up to 60% of the structural strength of a car in resisting top-down compression in a rollover. <a href="http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/esv/esv22/22ESV-000344.pdf" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
