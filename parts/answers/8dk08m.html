		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon emissions data is a really tricky subject and you have to be really careful with the graphs and data you read. </p>
<p>For example many countries are not reducing their absolute carbon emissions, but reducing emissions per GDP. In essence as Long as their GDP grows faster than their emissions they look like they are reducing their emissions. Some countries have really stepped up their game with Australia pledging 5% reductions regardless of the rest of the world. However, with increasing protectionism in large global players like USA, the global agreement and action is unlikely to take effect. Also, climate change is a really Long term problem with effects happening in 50-100 years. Most governments are only interested in maybe the next 20 years and reelection’s so to them it isn’t a big priority. </p>
<p>The IPCC AR5 report shows us that the danger of inaction now is likely to to cost magnitudes more than taking action now. But without global cooperation, CO2 is likely to exceed the 450ppm threshold that will allow us the time to adapt to climate change. </p>
<p>However it is a good to note that even if all emissions were to stop now, the temperature would continue to rise due to the delayed action of our carbon sinks. Also there are a bunch of cool geoengineering projects that people believe we can “innovate” our way out of global warming like aerosol spraying and biosequestration using micro algae. So not all is lost, but much needs to be done. Whatever we are doing now is too little and too slow to avoid the deadliest impacts. We are on course for a more than 2 degree rise when the target is 1.5 degrees. There is a huge difference between them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps this is semantics. But I'm really not sure there has been &quot;tremendous efforts by first world countries.&quot; There have certainly been tremendous efforts by individuals and NGOs. But most governments have not even come close to implementing the kinds of efforts consensus scientists have said would be necessary to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>I feel like this is worth saying. The reason impacts have been underwhelming is not because scientists were wrong about what measures would be necessary or what the outcomes of those measures would be. It is because most governments have not been willing to do what scientists said we had to do. Even &quot;pro climate change&quot; agreements don't come close to implementing what the climate scientists proscribe as necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't call the effort made tremendous at all. The average person has made no sacrifice or changed their lifestyle in any way. </p>
<p>I'd say the effort made has been minimal, but even that's kinda generous. One of the most promising developments, solar energy, has only taken off because it just <em>happens</em> to be cheaper than other energies. </p>
<p>But, efforts <em>are</em> starting to be made, a bit late, but you have to start somewhere. These efforts have merely slowed the increase of CO2 emissions per year but those emissions are still going up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did my PhD on a particular aspect of the economics of climate change so please take the following statement with that grain of salt.</p>
<p>In a nutshell.</p>
<p>Advanced economies have been de-carbonising for a couple of decades at least (even without actual policy effort, it is something advanced economies do). This will keep happening, that is a good thing.</p>
<p>The scary thing is these advanced economies got to that point by basically being crackheads on carbon to get to the advanced stage.</p>
<p>If China and India follow the exact same path then the globe is toast. We are all relying on China and India to find a different path to economic prosperity.</p>
<p>China knows this, they actually know there are not enough resources on the planet for their population to prosper. This is not even considering climate change. China know they need to find a different path.</p>
<p>That is a big part of the battle. It will be a battle though.</p>
<p>My main hope is that technology will get us all out of the worst of it just in time.</p>
<p>But that is hope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>carbon emissions will go down when alternatives are cheaper.  were actually getting really close, Coal is just about to be passed by Solar, and if Battery Tech gets a bit cheaper electric cars will be a lot more affordable than gas cars.</p>
<p>and if the new research in Thorium Reactors actually pans out, we could find ourselfs with mostly clean energy in 20-30 years</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
