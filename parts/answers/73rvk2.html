		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;knot&quot; is a muscle that's experiencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanic_contraction" target="_blank">physiologic tetanus</a> — that is, full contraction. Involuntary tetanus, or cramps, are caused by muscle spasms.</p>
<p>The current prevailing theory involves chemicals called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolyte#Physiological_importance" target="_blank">electrolytes</a>, which help regulate the internal electrical charge of each muscle cell. When a muscle is depolarized — that is, its internal charge flips from generally negative to generally positive due to the movement of electrolytes in and out of the cell — contraction is initiated. This process is controlled by a group of motor neurons called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_unit" target="_blank">motor unit</a>. If the charge of the muscle cell remains positive after the motor unit stops stimulating the muscle, it remains contracted. Normally, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%2B/K%2B-ATPase#Sodium.E2.80.93potassium_pumps" target="_blank">active pumps on the outside of the cells</a> flush out the cell, causing repolarization (return to baseline negative state). Sometimes, however, the muscle becomes <em>so</em> positively-charged that the NaK pumps don't have enough energy to fully reverse the charge, so the muscle remains depolarized.</p>
<p>Manual manipulation/physiotherapy (i.e. muscle massage) encourages blood flow, which brings new electrolytes and other chemicals to the area to encourage muscle relaxation.</p>
<p>There is also another type of muscle cramp, associated with the inhibition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgi_tendon_organ" target="_blank">Golgi tendon organ</a> (which is partially responsible for muscle relaxation in certain ways) and overstimulation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_spindle" target="_blank">muscle spindles</a>, which cause the muscle to contract. It is unclear whether manual manipulation has a distinct effect on this type of cramp.</p>
