		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>our brains are hard wired to recognize human faces and eye contact. In fact, there's a whole part of your brain devoted specifically to that task, and people with damage to it can get something called face blindness. So human faces in your visual field get some special attention when it comes to how your brain processes the image in front of you, leading to quick attraction and notice.</p>
<p>For people you can't see, you might recognize their presence by some other means, such as sound or touch. Then when you turn, both you and their face-recognizing visual systems have a reasonable chance to result in spontaneous eye contact. This might fool you into thinking you &quot;sensed&quot; them looking at you.</p>
<p>Otherwise it is likely simply a matter of confirmation bias. You recall when you felt something &quot;odd&quot; and met someone's eyes, and forget when you just &quot;felt something odd&quot; and nothing happened. There's no real basis for a 'sense' that can detect eyes looking at you, eyes don't transmit anything unique that makes an impact on human skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From Earlier Thread - This answer seems helpful</p>
<p>In as ELI5 as I can: you can't, but you think you do. One of 4 things can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone is looking at you, and you notice.</li>
<li>Someone is looking at you, and you don't notice.</li>
<li>Nobody is looking at you, and you notice.</li>
<li>Nobody is looking at you, and you don't notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the first one, you'll remember. You think &quot;why is Johnny looking at me? Has he been looking at me the whole time? That's kinda weird.&quot; The 2nd and the 4th, you cannot remember, since you didn't know it was happening. And the 3rd, well, you notice but you don't remember it, usually. Why would you? Nothing happened. People around you just doing their own thing.</p>
<p>Let's assume for fun each of these events are equally likely. Then some is looking at you (and you notice) 1 in every 4 times, on average. But it will feel like almost every time, because you don't bother remembering the times when someone isn't looking at you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to offer a rare dissent, here, supported by absolutely no evidence.  So y'all are free to laugh at me until I am proven correct, years from now.</p>
<p>I offer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Human hearing is more sensitive than many of us credit.  There was a recent example--predicted by William Gibson, by the way--of a blind person who learned to navigate a room by making bat-like clicking noises and learning to &quot;read&quot; the echoes.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check him out: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A possibly useful survival trait would be the ability to detect a silent predator by the change in <em>ambient</em> noise.  That's a change in the texture of other noises going on as something silently occludes a sound source or echo.  So our brains may retain this ability.  Furthermore, humans seem to have evolved from an early time in close proximity to a potentially useful ambient noise point-source--a smoldering fire.  Eyes burning a hole in your back, see--or rather, hear?  Does that turn of phrase go all the way back to the caves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shape of the human head might reflect ambient noise in different ways.  We have convex foreheads and, more to my point, we have two semi-concave eye sockets which, at a certain distance, might actually <em>focus</em> ambient noise.  When someone is looking directly at the back of your head (or more likely, from an angle that might help the subject to guess the position), their eye sockets may be focusing ambient sound directly at your <em>ears</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>Thus, when a person behind you turns to face you (as in staring), I think it's possible that some people may actually be able to <em>hear</em> a change in ambient noise that gives them the &quot;feeling of being watched.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Having said that, it would of course depend upon the shape of a person's face, the distance and position of that person, and it would be useless beyond a certain very short distance.</p>
<p>But it <em>might</em> explain some of the incidents that occur in enclosed places with a fair amount of ambient noise, like for example in waiting rooms or on the subway.  </p>
<p>And, in conclusion, I wish to credit Iron Maiden for the idea: <em>You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back/ A footstep behind you he lunges prepared to attack</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought I read under controlled studies that this phenomenon isn't real. Just confirmation bias whenever it actually happens. Most people wouldn't take mental note whenever they felt like they were being watched but weren't. Can't source it this second unfortunately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
