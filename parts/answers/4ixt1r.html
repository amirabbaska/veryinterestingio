		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ... I can't believe I know this.</p>
<p>It's fluid dynamics.</p>
<p>As the urine travels down your urethra it is under almost equal pressure from all sides.  As the liquid escapes it loses contact with the vessel.</p>
<p>Through a process called adhesion the water in your product will experience a drag effect as the contact with the waste channel is extinguished.  This drag is greatest in areas that contain the most perturbation.</p>
<p>The shape of the orifice that produces the stream produces the vast majority of the perturbative influence.</p>
<p>In this case the opening is a slit which produces semi-toroidal flows in the medium at the polar vertices.</p>
<p>Combine these forces (The sudden loss of pressure, the semi-toroidal flows, and adhesion) and the net effect is a torsion force on the stream.</p>
<p>The torsion force impels the fluid to twist and cohesion (water molecules are kind of like tiny magnets and really want to stick together) keeps the stream together.</p>
<p>There you have it.  Why your urine spirals instead of just flowing out like a garden hose.</p>
<p>EDIT: changed adhesion to cohesion in the last bit, my mistake(I typed this at work and didn't take the time to proof-read). Also; to those pointing out the navicular fossa you are correct in the biological sense. I was going for a my physics based approach, I apologize for not being more clear.</p>
<p>Lastly; thanks for the gold you wonderful redditors, you guys rock!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, lots of answers that are unnecessarily complicated. Am soon-to-be PhD in fluid dynamics, so here goes my attempted ELI5 answer. If anything is too much, I'd be glad to edit!</p>
<p>The pee isn't actually spinning (that much), it just looks like it. The more important thing is, as we've already talked about, the pee-hole isn't a circle.</p>
<p>Imagine a rubber circle. Now pull on two sides to stretch it to an oval. When you let go, it doesn't just go right back to a circle. Instead it crashes inward, pushing the top and bottom out and making an oval the other way (where the skinny part is between your hands and the long part is up and down).</p>
<p>Your pee wants to be in a circle, but your peehole is an oval. So, the pee tries to go back toward an circle and goes past it to an oval the other way. It's actually going back and forth between the two oval shapes as it flows.</p>
<p>For a bit more science, the stretchiness is due to surface tension. Water molecules like other molecules, so they pull them close. The ones in the middle of the water have friends all around and are pulled equally in every direction. The water molecules on the outside only have friends around half of them. This means that they are pulled more toward the water than to the air around them. When a bunch of water on the outside is pulling toward the water, it's like a circle of people holding hands around a bunch of friends inside. Surface tension is what allows bugs to walk on the ceiling and walls and it's also why rain drops stick together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have an embarrassing edition to this.
I am a 41 year old white male...in case that matters. I grew up in a small southern town. We really did not have the greatest selection of doctors. When I was 4, I began complaining about my penis burning all off the time. It happened mainly after I had a bath. My mom carried me to a pediatrician--several actually--and the general conclusion was that my pee hole was to small for the amount of urine and the force of my bladder muscles. They decided to extended my pee hole slightly by making an incision. And, yes, this hurt like fuck!</p>
<p>Flash forward to adult years...My pee barely even spirals. I have to be careful not to splash. I subsequently found out that I have a severe allergy to many soaps and shampoos; if I use certain ones today, I still burn the same. Basically, I was misdiagnosed.</p>
<p>The extra wide opening has left me with a scatter gun instead of rifle trajectory. Kind of neat for some things, and horrible for others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not exactly, but the design of the male urinary meatus (&quot;opening&quot;) does indeed impart a spin on the urine stream, making it aimable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
