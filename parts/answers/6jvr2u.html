		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During the time right before dawn to right after dawn, nocturnal insects head in to sleep, while diurnal insects wake up and head out to do... insect things. Spiders often set their webs to catch this transitioning prey.</p>
<p>After the sun has risen, the spider has gotten all the food he expects to catch from this web, has had a good meal, and has stashed any extra in a safe place.</p>
<p>Now you come along and destroy his webs. No big thing, mealtime is over, he's well fed and happy.</p>
<p>Next night, he spins his web to catch another breakfast.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Spider has gotten use out of it, it's a good spot, so doesn't care if it got destroyed during the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Sydney and the Golden Orb Weaver is an endemic web spider. They can give you a painful bite, but do so rarely and they like to set up shop outside nocturnal light sources like windows and doors. </p>
<p>The Golden Orb Weaver grows really big - bird for scale:</p>

<p>So, when you walk into one of these webs, a passionate and vigorous spider dance begins.  </p>
<p>What's my point? Well, because they frequently set up in pathways, I'm often destroying their webs and I notice that they almost always rebuild their webs higher or in an offset position afterwards. So, my observation is, some spiders do move their web, if you destroy the original. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about airflow. Spiders build their webs between pressure differentials that cause wind. Your big car sandwiched in between a tree causes a wind tunnel that concentrates the flow of insects.</p>
<p>Since you park your car in the same place every day, the wind is always in the same place, so it's a good spot for the spider's prey.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
