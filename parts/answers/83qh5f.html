		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep! More arms would provide better information about the polarization of gravitational waves and the direction of the source. Of course, just adding more arms to a single detector would have limited success because you can only really expand a detector in one plane, so it's more useful to have more than 1 detector in multiple locations on the globe, because each detector's orientation (and therefore, each field of view) is different. </p>
<p>Having the VIRGO detector as well as the two LIGO detectors is what <a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.1.20170927a/full/" target="_blank">allowed scientists</a> to pinpoint the location of the binary neutron star merger event last August, because the nondetection in the VIRGO detector limited the search to VIRGO's well-defined blind spot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
