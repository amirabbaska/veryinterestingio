		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA never divides perfectly. It gets spelling errors, sometimes it gets extra bits, and sometimes bits get taken out. Over a couple billion years these changes added up and lead to diverse species. Something important to note is that sexual reproduction only shuffles genes. It does not create anything new. The only way to do that is to have it be created in a mutation when DNA replicates itself. And something else is that even bacteria have sex of sorts where they create a bridge between their cells and exchange DNA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well it helps to look at species that have various forms of reproduction between asexual and our form of sexual reproduction. </p>
<p>For instance prokaryotes can't go through meiosis but can incorporate new DNA from other prokaryotes. </p>
<p>Then there are some yeast cells that can reproduce asexually or sexually when under great stress. </p>
<p>Then there are various hemaphrodites in the animal kingdom. </p>
<p>Then there are species that can change sexes like clownfish. </p>
<p>Then there are true sexually dimorphic species like us. </p>
<p>Do you have a more specific question. </p>
<p>Edit: Also it helps to think that sexual reproduction (meiosis) is really just a modified version of asexual reproduction (mitosis) done twice. Then you just have specialization of specific parts and genders overtime. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at the result. Sexual reproduction results in the combination of mutations from two separate lines of ancestors. </p>
<p>With asexual reproduction favorable mutations favor descendents of that one organism. So evolution consists of one favorable mutation after another, a slow process.</p>
<p>With sexual reproduction mutations from across the species can combine into one individual. Evolution is much, much faster.</p>
<p>Bacteria actually have ways to share DNA. That is how antibiotic resistance spreads. It is not sexual reproduction but it works.</p>
<p>Speciation occurs when individuals in one species no longer interbreed. They can be living across a mountain range, a river, or oceans. Gradually mutations accumulate. Eventually they can no longer interbreed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So what you're saying is that this chromosomal change could've happened in hermaphrodites which would then slowly encourage sexual dimorphism leading us to where we are today in regards to humans/birds? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
