		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The Goldilocks Zone is a quite extensive area depending on the star type/class.
The temperature range for liquid water is extensive, and even below 0C it can stay liquid.</p>

<p>Take as an example our own solar system.</p>

<p>As you can see, Mars and Venus are in the habitable zone too. They just aren't habitable due to other factors, like the lack of a magnetosphere in the case of Mars, and atmospheric configurations. Like the absurdly high-pressure and temperature of Venus.</p>
<p>Most of the habitability of a planet, and it's ESI comes from internal factors, like internal geology and dynamic weather systems.
That's one of the reasons as to why you shouldn't only take the habitable zone as a factor for colonization.</p>

<p>The equations for the GZone is the following:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our own solar system has three planets in the Goldilocks zone. Venus doesn't have liquid water due to the insane runaway greenhouse effect (among other factors I'm sure) and Mars doesn't have liquid water due to a lack of a thick atmosphere and lack of a magnetic field. </p>
<p>However, there seems to be evidence that liquid water once indeed flowed on the Martian surface. I recall some kind of rock was discovered that, so far as scientists know, can only be formed in the presence of liquid water!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Arguably, we have three planets in the goldilock zone of our own star. Despite being on the outer edges of it there are several other factors contributing to the lifelessness of mars and venus.</p>
<p>Mars lost its atmosphere. Well, most of it. No electromagnetic field due to no tectonic activity lead to the loss of most of the gas from the rather low gravitational pull.</p>
<p>Being further away from the sun certainly didn't help (or did, arguably, as some carbon-dioxide remains as dry ice) but wasn't the only factor.</p>
<p>With venus the runaway greenhouse effect is what did in any chance of life on the planet. a lot of tectonic activity spewing out a lot of greenhouse gases. The shorter distance to the sun most certainly didn't help; more warmth to trap in the atmosphere. But that wasn't the only deciding factor either.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
