		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, this is a really interesting thought! What you're asking is whether deep sea critters have something known as a circadian rhythm, or a 'body clock', that regulates their behaviour - in this case, sleep. Most multicellular organisms have one, and it's usually regulated by exposure to daylight and nighttime. So what of creatures that can't detect this shift in light levels, or photoperiod?</p>
<p>Alas, there are no published studies as far as I'm aware that have investigated circadian rhythms, or lack thereof, in deep sea fish. Not really surprising, as they're awfully difficult beasties to find and study anyway, let alone in the lab!</p>
<p>What you might find interesting however is that we've done a buncha' studies on sleep in cave fish. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_tetra" target="_blank">Mexican blind cave fish</a> have two forms - a surface-dwelling sighted form that lives outside, and a blind cave form that lives in perpetual darkness. What's interesting is that the blind form has completely shut down it's circadian rhythm, and therefore saves about 30% more energy by default, compared to it's sighted form which 'gears up' every day in response to daytime.</p>
<p>In the absence of light, the blind fish therefore don't have a 24-hour cycle and don't need to 'tell' whether it's day or night. Living in perpetual darkness, it's also disadvantageous to conform to a day-night sleep cycle anyway. Given food is scarce, it makes sense to try and remain awake and alert as much as possible - just in case a tasty morsel floats by. They therefore rarely sleep, and do so only in very short bursts, throughout a 24 hour period.</p>
<p>I expect what applies to these cave fish applies equally well to deep sea fish. They don't care what time it is up on the surface, and sleep in quick snatches whenever and wherever. </p>
<p>If that helps answer your question?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bit tangential, but fun!  </p>
<p>Giulio Tononi's theory about sleep is that it is the price we play for neuroplasticity.  There's loads of evidence to support this.  In the simplest possible terms, neurons that fire together wire together.  Throughout the day, perceptual inputs cause changes that we call learning.  Sleeping does two things, it shuts off the perceptual systems (otherwise the systematic firing together would necessarily continue), and it actively resets the system by pruning connections based upon how strongly they fired together during the day (this is why you completely forget things like the color of your professor's tie, but you retain the things you focused heavily on like the contents of the lecture).  </p>
<p>Different animals have lives that require different amounts of learning about their environment.  Humans have very complex lives, so learning is outrageously important.  Presumably, crustaceans near an ocean vent don't have to learn very much on a daily basis.  They aren't facing novel problems technological problems, they likely aren't navigating to new locations very frequently, they probably don't have much need to communicate, etc.  The less learning you require, the less sleep you need.  Sleep, after all, is quite a risky thing to do.  </p>
<p>If I recall correctly, Tononi reports that he has yet to find a living organism that contains neurons of any sort that does not have some sort of activity state that is at least analogous to sleep.  Some don't have slow-wave REM sleep, for example, but they all have some sort of sleep-state during which the system can be reset.  He has tried.  He was actually contracted by the DoD to find a way to defer the need for sleep, through drugs or whatnot, so that soldiers could last for 4-5 days without sleeping.  It simply can't be done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/tea_and_biology If it isn't too late, since you seem to have info regarding these vent dwelling critters, maybe you can answer a question that has nagged me for years. Since the water is quite hot at the vents, if one of those white crabs or shrimp were to be brought to the surface, could they ever really be cooked? I mean most crustaceans are boiled, but since the water is technically hotter than boiling at pressure, what would even happen? It may asinine, but it has always &quot;bugged&quot; me! Thanks! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many benthic species (fish, jellies, squid, zooplankton, etc) actually rise to the surface of the ocean at night- the zooplankton feed on the plankton that photosyntheses during the day, and the other, bigger creatures feed on the zooplankton ( —&gt; fish —&gt; squid —&gt; etc). When dawn breaks, they sink back down. Those without eyes (jellies, plankton, and some fish) have photoreceptive spots on the top of their bodies that helps them determine which way is up or down (and when dawn breaks). Zooplankton and jellies don’t sleep at all- their lives expend such little energy with so much passive feeding that they just float on. I believe squid don’t necessarily sleep either, but I don’t have a source for that and I could be entirely wrong. </p>
<p>These cyclical rising and falling trends happen in deep water coastal areas. Some of the creatures in the open ocean (sharks, worms, eels, starfish, crabs, fish, etc) rest on the bottom occasionally, but also have a much slower pace of life, which can require much less energy to maintain and therefore less sleep, if any at all. Most must spend literally every moment looking for food in the vast expanse. No time for sleep when you got the munchies, after all. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many deep level animals rise to the surface at night, and sink to the depths in the early morning (where it's safer) according to animal planet shows. The boundary between the Mesopelagic zone and the Bathypelagic zone contains The Deep Scattering layer – a layer of fish, squid, crustaceans etc, that migrate each day from the deep ocean to the shallows at night, moving up migration from deep water protection to feeding while awake in shallower water at night so their circadian rhythms are reversed to those who sleep during nighttime hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
