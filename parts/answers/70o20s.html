		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ice isn't smooth, it has little holes in it that let the gas separate out from the liquid(nucleation sites).  Once these little bubbles form they leave the ice and head towards the surface freeing up the spot for another bubble to form.</p>
<p>The surface of the ice eventually melts and any high points melt quicker resulting in smooth ice that doesn't have nucleation sites after a bit which is why the second pour over the same ice makes fewer bubbles</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
