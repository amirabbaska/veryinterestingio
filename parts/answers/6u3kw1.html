		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hunger generally starts when the body stops metabolizing food and starts using stored energy, but there isn't really an equivalent for thirst. That being said, hunger pangs hurt, but being dehydrated feels like walking around with a concussion after sprinting for a mile or two. It's not &quot;painful,&quot; but I wouldn't be able to function at all after 24h without water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally I know where you're coming from, and I don't think its totally subjective. One possible answer : food contains water, and is often consumed with water. Unless you consume nothing but dry wafers eating tends to provide some fluid intake, so hunger signals function to help both eating and drinking.</p>
<p>Second possible reason : people eat too frequently. I'm the similar to the other poster in that I fast semi reguarly - I don't tend to eat breakfast or lunch, and I rarely start eating till half 7 / 8 pm. I don't notice hunger pangs as much. When you get used to eating reguarly, your body expects it and starts desiring more faster. Fluid intake is less ritualised, and involves less preparation on the part of the body, so for most people the signals warning about &quot;intake required&quot; would be less strident for water than for food</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're actually dehydrated, thirst feels way stronger than hunger. I know from cutting weight for wrestling that hunger pangs disappear when you are truly thirsty. I think you're probably just not that dehydrated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds subjective. I fast regularly, and going 24 hours without food isn't nearly as big of a deal to me as missing a meal was before I started fasting. When I'm dehydrated, on the other hand, I pass out easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's because of our modern, sugar rich diet.</p>
<p>The body looses it's ability to easily process fat storages when it gets lots of easy calories from sugar. Someone who's eating less that 10 grams of simple carbohydrates a day will be a lot more fat adapted and their body will be able to reside in a fasted state for multiple days without the dire need to restock supplies, because it can use up all those tens of thousands of calories stored in fat. (Remember, one kilogram of body fat has about 9000 calories, so the typical man carries around 140,000 Calories) </p>
<p>If you supply the body with lots of simple carbohydrates tho, it will loose the ability to process fat easily and start depending only on glycogen reserves in the muscles and liver. And those deplete easily. So after just a few hours of fasting, your body will scream &quot;GIV ME LOOOTS OF CARBS NAU!&quot;</p>
<p>Our ancestors did not have this problem since they ate mammoth and not chocolate and doughnuts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
