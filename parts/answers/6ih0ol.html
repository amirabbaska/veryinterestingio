		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Upper management at most large corporations typically get their compensation in 3 different ways. Compensation packages will often include all three, with additional variations on some.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Salary. This is self explanatory. Believe it or not, most C-level executives have salaries that are not outrageous. $1 million in salary is not unexpected for even a fortune 100 company</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance bonuses. The board will set annual performance goals for the company based on projections, market trends, expectations, wishful thinking, etc... In order to incentivize performance, managers will often share a fraction of performance above the goal. For example, if the board sets a target for $1 billion in pre-tax earnings, they may offer 10% of anything beyond that as an incentive. If the company posts $1.1 billion in pre-tax earnings, the company exceeded shareholder expectations by $100 million; of this, the executives would split $10 million in bonuses.</p>
</li>
<li>Stock options. Stock options give the option owner the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a predetermined number of stocks from a specific seller at a predetermined price. A stock option may also give the option owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a predetermined number of stocks to a specific buyer at a predetermined price.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stock options often account for the bulk of executive compensation, especially during periods of economic growth. For example, On January 1st 2015 I am given the option to purchase from my employer to purchase on January 1st 2017, 100 shares at $10 each. If the value of a share on the open market is more than $10 on January 1st 2017, the stock option is valuable and should be executed. If the value of a share on the open market is less than $10 on January 1st 2017, the stock option is worthless. Once exercised, the stocks can be sold on the open market, or kept for voting rights and dividends.</p>
<p>During &quot;bad times&quot;, executives will draw their salaries, but the bulk of their compensation will be derived from performance bonuses. These performance bonuses will be geared towards keeping the company afloat, such as keeping losses below a certain threshold, or minimising capital expenditures.</p>
<p>Just for clarity, when management is substantially responsible for a company's poor economic performance, the management will usually be tossed in short order. New management will often be brought in to right the ship, weather the storm, or simply wind down operations in an orderly fashion. New management cannot be expected to work for free, especially when it's not clear that they will have future job prospects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For many of them it's because they don't make their money via their salary, instead it's via bonus, their salary represents their minimum pay. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-who-take-1-dollar-salary-or-less-2015-8/" target="_blank">Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg all make $1</a>, Elon Musk makes miniumn wage at Tesla but refuses it. Obviously they are paid well, but with a $1 salary they will typically get a bonus based on the performance of the company. Elon Musk has a contract that says he gets a $1.4bn bonus when the company <a href="http://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-tesla-targets-milestones-set-by-board/" target="_blank">meets 10 goals they set</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously this is a small example, but the point is most CEOs have a relativity low salary for various reasons, including taxes. They then take their pay as stock or bonuses contingent on performance, if they screw up it automatically cuts their pay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, due to tax laws, most of a CEO's compensation comes in the form of a &quot;bonus&quot;, that is really much closer to pay expected for doing the job than what most people would call a bonus.  To qualify as a taxable expense any pay over $1 million must be tied to performance.</p>
<p>So while the salary rarely changes, the bonus pay (which must be tied to some performance metric to qualify as a taxable expense) can vary widely.  For example, Jamie Dimon is the CEO of a very large bank (JP Morgan), whose <a href="http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5345ac8169bedd9e218f0d75-731-332/screen%20shot%202014-04-09%20at%204.23.37%20pm.png" target="_blank">pay rose and fell</a> pretty dramatically between 2008 and 2013.  </p>
<p>His salary is the lightest blue bar, and didn't change, but his compensation changed dramatically.  It's not uncommon to see similar swings in total compensation as a result of incentive pay changes for many US CEOs, but because their salary is a tiny portion of their compensation it rarely changes.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I should point out that cutting a CEO's salary usually has a negligent impact on company finances. As others have mentioned, bonuses make up a large proportion of their compensation (which is also true overseas), although even those are generally orders of magnitude smaller than profit or loss.</p>
<p>A cynical man would say that cutting the salary of a CEO who is presumably already pretty wealthy is nothing but a publicity stunt and he may be right but there are other reasons as well. Cultural factors may make shared losses more expected  (I believe this to be the case in Japan), or falling revenues may be considered the fault of the CEO and losing his salary is a form of self-imposed punishment. </p>
<p>At any rate, we oughtn't get too caught up in how much or how little CEOs get paid during hard times, it's not going to make much of a difference in the end. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Japan, the culture is such that you are responsible to society. As such if your business does badly, you are responsible for those employees beneath you, and so you cut your wage so you can better support the continued employment of your employees.</p>
<p>In the West, your only responsibility is to the shareholders. You have no responsibility whatsoever to your employees; it is their duty to grovel with gratitude at the few crumbs of table scraps that fall from your plate because they are eminently disposable.</p>
<p>Probably simplified to an extreme, but largely accurate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
