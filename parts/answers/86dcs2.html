		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcoholic beverage developer here! The main reason is the solubility of sugar. Most of these flavored spirits have a large amount of sugar in them, and sugar is not very soluble in alcohol. Therefore, to get the sweetness they want, they have to dilute the strength of the spirit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The higher the ABV, the harder it is to bring subtle notes in flavor forward. 35% means it packs a similar punch to its unflavored counterpart, but is easier to pack more taste in without it becoming overpowering or way too sweet.</p>
<p>Also, via legal definitions many spirits must be at or above a certain ABV. For example, Vodka must be at least 40% ABV to be called vodka so you won't see 35% ABV unflavored vodka because you legally can't call it Vodka, which is why most is 40%. Flavored versions however, do not need to abide by this restrictions.</p>
<p>Edit: Holy cow I did not expect this to explode.</p>
<p>For all the questions about sub-40% ABV vodka... These are the definitions I was referring to.</p>

<p>As far as Smirnoff goes... not sure about people talking about 35% non-flavored. Iâ€™ve always had 40%.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a part of the regulations on alcoholic drinks. The Code of Federal Regulations title 27 specifies that an unflavored liquor must be 40% or greater ABV (specifically stated as 80 proof) <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/5.22" target="_blank">27 CFR 5.22a &quot;class 1&quot;</a> but a flavored liquor can be no less than 30% ABV (60 proof) <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/27/5.22" target="_blank">27 CFR 5.22i &quot;class 9&quot;</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of exceptions to this rule: chartreuse, cointreau and grand marnier spring to mind.</p>
<p>Also, it varies in different jurisdictions: Australia taxes alcohol <em>very</em> steeply, and as such, most spirits are 'watered down' to 37.5%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
