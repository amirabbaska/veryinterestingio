		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tidal forces are essentially due to the <em>difference</em> in the gravitational field between two sides of a body. If you consider the difference in the moon's influence between our head and our feet, it is essentially null. If you consider the difference between one side of the Earth and the other, it starts to become significant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It illuminates some very common misconceptions (that even some of the answerers here seem to have) and answers basically every question you could have about tides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwChk4S99i4" target="_blank">PBS Spacetime</a> did a great episode on this. </p>
<p>The short version is that the tides we see in the ocean are the result of forces that are only noticeable on very large bodies of water. That's why lakes, cups of coffee, dirt etc don't move in response to tidal forces. Watch the video though, it's good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This also brings up this question:  I understand the pull of the moon causing the water to bulge toward it which we see as a high tide.  But why does the water bulge up on the <em>opposite</em> side of the earth at the same time - giving a high tide there...?  Makes no sense - can someone explain that one?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
