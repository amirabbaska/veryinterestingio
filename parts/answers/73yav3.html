		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good number (but not all) of those airlines are subsidised by their government for political/ prestige/ strategic reasons, so a $100 ticket buys you $150 of product. Emirates/ Eithad/ Qatar especially don't have business models that would survive without outside money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because when you are in Japan/Singapore/Qatar/Korea/etc, and you are getting on an airplane, you are far more likely travelling internationally than if you are an American, who's more often than not getting on a domestic flight, even for only a few hundred miles.  </p>
<p>International flights are always different than domestic ones. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airline passengers in the US have voted with their wallets and demonstrated that when they are paying for their own ticket, all they care about is price. The only people willing to pay for a premium flight experience are people spending someone else's money.</p>
<p>Second, US airlines are heavily built around their domestic routes. International operations are an entirely different market with different service standards.</p>
<p>To put some numbers to this, as of a couple years ago, American Airlines saw half of its revenue come from the 87% of its customers who flew the airline only once that year. When looking at their fortress hub in Dallas-Fort Worth, they don't see their competition as United or Delta, but rather ultra-budget airline Spirit.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it comes down to price. Kiwi.com <a href="https://www.kiwi.com/stories/flight-price-index-2017/usd/" target="_blank">ranks countries by average flight costs per kilometer</a>. In the US, we're about halfway down the list at an average of $11.50.</p>
<p>That puts is two slots above China, which isn't exactly known for expensive prices. That's because in the US, a lot of people fly to and from work in coach. People generally want the cheapest flight possible, even if they end up with a bad experience.</p>
<p>By comparison, I've been told that flying in Japan is more of a luxury. When a good experience is more important than cost, you end up with more enjoyable flights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
