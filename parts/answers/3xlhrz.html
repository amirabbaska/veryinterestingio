		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>An object that has crossed the event horizon of a black hole can never cross it back to leave. In a very real sense, the only future destination of the object (or more technically the endpoint of its possible future <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line" target="_blank">world lines</a>) is the center of the black hole. Nevertheless, black holes do emit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">Hawking radiation</a>, thus effectively spitting the energy they once absorbed back out. So in this latter sense, it is possible for the mass-energy that has entered the black hole to eventually exit the black hole, but not before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hair_theorem" target="_blank">it's been turned to mush</a>.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Something that enters a Black Hole is no longer causally connected to anything outside the event horizon. The object's observable universe shrinks to that boundary. Its not much different than areas of the Cosmos that are now so far away, we can never reach them, if we dont find a way to break light speed. Our event horizon is just a bit bigger.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Theoretically, yes, but that's assuming the processes of black-hole formation, evolution and evaporation  by Hawking Radiation are all <em>unitary</em>. ie can we describe a black-hole by a Hamiltonian evolving a quantum state-vector? (A Schr√∂dinger type equation, where the Hamiltonian is a relativistic one - not the more usual non-relativistic forms used in atomic and chemical physics)<br><br>Most physicists will say that the process is unitary, but we won't know for sure until we have a theory of everything.<br><br>Now, just because it is <em>theoretically</em> possible to recover something, doesn't make it <em>practically</em> possible. It would be like trying to recover all the books in a gigantic library after it is burnt to the ground.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>It's kinda trapped, but eventually escapes as the black hole evaporates.<br><br>Hawkins theorized that black holes will eventually evaporate through a quantum mechanical process, but we have not observed this yet. As the bh evaporates, matter than had fallen in escapes in another form. <br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">
