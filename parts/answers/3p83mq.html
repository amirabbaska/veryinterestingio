Of course, photons are fundamental particles, so the only thing you get out when they're &quot;split&quot; are more photons. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An atom is made out of several particles. Spliting an atom consist in separating those particle.</p>
<p>The same is impossible with a photon, since a photon is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle" target="_blank">elementary particle</a>. This means the photon is made of only 1 particle. </p>
<p>However, [you can split a photon into 2 new photons.] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion</a>)</p>
<p>The difference is that those 2 new photons didn't exist before the split, whereas the particles in the split atom existed all along. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photons are particles, but being a particle is not what makes an atom splitable, it is the fact that atoms are made of smaller particles.</p>
<p>Also, it is kind of glossed over what it means to 'split' an atom or the components of an atom. Technically, you can split an atom by ionizing it with radiation or an electric charge. More generally it means breaking an atom's nucleus into pieces using nuclear fission.</p>
<p>But, I think what you want to ask is why can't we do to photons what we do to other particles in particle accelerators.</p>
<p>While photons are particles they act like ghosts to one another. When two photons are in the same place they add together. And if they are headed off in different directions they pass each other by without incident.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many have described, you can split via parametric downconversion. But I'd like to mention another process which could be called &quot;splitting a photon&quot;. When you send light through a double slit, the interference fringes are caused by different parts of the wave function passing through different slits. Since every photon is described by the wave function, it is commonly said that each photon passes through both slits and interferes with itself. In other words, it spits and rejoins. The same can be said about all phenomena involving interference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
