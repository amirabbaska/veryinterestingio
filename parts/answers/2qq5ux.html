		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There are some issues with terminology, but in a sense, yes! They do make energy and store it, and in a somewhat parallel way to humans<br><br>In humans, we store energy (generally) in two forms - fat (adipose tissue) and carbohydrates (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen" target="_blank">Glycogen</a>). Glycogen is what we call a &quot;polymer&quot; of glucose blocks. Pretend that a single glucose molecule (the basic sugar that our body metabolizes for energy) is a lego. If I wanted to store all my legos, I could keep them loosely in a box. However, the body likes to be neat so instead of just tossing them in there, our body will connect the legos into stacks (&quot;polymerization&quot;) for storage in order to save space as well as keep them separate from the free legos which I want to use for energy immediately. These stacked legos (glucose polymers) are our glycogen. One caveat would be that in real life, we can stack legos in a straight line, but glycogen is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen#mediaviewer/File:Glycogen_structure.svg" target="_blank">branched</a>. Glycogen is stored mostly in the liver and muscles, and when we need energy our body chips away at our lego stacks in a process called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogenolysis" target="_blank">glycogenolysis</a> liberating individual legos which can be metabolized for energy in the muscle, or liberated into the bloodstream for use wherever need be by the liver.<br><br>Plants have a parallel mechanism, with a few differences. In plants, our stacked legos are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch" target="_blank">starch</a>. Starch consists of a combination of amylose and amylopectin. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylose" target="_blank">amylose</a> is linear, with no branches, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylopectin" target="_blank">amylopectin</a> is branched and is similar to glycogen with the exception of the types of saccharide bonds between legos.<br><br>I should also note the difference between complex and simple carbohydrates. A simple carbohydrate is that free lego. Sugary foods are high in simple carbs. A complex carbohydrate is the polymerized form - starch. Breads (brown bread more than white), potatoes, rice, etc are all high in complex carbohydrates.<br><br>The parts of plants which we eat (i.e potatoes, rice) are the site of complex carbohydrate storage. I'm not familiar with the plant biology here, so I'd let someone with more experience detail the specifics about plant anatomy. But to answer your question, the potato we eat IS their fat, although it isn't fat in the sense you might think (analogous to adipose tissue) but rather fat in a conceptual sense (stored energy).<br><br>---<br><br><strong>Edit</strong>: Including this reply I typed up further below:<br><br>&gt; Yes! It's actually a common misconception that eating fat makes us fat in a different way than eating carbs makes us fat. The body processes our food into energy through <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cellular+respiration+proteins&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1600&amp;amp;bih=785&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;imgil=SX6zoViJGgu5XM%253A%253BssgOh_shEbNX3M%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fprezi.com%25252F_xv9fukftjmj%25252Fbig-idea-2%25252F&amp;amp;source=iu&amp;amp;pf=m&amp;amp;fir=SX6zoViJGgu5XM%253A%252CssgOh_shEbNX3M%252C_&amp;amp;usg=__ypGm_g8gkURyH3mA90flel_h7PM%3D&amp;amp;ved=0CEsQyjc&amp;amp;ei=O8yhVJPsOMShNuCagogJ#facrc=_&amp;amp;imgdii=_&amp;amp;imgrc=faEoLB9gXDgX1M%253A%3BhVxiR9v02WXkiM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fbio1151.nicerweb.com%252FLocked%252Fmedia%252Fch09%252F09_20Catabolism-L.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fbio1151.nicerweb.com%252FLocked%252Fmedia%252Fch09%252Fcatabolic.html%3B416%3B600" target="_blank">the same pathway, whether fat, protein, or carbohydrate!</a> They each just enter this cycle at different points.<br><br>&gt;Essentially, cellular respiration is used to derive energy from all three macronutrients. Fats and proteins are all broken down into intermediates of cellular respiration, and then enter the cycle directly to eventually lead to energy.<br><br>&gt; Gaining (or losing weight) is just a function of thermodynamics. If I expend less energy than I put in, that extra energy has to be conserved. Our bodies primarily conserve energy by creating and storing fat in adipose tissue. Likewise, if I expend more energy than I consume, that extra energy has to come from somewhere because energy must be conserved. Then, our body will break down our stores of fat and provide energy to fill the difference. When it comes to losing or gaining weight, it is important to account for what we call Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which is how much energy our body expends on keeping us alive. Homeostatic processes (maintaining fluid balance, temperature, brain activity, everything) are biochemical processes which require energy - lots of it.<br><br>&gt; For example, my BMR is about 2000 kcal/day (8368000 Joules, equal to about <strong><em>twice the energy of 1kg of TNT exploding, and around the ballpark of the kinetic energy of an armor-piercing tank round</em></strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28energy%29" target="_blank">source, interesting to read!</a>)). If I eat 3000 calories, 2000 will be used by my body to stay alive. The other 1000 will be stored as fat. If I went swimming and burned 500 calories, only 500 calories will be stored as fat.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Plants do have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_organ" target="_blank">storage organs</a> which are used to hold nutrients (including water and sugars). These organs can be &quot;fat&quot;, in the sense of being much thicker than other portions of the plant. These storage organs can really occur anywhere in the plant, from leaves to roots.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succulent_plant" target="_blank">Succulants</a> often appear &quot;fat&quot;. They are suited for arid environments, and as such want to maximize water storage and minimize water evaporation. The best way to do that is to increase volume without increasing surface area, which is why these plants appear swollen.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There actually are mutations which cause unnatural fat/oil storage in plants. One such mutation in the pkl (pickle) mutation in Arabidopsis. Many fruits of plants accumulate fat. However as to the negative effects of increased growth...trees that grow faster (more radial growth per year) generally tend to die faster as well. <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/228492831_Relationships_between_radial_growth_rates_and_lifespan_within_North_American_tree_species" target="_blank">Here</a> <a href="http://treephys.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/11/1317.full" target="_blank">and Here</a><br><br>Though not the same as obesity there does seem to be a general trend in most lifeforms that those with more energy intake grow bigger faster and die more quickly having reached their reproductive potential earlier or more vigorously. <br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A fat plant is a plant that yields a larger than normal amount of produce, a higher quality produce, or one which yields very large produce which one depends wholly on what the plant in question is. An example of a &quot;fat plant&quot; are pumpkins as depicted in the image below. These are standard pumpkin which were over nourished and the buds were culled down to a single unit.<br><br><a href="http://www.theridgefieldpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/P1-ROP-Pumpkin-Growing-CL.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.theridgefieldpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/P1-ROP-Pumpkin-Growing-CL.jpg</a><br><br>If the plant cannot remove the excess &quot;food&quot; in its reproductive mechanism or growth than the soil may die resulting in the death of the plant. Soil is a complex living biome of bacteria life critical to a plants survival. Many of the so called critical elements are for the bacteria present in the soil not the plant itself other elements may attract other microorganism into the biome which could hinder the plant. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
