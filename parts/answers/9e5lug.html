<p>Fossils arenâ€™t just bones.  Fossils are preserved parts of all kinds, including preservation of the impression that the skin has made against whatever material fossilized.</p>

<p>This article has a picture of some fossilized dinosaur skin impression, and also notes the different parts of creatures that have been found fossilized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since a lot of comments cover the 'we don't know' aspect, I'll go over what we do know (apart from obvious stuff like 'these two bones fit together in this complete skeleton/modern animal and it can bend this far without dislocating so this bone goes here like this').</p>
<p>Firstly, despite most dinosaurs being very different to most modern animals, their muscles and body probably worked very similarly to various other ones. Since birds are a type of specialised dinosaur, we can look at the muscle scars on the bones of dinosaurs and then compare the size and locations with those on a bird (or other animals such as crocodiles for where muscles have been lost or modified, such as the tail and arms). An example of this is where the tail-leg muscle on a <em>Carnotaurus</em> was determined to be very large, from the size of the muscle scars, and those large muscles would support it either being a fast runner (if it was more red muscle) or sprinter (if more white). And by looking at the sounds different modern birds and crocodiles make, and what types of them do what, you can guess that tyrannosaurs probably boomed like an ostrich or hissed like an alligator rather than chirped like a canary or roared like a lion.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's possible to look at the texture of the bone to guess at what might have been above it. For example, bone under flesh and bone under horny skin both look different- if you compare (say) a bony sea turtle skull to a fleshy lion skull, you'll see that the turtle skull is very rough with small, sharp eye sockets while the lion is very smooth and rounded. So you could use it to tell the head crest of an <em>Allosaurus</em> was covered in horn rather than supporting a comb like a chicken. In addition, you can see the blood vessel holes or nerve pores- so you could see the holes in a <em>Spinosaurus</em>'s snout to show that it had pressure sensors.</p>
<p>Thirdly, you can look at the holes left by the nervous system to guess behaviour. The most important are 'endocasts'- rotted-out holes that got filled up, basically- of the brain, inner ears and nervous system. One example is that scientists compared the skull of a tyrannosaur ancestor called <em>Timurlengia</em> to those of older predators such as <em>Allosaurus</em>, and found that although tyrannosaurs only became an apex predator for a very short period of time, their sensory capabilities appeared earlier- <em>Timurlengia</em> could hear lower sounds than similar dinosaurs. Even other holes can be helpful- a recent discovery was that a pterosaur called <em>Coloborhynchus</em>, despite having limbs almost identical to another called <em>Anhanguera</em>, had much bigger nerves in the hip- meaning it was much more terrestrial, sorta like how some gulls are more terrestrial than others despite all being aquatic and similar.</p>
<p>Fourthly, you can look at the wear and tear that a lifestyle did to figure out what that lifestyle was in the first place. Tooth wear is most common- the herbivore with more worn teeth, for example, was probably eating something tougher and twiggier. Then there's scars and other injuries- as an example, an <em>Albertosaurus</em> or <em>Ornithomimus</em> had less stress fractures on its hands and feet than an <em>Allosaurus</em>, implying that allosaurs were different to the other two in that they were using their claws in combat on a relatively frequent basis. Giant marine reptiles called pliosaurs are one of my favourite examples, because they seem to have been getting the same injuries as pets banging their heads on the underside of a table... in the middle of the ocean. Nobody has any clue why they kept getting bumps to the ridge of the head.</p>
<p>Finally, you can just take a look or mess around. We have a wide variety of fossil skin and other such things, so you can guess what an animal's skin might be like by comparing it to close relatives. In fossil skin or feathers, you can check for certain colours- <em>Microraptor</em> was dark and had something structural to its colour (e.g somewhere on the spectrum from glossy to iridescent), <em>Sinosauropteryx</em> had a stripy tail, a bandit mask and the colour patterns of an open-terrain animal, and <em>Borealopelta</em> the ginger nodosaur was camouflaged like an animal vulnerable to predators rather than flat-coloured like an elephant or starkly-coloured like a porcupine despite its size, armour and vicious bladed tail. And then there's the odd other thing- the famous sound of <em>Parasaurolophus</em> was made basically by blowing the bony resonating chamber in its crest like a trumpet.</p>
<p>So yes, most stuff we see is just guesses. But when we want to find out exactly what something might look like, you can get a surprising amount of information from a few glorified rocks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When dinosaur fossils started appearing in large numbers at a time and it became clear that each was vastly different, they were cataloged in such a way that they were nearly unrecognizable compared to how we now believe them to have looked.</p>
<p>For a start, the artists which fleshed them out (literally drew flesh onto the sketched bones) didn't know anything about how the muscles would have looked underneath, so they omitted them almost entirely. As a result, a lot of the first drawings of skin-on dinosaurs made them look skinny and horrific. <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/gZcay" target="_blank">Here's an album of animals draw in the same style as the dinosaurs sketched in the 18- and 1900s, using only the skeletons as reference</a>.</p>
<p>We now know that lost of different animals have similar bones and muscles, even though they look entirely different on the outside. <a href="https://iucnredlist-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/medium/945216608.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJIJQNN2N2SMHLZJA&amp;Expires=1562256978&amp;Signature=zeTS0rSQhLbbZvuPDx3gv9MwWvs%3D" target="_blank">Here's an Okapi - they're related to Giraffes and they have nearly identical skulls and the same number and shape of neck bones</a>. Also &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; doesn't tend to just cover literal dinosaurs but encompasses a wide range of animals which lived those millions of years ago, and we know how a lot of these creatures evolved and how their structures have changed. Also bear in mind that sharks and crocodiles haven't really changed much for millions of years, so some of these &quot;living dinosaurs&quot; can give an idea of how most similar-sized creatures always tended to look, but with many many small variations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is actually a lot we know about dinosaurs. There is a good bit of guess work involved, but there are some really fantastic fossils that have preserved more than just bones. My favorite is Scipionyx. The digestive system, liver, heart, some of the respiratory system, and even blood vessels and blood were fossilized. Muscle tissue was preserved as well, it really is an amazing fossil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
