		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I sell ammunition for a living. I can break it down for you in this scenario. </p>
<p>You have the producer of the ammo, let's take winchester as any old example. Very few retailers have accounts with winchester themselves. For winchester, it's not worth the head ache keeping track of every gun store, hunting club, pawn shop, and sporting goods store who wants to sell their ammo. Logistically, in the volume of orders they already take, it'd be too much work to sell it by the box. They get orders from bass pro, walmart, Academy. These are orders on the scale of hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of dollars. Your average customer who is only spending 20 bucks isn't worth the time. </p>
<p>So Winchester goes to a middle man. This person has an account with Winchester, Remington, Federal, Hornady, all the retailers. Now to this new person, an order of $10,000 is a regular daily affair. That's why they're who I buy from. Your average customer who is about to spend $20 isn't worth the time. </p>
<p>Then you have us. We're <em>usually</em> the final stop the ammo takes before going to the customer (although we do supply some other dealers and vendors)</p>
<p>We usually order in the magnitude from the latter around $10,000 worth of ammo but it's comprised of many different bullets. We then apply a standard markup and sell to the consumer. Our range of business is designed to benefit the consumer most. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things. One is that what you think is a 'large quantity' could be their smallest sale ever, so it's possible they're not saying goodbye to much money, relatively speaking. If you were ordering, say, 5,000 units, and you were willing to set up an account with them etc., I bet they'd be fine with it. Selling to businesses requires completely different (and fewer) resources than selling to consumers, and by policy I bet they want to keep their business running the way they have set it up.</p>
<p>Beyond that, they likely have built relationships with the restaurants they sell to that rely on the fact that they are a business-to-business vendor, which helps keep products &quot;exclusive&quot; and prices lower. Restaurants might start looking elsewhere if the wholesaler were to start a consumer outlet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wholesale food distributor here. Your sale of one case of pickles is not something we are really all that interested in. Since food is a commodity in most instances, the margins are generally razor thin (especially on something as cheap as pickles). In addition to that, the effort of having an employee punch the order (as it will have to be picked) and having an employee go and pick your one case from the warehouse almost makes it a loss. The only way we even turn a profit is because of larger sales which is why volume is king in this business. However, if a normal customer comes in for a single case because they happen to run out, we will accommodate them as a courtesy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I cant speak to the pickle that youre in specifically, but at least in my case its to protect our customer base. We sell engines for forklifts and if we sold to anyone at wholesale price we would be cutting out forklift dealers who are constantly buying from us. They wouldn't be making as much money because of our sales to end users and when they got wind of what we were doing they would take their business elsewhere because we made them lose sales. We would be trading a reliable stream of business from dealers for one time sales and it wouldn't be good for us. However, we have a separate, internal, retail company that simply has higher prices. So we do sell to end users, just at a higher price. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The definition of wholesale <em>is</em> selling to other businesses... some retailers claim to sell &quot;wholesale&quot; to consumers, because it implies a deal or cutting out the middle man, but there are differences in licenses, ability to collect and remit sales taxes, etc.</p>
<p>If they had sold to you, they legally would have been obligated to pay sales tax on the sale. But because it's not normally something they deal with due to selling to other businesses, then it would be a royal headache for them to remain in legal compliance for a minimal sale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
