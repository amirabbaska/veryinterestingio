		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can read some of the history of it here: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GEPlants/UCM537311.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/GEPlants/UCM537311.pdf</a></p>
<p>In brief, it's a bit of an arbitrary semantics issue. As far as United States government agencies are concerned, all &quot;traditional&quot; techniques for altering a species are not considered genetic engineering (or GE, the phrase they typically use instead of GMO).</p>
<p>The more recent regulations were specifically made in response to technologies that relied on recombinant DNA and cell fusion (though you don't tend to hear about the latter anymore). What is different about these modern techniques is that they can be used to obtain organisms with genomes that would be extremely unlikely or even impossible to obtain through any pre-modern technique, such as putting a bacterial gene into corn, or a jellyfish gene into a cat.</p>
<p>In fact, it is even argued that it is not the technology that determines what is GMO, but the result. That is, there are people using gene-editing technology to create organisms that you could in principle obtain with selective breeding, but in one or two generations instead of twenty. (such as here: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3560" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3560</a> )</p>
<p>Under that sort of a regime, it would be argued that any rearrangement of DNA, in which all of the DNA comes from one species, is not GMO, even if different pieces of DNA came from different individuals. And simple deletion would also not be GMO, since it's only removing and not recombining DNA. But adding DNA to a species that it has no way to obtain through mating or hybridizing, that would make something GMO. Though again, semantics, people are still arguing over this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tree geneticist here. It is worth mentioning that USDA APHIS recently decided that it wonâ€™t regulate the Crispr-Cas9 generated genetically engineered organisms like it regulates the Bt transformation based organisms. This means the very lengthy and expensive regulatory process will not have to be endured by organisms modified through Crispr. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Master student of biotechnology here who has studied GMO crops specifically. I see a lot of people are slightly confused about the concept.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the law, something is GMO if it's been subject to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering" target="_blank">genetic engineering</a>, which is a rather specific technique for changing an organism's genes.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other ways to change the genes of organisms that doesn't count as GMO, for example cross breeding, mutagenesis using chemicals or radiation. Essentially any method that changes the genes randomly or semi-randomly or in a way so that we <strong>dont</strong> immediately know what changes have occurred are non-GMO. These ways of altering foods gene are almost not regulated at all and you have no obligation of finding out what you've changed in the genome, you can go on directly to plant it and sell it to people for consumption.</p>
<p>But when you use genetic engineering and knowingly move genes that you know what they are from or to a specific place in the genome with the purpose of accomplish a specific thing, then it's GMO and according to a lot of governments, dangerous and unsafe and can't be sold for human consumption, although there's been decades of testing proving that GMO crops are as safe or safer than conventional food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a plant geneticist. &quot;GMO&quot; is a cultural term, not a scientific one. Some people consider all genetically altered crops GMOs, others just use it to refer to crops that have genes inserted from other species.
I made an infographic that illustrates the different ways that the genetics of crops are modified:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GMO is typically a shorthand for transgenic crops. These are plants whichhave had a gene from another species introduced artificially, by one of several different methods. This is distinct from human induced changes from selective breeding. </p>
<p>Crops produced from other types of genetic engineering, including the use of mutagenic chemicals or radiation are not considered GMOs. </p>
<p>Still there is some degree of arbitrariness in the label. Cheese, produced from chymosin from genetically modified microbes (which is extremely common in the US) is not considered a GMO, even though chymosin producing microbes are definitely transgenic organisms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
