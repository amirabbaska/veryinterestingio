		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The angular momentum of a solid sphere is L=Iw, where I is the moment of inertia and w is the angular velocity. For a solid sphere, I = 2/5 mr^2, where m is mass and r is radius. w=v/r, where v is the tangential velocity. This is all covered in classical mechanics. So L = (0.4 m r^2) * (v/r). The tangential velocity is therefore (5L)/(2mr). We know the mass of an electron is roughly 10^(-30) kg and the classical radius of an electron is 10^(-15). So all that we need now is L.</p>
<p>Now a bit of quantum. The eigenvalues of the spin operator on a state is hbar <em> sqrt (s (s+1)). hbar is planck's constant over 2</em>pi, s is the spin of the electron. You can refer to Chapter 4 of Griffiths Quantum Mechanics if you want to learn more, but basically we can consider this quantity to be the angular momentum L from the classical formula L=Iw. so L= sqrt (3)* hbar/2. Plug this into the formula we derived for v classically.</p>
<p>We therefore find that v is roughly 800 times the speed of light. However, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there is now way that the electron is spinning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, this is silly, I know, but this thread seemed like a good place to ask:</p>
<p>Is there any &quot;research&quot; into considering the electron as a &quot;higher-dimensional&quot; particle?</p>
<p>The part that's visible in our 4D world is the point - the very tip of the electron if it were a hyper-sphere.</p>
<p>Wouldn't this also explain how during tunneling or when &quot;moving&quot; around a nucleus, it seems to jump from location to location and not actually travel in a contiguous path?</p>
<p>I'm quite sure the maths will prove this ridiculous but just a thought that keeps popping up in my brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aren't electrons more or less a percentage chance of negative charge existing in a quantum field? My understanding of quantum physics is very limited but as far as i know an electron isn't really &quot;something tangible&quot;. Its like a tiny probability of electrical potential. It seems difficult to create a model that properly represents something like this when nothing physical or tangible really behaves anything like this. It's very contradictory to human perception.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I guess the question is why you can't explain spin of an electron as effect caused by rotation of charged sphere.</p>
<p>First it is important to understand why we sometimes speak of spin as &quot;sort of rotation but not really&quot;. The reason is simple: The quantum mechanical (QM) equations that describe the spin look more or less the same as the equation for QM rotation. For example the discreet allowed values of angular momentum in some direction are integer (or half-intiger) multiples of hbar. The same goes for the spin.</p>
<p>However, the spin is not any kind of movement at all. The spin of particles arises naturally when you try to put together special relativity and quantum mechanics. </p>
<p>Basically, for an electron you arrive at equation of the form A\^2-B\^2=0. Now this has two solutions A = B and A = -B, but that is a problem since B corresponds to energy and you don't get a ground state (the state with the least energy) if there are solutions like this.</p>
<p>Normally, you would solve this problem by factoring out the equation into (A-B)(A+B)=0 and only keeping for example A-B=0. This however can't be done here, because we live in 4D spacetime and so actually A\^2=dX\^2+dY\^2+dZ\^2. Paul Dirac performed a neat trick, by putting in some matrices. This allowed the equation to be factored down (thus solving the ground state problem), but as a side effect, we now don't have one wave function (as in classical quantum mechanics), but rather a set of four of them (so called bispinor).</p>
<p>It turns out that the first two parts of the bispinor correspond to wave functions of electron with spin up and down and the other two correspond to electron's antiparticle - pozitron.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Spin is a necessary consequence of special relativity in 4D spacetime that is (by &quot;coincidence&quot;) described by similar equations as rotation. </p>
<p>A btw fact: There is difference between spin and rotation when it comes to magnetism. For any object the magnetic moment is proportional to angular momentum (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromagnetic_ratio" target="_blank">Gyromagnetic ratio</a>). If spin would be just a rotation, the gyromagnetic ratio would be twice less than what it actually is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
