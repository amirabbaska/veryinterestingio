		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for one of the largest energy suppliers across NA. The impact is that once you retire that REC it cannot be sold or traded in the future. This is a net positive. The extent to which it is positive depends on future policy and the overall demand for RECs in the market. </p>
<p>Net net, it is a good thing to do as a consumer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key term there was &quot;significant&quot;. Purchase and use of a REC directly relates to new installed renewable power. However when comparing the use of individual, voluntary purchasers compared to organizations who are motivated by legislation, marketing, world citizenry, etc,  we are talking about insignificant amounts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you choose to pay for renewables then you will be directly paying for that many kilowatt hours of energy from renewables. Most people don't care enough to do so, and residential power usage accounts for something like less than 20% of total electric use over a 24 hour period. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=86&amp;t=1" target="_blank">60% is used in industrial processes, and the remaining 40% is split between Commercial and Residential.</a> Residential being the smaller portion thereof.</p>
<p>Last time I checked people who voluntarily paid extra to get renewable energy accounted for less than 1% in my state. So we're talking like 0.2% of all electric use. That's just not a meaningful portion of the demand.</p>
<p>That being said, most electric utilities have some renewables generation in their portfolio these days, even if it's just for feel good stories in the local paper it still accounts for more generation than there is demand from people willing to pay extra.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in energy efficiency products sector and spend the majority of my time working with utilities to reduce the grid demand from consumers and business. While I don't work directly in the energy purchase agreement side of things, I know and work with a lot who do so this is my take away.</p>
<ol>
<li>There is now way to buy 100% renewable power from a utility as the grid is like a big bowl with a lot of different power sources poured into it, and you get some of the mixed power out.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.there is (currently) no feasible (read: cost effective) way to create a 100% renewable grids as all of our renewable power sources are pretty temperamental and are not very good at producing the baseline amount of power a utility needs through a day. E.g the sun doesn't always shine and it's not always windy, but people always need power.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Battery storage is nowhere near as effective as it needs to be in order to store the quantity of power needed to support our communities. It's very very cost prohibitive. This is why people like Elon Musk are dedicating the majority of their wealth and skill towards fixing this issue, as the inefficiency of batteries is the single biggest thing holding back human advancement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need for baseline demand for power is filled by legacy technologies like nuclear, and hydro electric and short term demand being filled by burning natural gas and coal with wind and solar falling somewhere in the middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The growth of personal solar has lead to some big issues for utilities for utilities as they build a forecast for the power will be needed and occasionally if amount of power being put on the grid comes from outside sources it can disrupt those plans. Think of the bowl metaphor again, utilities plan to keep the bowl filled to the level needed, but occasionally the personal solar pours too much in the bowl and it overflows (very very dangerous thing) and the utility needs to pay people to use their bowls. When this happens the cost of power becomes negative which is why a lot of utilities are being more restrictive with solar.</p>
</li>
<li>When utilities cannot find the extra bowls for the power they are forced to just release the energy which we know is a mix of types of power. </li>
</ol>
<p>When you buy 100% renewable you are often buying demand not from your utility but from a third party provider. This puts the pressure on utilities to buy more power from solar farms which in turn helps to drive down solar cost but also incentivizes utilities to invest in better battery tech in order to capture the benefit of solar power. It's also makes them build solar into the standard and peak demand modeling which helps to reduce dependence on other less effective sources. While a single person is not much of a difference maker, the tens of thousands making the switch it becomes pretty influential.</p>
<p>So I would say it is a net good, but you need to determine if the additional cost to you is worth it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Maryland we were promised that if we allowed our electric company to merge with Constellation energy and open competition to other providers we would see a reduction of our kilowatt hour rates.  In reality, we experienced roughly a doubling of our electric rates.  </p>
<p>BUT we can chose to have our electricity provided by renewable sources, which is largely a scam.   First off, you really can't select the source of your power, only the company you pay for it.  SO 100% of your power could easily be coming from coal but you're paying your renewable energy company to put an equal amount of power on the grid.  It would be like having five water companies dump water into a lake and you dip in your cup and pay the company with the cleanest water for the drink.  </p>
<p>All of us use electricity from renewable energy companies (assuming you're not off the grid).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
