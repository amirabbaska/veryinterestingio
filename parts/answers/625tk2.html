		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a very big impact crater on the far side. Probably you meant lunar maria. They formed when impacts were big enough to break the lunar crust and reach the molten interior, so lava came out and later solidified in a relatively smoother and darker surface. The impact on the far side just created a big crater with no mare as the crust is thicker.</p>
<p>There are two theories about this. They do not contradict each other so they could even be both true.</p>
<p>One of them says that when the lunar maria formed, Earth was still hot and emitting lots of infrared. So the near side of the Moon was kept warmer, with a thinner solid crust.</p>
<p>Another theory is based on the giant impact hypothesis. Some background: A Mars-sized body (called Theia) is supposed to have impacted Earth at a relatively low speed. The collision created a disc of debris that eventually coalesced and formed the Moon.</p>
<p>Back to the maria: the other theory says that from this disc of debris it was actually <em>two moons</em> that formed. But since they were sharing the same orbit in an unstable configuration, eventually they crashed at a low speed and the smaller moon &quot;pancaked&quot; over the larger one, creating a thicker crust on that side. Then the Moon gradually became tidally locked and the thicker crust happened to be on the far side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is currently true but during the time of great bombardment when the moon was likely still being formed along with our planet, the moon wouldn't have been tidely locked therefore the possibility of it getting hit on the side we see would have been astronomically higher. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth doesn't provide relevant shielding. Yeah, some asteroids hit it and can't hit Moon afterwards, but some will also get attracted just right to hit Moon. The different structure does not come from a different number of impacts. See /u/annitaq's description for details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
