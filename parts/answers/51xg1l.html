So yes, we'd feel slightly more (except at the poles where it would imperceptibly less).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'd be under slightly greater net downward acceleration, but it'd be so small a change you wouldn't notice, and almost nothing directly would change due to gravitational acceleration.</p>
<p>Other significant things would indirectly change, however, such as the oceanic currents, the seasons, the shape of the earth, and the rotation of the earth's core. I don't know enough to guess at those changes, but I think  its safe to say it would be very serious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>F = mrw^2 = centripetal force</p>
<p>m = mass [kg]</p>
<p>r = radius of circle traced by human on earth [m]</p>
<p>w = angular velocity [rad/sec], of human in computer chair. Equals 360 degrees per 24 hours</p>
<p>F = 60*6371000*0.000073^2 ~= 2 [Newtons]</p>
<p>Weight of human on computer chair = F_2 = ma = 60*9.8 = 588 [Newtons].</p>
<p>Net force on human in computer chair = 586 Newtons</p>
<p>Multiply w by 17 to roughly cause both weight and centripetal force to be equal, resulting in a feeling of weightlessness. 24 hours / 17 = 1.412 hours, roughly the orbital period of the ISS. Coincidence? I think not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
