Source : I've done deep cleaning on quite a few cars 30-50 years old with original carpet.  Hard surfaces wear much more obviously - painted metal, bare metal, plastic, wood or whatever else you think &quot;should&quot; be there would be much more likely to show wear earlier than decent carpet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who buy cars generally do not like sounds intruding in the cabin. Although modern cars have many forms of sound deadening from simple to carefully engineered, the carpet remains a large part of that sound deadening. More cleanable floor coverings would tend transmit more sound to the cabin, or would be heavier than carpet.</p>
<p>People who buy cars generally like them to feel luxurious. This feeling of luxury probably began with horsedrawn coaches but moved to cars and other vehicles. If you have never really seen a car with its carpet gone, its a fairly naked and ugly sight, appealing to certain people, but not at all to most. Floor coverings that are not carpet would not have this effect, and don't sell all that well in the general market.</p>
<p>Carpet in a car insulates the feet from metal, much as home carpet insulates the feet from cold boards. Like any fabric blanket, it helps trap heat inside the car in the winter, and at the very least gives the illusion of warmth to the occupants in low temperatures which is almost as important.</p>
<p>The adsorbent nature of carpet that makes it seem like a bad choice is in fact a sort of boon. Something like a thin sheet of formed rubber in place of carpet would seem a better choice to use when moisture is expected. But water, trash, and dirt would still collect on such flooring, while water would slosh around the floorboards in all but the driest climates. Trash and dirt would be easier to see, and the car would look nasty sooner. Instead carpet traps any water and dirt so that they can be contained and removed later. </p>
<p>Cleaning some sort of rubber or other floor would probably involve lots of scrubbing around on the surface with towels in order to clean, and in practice would not be much less odious. No, you cannot hose out the car. The whole car interior would have to be designed for hosing/powerwashing, meaning materials that are either very expensive or very unpleasant to deal with. Electrical systems in the cabin would need to be even more expensively designed and likely heavier in order to resist an expected regular bath. In the end, no matter what you make the flooring out of, cleaning a car interior is a hassle. Minus the powerwashing, you are still down there scrubbing away at your rubber floor.</p>
<p>You may not realize it, but the average car's carpet can be pulled all the way out with a minimum of trouble by the properly equipped. If the carpet is utterly ruined, it can actually be replaced without much trouble, or it can be vigorously washed. Other solutions, like rubber, could do the same, but would be either be thin enough to rip and wear through, or thick enough that they add significant weight to the car compared to carpet. Excess weight is undesirable for economy and performance reasons. As many have pointed out, carpet is not actually that hard to clean, even in the car.</p>
<p>The addition of drains to floors seems obvious, except that the modern car floor is full of bumps, depressions and ridges meant to increase rigidity and serve engineering purposes other than channeling water. Either floors would be more expensive to design without carpet, or many drain holes would have to be strategically added, adding failure points to the floor for leakage, cracking and encouraging rust. Rust needs no encouragement and must be strenuously battled. Carpet covers all this ridged unsightliness well while asking for very few favors from the engineering process and adding no problems mechanically. </p>
<p>Carpet is actually the easiest, most effective way to solve the problem of car flooring, pleasing the owner and making things easier, and thus less expensive to the manufacturer, which results in lower prices, and there we go pleasing the people who buy the cars again. The modern vehicle carpet has been exhaustively designed to do that job very well. Many, many smart people have asked why carpet, and yet, we always return to fuzzy stuff on the floor, for all the reasons I mention.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cleaning, noise reduction, durability...no other substances do it all, while carpet does all of those things pretty well.</p>
<p>I doubt you'd particularly enjoy being in a vehicle without carpet either... The noise reduction is a lot more than you are thinking it is. You'd end up with an echo filled, extremely loud vehicle without it, while with it you have some degree of insulation from the noise... And it should perhaps be mentioned that no single material can be manufactured cheaply that does all these things.</p>
<p>That's basically all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cars used to have crappy rubber or vinyl floor coverings by default. For example my 1964 Ford Falcon had this weird vinyl floor, but carpet was available as a paid upgrade when it was new.  Having carpet in your car was a status symbol. </p>
<p>Over time, the &quot;upgrade&quot; to carpet became the norm, as everyone wanted the upgrade in status. If a car didn't have it, it simply wasn't competitive.  Now it seems only work vehicles tend to have rubber flooring in them, where practicality trumps status. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
