		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, we do have methods of duplicating antibodies in large quantities! Today, monoclonal antibodies can be generated fairly easily via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoclonal_antibody#Production" target="_blank">hybridoma technology</a>, but even prior to the development of that method, antibodies from the serum of immune donors were widely used for treatment against infectious diseases in non-immune patients. That process is called &quot;passive immunization&quot; and is reviewed <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88952/" target="_blank">here</a>. A similar process also happens naturally between mother and infant, where antibodies from the mother are passively transferred to the infant via the placenta or via breast milk.</p>
<p>For some diseases, passive transfer of antibodies remains pretty much the only treatment option we have once an infection has progressed (e.g., tetanus, diptheria, and botulism, where antibodies are given to neutralize toxins). The first table in that review lists a lot of infections where passive immunization is used. Passive immunization can help a patient recover from a disease, but it only has a temporary effect. It doesn't provide any immunological memory like a vaccine would, so the person who received the antibodies wouldn't necessarily be protected against future infections.</p>
<p>Also, there are a lot of other potentially promising uses for passively transferred antibodies aside from infectious disease treatment, such as generating antibodies against cancer cell antigens and injecting the anti-tumor antibodies to deplete a patient's tumor cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here - we do this for several diseases, like tetanus and botulism! It's expensive and only works for the single episode, however, and doesn't &quot;boost&quot; the natural immune system - the antibodies are normally the end product, so the immune system doesn't have any way of copying them to make new ones itself. The effect length varies by antibody type, but maxes out around a few months or so, and mostly are only good for a few days - that's OK if you're just treating one specific episode of a disease, but bad for prophylaxis.</p>
<p>We also sometimes use more of a shotgun approach for some diseases like Kawasaki disease or Guillan Barre syndrome and just slam a whole bunch of filtered antibodies from other people into someone! Pretty cool!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All good answers so far. Another class of diseases for which intravenous antibody administration is sometimes required is primary immunodeficiency, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-linked_agammaglobulinemia" target="_blank">X-linked agammaglobulinemia</a>, in which a person inherits mutations in genes encoding key signaling proteins that relay signals from the B cell receptor to promote activation and differentiation into antibody-producing plasma cells. Since we can't yet edit the mutation(s) out of the patient's genome, they must receive monthly infusions of IgG antibodies for their entire lives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question! Like Etryn mentioned we have the ability to create antibodies and they are used clinically. Some types of cancer respond to antibodies directed against growth factors or their receptors.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetuximab" target="_blank">Cetuximab is an engineered antibody that fits this category</a>. I think your question is more general and the answer lies in the complexity of the immune response. Some of the organisms that cause disease are very stable and thus we are able to develop a vaccine, encourage the body to develop the appropriate antibodies, and provide life long protection from a particular disorder. Other organisms behave much more dynamically and are able to display variations in their structure that makes our previously formed antibodies ineffective in combating a new infection. This line of thinking applies to the Rhinovirus (common cold). </p>
<p>The process of synthetic antibody development is not efficient enough to </p>
<p>1) isolate the Rhinovirus antigens </p>
<p>2) produce a synthetic antibody that is specific for those antigens </p>
<p>By the time that we are able to develop a safe and effective antibody to combat the infection the patient is likely to succumb to the disease. </p>
<p>TLDR: We have developed antibodies to fight many diseases including cancer. Day to day antibody production is currently too complicated and time consuming for it to be effective. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
