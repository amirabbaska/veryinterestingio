		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical student here. The insides of your lungs are coated in a liquid called a surfactant. </p>
<p>This lowers surface tension, making it easier to breathe, and, crucially stops your lungs from collapsing. Specifically, it stops your alveoli, the small little containers for air, from collapsing. </p>
<p>My lecturers tell me that every 100 breaths or so we take a deeper inhalation, which helps mix this surfactant </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical student - We occasionally take deeper than average breaths to ensure all windpipes and alveoli are open fully and to open any closed alveoli. Think of it as almost a mini reboot of the lungs. They are named lung recruitment manoeuvres and can occur for a variety of reasons including as otherwise mentioned high PaCO2. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that it's an autonomic function responding to <em>slightly</em> too much carbon dioxide from just not remembering to breath enough. Your body is trying to maintain equilibrium in your blood via bicarbonate buffer system, and you simply needed to blow off a little extra CO2 to keep things optimally homeostatic. You probably just had slightly too much CO2 built up from not breathing quite deeply or often enough. Could easily happen if you're extremely relaxed or concentrating really hard on something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
