		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some FYI</p>
<p>Japan also uses <del>110V</del> 100V as their standard. I haven't researched the reason but will guess it's something to do with US influence after WWII.</p>
<p>EDIT</p>
<p>Thanks to the responses. </p>
<p>u/Sakuromp corrected me in that Japan uses 100V; not 110V.</p>
<p>u/cmfg provided <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Japan#Transmission" target="_blank">a link</a> which explains the history behind the 50 Hz and 60Hz difference within the country.</p>
<p>u/AppleGel also explains that &quot;the electricity grids in Tokyo and Osaka are both old, it's the same reason as the U.S. Also Tokyo land area uses 50Hz whereas Osaka land area use 60Hz because they bought different systems in the beginning assuming grids would never need to be connected.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, America uses a range of voltages for consumption. 120V is the most common for residential, though most houses also have 240V for larger appliances. 208V and 277V are the norm for commercial, and 480V and above can be found in industrial settings. So the US isn't homogeneously 120V everywhere. I'll return to this in a bit.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's all irrelevant (mostly) for transport costs. This is because the end-user voltage (120 or 240) is only present for like the last 0.5% of the journey from the power station. Prior to that, the electrical power is transmitted at much higher voltages - up to hundreds of kV.</p>
<p>Back to end-user voltages now. For residential (where there exists this US-global disparity), there really isn't a major difference in terms of conservation. The lower voltage requires higher current to drive similar devices, basically double in this case (but it's the same wattage regardless, so energy use is roughly equal). It's the reason commercial users typically need 208 or 277V service, because they have far more wattage on any given circuit (think of the lighting in a typical store compared to a house), so to reduce the current/heat/wire size they want higher voltage. Running larger wires over the longer distances in a store would be very expensive.</p>
<p>However, in a house there isn't much distance from breaker panel to end outlet, and many electricians will just use larger-than-necessary wire sizes (#12 instead of #14 where applicable) to avoid nuisance tripping since the added cost isn't huge for such a small installation. And that's really it: for the small amounts of wire being used on any given house, the added cost of thicker wire isn't significant enough to be a huge issue. If we switched to 240V-all residential service, and shifted wire sizes down one step across the board, you'd be saving like $400/house.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those higher voltages (240V) are a lot more dangerous than 120V. While in a commercial setting you can be fairly sure some dumb kid isn't going to lick a receptacle or an idiot homeowner isn't going to try rewiring everything live, you can't be sure of that in residential. Going with the slightly more expensive but safer 120V makes sense.</p>
<p>Although as others have pointed out, it started as a historical accident, the code could've been changed at any time, as it is almost yearly, yet we've stuck with 120V for residential all the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
