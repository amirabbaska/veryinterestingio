		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A rice cooker isn't necessarily superior, it's just <em>vastly</em> more convenient.  If you eat rice on a regular basis, it's just one less thing to worry about - you can toss your rice in the rice cooker before you start making the meal and <strong>BAM</strong> it's ready to eat when you've finished everything else.</p>
<p>I buy rice by the 25# bag  so I eat a fair bit of it.  A $20 appliance that makes cooking it a zero-thought part of meal prep is a good investment for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The right proportions, the right temperature,  the right pressure, the right time. That's all there is to cooking rice and the rice cooker makes 3/4 of these impossible to miss and usually come with measuring lines or scoops for the last part. You could do it yourself in other ways but you'll likley screw it up on one of them. </p>
<p>If I had a &quot;steak cooker&quot; that resolved 100% of the variables in cooking the perfect steak, I'd never use anything else. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know that they're 'superior' so much as 'convenient'. If you prepare rice on a regular basis, you can simply dump in rice/water, push a button and you don't have to worry about it conflicting with any of your other preparations. Presuming you timed it right, the rice will be ready and hot when the rest of your food is.</p>
<p>Ultimately, cooking rice is about as basic as you get. You take 2:1 water:rice, you boil for the right amount of time and there are you are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most obvious benefit is that it makes it impossible to screw up rice, and frees up an extra burner on your stove top when you're cooking other things. Basically, it makes rice an afterthought, a thing that just gets done while you do other things. You don't have to set a timer, or keep half an eye on your rice, ever again.</p>
<p>But it's a lot more versatile than that. Because it will automatically switch from Cook to Warm when all the water evaporates, anything where you want it to stop cooking and stay warm after it reaches 212Â°F becomes trivial to cook. I've used it for every kind of grain from pearled barley to quinoa, lentils, couscous, polenta, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to go really crazy, you can use it like a slow cooker, get one with a steamer basket and use it to steam vegetables (while your rice is cooking or just to steam the veggies by themselves), make oatmeal, make or reheat soup, or go really nuts and cook things like eggs or cheesecake or banana bread in it. I even used mine as a hacky sous vide cooker a few times before I bought an immersion circulator. It's definitely not a unitasker in my kitchen.</p>
<p>It's also a really simple machine, so even a cheap one will likely work for years. I bought a cheapo rice cooker for like $20 over a decade ago, and it still works perfectly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
