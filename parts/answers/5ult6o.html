<p>Is there a problem with unethical whale watch tours (like boats that get too close to the whales and distress them, that sort of thing)? If I want to go on a whale watch, what kind of things should I look for to make sure the company running it has good practices (or red flags for bad ones)?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Jamison and Ed. Thanks for doing this.</p>
<p>I'd like to talk to you about lobster gear marking.</p>
<p>I own a marine and hardware store in Downeast Maine. Let me say up front that none of the fishermen around here have an issue with protecting the whales in their waters. But I have watched the lobster fishermen struggle to comply with the gear marking rule for two years. The rule requires 3 twelve inch marks (top, middle, bottom) on each buoy line.</p>
<p>The fishermen have tried the following, with varying success: sewing twine into the rope, wrapping/weaving in colored cable ties, using plastic heat shrink electrical tubing, wrapping in electrical tape, soaking in thinned oil-based paint, using spray paint and plastic-bonding spray paint.</p>
<p>The fishermen have the following challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Making marks by hand:
Fishermen take a 600'-1200' coil of float rope--depending on the thickness of the rope--measure out and cut the lengths they need based on where they fish and how many traps they have, and then need to mark each rope three times. That's why a lot of fishermen here went to spraying with or soaking in paint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making marks on different lengths of rope:
Buoy lines vary by the depth of the water, anywhere from 5-120 fathom (30-720 feet). And fishermen move their trawls throughout the season to different depths, so they either have to keep multiple sets of rope and change out their gear each time they move, or have one set of rope marked in more than 3 places so they can lengthen or shorten the rope as needed. (This is a good overview of lobster gear configurations: <a href="http://www.bycatch.org/sites/default/files/Lobster_Gear_Report_0.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.bycatch.org/sites/default/files/Lobster_Gear_Report_0.pdf</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making marks that do not interfere with their haulers:
For those who don't know, the buoy lines are usually pulled up by an electric winch. Surface variations on the rope can put the hauler off balance causing damage to the rotating plates and motor.</p>
</li>
<li>Making the marks permanent:
The hauler puts friction on the rope, eventually rubbing the marker away.</li>
</ol>
<p>So my questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Has NOAA heard any successful techniques from fishermen that I can share with my customers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you clarify what the purpose of the markings are? Folks around here say that it's either so the whales can see the ropes more easily or so NOAA can identify where a rope came from if a whale gets tangled.</p>
</li>
<li>Could NOAA work with rope manufacturers to produce rope that achieves the desired result? For example, if rope was pre-marked every 2 fathom, would it have the same effect?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for your time and keep up the good work!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi guys! Thanks for all that you do for the whales! It inspires those of us interested in conservation to know that there are people like you working hard everyday to keep our whales and our oceans safe.</p>
<p>As an undergrad in marine biology hoping to also work in cetacean rescue and rehabilitation, what career or educational moves can I make to end up in a position similar to yours? Also, what would make a person stand out amongst their peers seeking work in your field, and what certifications or experiences are particularly useful and beneficial to what you do? </p>
<p>Lastly, can you tell us anything about the conservation efforts regarding the vaquita, considering entanglement in gillnets has essentially wiped out their population? Do you think there's any hope of getting a permanent ban on gillnets in the Gulf of California, or stricter punishment for those caught using them? </p>
<p>Thanks so much for doing this AMA! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
