		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, do you know how European cities have these amazing, elaborate tram and subway systems in the first place?<br />
We had the &quot;opportunity&quot; to completely restructre our cities, oh, about 70 odd years ago. Turns out, when pretty much all your city is obliterated after WW2, and you have to rebuild anyways, there is a lot of free space where you can stick those transportation systems.<br />
Basically, you did the demolition for us. All the building and zoneing people had to do was clear the rubble and now we have parks in inner cities, zoos near the city centres, and relatively broad roadways. Plus, the space-consumeing railways.<br />
American cities were, for the most part, never destroyed that completely. You had to integrate public transport into living cities, which is almost impossible to do. Construction takes that much longer and is therefore that much more expensive because you can only do it in increments.<br />
Plus, shutting down certain parts of the city can become nigh-impossible because they are major traffic arteries. And there is the matter of aquiring the property you need to do construction on or underneath. If anyone gets wind of the project the prices are going to rocket sky high.<br />
Plus, what good is it to maintain old tram systems, even when they are profitable, when they're just going to be stuck in the traffic created by the cars? The more cars became prelevant, the less useful the tram becomes. Therefore, you need either subway systems (tunneling) or some sort of monorail / a bridge system to get your tram around.<br />
And those are way more expensive to build than tram systems on the ground. See also: The problem of aquiring the land in a city that is already completely owned by a hundred thousand different people. Even those support beams have to stand on somebody's land.<br />
And every time you attempt to do these project, the prices are going to go up. Plus, no-one is happy to live next to the subway, right? Those property prices are going to plummet because of noise polution. So you always have the big-construction-problem of groups forming to protest your new railway plans. Possibly to the point of stonewaling you and voting you out of office before you can make significant progress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of factors listed here. One in cities like Houston, Texas is that it is massive and spread out. Houston is the 4th most populated city in the US and is a little larger than London at 1630 sq km, but has 25% of the population. People work far from where they live and have to commute all over the city. Light rail trains, buses, and high occupancy vehicle lanes cut down on the amount of vehicles on the road, but some drive distances/locations are not practical without allowing 2+ hours commute each way daily. </p>
<p>Downtown Houston is only about 50 feet above sea level, so underground subway systems are not practical. </p>
<p>Here is a quick guide to why the US sucks at public Transportation. </p>
<p>Largest cities in the world ranked by land area in sqKm                            </p>
<ol>
<li>NY metro                               8683 </li>
<li>Tokyo                                    6993 </li>
<li>Chicago                                5,498</li>
<li>Atlanta                                 5,083</li>
<li>Philadelphia                          4,661</li>
<li>Boston                                 4,497</li>
<li>Los Angeles                        4,320</li>
<li>Dallas/Fort Worth                 3,644</li>
<li>Houston                              3,355</li>
<li>Detroit                              3,267</li>

<li>Miami                               2,891</li>
</ol>
<p>You have to get to 13th to find the 2nd city not in the US.             </p>
<p>We are the 3rd most populated country in the world but the 179th in population density. </p>
<p>TLDR. We are really freaking big and spread out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People use cars for pretty much any journey in the US.  When I went there on business, I was asked by a colleague what I was doing for lunch and I said I'd probably pick up a sandwich from the supermarket which was less than 200 yards away across the office car park.  He asked me how I was getting there and I said walking and he was having none of that insisted on driving me there, all 20 seconds of the journey.  He seemed oblivious to the fact that it might be nice to get some fresh air.</p>
<p>Another day I thought about visiting a store which was about three miles away.  I do a lot of walking/hiking so it's a distance I walk regularly and I figured there'd be a route I could take to it and it would make a nice walk after being sat in an office all day.  Not a chance in hell.  I'd have to take a car to get there because of the road systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>lots</strong> of reasons </p>
<p>The American rail system is focused on shipping freight which it does very well.</p>
<p>Westward expansion took over a century which meant it was difficult to plan where new population centers would be cropping up in relation to the older cities.</p>
<p>Lobbying and scheming by motor companies to make America based around the car, the documentary <em>Taken for a Ride</em> does a good job covering this.</p>
<p>Many states are mostly rural areas which negates the usefulness of light rail somewhat.</p>
<p>And finally I think that many people just prefer the freedom and independence afforded by using automobiles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very large number of American cities were built (or expanded into cities from being towns) after the invention of the Car. As such they were designed for people to use cars to navigate them, not for them to be walked on foot. When most people have and use cars there is very little that you can do to justify spending tax money on a public transit system, and very little motivation for a private company to provide it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
