		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple taxa-dependent strategies social hymenopterans use in response to nest destruction. Many of the highly eusocial taxa engage in a behavior called swarming, whereby a queen and a portion of the colony leave the nest while the remainder stay under a new queen, which is typically a form of colony-level reproduction but the same mechanisms appear to be used in response to the destruction of the nest as well. Though the specifics differ between species, the general pattern is the swarm follows and gathers about the queen who has flown to a place of relative safety, guided by various aggregation pheromones. The swarm then sends out scouts to look for a new place to nest. The scouts return, and the group collectively decides on which of the found nesting sites would be best before taking off as a group and entering the new nest (HÃ¶lldobler &amp; Wilson 2009, Seeley &amp; Buhrman 1999). This is most prominent in genus <em>Apis</em> but does occur across apid and vespid (bees, wasps, hornets, etc) taxa (Smith et al 2002). While there is understandably little literature directly addressing the fate of destroyed honey bee hives as doing so is logistically unfeasible, swarming behavior itself is well-studied and can be easily replicated by caging a queen and dumping workers nearby (eg, Gilbert et al 2011). This effectively mimics the destruction of the nest as the bees are unable to go through the typical pre-swarming procedures for colony-level reproduction in this circumstance, yet is still considered a methodologically-sound analog for the study of nest site selection and swarming. Swarming in wasps is studied/replicated by the outright destruction of the nests (eg, Sonnentag &amp; Jeanne 2009). It is reasonable then to suspect survivors of a destroyed bee hive would behave in much the same way as during swarming, and swarming is suspected to be a derived form of other nest relocation strategies such as migration and absconding (Delaplane 2017).</p>
<p>Many of the more primitively or intermediately eusocial genera such as bumble bees lack swarm-like strategies. In bumblebees, if it was early enough in the season, the gyne (queen) would likely attempt to re-found a new nest on her own as evidenced by the ability to capture these gynes and start new nests for the purposes of study (eg Schmid-Hempel &amp; Schmid-Hemepel 2002). If the destruction was much later in the season, the colony would likely die attempting to rebuild, though I was unable to find any studies addressing bumble bee behavior post nest destruction. In primitively/intermediately eusocial wasps, foundresses of nests that have workers generally attempt to rebuild in the same location as the previous nest or nearby. If the foundress has yet to produce workers, she would attempt to usurp an existing nearby nest by killing the queen &amp; eggs and taking over (Makino 1989).</p>
<p>Ants, the other major eusocial hymenopteran family, have a process of emigration enacted when the nest is destroyed or otherwise becomes compromised (Abraham &amp; Pasteels 1980, Sendova-Franks &amp; Franks 1995). The ants stay near the remains of the nest and use a similar strategy of sending out scouts to find new nest sites before salvaging all they can and carrying the queen to the new site.</p>
<p><strong>So to answer your question: for highly eusocial taxa, they would likely follow the queen to a nearby position of relative cover such as a tree and stay there until a suitable new nesting location was found. Primitively/intermediately social taxa would attempt to rebuild at the same location or nearby,  the reproductive would scout out a new new nest site and restart alone, or the colony would die.</strong></p>
<p>If the queen was killed during the destruction of the nest in honey bees and other taxa in which workers are of a fixed caste and sterile, the workers would likely attempt to drift to a nearby colony and/or simply starve to death. If it was late in the season, the colony would likely be unable to sufficiently rebuild and would die. In more primitively eusocial taxa such as wasps, the (typically) oldest female would supersede and function as the new queen in rebuilding the colony (Strassman &amp; Meyer 1983, Makino 1989). Taxa in which colonies do not overwinter and/or lack supersedure (queen replacement) behaviors would die. Most monogyne (single queen) ant colonies would slowly die out if the queen was killed and the nest destroyed as they also lack supersedure strategies.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The below is about <em>Apis mellifera</em> other species may vary.</p>
<p>First you need to define how the hive is destroyed and what sort of damage is done. </p>
<p>Start with a complete destruction scenario the tree where the hive is cut down and removed. The only remaining bees will be the foragers that were out in the field when the destruction happened. The will return to the hive location find it missing and start to search for it again in a wider and wider area. If there is a spot to land close to the old hive entrance, say a branch from another tree a few feet away they may cluster there The vast majority if not all of these bees will die from exposure/predators in a few days. In the wild hives tend to be quite some distance apart and they will not find another hive to drift to. In an managed apiary they may attempt to enter another nearby hive, and if they are carrying pollen or nectar will be allowed in and join with the new hive.</p>
<p>In a scenario where the hive is wrecked, but the location still exists they will do their best to rebuild. Lets say a beekeeper moves a working hive but leaves an empty box in its place (this is common practice to collect the foragers and reunite them with the hive in a day or so). The returning workers will start to build new comb and continue foraging. They will stop collecting pollen in general however, pollen is only needed for larva and without any larva they will reduce they amount the collect. Nectar, water and resins for propolis production will still be collected.  They will rebuild comb, and store honey. Without a queen present some workers may start to lay eggs. However since those workers are not mated they can only lay unfertilized eggs which only produce drones. Drones don't do any work and do not contribute to the long term viability of the hive. In short order the remaining members will die off. Workers only live about 45 days and foragers will die off from natural causes in short order. As its population declines and it can't defend itself the hive will get robbed out by workers from other hives, pests (Small hive beetles, wax moths) will move in to the hive and destroy what is left.</p>
<p>If the hive is destroyed but the queen is still present, or there is comb left with eggs and larva the hive can recover. In the absence of a queen some larva will be fed a diet different than usual and a new queen will be raised. This takes 16 days from the egg hatching to maturity then a week to get mated than a week to start laying well. Then its another 21 days before her first eggs mature to adults. The population of the hive will decline during this time and the hive may fail, or may not.  The same is true even if the queen is present, she can only lay in already built comb so until they build new comb the population is likely to decline.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event the nesting site is entirely destroyed but the queen is present the workers will cluster around her. They may attempt to find a new home but it is unlikely to happen. Heavy with eggs the queen is not a good flyer. It takes several days to get her in shape to fly well with a swarm and in that time they are likely to build comb, even if its exposed on a tree branch. Once there is comb the queen will start laying again stopping the process of relocation. An exposed hive will likely die of exposure in winter unless its in tropical regions.</p>
