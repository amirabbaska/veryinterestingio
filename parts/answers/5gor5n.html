		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/SpindleSpider spoke of development and reproduction and /u/PM_ME_THIRD_NIPPLES covered the hardware limitations. I would like to add that oxygen is a third limit. A heart and lung combination capable of supporting a large body would require either a much lower metabolism (making it slower or tiring more quickly) or a higher energy input (consuming and processing large amounts of food regularly). There reaches a point where there is simply no evolutionary advantage to go bigger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a wonderful and quite extensive explanation on this and a few other topics regarding <a href="http://fathom.lib.uchicago.edu/2/21701757/" target="_blank">the biology of B-movie-monsters</a><br />
One point written there is the difference between growth of bone strength (goes with radius squared) and mass (goes with volume, that is radius by power three). At some point the mass can't be held by the bones (or similar structures) anymore.<br />
Also: Mammals produce heat. If every cell produces heat, the amount of heat produced goes up with every cell and thus with the volume, and again we're at radius by power three.
The amount of heat a body can give off by radiation, convection or diffusion (the three ways heat can be transfered) is dependend on the outer surface volume or radius by power 2.<br />
Long story short, at some point, the animal would start to burn.  </p>
<p>The same gap between radius by power two and radius by power three is present at other points in a mammal's body, for example the opposite to the 'burn'-problem: Energy uptake. Eating means transferring energy from outside to inside the body through the surface (area! Power two). But every cell in the volume (power three) consumes energy. You might be able to adjust a few variables and build an idealized (hypothetical) animal that is quite large, but at some point the dimensionsal differences present in a lot of bodily processes will draw a line.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yup, there is a maximum size/weight bones, tendons, muscles together can handle. Past that point they'll simply break/not be able to work so its worthless going past that point. </p>
<p>Whales somewhat get around this fight of gravity since they're supported by water hence the blue whale being the largest mammal in existence. </p>
<p>Other constraints would be available food as a larger animal needs more resources to support the metabolism of that larger body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most simply put; yes. There is a trade-off between size, or rather development, and age of reproductive onset because any given animal has a limited amount of energy to use at a time and cannot grow AND work on reproducing at the same time. For example; elephants spend much more time growing and reach sexual maturity later in life, while mice spend less time developing/growing so that they can begin reproducing at a younger age. You also have to consider how many resources are available in that animals habitat and how much of a predation risk there is in that area</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably buried here.. But the Blue Whale is likely the largest a mammal can be. There are a lot of constraints against larger sized organisms in general. </p>
<p>First, surface area supplies the volume. Meaning the volume of the mammal is increasing at a cubed rate, whereas the surface area to supply that volume is only increasing by a squared rate.</p>
<p>Second, bones are only so strong. The weight of a Blue Whale wouldn't be able to be supported on land. Also, the whale's buoyancy requires a lot less metabolic energy to support itself.</p>
<p>Third, what nitche is this organism filling? What is the adaptive benefit  of an organism evolving to such a large size?</p>
<p>By no means is this exhaustive, just a few of the major constraints I can provide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
