		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting question, where there has been some recent development in neuroscience. Contrary to popular belief, <strong>making up for &quot;sleep debt&quot; doesn't really exist</strong>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/12/4418.short" target="_blank">In a 2014 paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience by Dr Jing Zhang</a>, it was shown that in short durations of sleep deprivation, a protective molecule called SirT3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>coordinates mitochondrial energy production and redox homeostasis. We find that brief wakefulness upregulates SirT3 and antioxidants in LCns, protecting metabolic homeostasis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that SirT3 protects your brain from the bad parts of metabolism. &quot;Redox&quot; is short for &quot;reduction oxidation&quot; which means that you are changing the charge on an atom/ion. One of the most common ones that causes damage to the body is reactive oxygen species (ROS). You can think of it like an exhaust pipe in a car. When burning fuel to make the car run, you'll end up producing some unwanted products. Antioxidants are healthy to consume so that you can neutralize these ROS. SirT3 acts in a protective fashion against redox byproducts</p>
<p>For the first time, it was shown that, while SirT3 is able to sufficiently protect the brain after short durations of extended wakefullness (like pulling an all nighter), it is unable to keep up with chronic (many days) of sleep deprivation. There simply isn't enough of it. This causes damage to the neurons, which kill themselves through apoptosis (programed cell death). Neurons (brain cells) are considered to be one of the few areas of the body which cannot regenerate like the other areas (heart and skeletal muscle being the others). </p>
<p>Because the cells started getting damaged permanently, &quot;making up for sleep on the weekend&quot; doesn't help bring back those cells. <strong>This paper is significant because, for the first time, it was shown that sleep deprivation can have permanent negative effects on the brain.</strong> </p>

<p>Edit: added another line</p>
<p>Edit 2: I should also add that my qualifications on this topic are not great. I'm currently in my last year of medical school. I would recommend crossposting to /r/neuroscience or something like that. </p>
<p>Edit 3: removed lines directly related to OP's post, which may contain a question regarding medical advice. Removed as per subreddit rules</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would not phrase it as &quot;permanent&quot; but more like &quot;cumulative&quot;. Chronic sleep deprivation can't be cured by a day or two of extra sleep. It takes your body a significant amount of time to recover. One study has suggested that sleep allows expansion of the ventricles and increased flow of fluid within the brain and what they saw in the fluid suggests this helps to remove debris and other 'gunk' from the brain. So when you're sleep-deprived, you're hindering your brain's ability to perform maintenance.</p>
<p>I would be more concerned about what triggered this seemingly more acute two week period of insomnia, medically. Were you anxious? Did you experience something awful in your life immediately prior? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Curious to see the answers on this thread. As someone who once suffered severe insomnia i'm very curious.</p>
<p>For anyone wondering, I used to go 3-4 days at a time with no sleep and then crash for 5-6 hours. Rinse &amp; Repeat. This cycle lasted almost 3 years. It was terrible and I was completely miserable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd also be interested to know if is there any long term adaptation to chronic sleep restriction? </p>
<p>Of course, mental and physical performance will decline during the first few days of sleep restriction, and eventually stabilize to some minimum. But the key question is: if you sustain this sleep restriction for a longer period of time (months to years), will performance ever increase above this minimum? and by how much? Is it possible to regain baseline performance if you limit sleep restriction to a small level?</p>
<p>Effectively, you would be training your body/mind to work in a sleep deprived state, in the hope of reducing the effects of sleep restriction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It's been slowly going away but lately I've been getting around 5 - 6 hrs of sleep from 2 - 8 am. </p>
<p>I'm also curious if there is any long term negative effects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
