		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you've described is the case, according to the standard big bang model. The (potentially terrifying) thing is that we will never see beyond this 'horizon' because space itself is expanding, meaning that everything beyond that horizon is moving away from us faster than the speed of light. So we will actually only be able to see less in the future. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely correct. There's the visible universe and the observable universe. The visible universe is what we can see, what you described. The observable universe is what we can predict exists based on observable maths, which is something like 90bly. Then there's the hypothesized universe, which exists beyond the horizon of the observable. </p>
<p>EDIT: So it has been a while since I studied astrophysics, and most of my previous statement is incorrect. The observable universe is about 90Bly in diameter, but this is due to the expansion of the universe. So while the light from an object has been traveling for 13.3 billion years, the object is, in reality, approximately 46Bly away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe is constantly expanding. Since light moves at the same speed no matter what point you view it from, we are able to measure lightyears as a constant variable. The distance light travels in a year remains unchanged. Since we have no way of speeding this up, the edge of the observable universe is as far as we can see. These galaxies that are on the edge, since their light has taken many billions of years to reach us, at this moment physically ARE totally different from the way we SEE them. The edge of the observable universe is as far as we can see because the light is billions of years old, and any newer light from further off galaxies wont reach us for quite a while. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>based on my arm-chair understanding of the creation of the universe it's a guarantee. There was a period of expansion that exceeded the speed of light and then it took a really long period of time for light to actually be able to be released. Once that happened, anything that had already gone in the other direction was too far off to ever see again. Basically it was receding from us at a rate that light could never bridge the gap. Now, to temper this, is the idea that the universe is 'bound' and that the light would just come at us from the opposite direction. If we ever get the same light signature from two opposite locations then we'll know the definitive rate of expansion and the actual size of the universe. Right now we're looking for that, but the light is so faded that we're pushing at the limits of detectability already and I don't think anyone believes we're even close. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
