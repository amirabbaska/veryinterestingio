		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some ant species farm aphids (from Wikipedia):</p>
<p>Ant tending aphids</p>
<p>Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants they eat, eating the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship. These dairying ants milk the aphids by stroking them with their antennae.[b][61] Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.[62]</p>
<p>Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus)[63] manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.[61]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read that baboons can adopt dogs. But I am not sure that this is &quot;domestication&quot;. If you go by the definition &quot;the process of taming an animal and keeping it as a pet or on a farm.&quot;, It is domestication.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, because the most important part of domestication is control of breeding. Training a single wolf to be docile isn't a sustainable strategy, you've got to pick the two most docile wolves and breed them together to make an even more docile animal. Repeat a few thousand times and you've got dogs. </p>
<p>This applies to every farm and draft animal we've domesticated - they were selectively bred for traits that humans found desirable in a deliberate process that involved critical thinking, long term planning, and the ability to control the animals being domesticated. </p>
<p>There are animals that have critical thinking and long term planning abilities - crows, whales, pigs, and primates to name a few - but none of them have been seen attempting to interfere in the breeding of other species. </p>
<p>Even the ants/aphids combination seems more like mutualism than true domestication because the ants stumbled onto the arrangement by accident and don't breed the aphids or make incremental improvements in their control and use of them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>yes!  Ants keep aphids, The aphids provide honeydew to ants.  The ants take the aphids ino their nests at night to protect them and then release them back to a plant the next morning to load up with honeydew (using them as livestock like we do cattle, sheep, chickens, etc.)  This is a form of mutualism. (if helps both of them!)   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
