		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ex Intel process engineer here. Because it wouldn't work. Making chips that don't have killer defects takes an insanely finely-tuned process. When you shrink the transistor size (and everything else on the chip), pretty much everything stops working, and you've got to start finding and fixing problems as fast as you can. Shrinks are taken in relatively small steps to minimize the damage. Even as it is, it takes about two years to go from a new process/die shrink to manufacturable yields. In addition, at every step you inject technology changes (new transistor geometry, new materials, new process equipment) and that creates whole new hosts of issues that have to be fixed. The technology to make a 5nm chip reliably function needs to be proven out, understood, and carefully tweaked over time, and that's a slow process. You just can't make it all work if you &quot;shoot the moon&quot; and just go for the smallest transistor size right away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nanotechnologist here!</p>
<p>Because when a transistor is very small, it has a number of side effects like quantum effects and short-channel effects. Also, transistors work by doping semiconductors, if the semiconductor is very small there are very few doping atoms. Also, a small imperfection results in a big effect when we're working in small scales. There are many ways to fix it but it's not evident. This is the tl;dr it's actually a very vast science. You can ask me for specific things or you can google these 3 things: Beyond CMOS, more Moore, more than Moore</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is somewhat similar to asking &quot;if you know how to build a firework rocket, why don't you just scale it up and send it on a Mars mission?&quot; </p>
<p>Changing scales also changes how well (or if at all) different technical solutions work and mess up the tuning of the process you previously had. Taking a technology and just slapping it at a different scale doesn't work, you need to take many small steps and adapt your technology or sometimes even use entirely new technologies to overcome principal problems in order to get there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's hard. </p>
<p>As simplistic as the answer is, there you go. </p>
<p>It's a minor miracle we've gotten down to 14 nm etc in chips now, there issues to solve with crosstalk and other things when you're working on the near molecular level. We're literally coming up to the smallest possible levels physically achievable. </p>
<p>Science is often iterative. You learn something, you improve on it. </p>
<p>Your question is kind of like &quot;when the Wright brothers first flew in their deathtrap biplane, why didn't they next construct the SR-71 Blackbird multiple-supersonic high altitude jet?&quot; Granted, the step from 14 nm to 5 nm isn't quite as drastic, but still. One step at a time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because manufacturers have to keep inventing new ways to print at increasingly-smaller scales. This means <strong>perfecting</strong> new methods and technologies that are capable of printing enough chips that <em>pass</em> quality control that they more than pay for all of the chips that <em>fail</em> quality control. In other words, any process that does NOT produce enough good chips for there to be a net profit is <em>simply not good enough.</em></p>
