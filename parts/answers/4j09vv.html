		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, we still don't fully understand how smell works. Of course, the basic steps of olfaction are easy to sketch out: 1) volatile compounds (odorants) travel from an object to your nose, 2) in your nose these compounds interact with certain receptors and 3) the receptors kick off a long biochemical pathway that ends with your brain detecting the smell.</p>
<p>The first part is relatively straightforward nowadays. We have plenty of sensitive and specific tools to figure out the composition of the chemical compounds that float around &quot;smelly&quot; objects. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry" target="_blank">Mass spectrometry</a> is arguably the most powerful technique we have here, which allows us to rapidly catalogue the presence of hundreds of compounds present in minute (ppm or less) concentrations. </p>
<p>But identifying compounds using analytical techniques is the easy part. Where we lag is in understanding the actual mechanism that allows us to so specifically detect certain compounds or classes of compounds by smell alone. There are two main groups of theories for how smell works qualitatively:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The shape theory. The idea here is that the odorant and receptor fit together like a lock and key. Depending on the flavor of the theory, both the 3D shape of the molecule and/or its chemical structure play a part in this process. The shape theory is currently the most widely accepted theory and it has a lot explanatory power. For example, it also explains why chemically similar molecules often smell similar, e.g. why thiols (things with C-S-H bonds) tend to smell like rotten eggs.</p>
</li>
<li>The vibration theory. Unfortunately the shape theory doesn't explain all observations. For example, in some cases just switching the isotope of an atom in a molecule can produce a different smell (e.g. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055780" target="_blank">see this paper</a>). Since the isotope usually only has a small effect on the shape or chemical reactivity, it's hard to square this effect with the shape theory. However, changing the isotope can produce a much larger change on the <em>vibrations</em> of the molecule. This idea lead a group of researchers, mostly centered around Luca Turin to pitch the vibration theory. This theory claims that it is the vibrations of the odorant that are key to producing a specific interaction with a receptor. </li>
</ol>
<p>As of now, the shape theory still remains dominant and the vibration theory is highly controversial. However, both theories are able to explain specific experimental results that are a bit difficult to fit into the other. Of course, it could very well be that the two theories are complementary. In most cases perhaps it is the shape and chemical structure that determines what receptors will be activated, while for <em>some</em> odorants the vibration can also affect which pathways will kick in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Odor is actually quantifiable, so yes it can be measured. EPA has a standard operating procedure on how to quantify odor and how to report it. It's a secondary regulation, so it won't kill you (questionable imo) but it's there for an ease-of-life kind of thing. There are regulations for aesthetics and such that don't need to be enacted into law such as copper being under 1300ppb or else you'll get stains on your clothes when you wash them or get stains on your tubs/sinks. </p>
<p>Furthermore, you can also do indoor quality air monitoring. You basically set up a whole bunch of tubes around a room and you have a portable instrument that sucks in the air for an extended amount of time (think a week) and then it analyzes the particles (odor) in the air on a chromatogram. So you can get a complete reading of what's in your air and what's making it smell if you wanted- my company actually specializes in that. </p>
<p>It's pretty neat</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I used to do some work in monitoring &quot;Nuisance Odors&quot; which are really difficult to define and prove.  Essentially, you have a machine that you smell through. I shit you not, it's called a <a href="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--SDZqoLYe--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/196cjpa9zxbaapng.png" target="_blank">&quot;Nasal Ranger&quot;</a> and you can't not look like a tool using it.  It routes some air through a carbon filter that removes smells and slowly you ramp up the concentration of &quot;unfiltered air&quot;.  When you first identify an odor, you utilize an odor descriptor to identify if it is capable of being a nuisance.  Then you wait 15 minutes, and if it's still there, the odor meets many of the state definitions of being a nuisance.  </p>
<p>Of course prior to this testing, there is a series of tests on the tester to ensure that their nose is not overly sensitive and too allow for corrections of anything they are particularly good or bad at smelling.  </p>
<p>It's really quite complicated and ineffective but we got paid for it! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>what i've always wanted to know is, how much weight does a smelly object lose by giving off its odors? there's some physical portion of the object that floats away, right? so if you put a block of really smelly cheese (or whatever) on a super-accurate scale, at what kind of rate would the cheese become lighter? like, in terms of % mass per second, would it be like... .01%/s? .00001%/s? .0000000000001%/s?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>some materials (that is, anything you can smell) are volatile enough that little bits of it escape into the air. these molecules are sucked into your nose and contact chemoreceptors, which stimulate a signal to the brain you perceive as smell. In a lot of ways your sense of smell works like your sense of taste, being the specific response to a chemical connecting to a receptor. And in fact those two senses do have a certain amount of interconnection.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there is no qualitative measure of how strongly something smells. That's a pretty subjective thing for a lot of people, especially when it comes to food! Just look at the Durian-- A lot of people thing it smells intensely rancid, many people are utterly unbothered and even find the smell pleasant. </p>
<p>There may, of course, be qualitative measures of the sense of smell. Someone who has researched in this field could give a better answer as to that!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
