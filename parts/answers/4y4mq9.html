If you could &quot;see&quot; it, it would just look like those <a href="http://chemconnections.org/chemlinks/Stars/images/orbitals.jpg" target="_blank">orbital diagrams</a> from your high school chemistry textbook.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="http://pre14.deviantart.net/2c07/th/pre/f/2012/259/3/d/hydrogen_orbitals___poster_by_darksilverflame-d5ev4l6.png" target="_blank">images of orbitals</a> you see in books or online are mapping out the probability of the electron existing in those specific locations. Until you attempt to measure the location of the electron, you can't say anything more about where it is located than that - there is no &quot;hidden variable&quot; that can describe the position more accurately.</p>
<p>However, you can attempt to localize the electron by scattering photons or some other particle off of it. The problem is that this must necessarily add kinetic energy to the electron and ionize it. So you only get one snapshot - there is no way to make a frame by frame movie of the electron. But in theory, a very tightly focused gamma ray beam could be used to localize the electron to within a fraction of the volume of its orbital.</p>
<p>There was a very different <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.213001" target="_blank">experiment by a group in the Netherlands</a> that comes close to taking a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the electron in its orbital around a hydrogen atom (see a write-up about the paper <a href="http://physics.aps.org/articles/v6/58" target="_blank">here</a>). Instead of using short wavelength light to localize the electron like I described above, they barely ionized the electrons with visible photons, then used a DC field and an electrostatic lens to focus those electrons onto a screen. As more electrons are collected on the screen, a pattern emerges corresponding the the wavefunction of the electron at that location. The pattern on the screen ends up displaying the same nodal structure that the orbital had. However, this isn't a direct image of the orbital structure, and when an single electron is recorded on the screen you can't say for sure where in the orbital it came from. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of answers on here from technically accurate experiments. I don't think OP is asking for experimental data, but a question more like &quot;if we were able to...&quot;. I think the answer is, we don't really know. There's a feature of electrons called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">quantum tunneling</a> which allows an electron to go from where we know it's supposed to be, to surpass a seemingly insurmountable barrier and arrive a place where it shouldn't be. There's also the double slit experiment which shows that waves of electrons form a pattern of interference, but the interference still exists even if the electrons are sent through only one electron at a time (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment" target="_blank">here</a>]. So the question, are electrons flowing along a continuous path like a baseball, or are they dodging in and out of existence like Nightcrawler from X-Men? Quantum Mechanics is pointing us at Nightcrawler, but it's just a mathematical model that's been very accurate at prediction. Until we can actually take a &quot;video&quot; of an electron in motion, we'll never know. Here's something fun: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-electron_universe" target="_blank">One Electron Universe</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, you can only get one frame per atom, because taking the picture, no matter which process you use, will kick the electron out of its place. But if you take one picture of each atom and you have a bunch of atoms, you can get a picture looking like an orbital cloud. That is more or less what they do in <a href="http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/photodetachment_microscopy/" target="_blank">this</a> experiment, which I worked on for a brief period long ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the question imports a classical notion of what a hydrogen atom is like (planet and moon orbiting) and tries to preserve that notion in the quantum domain.</p>
<p>So the good news is that I don't think it's correct to think of the electron as randomly teleporting.  The bad news is that we have to drop our model of the atom as two small bodies orbiting each other.  It's actually not the case that there is such a thing as an electron (in the classical conceptualisation of it as a tiny particle) orbiting the hydrogen atom.</p>
<p>We want to think of a &quot;particle&quot; as a thing that exists independently of us.  It has a location, it has various properties etc. and it has these independently of our tools of measurement.  But the maths of QM describes the &quot;entity&quot; in a way that does not translate to observable (or understandable) properties (its wavefunction).  As soon as we start trying to get at observable properties (and I think this is what you were doing with the thought experiment of a frame by frame video), we are &quot;collapsing&quot; the wavefunction using the maths of QM and we get a probability distribution over possible values.  So just to go over that again, you start with the wavefunction, which does not translate to any concept of reality that we can understand, and from that we go immediately to a probability distribution of what results we would obtain if we were to do the measurement a large number of times.  We entirely skip over any story of what is happening to that one single electron we want to zoom in on and get a frame by frame video of.</p>
<p>My understanding is that when QM was first being proposed, many of the early debates and controversies were about just this:  the desire to hold on to the classical concept of what a particle is and what reality is, and that physics is a 1:1 study of the basic building blocks of the universe.  The search for &quot;hidden variables&quot; tried to preserve these notions of there being a real electron there, existing with properties independently of a measurement event (you are trying to do a similar thing with your question - the hidden variables being something to do with how the electron appears to be teleporting).  Instead, QM seems to be saying that there is no real thing as an electron, in the classical sense, until the measurement event interacts with the thing.  What it was like before the measurement event, nobody can say.</p>
<p>The Copenhagen Interpretation of QM, which to my knowledge became the mainstream view, was to, in effect, redefine physics as a mathematical tool with which to predict the results of experiments.  It's no longer a conceptual apparatus describing what the universe is <em>really</em> like.  There's no conceptual model that fits at this stage.</p>
<p>*TLDR:  The questioner's request to slow things down and take a frame-by-frame video of a single electron in orbit is, I argue, an attempt to inject hidden variables that would preserve the classical view of physics.  Unlike classical physics, quantum physics has no conceptual model - it is quite literally not understandable at this time.</p>
<p>See also this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd-tKr0LJTM" target="_blank">great video on hidden variables and Bell's Theorem</a>, which set up an experiment that could be done to test whether hidden variables theory could be true (tests showed hidden variables theory is not true).*</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
