		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Average temperature is correlated with latitude, but it is not directly controlled by it. See <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Annual_Average_Temperature_Map.png" target="_blank">this map</a> of average temperature across the globe.</p>
<p>How hot and cold air are able to move across land matters a lot. So things like plains and mountains change where the air can go. Ocean temperature also matters, and similar to the air, there are currents and parts of the ocean are warmer or colder because of those currents than you would expect just based on latitude alone. Here's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature#/media/File:SST_20131220_blended_Global.png" target="_blank">a map</a> of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Greenland has a mountain range on its east coast which is much higher than any of the other mountains in the Canadian Arctic region, allowing glaciers to form. The ice sheet is self-sustaining in a way, since the large amount of ice raises the surface elevation out of the zone that gets above freezing in summer. This is actually the biggest factor for why the ice sheet covers the entire island.</p>
<p>It's also because of its much more maritime climate causing the summers to be even colder than they are at other areas at a similar latitude. The maritime climate happens in Greenland but not in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago because warm air from the south in summer can reach it across the short inlets and straits but can't reach Greenland from any direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of it is down to winds and ocean streams. For instance: Toronto is a little more south than Berlin (Germany), yet toronto has much more severe winters and is a little cooler (temperature wise) than Berlin. This is because we have the east blowing jetstreams and the golfstream right to the west of Europe. The golfstream bringing all the warm water to us helps to heat up (and moisten) the air. (the moisture part is the reason the British Isles and Ireland get significantly more rain. The jetstream then blows the warmer air towards the west and north giving us the for this latitude unusual mild climate we have. Because the British Isles are, in fact, so close to the golfstream their winters are even milder than in main land Europe resulting in good conditions even palmtrees and other rather tropical plants to grow quite well.</p>
<p>Also: a large area of ice, once formed, reflects the light of the sun back into space quite well which results in a lot less energy being stored in the ground and given back to the air which helps cooling these spots down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One factor is that there are giant circular ocean currents called gyres, which go clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. The Gyre in the North Atlantic going clockwise means it brings warm water up from the equator towards North America through the gulf stream. This water cools as it travels further North, yet still transfers heat to the coast. By the time it hits greenland, it has been completely cooled and is going south/east instead of north, bringing colder water from the north towards the coast. Edit: this is a pretty simplified explanation and isnt entirely accurate, I thought the gyre directly brings cold air to Greenland in a big circle, but instead it splits into two currents when it approaches europe, the northern current then loops around in the opposite direction and brings cold water to the other side of Greenland. <a href="https://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Eduspace_Weather_EN/SEM1HYK1YHH_1.html#subhead1" target="_blank">https://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Eduspace_Weather_EN/SEM1HYK1YHH_1.html#subhead1</a> The diagram on this site makes it a lot easier to visualize </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Greenland is mountainous while the Canadian north is not other than in the east. Greenland glaciers originate in the interior, and are hemmed in by mountains. Canada's northern archipelago is mountainous only on the narrow Baffin Island, right next to Greenland. Due to those mountains Baffin Island <a href="http://www.grida.no/resources/4480" target="_blank">does have glaciers</a>. The other islands are low lying and so don't form glaciers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
