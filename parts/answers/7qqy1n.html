		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>The brain/nervous system operates mostly <em>chemically,</em> with electricity being used as a bridge between chemical reaction sites. So it's much less susceptible to this interference than a purely electrical device.</li>
<li>The amount of interference absorbed is low -- notice that your computer and phone, which <em>are</em> electrical, are not being disrupted either.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1wgypf/eli5_if_our_brain_works_with_electrical_pulses/" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An EMP (<strong>edit:</strong> electromagnetic pulse <strong>/edit</strong>) knocks out electronics because of something called &quot;inductance.&quot; When there are magnetic fields in motion near a conductor (like a wire), electrical currents get induced in the conductor.</p>
<p>An EMP is, roughly, a huge electromagnetic field ripping by, so it induces huge currents in any unshielded electronics and blows them up because the device can't handle those loads.</p>
<p>Our brains don't have wires in them, though. Nerve signals are carried by neurons, which are specialized cells. An electrical pulse travels from one end of the neuron to the other, but the signal is carried chemically from each neuron to the next. So, it's not like there's an uninterrupted electrical current going from one part of the brain to the other: it's really mostly chemical signals.</p>
<p>Neurons are very short and frankly not that conductive, so they don't pick up any induced currents from the EMP.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our nervous system does not operate 'electrically' in the same way that an electrical circuit does.  </p>
<p>Our nerve cells operate on the flow of positively charged ions across an electrical gradient.  Compared to electrons these ions are large, bulky and slow and are much more influenced by the relatively large electrical potentials generated by nerve cells.  Thus an external EM field cannot induce a current in our nerves because we do not have electrons in a conductor to influence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
