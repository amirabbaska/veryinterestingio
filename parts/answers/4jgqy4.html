<p>relephant edit: in brown dwarves you can still have deuterium fusion, but not hydrogen fusion, and it's debatable whether these are stars are not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take into account hypothetical Black Dwarves too. After a low mass star novas into a planetary nebula the white dwarf will be left behind. The dwarf is still hot and thus glows white. However, it  is very small and dense. After hundreds of billions or trillions of years the white dwarf will cool and become a black dwarf. Having close to 0 K surface temperature. This is hypothetical though as the theorized age the our universe is no where near the needed age. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(The first two paragraphs I detailed what absolute 0 is. If you have a firm grasp, then TL;DR skip them.)</p>
<p>Ok, so the deal with temperature is, it describes how energy is distributed in a system. In the most entropic state (thermal equilibrium, where something is of uniform temperature) the energy of single units (like atoms in a gas) is very well described. (Depending on what the underlying system is. For example, the ideal gas with the very common equation of state PV=NkT is modeled as each atom/molecule is distinct and don't interact with each other. A fermi gas is where particles cannot share the same state [can't be at the same position and have the same momentum] and that is very well known as well) When I say energy distribution, it goes like this; lets say that you managed to isolate one gas molecule in the air around you that is room temperature (24 celcius) Then I can tell you what is the probability of that particle having a speed v (speed translates directly to kinetic energy in this case) when you pick it. The probabilities are a predictable function of temperature.</p>
<p>It turns out that, for an ideal gas (and most other situations) if the energy that a particle can have is unbounded from above; (meaning you can have a particle with arbitrarily high energy. Since we are talking about classical mechanics, the energy is unbounded; you can always think of a faster speed that results in higher energy from the formula mv^2 /2.) then having negative temperature makes no sense. It basically tells you a higher energy state is always more probable than a lower energy state. (Which is pretty easy to argue that makes no sense. All your probabilities should add up to 1 to be a probability. If every number is larger than the preceding one; then there is no way they are going to sum up to 1) This puts a natural lower bound on what temperature you can ever expect from the system. A temperature below that is unattainable as it makes no sense. (Do note that if you have exotic systems, it is very possible to have it. For example, lasers confine the particles into two of infinitely available energy levels. Although the process of laser actually prepares the system in a non-maximally-entropic state so conventional thermodynamics don't work very well; but you can model it to have only two energy levels and the equations work pretty well. In this consideration, negative temperature is induced and then whoosh comes out the shining beam of monochromatic light. Everything is fine, since you limit your energy level from above, as in you can't go higher than the second state in this restriction.)</p>
<p>And that answers the question, yes the limit is absolute zero. But that is not the limit limit. The limit is 2.7 K (2.7 degrees higher than absolute zero) for the time being. The reason is, the universe has a background radiation that is this temperature. (You can look up Cosmic Background Radiation) It is much like everything in the universe is as if in a pool of water of some temperature, so no matter what it is; hotter or cooler; eventually reaches this temperature. </p>
<p>However, the lower limit approaches absolute zero, but never reaches it. The reason being is that this temperature drops over time as long as the universe is expanding. (For some time before, the temperature corresponded to the temperature of hot iron rods; thus the sky would not look black but white, then yellow, then red. Then as it cooled down, the universe became black to our eyes) Continuing the analogy, the pools temperature decreases over time. If you consider the fact that current expansion trend is exponential, some time in the nearby (in the cosmic sense) future, the lower limit temperature will approach 0 K. (but never will actually reach it)</p>
<p>Hoewever, we don't know any star remnant at this temperature. Dwarfs can only lose energy through radiating due to being very compact objects; and radiative heat loss is very slow. I calculated it once (it is not difficult to do; the total power radiated from an ideal black body is proportional to T^4 ) and the rate of temperature drop becomes extremely slow as you cool down. So it takes a very long time to cool completely to the limit temperature. I think a fresh white dwarf needs many orders of magnitude higher than the current lifetime of the universe (14 bn yrs) to fully cool down under current conditions, but take that with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Also, we can't see these objects as once they cool down, they radiate much less. (Cooling down to half the original temperature in kelvin reduces the cooling rate by 16) And we can only see bright objects. White dwarfs are faint enough to begin with. So we haven't seen any super cool dwarfs. I remember that they did fond a brown dwarf nearby, (~10 lyrs away or so) and they can barely see that one. Gravitational techniques would not really help, since the precision to resolve them from small black holes with no accreation would be extremely difficult.</p>
<p>To answer your second question, no there is no limit to how hot can something be. It does take much more energy to get something a bit hotter the more hot it is though, so there are practical limits on how hot we can get things. But there is another issue. As things get hotter and hotter, they start exhibiting different behaviours. You are familiar with the three; solids liquids and gasses. Scientists have discovered a plethora of other exotic phases of stuff; like plasma, bose-einstein condensation, quark-gluon plasma etc. all having to do with reaching temperature (And pressure) profiles where physics that usually don't come into play in our daily life description of things (quantum and relativity) start becoming dominant. We are not sure what some extremely high temperature things are. (In our 3 phases, matter is in atoms/molecules. But in plasma for example, the energy is so high that the electron-sticking-to-protons-energy becomes very insignificant, and things are just like a mixed gas of electrons and nuclei; which are bound protons and neutrons.) So the answer is, no absolute limit but we don't know what stuff becomes once they get hotter beyond a certain point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A star has to be hot enough to sustain fusion* - any colder and they're no longer stars.  So the coldest stars out there are quite cold relative to the sun's surface temperature of 6,000 Kelvin - but they're still over 2,000 Kelvin themselves.</p>
<p>As discussed elsewhere in this thread, theoretical highly-metallic stars (which might occur once the universe is much older) could sustain fusion at a much, much lower temperature (even below 0 Celsius).</p>
<hr />
<p>* Dwarf stars (white, black, brown) and neutron stars are stellar remnants, not stars (like how starfish and jellyfish aren't fish, hence technically being called sea stars and jellies).  I'll certainly grant that the jargon is horribly jumbled - I wish the astronomical community would eject all the current terminology and come up with systems that make sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends what cold is for you. There is no temperature under which it can be said that something is cold or not, it's rather subjective. For example, a G-type star, like the Sun, is around 5,000 to 6,000 K, which is pretty cold compared to a blue star (O-type), which usually measures between 30,000 to 60,000 K. That's a difference of at least 24,000 degrees centigrades, much more than what you feel is cold when it's -10 °C outside (a difference of about 47,5 degrees with your body). The coldest stars are red dwarfs, at under 3,500 K.</p>
