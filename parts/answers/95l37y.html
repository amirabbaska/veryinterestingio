		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Russell's teapot is an analogy that shows that burden of proof lies with whoever makes the unfalsifiable claim. If someone was to claim that there was a teapot orbiting the sun between the earth and Mars, then the burden of proof lies with them, because it is impossible to prove that there isn't said teapot.</p>
<p>It's often used as an argument against religion or more accurately against the notion that religion must be disproven. Since it is impossible to disprove a god, the burden of proof lies with whoever is claiming God exist.</p>
<p>Tl;dr if someone ask you to prove something happened, and your argument is &quot;prove it didn't&quot; then your argument is probably bad.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an infinite number of things that <em>could</em> be true. </p>
<p>The Men In Black <em>could</em> exist, just neuralizing everyone that comes across hard evidence (so the lack of evidence isn't surprising), and using advanced alien tech to conceal themselves. </p>
<p>We all <em>could</em> be in the Matrix, with every experience we have being nothing but a simulation. </p>
<p>There <em>could</em> be an invisible weightless monkey sitting on your shoulder all the time, except for when you go to feel for him. </p>
<p>There <em>could</em> be a celestial teapot out there, and all the lack of photographic evidence can just be chalked up to insufficiently powerful telescopes. You can't guarantee you've looked in every single spot, or that you would have seen it if you did.</p>
<p>There's no way to disprove any of these things, since the excuses are baked right in. </p>
<p>But without a really strong evidence <em>for</em> them, you'd be an idiot to believe any of them. Or if you do pick one of them to believe anyway, you've got no basis for rejecting any of the others. </p>
<p>It's not my job to prove that the Men In Black aren't real, since doing so is put on a shelf that's deliberately out of reach. </p>
<p>Instead, it's the job of the person that wants me to believe it that the Men In Black really <em>do</em> exist - and until then, I'm under no obligation to take the idea seriously. </p>
<p>The core idea is <em>falsifiability</em>. If you can't come up with a test that, if failed, could prove the assertion false... then you shouldn't believe it without <em>positive</em> evidence.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your friend tells you that they've discovered a new Pokemon, you'd ask them to show you, right?</p>
<p>What if they told you that this Pokemon was so small, you couldn't actually see it in the game?  You might ask them how they know it's there, then. You want them to show you.</p>
<p>Your friend could say, &quot;how do you know it's <em>not</em> there? I won't show you, you show me that it's not there.&quot; </p>
<p>Would you bet your lunch money on it being there or not?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the foundational principle of the scientific method is that predictions must be falsifiable. </p>
<p>You can pose any hypothesis you want that you think explains the world, but unless it can be tested, it's more or less worthless.</p>
<p>Russell thought that if you make a statement that is not falsifiable, it is on you to demonstrate its truth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s just a way of formalizing the idea that the burden of proof lies on the person making an assertion, particularly an assertion not easily proven wrong, not on others to refute it - and, as a sort of side issue, it implies that the more outlandish a claim is, the more certain it is that that’s the appropriate place for the burden.  </p>
<p>If I claim there’s a teapot in orbit around the sun, the burden isn’t on you to prove there isn’t one. That would be ridiculous - you’d have to monitor every single bit of space around the sun. Instead, the burden is on me to show there is a teapot there. </p>
<p>If I claim, on the other hand, that an object dropped close to the surface of the earth accelerates at roughly 9.8 meters per second per second, minus whatever relevant drag force, well, that’s easily falsifiable - either one of us can easily do an experiment. </p>
<p>It kind of ties in nicely with the whole orders of magnitude required to refute bullshit assymetry thing in my mind - claims should be easily falsifiable, pretty much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
