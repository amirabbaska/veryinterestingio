		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The movie ratings organizations used to have an &quot;X&quot; rating for movies that were above and beyond &quot;R&quot; rated.</p>
<p>IIRC, this has since been changed to NC17.</p>
<p>Because X rated was associated with explicit scenes (though this included violence, not just nudity), it became a positive marketing point for pornografic films, who were specifically targetting an audience <em>seeking</em> explicit content. XXX was to denote even more explicit content than just &quot;X&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read that they used to censor covers of porn mags with X over the nipples, butts, vaginas... So, boob only cover would have XX on the nipples, while full frontal nudity provides XXX censorship. Surely, pictures with full nudity are more desirable, so the XXX mark cought on. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have always had the suspicsion that the city of Amsterdams crest had something to do with it.</p>
<p>EDIT- sorry i should have elaborated a bit. The crest dates back a long a time and Amsterdams sex, drug and drink industry goes just as far. </p>
<p>This explains the old bottles with it on and why its almost always been associated with forms of tabboo</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
