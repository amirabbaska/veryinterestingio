		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, proteins are broken down for the most part, but hormones are not proteins. At least not necessarily. The hormones in question belong to a family of hormones called steroid hormones, which are small organic molecules. They are not easily gotten rid of unless there's a high level of biochemical degradation, so hormones in tissues, food, drinks, etc. have a relatively long half life, since they are really stable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This really depends on the specific agent being used. &quot;Hormones&quot; like IGF-1 and growth hormone that are consumed don't really have any direct impact on people because they get broken down. These are peptides.     </p>
<p>There are absorbable forms of steroid hormones that behave differently in the body and do cause near-direct action (like testosterone undecanoate). These hormones are lipophilic and not subject to protease action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your topic with certainty as I haven't looked into hormones being synthetically injected into animals and whether there is an effect on humans. However, I know a few things and so I will discuss some possibilities.</p>
<p>About absorption of nutrients by the small intestine cells (enterocytes)... Basically, there's some proteases (pepsinogen--&gt;pepsin) that are released due to the stimulus of food entering the stomach. Protein breakdown begins and when the food (bolus) enters the small intestine there are more enzymes released for the rest of the macronutrients (lipids and carbohydrates and more for proteins such as trypsinogen---&gt;trypsin) which break down these molecules further. </p>
<p>I will use sugar as an example to illustrate specificity of channel absorption. There are different kinds of disaccaride sugars such as maltose, sucrose, and lactose. Each has been broken down from its polysaccharide carbohydrate form into each respective dissacaride listed. (Maltose = glucose + glucose) (sucrose = glucose + fructose) (lactose = glucose + galactose) I will use lactose as an example since you are asking about milk. Some people have a gene that codes for the enzyme lactase which breaks lactose into its 2 monomers, glucose and galactose. If you don't have enough lactase then you will be unable to digest large amounts of lactose. If you don't have any lactase then you can't digest lactose at all. There are specific channels that allow for glucose to pass through (Glut2) into the cell and there is another channel that allows for galactose to be absorbed (can't remember the channel). (Side note: sometimes molecules need to be cotransported with another such as chloride, potassium, H+, etc.)</p>
<p>If there is a mutation in a person's genome then they may not be able to absorb certain molecules at all or to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>As far as ingestion of hormones, there are spaces in between enterocytes (cells lining the small intestine) in the small intestine called tight junctions which let water pass freely with concentration gradients and also allow passing of molecules less than 1000MW (molecular weight). Some hormone may be digestible if they are protein or peptide hormones as protease enzymes may be able to break them down. This depends on whether or not the substrate (peptide hormone) fits into the binding site on the enzyme. If it doesn't fit then it may not be broken down. If they aren't broken down then I suppose it is plausible that they could slip through the tight junction and into the enterocytes and from there they may be absorbed into the blood stream. Otherwise they could simply be excreted as waste.</p>
<p>Steroid hormones are usually small and flat and so I would also speculate that due to the fact that they can slide through 6nm cellular membranes, it is possible/likely that they can be absorbed directly from ingestion. </p>
<p>Hormones are highly specific to the receptor in which they bind. It could be that the hormones given to animals will not bind to human receptors at all. Although, it depends on what hormone it is. If there is no receptor for the hormone, then it will have no effect.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider, (probably the most important), would be that the hormone concentration dictates the response. If there is not a lot of hormone, then there will still be no observed response. So a question I would like to know the answer to is: what concentrations of which specific hormones are present in particular types of meat and from which manufacturors?</p>
<p>On top of all of this, growth hormone and IGF-1 (insulin like growth factor 1) have very slow effects on the body. They don't work like epinephrine in which you are almost instantly in a state of heightened arousal with increased heart rate and muscle tone. GH and IGF-1 won't be noticeable at all after ingestion and even then, you would need to ingest lots and lots of these hormones over a long period of time to have any noticeable change in your body. </p>
<p>What change would be noticed? Well, GH increases mobilization of lipids from adipocytes and increases muscle protein synthesis in muscle. GH essentially makes you leaner and aids in cellular repair especially the muscles after a workout. Your body produces GH during and after exercise in response to the stress you induce on your body in order to repair and rebuild damaged muscle fibers. Unfortunately, I can not tell you what happens when you inject/injest GH in a sedentary state as I only have learned it's role related to exercise.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much every protein we ingest gets broken down into amino acids, which are the same for every protein regardless of its origin, which is why anyone who tells you that meat and plant proteins are different on a nutritional level is full of crap. As for the thing about hormones, it comes down to the fact that not all hormones are proteins. Hormones that are proteins get broken down during digestion, but steroid hormones do not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
