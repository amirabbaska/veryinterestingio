		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an organizational choice they make. Their company has different set of inventory, shipping logistics, payment processors, and other logistics separated by region. They decided to divide their company traffic up among different domains to help group the regional logistics systems better. </p>
<p>Another reason could be corporate structure. They could have a Canadian corporation that operates the Canadian store and keeps its profits in Canada for tax reasons. </p>
<p>There is nothing about domains that prevents them from operating their site under 1 domain for the entire world. However, a company that large has many benefits to dividing the traffic under different regional umbrellas. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessarily going to be a different set of servers; you can point multiple domains at the same servers and figure it out later.</p>
<p>A big part of it is culture though. In many countries, using your country domain is standard, and .com is unusual/reserved for multinationals, so using a country specific donation can make it feel more local and comfortable even if it's serving the exact same thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons. Language is one reason. Another reason is the content presented in searches. Content may vary depending on your country's domain. These sites track your location, so it will still present relevant content to what you are searching for, and probably won't change that much, but there are slight variations. Additionally, these servers in other countries are hosted in those countries. The top level domains (.com, .net, etc) as well as IP address issuance are managed by ICANN. In a similar way that all home addresses in the world will vary, as do internet IP addresses and top level domains. Finally they will provide less latency to those in said countries. Try pinging google servers around the world, the fastest will be in your home country. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for amazon, and .ca .de etc are all their own standalone sites. A lot of it has to do with the prime benefits and different rules/regulations for that specific country. The products sold on each domain come from that country as well. Your search results for .ca and .com will be completely different. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
