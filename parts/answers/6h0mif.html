		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way the new ad system works is, a person at YouTubereviews the video some time after upload and detirmines its &quot;friendliness&quot; and how suitable it is for advertisers, so they can be safe the video isn't showing on innapropriate content. The issue is, people have found that saying the word &quot;fuck&quot; once, or talking about sensitive topics once throughout a video, gets them not demonetised, but &quot;unsafe&quot;. What this means is that the YouTuber is not told why they lost monitisation, and even when they lose monetisation. The majority of larger Youtubers who are vocal about this issue often create &quot;questionable content&quot; and as such do not loose all income, but earn sometimes 100x less. This all began when The Wall Street Journal reported that ads were showing on white supremacist's videos(which turned out to be false) and advertisers became scared of a backlash from this and pulled their ads from youtube. YouTube has really been trying to recover :/

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Professional YouTuber's earn money from Ad's which are supplied by YouTube. </p>
<p>Ad's were showing up on videos containing hate speech.</p>
<p>Advertisers pulled $1.4 billion of funding from Google.</p>
<p>Google owns YouTube. </p>
<p>Google has $1.4 billion less to pay professional YouTuber's.</p>
<p>Google enacted strict and incredibly restrictive content classifications on what now counts as advertiser friendly content. </p>
<p>Many professional YouTuber's now fall outside those guidelines so they cannot monetize their videos, meaning they can no longer afford to create content.</p>
<p>Those who do fall under the umbrella of advertiser friendly content are now seeing 1/5th of the money they did before advertisers backed away from google en mass. This means channels that employed multiple people to upload daily content can no longer afford to do so. </p>
<p>YouTube is no longer a source of sustainable income, meaning we have less quality content and less active YouTubers. </p>
<p>Freedom of speech and the pursuit of happiness dies. </p>
<p>Everyone suffers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of companies were not liking their ads being attributed to very controversial topics. Such as violence, sex, drugs... so on.</p>
<p>So they decided to boycott Youtube of all ads until they provided a more robust way of the companies to decide what kind of content they would have their ads put on.</p>
<p>The result was that when a business buys ad space on youtube now, they have a bunch of criteria boxes they can tick or leave empty, signifying what they are okay with and not. </p>
<p>Meaning the business has more power over the kind of exposure they are having.</p>
<p>There is also a &quot;demonetising&quot; process. Where and by if a video gets a significant number of views and reports for being controversial, it can have an amber dollar sign placed on the uploaders view of the video. Showing that no ad money can be earned on it. Unfortunately there isn't much explanation given with this, and so they are left in a guessing game as to what made them &quot;ad-hostile&quot; many people like Philip Defranco have spoke out about this and complained to Youtube, with Phil explaining he's just giving the news, he's specifically trying to facilitate a discussion, asking his channel to explain their thoughts in the comment section. </p>
<p>When he was told that the reason for one of his recent videos was demonetised because it spoke about the recent London Bridge attack, he pointed out the hypocrisy that established media channels like BBC had videos showing the graphic pictures (which he didn't) and yet they were showing ads before the clip. Asking why that channel can upload and monotize content, that he couldn't. Personally I think it's because those other videos didn't have anywhere near his exposure, so less reports. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what everyone else has been saying, it isn't just &quot;violent&quot; content they are demonetizing-- It's even basic news content that happens to be <em>about</em> violence. Like, if you're a news-based channel like Phillip DeFranco, and you report on a terror attack, that's enough to get demonitized. A sterile, opinion-less news report. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
