		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually hare is why:
The old rotary dial phones used to actually send the dialing sequence by a series of pulses that are generated when the dial RETURNS TO POSITION known as back spin. </p>
<p>Because the backspin actually dialed the number, the switching equipment was sitting idle waiting for that back spin.
Back then the the way the system worked was that the SECOND  number you dialed told the equipment whether it was a local or long distance call</p>
<p>If the SECOND number was a 1 or 0 the system read it as a long distance call Otherwise it saw local call. </p>
<p>So as a result all area codes at the time had to have the second digit being a 1 or a 0. </p>
<p>Only once those numbers started to run out in the 1990s the new all digital system was put into place and  we could have area codes like 757 242 434 540 etc.It also opened up things like 303 and 314 to be local numbers not possible before.</p>
<p>In order to manage the long distance switching equipment and get it operating as efficiently as possible the Bell System did some research when the system for dialing your own long distance calls was being designed they tried to figure out which parts of the country would make the most and the least long distance calls.</p>
<p>The places that were determined to likely get  the most long distance calls were given the area codes that would have the shortest &quot;back spin&quot; times and therefor kept the equipment sitting idle as short a time as possible</p>
<p>As a result NYC got 212 which generated the shortest back spin time possible 213 was still very good so LA got that one sticking San Diego with 609.</p>
<p>The entire state of Hawaii has 808  before it even had statehood</p>
<p>North Carolina  at the time was 919 Virginia 703 etc </p>
<p>But they didn't get that many long distance calls</p>
<p>So that's the reason.</p>
<p>I am not at all convinced that the Bell System was even capable of allowing anything to happen totally at random. It was not their culture at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When they initially set up North American area codes in the 1940's, there were a couple of considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>states with just one area code got one with a zero as the middle digit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>states with multiple area codes got ones with a one as the middle digit</p>
</li>
<li>because of rotary dialing, areas with lots of numbers (NY, LA) got area codes that were shorter to dial</li>
</ul>
<p>As an old guy, I can attest to the last one -- if you had a phone number with a lot of 7's, 8's, 9's, or 0's, it took a <em>long</em> time to dial your number. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is nothing tying area code to geography like zip codes -- the biggest cities got low numbers when they were rolled out because the original rotary phones made clicks/pulses for each digit and the clicks for 212 was 5 clicks, and 949 is 22 clicks. In addition to ones listed above, Chicago was 312, DC was 202.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure I remember seeing something on TV about how it started with the telephone companies. Bigger, established cities were the first to receive lines and the numbers were lower because of the rotary phones they used</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
