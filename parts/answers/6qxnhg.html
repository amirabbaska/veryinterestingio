		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even &quot;high density&quot; areas of space are very low density. There's no way it would be enough to noticeably affect our temperature or environment. Also keep in mind that these &quot;dust&quot; particles are much less massive than the dust we're used to - I think most of them have less than a thousand atoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suppose our solar system could indeed move into a large area of dust. However even the most dense nebulae are still not particularly dense with particle densities of at max <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast162_3/notes11.html" target="_blank">10^(4) particles per cubic centimeter</a>. Compare that to the 10^(19) particles per cubic centimeter that the air we breathe consists of. Now I don't know if that would actually burn up our atmosphere, i don't think so, but I can't tell you with certainty. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
