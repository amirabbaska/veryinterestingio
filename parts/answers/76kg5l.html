		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if you're not swishing it around in your mouth, it's still going to touch your teeth at some point. If you don't drink soda or any carbonated drinks very often, then this boasts no problem to your dental hygiene. However, if you're drinking carbonated beverages every day, then you could see a problem start to develop. </p>
<p>The way this works is through a chemical reaction between carbon dioxide and saliva. When these two reactants meet, they form carbonic acid, which brings the pH level in your mouth down. This means your mouth is now more acidic than it is basic. The extra acidity begins erosion of enamel, which is the part of your tooth that protects the dentin from bacteria &amp; what not. </p>
<p>Edit: So obviously any kind of soda is going to be worse for your teeth than just straight up carbonated water. OP had just asked about &quot;fizzy drinks&quot;, so I assumed he/she was concerned about the fizz aspect and not the sugar or anything of that nature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This calls to mind a tidbit I read about phosphoric acid, an additive in dark colored soft drinks. I got the impression then that the above actually leeched calcium from your bones and teeth, but I just googled it and learned that an excess of phosphorus can instead lead to a decrease of calcium and the diseases associated with it. Also that the carbonation itself isn't the cause. Here is an article on too much phosphoric acid and its effects on bone health; more on Google if you're interested: <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/is-phosphoric-acid-bad-for-me#6" target="_blank">https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/is-phosphoric-acid-bad-for-me#6</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off its going to touch your teeth, basically no way to avoid it.</p>
<p>Second when you drink it you're upsetting the pH balance of your body and to even it out your body has to demineralize bone to bring it back to neutral, that includes your teeth (but this effect is much less pronounced than the direct effect the acid and sugars have in your mouth)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sugar in the drink feeds the bacteria in your mouth, the final waste that the bacteria break the sugar down into is an acid which sits on your teeth, always brush with toothpaste as the flouride bonds with your teeth to form an flouride enamel compound which i firget the name of but is stronger than just enamel</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fizzy drinks are not harmful because they are fizzy. They have stronger acid than carbonic acid in them and they have sugar.</p>
<p>There was a scientist that uses IV to inject sugar into animals therefore bypassing the mouth completely and the animals still has tooth problems.</p>
<p>Sugar does damage to gums and teeth from the inside out even if it does not touch the outside of your teeth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
