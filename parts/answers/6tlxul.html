		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ran the observatory at Cornell many years ago.  Went to the engineering department to ask them to reverse thread the eye piece so I could screw in my camera to the telescope.  I took some great pictures of various items and posted them around the astronomy department.  </p>
<p>My question: Is the observatory still there and being used?</p>
<p>Thanks!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
