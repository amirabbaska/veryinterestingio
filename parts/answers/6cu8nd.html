		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there. All paranasal sinus cavities are continuous with the outside world <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranasal_sinuses" target="_blank">(via ostia)</a> and should not hold pressure unless in a pathological state (sinus infection, tumor growth, sinusitus, etc).</p>
<p>Animals also have paranasal sinuses, and in some species they are very large and elaborate. <a href="http://d1uhp0uy75me04.cloudfront.net/31/37b240309c11e0996a0050568d634f/file/PV_0211_waguespack_f1.png" target="_blank">This picture</a> gives a good representation of horse sinuses, and <a href="http://fce-study.netdna-ssl.com/images/upload-flashcards/back/3/4/32743957_m.jpg" target="_blank">this one</a> describes how a bull's horns actually contain extensions of the caudal frontal sinuses within them (so, theoretically, a bug could fly into a bull's nose all the way up into its horn).</p>
