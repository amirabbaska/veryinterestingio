		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do the same thing, so I got curious about the exact numbers. Fortunately some researchers actually looked at this question systematically in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0963996996000385" target="_blank">this paper</a>. The key result is summarized in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WGSg1Fc.png" target="_blank">this table</a>, where they looked at the fraction of caffeine extracted after different types of tea were steeped for 5 minutes in boiling water three times in a row. The results show some variation from one tea to another, but on average close to 70% of the caffeine was extracted in the first steep and less than 25% on the second steep. </p>
<p>As expected, bag tea is especially quick to lose its caffeine since its leaves have been smashed apart, giving them a larger surface area. For your purpose this type of tea would be the best candidate. For example for Lipton black tea, only 18% of the caffeine was extracted on the second steep. On the other hand, if you ever want go get more caffeine out of the second or third steep, loose leaf tea has the clear advantage there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You already got a good answer, so I thought I'd address your fear of tea purists giving you hell for double steeping.</p>
<p>Oolongs are actually steeped many times and they tend to get better after the first. Sometimes so much so that the first one is thrown out. My favorite tea is Darjeeling, and though most people will call it a black tea, it's <em>technically</em> an oolong because it's not completely oxidized. I find the second cup is at least as good if not better than the first. It does start to fall off pretty quickly though and I can't get a properly cup of tea out of the same leaves after a few cups, but it's worth keeping around for two cups at least. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it doesn't infuriate tea purists at all! Many teas are made for multiple steeps.  You can buy a mixed tea from Japan which is leaf tea (sencha) covered with powered tea (matcha).  First steep is very fast and is mainly matcha.  Second steep takes longer and flavor is mainly from sencha, but still a little matcha.</p>
<p>Try Puer tea from China if you want many steeps.  It is still dark as coffee on the 4th steep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not to highjack, but does the same thing happen with coffee? Especially in relation to temperature's effect. I recently bought a cold brew coffee pot but it uses a fair amount of coffee grounds to make the pot (I get somewhere between 4-6 days out of one pot because it brews a 'concentrate') I was wondering if I could save and reuse the grinds a second time and what would happen to the 'effectiveness' of the coffee</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing with tea is, if you use whole leaf tea, you can actually use the tea bag a few times. I usually do that on regular basis.</p>
<p>The other thing with ctc leaf is, most of the tea bags contain the dust left out from the ctc procedure. This dust quickly dissolves in water and gives the color instantly. So on repeat use, you have much less amount of tea to brew from.</p>
<p>Also caffeine dissolution depends largely on at what temperature you wish to steep it in, but for bed time I suggest drinking chamomile tea, it's really amazing and helps you with falling asleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
