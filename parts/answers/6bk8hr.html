		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell, It's because grapefruit contains compounds called furanocoumarins that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes; (mainly CYP3A4) which are responsible for the metabolism of many drugs (statins, anti platelets, antihistamines etc). Generally this causes them to hang around longer in higher concentrations, thus increasing the risk of adverse effects occurring. For example with a statin it'll increase the risk of liver side effects, myalgia and myositis. Other citrus fruits (limes, Seville oranges) can also cause this grapefruit reaction, and there are other foods that also contain furanocoumarins. It's a minefield! </p>
<p>EDIT: goodness me, this simple explanation really blew up. Bear in mind it is just that; an explanation kept deliberately easy to follow. If you're interested I'd suggest a good pharmacology textbook that can give you a footing in basic principles. I should also point out that CYP enzymes are pretty much contained in most tissues in the body, and whilst I was talking about liver inhibition of CYP3A4 it is located elsewhere. This is why it's not a simple linear explanation of inhibition will cause raised levels, or increased half lives.  I've also tried to reply to comments individually but I've been at work all day and am only getting a chance now. Also thank you to other awesome redditors who have contributed to further fleshing out my barebones answer, and correcting errors in other answers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PSA: effectiveness of oral hormonal birth control (the pill) is inhibited by grapefruits and grapefruits juice. So do not eat grapefruits or consume grapefruit products if you are on the pill. I know this doesn't answer OP's question but many others have answered it and I thought this was an important point to bring up.</p>
<p>Also, most commonly prescribed antibiotics inhibit the effectiveness of the pill as well so use a second method of birth control while taking antibiotics! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So my oldass account is shadow banned then...? :( So I wrote all these responses for no reason? :(</p>
<p>The liver contains enzymes known as CYP P450. These enzymes change substances to another metabolite, which can then be extrected, either through the feces or the urine. Happens to almost any drug you take, happens to alcohol, etc etc.</p>
<p>Some drugs (prodrugs) are activated when the liver enzymes change them into another metabolite. Codeine for example is an inactive drug, which is then metabolized into morphine.</p>
<p>Other drugs become inactive when metabolized. Propranolol, a beta blocker, is an example of this.
There are many different CYP enzymes that metabolize different drugs. For example, CYP3A4 metabolizes a loooot of drugs, including the mentioned Propranolol.</p>
<p>Some of the contents of grapefruit (mostly furanocoumarin) inhibit the CYP P450 enzyme CYP3A4, making it less active.</p>
<p>So returning to the previous example, if you eat grapefruit and use propranolol, the most common beta blocker, you will not metabloze propranolol as fast, and thus you will have more of the active metabolize in the body, leading to higher effect of propranolol.</p>
<p>A more serious drug would be <del>tramadol</del> Simvastatin, which is metabolized to inactive drug by CYP3A4 - meaning you would have more active Simvastatin than intended if you ate grapefruit.</p>
<p>List of drugs that interact with CYP3A4: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4#CYP3A4_ligands" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4#CYP3A4_ligands</a></p>
<p>Correction: Tramadol is also metabolized by other CYP enzymes, and thus does not pose as serious a risk. A better example is the cholesterol reducing drug, Simvastatin. </p>
<p><strong>Edit: A lot of people are asking about specific drugs. I cannot give medical advice here, you'll have to ask your doctor if you are worried. Things to remember though: There are many CYP enzymes, some drugs are metabolized by several of them. Not all drugs are potentiated equally.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many drugs are broken down with the help of a an enzyme called CYP3A4 in the small intestine. Some substances in grapefruit juice can block the action of CYP3A4, so instead of being metabolized, more of the drug enters the bloodstream and stays in the body longer. This can result in dangerous levels of the drug in your body. Certain drugs have the opposite effect and are reduced in potency. Grapefruit is not the only fruit that can cause this reaction. Pomelos and Seville oranges can also cause this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone else is right, but I wanted to say that it's not just grapefruit. Supplements and other herbal drugs, like St John's wart, can also interfere heavily with the cyp pathway, and has been linked with fatal effects. That's one reason why I would never take an herbal drug, but also why one should never take an herbal drug and a prescription simultaneously. It can cause serious complications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
