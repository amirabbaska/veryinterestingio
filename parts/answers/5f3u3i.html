		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something I have regularly. I refer to it as voodoo doll pains because it happens randomly and i have had it happen from the bottom of my feet to the top of my head. Sharp intense pain for 4-10 seconds then it dials back to a slight tingle and in about a minute it is done with. No doctor will give me any kind of straight answer when I talk to them about it because it is totally random. I have gone a couple of months between a pain hitting me then it might be 2-3 times a day for a couple weeks or even a couple of days as I said totally random. Can't recreate it in the doctors office they tried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="http://www.livescience.com/26496-endocrine-system.html" target="_blank">endocrine system</a> is our body's chemically based control system.</p>
<p>It works by sending chemicals through our blood to make changes down to the very smallest molecular level. It can be slow to react as these chemicals travel all over our body but only as fast as our blood can carry them.</p>
<p>When the chemical gets to where it is going it might just tell part of the body to make another chemical to change something else. That thing that needs changing might be the one that started it creating a feedback loop.</p>
<p>It is all very complicated and it's a wonder it works with any reliability at all. So when your chest or lungs feel uncomfortable it may be your kidney gland not telling your body to swap potassium for salt.</p>
<p>It may get there. It might be temporary discomfort until the feedback loop fixes the imbalance. Or it may not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what it's called, but one can get sharp, yet harmless, pain in parts of the lungs or chest walls. It's scary, though. Pain in the lungs COULD very well be serious, but this one isn't.</p>
<p>I sometimes get it around the heart area, which scared the fuck out of me in the beginning. It's happened once or twice every year for the last seven years or so. I'm not a smoker, and is in good health in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I stumbled across this once: <a href="https://www.uwsp.edu/stuhealth/Documents/Other/Precordial%20Catch.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.uwsp.edu/stuhealth/Documents/Other/Precordial%20Catch.pdf</a></p>
<p>It occasionally happens to me and lasts a fraction of a second before passing. As a nurse it's a little off-putting, but the few things I've read indicate it's harmless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
