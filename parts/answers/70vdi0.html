		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Christmas music occupies this weird space in the musical industry. It's all about the songs and the tradition. It all stems from singing carols. (Which has roots in religious hymns)</p>
<p>The rest of the music industry is driven by the artists. &quot;Taylor Swift's new album!&quot; is generally how these things are advertised.</p>
<p>New Christmas music does get made. There's <em>Believe</em> by Josh Groban, which is a &quot;new&quot; Christmas song. Relatively speaking. It was written in the last 20 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tried playing some more modern stuff a few years ago and immediately faced wholesale revolt from my family. Everything about the holidays is ritual, and tradition. It's not about new things, it's about doing the same old things.</p>
<p>Occasionally new songs will make it into the Christmas canon, but for the most part tradition rules the holidays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big factor no one has mentioned yet is that the majority of instantly recognizable Christmas songs are part of the public domain. This makes them much cheaper to use in any sort of medium so they perpetuate through the public consciousness. You don't have to secure rights (unless you want a specific artist's rendition of the song), so no one can deny you use of a public domain song for whatever purpose you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are hundreds of Christmas songs but the most popular ones self-perpetuate as they are the ones people most associate with Christmas, so the radio &amp; TV &amp; stores play them to death to get everyone in the spirit.</p>
<p>Artists do release new xmas songs every year and a few do catch on (The Darkness &quot;Don't let the bells end&quot; seems to get rolled out every year these days) but a lot are just quite poor (as with a lot of pop songs - for every solid gold #1 there's 1000 forgotten ones that sank) or awful cash-ins or novelty singles that have very limited appeal.</p>
<p>Bad Religion and Bowling For Soup did xmas albums, XFM's &quot;It's a cool Christmas&quot; CD has some great tracks by indie artists, and Smerins Anti-Social Club did a great cover of Walking In The Air. I actually have a USB stick full of alternative xmas tracks precisely because I get sick of the usual stuff - there's more than 100 tracks on it. if I remember I might even post a list when I find it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
