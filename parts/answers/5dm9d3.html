		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the time of the redbull jump, there was discussion as to whether he would break the sound barrier during his fall. My recollection is that it was concluded after the fact that he did. Your jump was a few weeks later. Presumably you also broke the sound barrier. Visually or physically, what was your perception of this? Could you see a shockwave coming off the top of your helmet? In the movies of Chuck Yeager's first supersonic flight there was very high turbulence just before breaking the sound barrier, then an abrupt cessation of the turbulence after the shock wave was established. Did you experience anything like that as a free falling body? Did you have any controls or devices to keep yourself from tumbling or losing control of your trajectory at the maximum speed?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>First for Alan: How much of your experience and background at Google helped in the planning and design of the project? I guess put another way: did any of your work with computers and technology get applied in preparation to perform such an incredible feat of science/technology/engineering?</p>
<p>Second for Jerry: I've seen a few episodes of Brain Games and its really well done. Scientific outreach is something that a lot of us are interested in here and in our professional lives. What is the process by which you've come up with a topic to present in the show? It seems like you end up focusing on really narrow areas of cognitive science and then immensely expanding that for the show. How do you then take that idea of &quot;let's do a show specifically about X&quot; and then convert that into a ~30 minute show?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a morbid question, but I always wonder this about death defying stunts.  As part of the preparation, did you &quot;put your affairs in order&quot;, as they say?  Your will updated, plans in place to support your family if you were incapacitated or killed, and arrangements to pay for your medical bills and/or burial fees?  Did you record a goodbye note? I can't imagine that you can get insurance for this kind of thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
