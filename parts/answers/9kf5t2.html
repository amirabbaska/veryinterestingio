		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing not mentioned yet is that your house may not the same temperature in every room. Depending on a variety of factors, you may have significant differences in temperature and humidity in different rooms and especially on different floors. Your thermostat in the first floor living room may say 72, but that doesn’t mean the bedroom on the second floor is 72.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is not strictly the only thing that influences your sense of comfort.</p>
<p>Outside things like direct sun, wind and rain influence your feeling.</p>
<p>Inside it's mostly a question of air pressure and humidity, since you're mostly static. Airflow also impact the feeling, and so does radiation of surfaces. Not all of these can be controlled sadly.</p>
<p>Very very very dumbed down: If it's colder outside your house loses radiation to the outside world, and that's noticable inside. Some heaters only heat the air inside, but the surfaces (walls, ceilings and floors) won't radiate heat, so even when the air temperature is  constant it doesn't lean you'll achieve the same level of comfort.</p>
<p>That's why a well insulated house with low temperature floor heating is way more pleasurable than a non-insulated house with space heaters cranked to full.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three methods of heat transfer:
1) conduction - stationary things you’re in contact with transferring heat.
2) convection - moving things you’re in contact with. Think running water or a cool breeze.
3) radiation - things you’re not touching sending heat in all directions and some of it hits you. If you remember those old bar style heaters, that’s a good example.</p>
<p>Radiating heat is why sitting in direct sunlight is so effective for warming you up and why closing curtains will immediately help a chill from a closed window on a cold night. It’s also why a car on a hot day feels oppressively warm the very second you turn the AC off.</p>
<p>The short version is that if the walls of your house are cold, you need more heat through conduction (air temperature) and convection (warm vent facing you) to compensate for the smaller amount of heat received through radiation from your walls.</p>
<p>Just to throw a bit of science into it, conduction and convection heat transfer is proportional to the difference in temperature, but radiation is proportional to temperature to the power of 4.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Relative humidity and direct sunlight can play a huge part in what the body feels. UV rays from the Sun get absorbed through the skin can make one feel hot. Also the humidity in the air has a great effect on how you perceive temperature. Inside your house you have extremely low humidity and no direct sunlight therefore the same temperature will feel cooler in your house versus outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's due to the humidity. Humidity makes you feel hotter because it slows down evaporation of water from the surface of your skin, it makes sweating less effective. Modern hvac systems have an evaporator coil that is very cold. The humid air makes contact with the coil and condenses the water back into liquid form thereby drying the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
