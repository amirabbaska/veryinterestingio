		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You feel like you're going extremely fast on a bike because you <em>feel</em> more.</p>
<p>Cars have very well developed suspension systems that &quot;even out&quot; the bumps on the road. As long as you're not dealing with a serious pothole or a speed-bump, the car's suspension is going to face-tank most of the shock so that you don't have to. Larger tires can also take some of the shock out of the road, but it's not as effective. Bikes generally <em>don't</em> have awesome suspension, and tires of <em>comparable</em> size. That means that you feel every bump in the road, or close enough to every bump in the road as not to matter.</p>
<p>Beyond that, cars are enclosed capsules. Your body's perception of &quot;speed&quot; relies on three things: what you see with your eyes, what your inner-ear feels, and what your skin feels. When you're on a bike, you can feel the wind running over your body. That allows you to &quot;feel&quot; your speed when you aren't accelerating or slowing down. Your eyes give you a sense of speed, but the brain is pretty good at filtering out unwanted implications from the eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Side Note</p>
<p>The Inner Ear mostly just registers acceleration, for the purposes of this conversation. It picks up when you speed up, or when you slow down. It's also a part of your sense of balance, but that's not too crucial to note in this situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's basically a combination of being able to feel the wind, and the poor shock-absorption.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>2 Main Reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the car some of your senses are not feeling the speed as they should. (Wind on the skin, wind sound, bumps and surface abnormalities (better shock absorbers on a car), and turning acceleration (also in a car the absorbers minimize the acceleration you feel))</li>
<li>An effect called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax" target="_blank">Parallax</a>. On 2 wheels you focus more on the road just ahead of you, while on the car you look on the car that is in front of you, other obstacles in order to break in time. This effect also explains why we don't feel the speed (500 to 600 MPH) on passenger jets while being on car with speed will be terrifying. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has mentioned the actual reason yet. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax" target="_blank">Parallax</a>. </p>
<p>As you travel, objects near you appear to be traveling at a much higher rate of speed than objects further away. On a bike, you can view the apparent speed of objects very close to you, especially the ground. They seem to be whipping by. In a car, the doors and floor and body prevent you from seeing the ground below or immediately in front of you. Your vision is restricted to things that are higher up and further away, like trees and buildings and traffic lights, which appear to be moving much more slowly. </p>
<p>Edit: obligatory RIP inbox. </p>
<p>And to the doubters--sure, wind and danger play a role. But why do you think <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XoCVXIpiH5w" target="_blank">this scene</a> was set in a forest?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Motorcyclist here.  I believe you get more comfortable with speed.  I remember 40mph felt like reckless speed and now twice as fast is effortless.</p>
<p>FWIW, I ride a bicycle too and the same thing happened.  Without all the motorcycle gear, riding a bicycle felt like I was naked while straddling a rickety fence.  Even though I was riding a much slower speed, it felt fast and dangerous because I was aware of how vulnerable I was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amateur cyclist here. I'm sure part of the &quot;seem,&quot; has to do with the stopping distance/time. Your body and brain have a fear instinct that will kick in at speeds that would harm you. You can stop pretty much instantly up to 10mph. Above that you have to slow down a little bit more gradually.  </p>
<p>You get desensitized to it in cars because you spend so much time in them. If you brought people from two centuries ago into our timeline and put them in a 75mph car, they would be <em>terrified.</em>  </p>
<p>When I'm at my top speed cycling, I definitely have to be paying close attention to the roadway. Even a seemingly small bump can really hurt and potentially throw you off course. You also have to use your back brake first and then your front on so you don't throw yourself over the handlebars. Remember - there are no seat belts on a bike!  </p>
<p>Edit: Like I said, amateur. Apparently people think I'm supposed to use the front brake first and with more pressure. I'll try it. But that is not OPs question, and I stand by the stopping distance and perception statements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
