<p>However in a programming language one misplaced bracket doesn't really have the same context for a program to find the error on its own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what everyone else has said about error correction, if a scratch is bad enough that error correction cannot recover the data, on an audio CD or DVD it may just show up as a glitch in the sound or video that can be played right through. A CD-ROM storing sofrware, like a PC game or old installation disk, can in a sense be less resilient to scratches because an unrecoverable error that affects just a few bytes in a critical computer software code can render said software completely unusable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CD or DVD are encoded with an error correcting scheme that allow to recover errors, no matter where it is (there is no sensitive spot).</p>
<p>The simplest example is to repeat 3 times: PPPoootttaaatttooo...</p>
<p>Notice that this scheme has two major flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes 3 times as much space</li>
<li>It fail if you have two consecutive errors (errors need to be sprinkled which is not typically what happen with a scratch)</li>
</ul>
<p>It helps if you interleave differently the 3 copies: Potato.Potato.Potato.</p>
<p>Now you can scratch up to 7 consecutive letters and still decode perfectly. But it might require you to read the entire CD to do so, which slow down the reading speed.</p>
<p>CD and DVD uses Reed-Solomon codes with a custom Interleaving Scheme (even QR Code use those!) which allows you to choose the trade-off between correction capabilities and waste of space and throughput.</p>
<p>On CD you have a guaranteed correction for bursts up to 3500 bits in sequence (2.4mm long scratch). If this is stereo sound, they can compensate a loss for one ear by using the sound for the other ear. So they interleave those carefully (aka. put them far apart) so that a scratch will not usually corrupt both ears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without getting technical, the DVD is coded very cleverly. It is coded so that if it is scratched somewhere, the computer knows that there is a scratch, or &quot;that there is a wrong letter&quot;.  Then there are algorithms and coding schemes that can replaces the wrong letter with the correct one.  Sometimes the disc will be so scratched up that the computer can't recover the data, and the computer knows this, so it will just complain rather than try to process the corrupted code. </p>
<p>The processor then happily cranks away given the correct letter in the computer code. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
