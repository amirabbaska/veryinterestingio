		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most computer scientists would say yes. The brain occupies a finite amount of space and since the universe is discrete, there is a finite amount of information in there. Personally, I'm not too comfortable with the number of assumptions being made with that logic, but my position on that matter is controversial.</p>
<p>I do know that to say the brain's storage reduces to the number of neuron connections is probably not correct. It's far more complex than that. There is also a dynamic electro-chemical state between and within the synapses which has some information storage capacity--various ion and neurotransmitter concentrations, for instance. Things like &quot;are you happy&quot; probably aren't stored in a chart showing which neuron is connected to which other. You can take a pill to change that variable.</p>
<p>Then, unlike a regular computer, the brain and the body has evolved an extremely integrated interface with its environment such that it's often difficult to tell where you draw the line between brain and not-brain. For instance, what about your body temperature? It effects cognition, and is in a feedback path with the brain. Could that be considered a form of storage? There are many examples like that.</p>
<p>It's often forgotten that information is specific to context. A forgotten language can only be deciphered if we actually share something with the lost civilization-- feelings, biology, environment.  The brain is weird because it creates its own context.</p>
<p>Since the brain is so closely integrated with its environment, its identity can become blurred and it can become unclear <em>where</em> the brain actually is. Your brain organized your room and now your room effects your cognition. Is your room information storage? You have a romantic partner. Your brain interacts with them and changes them. Now they interact with you and change your cognition. Are they storage? The [transactive memory hypothesis] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactive_memory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactive_memory</a>) builds on this idea and suggests there are memories that we can only have or have better when we're together with someone we've interacted with before.</p>
<p>You could say that these external sources are just external and thus we can ignore them. But your environment, which your brain is changing, effects you whether or not you ask for it. In that way, the external is really not so external. Your environment is not like a USB flash drive. You can't unplug it. There are numerous examples of what happens when you try to unplug it. Extreme isolation for example. The brain just breaks down in these contexts.  So environment is actually part of you.</p>
<p>If the brain doesn't have well-defined limits, then measuring its capacity is going to be incredibly difficult. It could still be a number in bytes depending on which physics you subscribe to. It's commonly believed that the whole universe has a finite storage capacity. If so, then even a brain without a skull limit still has a universe limit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Computer storage and the human memory are not directly comparable. Computers store information as states of &quot;on&quot; or 1s and &quot;off&quot; or 0s. A single one or zero is a bit, and 8 of these put together (at least in most modern computers) is a byte. But brains don't work like that at all. We store memories as connections between nerve cells, so bytes is not a very applicable unit to measure brain capacity with. A more accurate measure of brain capacity is the number of connections in the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i think this is a bad comparison. our brain seems to plot experiences into the neuronal network and thereby is able to see similarities to a previous experience. thus, we have no &quot;storage&quot; and &quot;processing&quot;. the overall activity at one moment is the information experienced.</p>
<p>technically, the brain is non-binary (it does not store bits and bytes), it measures time between activities (neuronal firing) which is a complex number, and quantifies this information (threshold levels for input triggering activity from the cell); it can multitask and consider various levels of analysis at the same time -- this allows it to be fuzzy and very apt at pattern matching.</p>
<p>when you count how much a person can learn, you get bytes, but this is really not the good way to see the brain. it does not store things in this way. the more you learn from one thing, the easier is the storage for still more, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a hard question to answer.  Of course, since we occupy finite space, our properties must be finite.  But the exceedingly complex structure of the brain and other systems (such as the nervous system) makes it hard to calculate the amount of &quot;data&quot; that we can store. </p>
<p>We don't have a way to measure resolution of life or the quality of everyday noises.  Such a calculation can vary extremely on a person's perceptive ability.  Most of our memories are vague recollections, barely any measurable data, linked in a series of firing neurons that connects those vague ideas into one clear thought in our RAM (Short-term memory).  </p>
<p>However, we can estimate average capacity, although it has no clear meaning in our terms of cognition.  That number would be 2.5 petabytes (2,560 terabytes, or 2.814×10^15 bytes).  </p>
<p>Even so, this number varies as well from person to person.  The memory space used is also selective based on a subconscious &quot;hierarchy of importance&quot;.  Some people remember numbers best, while some people remember images best.   These have a direct impact on how much we can know.  Other factors can influence it as well.</p>
<p>TL;DR: 2.814×10^15 bytes, give or take a few trillion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, our memory can hold anywhere from 1 to 100 terabytes. Combined with strong neurons (our processors) that could make our storage up to 2.5 petabytes. This of course varies per person .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
