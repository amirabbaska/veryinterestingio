<p>I had to change deodorants around puberty, but it was because my skin under my arms became very sensitive and now I have to use hypoallergenic stuff. Your body and the things living on/in it change all the time. Find what works!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phenomenon youre describing is your smelling senses getting &quot;used&quot; to the smell of the deodorant. It makes you have to use more before you notice the same intensity of it.
Think of it like running a mile. After 'training' often you get used to running a mile, but 2 miles can still get you exhausted. So you train to run the 2 miles until this becomes normal, and then you'll have to run even further for the same exaustingness.
Hope this explanation was helpfull, i just learned this at school in my own language so some terms may be off, and my first ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
