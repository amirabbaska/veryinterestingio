		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how close you are. If you are very close, you see nothing and then suddenly you are in the supernova (because the light doesn't travel much faster than the matter behind it).</p>
<p>If you are more distant and don't get directly hit by fast matter, you see the expelled matter expanding very quickly. If you are even more distant, it looks slower. Whatever goes in your direction is blueshifted, but for human eyes it would look white anyway unless you are so far away that it appears as point source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
