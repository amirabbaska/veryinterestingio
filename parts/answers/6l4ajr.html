		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of other comments concerning peeing and pooping in utero (in the womb):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meconium present at birth indicates fetal distress, the baby was stressed by something in the delivery process or shortly before.  As has been noted, the stuff is really sticky and if it has been aspirated (inhaled) can lead to breathing difficulties.  This can potentially be fatal so meconium at birth is not a good finding.</p>
</li>
<li>If a child fails to produce urine due to malformation of the kidneys or urogenital tract (bladder and urethra) a condition called oligohydramnios occurs.  Not only do we &quot;drink&quot; our urine as mentioned but we also &quot;breath&quot; it in the womb.  Babies inhale and exhale amniotic fluid.  If there is insufficient amniotic fluid because baby is not peeing, these breathing movements cannot occur normally and the lungs do not develop normally leading to severe problems at birth which can potentially be fatal.  In really severe cases of low amniotic fluid because baby is not making urine something called &quot;Potters sequence&quot; occurs.  &quot;Potters&quot; is not someone's name but comes from the fact that the child looks like they had been trapped in a clay pot.  They have abnormal development of the lungs because they have no &quot;breathing&quot; in the womb (the uterus has squeezed them and restricted this), have abnormal development of the joints in the arms, hands, and legs because they could not move (baby could not kick and move in the womb), and have abnormal appearance of their face because it was smushed by the womb.  They may not have the normal lines on the palms of their hands because they could not move them.  If severe enough oligohydramnios, the child will not survive due to the failure of the lungs to develop normally, the lungs look &quot;solid&quot; and not like &quot;sponges&quot; because they little sacs (alveoli) where oxygen adsorption occurs do not develop.  Peeing in the womb is REALLY important!</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Just a couple of months into their development, little humans begin peeing freely into the amniotic fluid that surrounds them in the womb. Then, foreshadowing all the gross stuff that babies do once they’re born, they’ll consume that urine as they swallow the amniotic fluid. Every last one of us has spent several months drinking our own pee.</p>
<p>In utero pooping is less common. Fetuses get their nutrients from food that their mothers’ digestive systems have broken down, and the waste from that food stays with mom and is taken care of on her end (Thanks, Mom!). Fetuses do ingest some stuff—mucus, bile, fine fetal hairs called lanugo, cells lining the inside of the womb—that needs to get disposed of, though. All this stuff gets broken down by the fetus’s digestive system and forms a viscous, sticky mass of feces called meconium.</p>
<p>Meconium is almost odorless and mostly sterile. It usually stays in fetuses’ bowels until they’re born, but some kids—around 13 percent—just can’t wait, and let it loose in the womb. This can be a problem, since feces is now floating in the amniotic fluid that the fetus swallows and takes into its lungs, and “meconium-stained amniotic fluid,” as the docs call it, can lead to serious respiratory distress.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called &quot;Meconium,&quot; as u/maaagill said, and babies sometimes do &quot;poop&quot; in the womb-- I was a meconium baby as I was born two weeks late because as usual I was too lazy to get up. It's not <em>super</em> dangerous for a baby to womb poop but it's not really good, because they can inhale the substance when they breathe on their own for the first time. In this case they put a tube down the baby's throat to suck it out and clear it. It left me with a scratchy voice for a little while :)</p>
<p>EDIT: Since people have been asking, &quot;a little while&quot; was as long as six months, according to my mom. I can't really comment since I was an infant, and I can't ask my mom now because we don't speak anymore.</p>
<p>re: twenty comments of &quot;lololol you ate shit&quot; yeah I sure fukken did and god almighty can I not wait until you kids go back to middle school in the fall and reddit is full of adults again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My baby expelled meconium as she was coming out. It got alllll over me. We did skin-to-skin and when she finally got lifted off of me, our skin was stuck together from the stuff.  I didn't even care. There was no better way to say welcome to motherhood!  The doctors were worried that she had pooped in utero but she didn't. Saved it all for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I haven't seen mentioned is that the &quot;urine&quot; people have mentioned isnt  the same urine that you and I have as adults. It's really just amniotic fluid, which has special proteins and such that the baby is constantly swallowing and passing through themselves. This helps them develop throughout gestation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
