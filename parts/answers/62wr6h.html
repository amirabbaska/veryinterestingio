		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buffalo wings have a really strong flavor, and some people may find it too strong or even uncomfortable after a while. The celery is provided to give a little cleansing and cooling break without introducing a different flavor, as it's a pretty flavorless veggie on its own. It can also be used to scoop some cooling sauce like ranch or bleu cheese or whatever might be served with your wings.</p>
<p>Also not only served with wings, but other dishes where cooling or cleansing might be desired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me it's also digestive related. If you're not used to it, just eating a ton of protein makes your poop less solid. Also, it's spicy, so my poop gets extra less solid. Maybe I'm also drinking a few beers. Now my morning poop is gonna be a fucking spicy river. The celery is mostly just fiber and water and hopefully mitigates some of my lava poops. Here's to hoping someone who understands the digestive tract and nutrition better can back me up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semi relevant: Not a fan of celery, but love the carrots- so for years I would eat the carrots and discard the celery. A while ago, it finally dawned on me to simply ask to swap celery for just carrots. Now, I get to enjoy double the carrots and not waste celery that others enjoy...Could even be LPT ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
