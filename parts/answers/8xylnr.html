		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for doing this! My question is: one summer backpacking in southern Ohio, I encountered a form of tick I had never seen. A local called them &quot;seed ticks&quot; and suggested they were actually just juvenile ticks. They were less than half a millimeter across and hung out in clusters of ZILLIONS. At some point, I must have brushed past one of these patches. I was brushing them off of me for two days before I knew what they were. Then one of them crawled across the screen on my phone, and I saw its teardrop body and forward-swept legs... I ended up having several bites on my ankles and had to &quot;excavate&quot; kind of aggressively to get the little bastards out. </p>
<p>My main question is: do these &quot;seed ticks&quot; carry Lyme? The internet seems conflicted.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm very interested in anything you have to say about seed ticks. I had somehow never heard of them and most information I can find is a just a testimony or an anecdote like mine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m an avid backpacker, as are many of the commenters on this AMA. If you were to hit the trail, what exact preventative measures would you take against getting tick bites? And what sort of tools would carry? (Permethrin, Picaridin, removal tools, etc.).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems the media has been widely reporting that the population of ticks and/or risk of Lyme has increased dramatically in past years.  How true is this?  And if it is true, what causes are leading to this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
