		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are not being formally charged you will get released where you can retain your own lawyer or go to the public defender's office (or equivalent).</p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> being charged, you will get booked into jail. The phones are free to use until you get assigned a cell. You can try to find a free lawyer at this time but good luck, most require a judge's approval to become your court-appointed attorney, this phone call is usually to call family and bond companies to try and get bailed out of jail.</p>
<p>Once you go to a cell it's usually a temporary dorm until you go before a judge. If it's a misdemeanor charge you will see a judge pretty soon, if it's a felony, it can take up to 72 hours to see one. This is the point where you can request a court-appointed attorney, signing paperwork that basically says you can't afford an attorney.</p>
<p>After this, if you haven't been bailed out of jail yet, you will probably get moved to permanent classification; another dorm.</p>
<p>1 week - 1 month later (or longer) you will get mail delivered to your cell that has your court-appointed attorney's name, info, etc. If you have a felony charge and cannot bail out of jail, you will have to wait to be indicted (typically by a grand jury) to know when your pre-trial court date is. This can take anywhere from months to almost 2 years. I was in with a guy waiting to be indicted for 22 months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The following should only be interpreted to apply in Canada (in case the various &quot;In Canada,&quot; qualifications weren't enough)</p>
<p>In Canada, if you've been detained by Police and you invoke your right to a lawyer, the Police are obligated to &quot;immediately&quot; (which in application, generally means &quot;as soon as possible in the circumstances&quot;) provide you a reasonable oppurtunity to contact counsel.</p>
<p>Importantly, they're bound to hold off on questioning you further until you've been afforded this oppurtunity, barring exceptional exigent circumstances and investigative necessity.</p>
<p>If you're detained at a police station, this usually means the Police will place you in a designated private phone room with a phone book (sometimes ipads/tablets these days depending on the station). </p>
<p>In Canada, Police are also obligated to provide you with phone numbers for duty counsel, who are free on-call lawyers who provide limited immediate advice relevant to the circumstances of your arrest. Depending on what province you're in, this may be a &quot;1-800&quot; 24/7 hotline number or a list of lawyers which ought to be provided to you by police.</p>
<p>Depending on the time of your arrest, you may be on hold for anywhere from 10 to 20 or more minutes trying to get through to duty counsel, due to wait time on a 1 800 number or non-response from listed roster numbers. If you do not wish to waive your right, its important you are diligent and patient and stay on the line/keep calling numbers. </p>
<p>Cutting myself off before this verges into legal advice territory, if you do not understand your right to counsel, or wish to speak to a lawyer but are having difficulty getting in contact with one despite your best efforts, its important to communicate that to police in unequivocal terms. The police are not expected to read your mind, but where its clearly known to them that someone doesn't understand their rights or is having difficulty excercising those rights,  they are generally bound to make further reasonable efforts to discharge their informational and implementational duties under 10(b) of the Charter.</p>
<p>This may not make a difference in whether you're charged or not, but it can make a huge difference when you actually retain a lawyer to defend you on those charges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: you do not have to have an already retained lawyer to use this, but you are not actually asking for an appointment either.</p>
<p>In the US, the phrase, &quot;I'd like to talk to my attorney before we go any further,&quot; invokes your Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Police can no longer question you, and answers they elicit out of you can be excluded from evidence on the basis of a constitutional violation. BUT - you can waive your Sixth Amendment protections by volunteering information after you have requested to speak to an attorney.</p>
<p>Once you have invoked your Sixth Amendment right, it is up to you to call an attorney. If you don't already have an attorney, you can ask for a phone book. You can also call your spouse/mom/friend etc to secure an attorney for you. If you cannot afford an attorney, you can look for a pro bono (free) attorney, but that is unlikely. Otherwise, you must wait to be before the judge to ask for an appointed attorney. If you can afford it, you may be able to bond out before that.</p>
<p>If the police are not charging you with anything, you can always ask, &quot;I am under detention right now?&quot; if the answer is no, then you are free to leave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will speak from an Australian perspective. Here in NSW, at least for Indigenous Australians, police are required by law to call the 'Custody Notification Service', which puts you in touch with a lawyer once you are arrested, but <em>before</em> police ask to interview you. We [lawyers] ask certain questions of the police - the nature of the charges, whether the person is likely to be granted or refused police bail, and if refused police bail which court they will be attending. We then speak to the person charged and give them certain advice and answer any questions they may have at this point. Another law requires people refused bail to be brought before court as soon as possible - so on the weekend that is something called a Registrar, and during the week a Magistrate (a Judge in the lower-courts). We will have a lawyer there ready to represent them at their first court appearance.
For non-indigenous Australians, the system operates largely the same. If unrepresented at their first court appearance, the Magistrate will typically ask if the person would like a lawyer, at which point they can apply for a 'grant' (representation) from Legal Aid, a publicly funded defence-lawyer service.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, saying &quot;I want my lawyer&quot; is equivalent to saying &quot;I wish to assert my right to have an attorney present&quot;.  Once you do that, the police have to stop questioning you whether you actually have a lawyer or not.  </p>
<p>At that point, they may choose to charge you with a crime, and that's when you have to worry about finding an actual lawyer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
