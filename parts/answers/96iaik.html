		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They typically don't. Snowflakes are a crystalline formation, and they crystallise along hexagonal patterns. They are roughly symmetrical because at each point when more ice crystals are forming at the edges, they are experiencing approximately the same conditions as at corresponding points of rotational symmetry. Because of the hexagonal structure there are limited ways the ice can crystallise at the edges, this limitation forces the shapes into more regular patterns. The smaller snowflakes are the more uniform and closer to symmetrical they are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here, let's start by checking out [this video of a snowflake forming.](
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCA2VmDVzEo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCA2VmDVzEo</a>)  You can see that there isn't perfect symmetry, but rather each &quot;leaf&quot; of the snowflake forms individually.  The formation depends on many variables, such as temperature, pressure, etc. and the exact value of those variables is different from one end of the snowflake to the other; even if it is such a tiny difference, it matters.</p>
<p>The reason the hexagonal structure is so prevalent is because water molecules have that angle.  Check out the diagrams <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hexagonal_ice.html" target="_blank">on this website</a> to get a general idea for how the molecules structure themselves.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
