<p>Barometric pressure drops, which causes the fluids and air inside the body to expand and press on and compress nerves. It's on a microscopic level but it's a cumulative effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've got a small, old-fashioned weather station on my desk - a vintage Airguide barometer, and some other naval instruments my grandfather collected over time.</p>
<p>After all the surgeries, sports injuries, cracked bones, and various ailments earned over the last half-century on this earth, I can tell you when the barometer's needle is buried below 29 inches of pressure, I'm feeling it everywhere.</p>
<p>It starts around 29.5 inches - it's noticeable but when it's creeping lower, and lower, it's time to break out the heating pad and aspirin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I'd agree with the barometric pressure assessment. But shortening of the soft tissue would also have a significant effect. You know when you &quot;pop&quot; a joint? All that's happening is you get a dissolving of a small nitrogen bubble in the joint fluid allowing the joint to... Depressureize and stretch out. ( think like a soda can where the Gass suddenly dissolves back into the soda) The pop you hear is a cavitation effect.</p>
<p>So I would imagine barometric pressure would play a big role.</p>
<p>However, people also tend to drink less when it's not hot or if the weather is foul. This may lead to dehydrated &quot;stiff&quot; tissue.</p>
<p>Source: I'm a Physiotherapist, that's my best educated guess.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's barometric pressure. I have chronic migraines and can pretty much predict the weather. It creates a difference in pressure between the outside and your body, kind of like going to a higher elevation and your ears start popping. For people sensitive to headaches the pressure change that affects the sinuses can often cause worsening pain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to note. It’s not been proven that this phenomenon is true just yet. While there are some interesting and plausible explanations as to why people may feel aching/pain in different weather conditions, there may not be any correlation to begin with.</p>
<p>Colleagues in my department at the University of Manchester started a study a couple of years ago to try and show this link. They measured people’s self reported pain, daily, on a smartphone app. Location and weather data can then be retrospectively added to statistically investigate the link between pain and weather.</p>
<p>Data has not been released yet, but feel free to look at the website below.</p>
