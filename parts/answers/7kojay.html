It has dropped around 15% since then. (See link for the interplay of efficiency vs extra devices.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if I should create another thread or just ask in this one; a lot of the replies here state that utilities are raising rates due to increasingly stagnant energy usage. </p>
<p>Why isnt there more competition in this space? I live in Idaho and Idaho Power (Private company) has a monopoly and can charge just about anything they want afaik.</p>
<p>At what point do these power companies start losing so much money that they go bankrupt. What happens then? (Serious question)</p>
<p>Thanks and sorry if this is an inappropriate place for this question in the context of this thread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I work with a non-profit that operates at a remote site, powered by our own private power system. Our hydro-electric plant produces about 260kVA in the summer, and drops down to as low as 40kVA in the winter.</p>
<p>Despite the radical improvement in efficiency when it comes to our lighting loads (our guest rooms have 4 bulbs in them, totally 28W with LEDs vs 240W on incandescent), the total load on our grid has gone up over the years, mostly due to people's electronic devices as well as our own IT systems, and other things that we've had to put in for regulatory and similar purposes. </p>
<p>Our base IT load is now about 3500W across our campus, which is significant when you're only producing about 45kW off your power plant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not in the Unites States. Since about 1990, we have held around 95-99 quads of annual energy consumption. There has been a shift to more efficient appliances, but our phantom loads continue to increase (large plasma TVs) and in general, we are wasteful in practice of energy conservation. The EIA has great datasets to explore. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/#/?f=A&start=1949&end=2016&charted=4-6-7-14" target="_blank">https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/#/?f=A&start=1949&end=2016&charted=4-6-7-14</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
