		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people use water as an analogy, but I personally prefer a pipe full of marbles, I think it fits better.</p>
<p>So, imagine you have a pipe full of marbles, the inside diameter of the pipe is the size of one marble, so they're all in a line.</p>
<p>If you push a marble into one end of the pipe, another one pops out of the end, just like electricity. The marbles move slow, but the effect is fast.</p>
<p>Now let's let's define some terms:
Voltage: The pressure behind the marbles, or in the case of electricity, the motive force behind the electrons.</p>
<p>Current: The number of marbles moving past a given point in the pipe per second. In a circuit, this is the number of coulombs of electrons passing a given point per second, measured in Amperes.</p>
<p>Coulomb: One whole marble, or ‎6.24150934(14)e×10 18
Electrons (you don't have to know what that number specifically means, just that it's huge, and thus, electrons are small). One coulomb moving past a given point in a circuit is equal to one Ampere by definition. This is here so you can understand what an ampere is while we talk about it.</p>
<p>Resistance: In the case of the pipe, this could be likened to how slippery the walls of the pipe are. More sticky means more resistance, and it will take more force (voltage) to move the marbles in the pipe. The longer the pipe or the greater the stickiness, the greater this resistance to movement is, and thus the more force you need to get the marbles to move. In a circuit, this is basically the same. It's how much voltage you need to get a given amount of current to flow.</p>
<p>So now we have our definitions down let's do some stuff with them.</p>
<p>We know that resistance degreases the number of coulombs per second flowing past a given point, and voltage does the opposite. More resistance means less current (and vice versa), more voltage means more current (and vice versa). We also know that this relationship must be linear (going from one to two is the same amount of change as going from nine to ten, for example) because current is always proportional to resistance.</p>
<p>Since it's linear, there's really no fancy math involved, it's just multiplication and division, depending on what you're solving for, so let's construct our equation.</p>
<p>Current is equal to voltage divided by resistance (I=V/R). I don't know why we use I for current, but we do.</p>
<p>Now with a little algebra, we can rearrange this to solve for any variable given two others.</p>
<p>V=I*R is used to solve for voltage, when you know how much current and resistance you have.</p>
<p>R=V/I is used to find the resistance when you know voltage and current.</p>
<p>That's probably as deep as I can go for ELI5, so I'll leave it at that. If I didn't explain something clearly or glossed over something I shouldn't have, let me know and I'll edit accordingly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>V = Voltage = pressure of electrons<br />
R = Resistance = well.. resistance.. how difficult it is for them to flow<br />
I = Current = how many electrons are flowing</p>
<p>Imagine instead of electrons you are talking about a water pipe with a tap. You can turn the tap in order to open/close it, or you might say in order to reduce/increase the resistance. And the city can increase or reduce the pressure of the water in your pipes.</p>
<p>If the city increases the pressure, more water will flow when you open the tap. In other words: more voltage means more current.</p>
<p>The more you close the tap the more resistance you have. The more resistance you have, the less water will flow. In other words: more resistance means less current.</p>
<p>Therefore: Current = Voltage / Resistance</p>
<p>If you increase the denominator the result gets smaller (more resistance, less current) and if you increase the numerator the result gets bigger (more voltage, more current).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a multilane highway with a lot of cars. At rush hour, a lot of cars want to travel the highway. At midnight, fewer cars want to travel it.<br />
One day, a construction crew blocks off some of the lanes. Now at rush hour everyone has to merge, so traffic is slower. Some cars even take alternate routes to avoid the traffic. Same thing happens at midnight but on a smaller scale.<br />
Amount of cars that want to travel = Voltage<br />
Speed of all cars added together = Current<br />
Construction lanes = Resistance </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people have already said electricity is like water in pipes, but allow me to give my version.</p>
<p>Ohm's Law states that V = IR or Voltage equals current times resistance.</p>
<p>In the water analogy, voltage is water pressure (e.g. pounds per square inch), current is the flow of water (Liters per minute) and resistance is a force opposing flow determined by either diameter of the inside of the pipe or material in the pipe.</p>
<p>So let's say you have a water pump that creates a constant water pressure. Let's hook that pump up to a hose that is 2 cm wide. That hose would put out let's say 10 L/min. Now, hook that same pump with the same pressure to a hose 4 cm in diameter. You've increased the cross section of your hose by 4x (Π4^2 / Π2^2 = 16/4 = 4). Your new flow rate with the bigger hose is now 40 L/m. In essence, with constant pressure, you've increased flow by decreasing resistance (by increasing the cross section of the hose). The same goes for electricity. With constant voltage, if you use a heavier gauge of wire, you get more current because the larger gauge wire has less resistance.</p>
<p>Now let's say you kept the hose the same diameter, but adjusted the pressure. A hose attached to a 10 psi pump would have a lower flow rate than that same hose attached to a 20 psi pump. More pressure means more flow. With electricity, more voltage (given the same wiring) means more current.</p>
<p>Another thing that affects resistance is the material through which the water is flowing through. You could have a hose with nothing in its inner area. But what about a hose with filters inside them? Or what about mesh grates or ball bearings inside the inside of the hose. Depending on the material &quot;clogging&quot; up the inside of the hose, certain hoses would flow better than others. If you had a hose with an empty inside hooked up to a 10 psi pump the flow rate would be higher than that same pump hooked up to a hose with a filter running through it. The amount and type of material inside the hose can affect the rate of flow. With electricity, it's the same. Some materials allow electrons to pass through better than others. A superconductor would be like a hose with nothing inside. A good conductor may resemble a hose with marbles or metal grates inside that slows down the water a little but it can still pass fairly easily through. A poor conductor may be like a hose with fine mesh grates or filters inside that slow water down more. And an insulator would be a &quot;hose&quot; blocked off with something solid that water cannot pass at all. The harder it is for water to pass through the hose, the more pressure you need to maintain a certain flow rate or the lower your rate of flow is given a certain amount of pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
