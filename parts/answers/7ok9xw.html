		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mass is a term claimed for how much an object interacts with the Higgs field. </p>
<p>Think of water in a bucket. Each of the water molecules are interacting with eachother with hydrogen bonds. You stick your hand in the bucket, displacing water molecules around your hand.</p>
<p>The Higgs field is exactly like water. But instead of water molecules there are little Higgs bosons. Thus if you have an object that interacts more with the Higgs field, then more Higgs bosons are displaced creating more mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a preface, note that any layman-friendly explanation you will encounter here is going to be a gross oversimplification of the Higgs-mechanism, so take everything with a grain of salt (including this comment).</p>
<p>To clear up some confusion that I've seen in this thread, first lets talk about something a little more fundamental, the Pauli-exclusion principle (PEP). It says that no two Fermions (particles that ordinary matter is made up of) can occupy the same quantum state (i.e position, angular momentum, energy etc). This is why we expect some resistance if we're trying to squish something together, for example.</p>
<p>Now, Bosons are different from Fermions. They don't obey the PEP and as a consequence can be packed arbitrarily close together.</p>
<p>This is for example why stating that particles gain mass by &quot;displacing&quot; Higgs-Bosons is not true, Bosons cannot be displaced.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to your question.</p>
<p>Particles gain mass by <em>interacting</em> with an omnipresent Higgs <em>field</em> that permeates all of space.</p>
<p>The best way to think of this field is a room full of your friends (bear with me, this will all make sense in a moment). The people inside are <em>excitations</em> of this room, much like the Higgs-Boson is an excitation of the above discussed Higgs field. </p>
<p>Suppose now you want to go trough the room. Of course every single one of your friends will want to talk with you, slowing you down along the way. </p>
<p>Meanwhile a complete stranger with the same path would get to their destination much faster, as only few people would slow them down with a conversation.</p>
<p>A similar thing happens with particles. Their coupling strength (or popularity, in our analogy) determines how drastically they're &quot;slowed down&quot;. the more they interact with the Higgs field, the more mass they get and vice versa.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, this is not a complete rundown on the mechanism, but seeing as it nevertheless is a pretty lengthy wall of text already I will stop here. If you have any follow up questions, feel free to ask.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am curious to see if we can manipulate the Higgs and make matter have more or less mass than normal.
