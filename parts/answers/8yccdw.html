		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In  a hospital setting it's treated as a biohazard because there is a much higher change that the owner of the blood is infected in some way (otherwise they wouldn't be in a hospital). Also, the blood isn't treated as a biohazard for the protection of the patients, it's more for the nurses and employees. They have to come into contact with blood far, far more often and from a much wider range of individuals than a typical person does. This increases their statistical change of being infected; thus it becomes wise to put more strict and careful controls in place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason that restaurants treat uneaten cooked food differently than we do at home.  There are laws in hospitals have to follow to control illness, because so many illnesses end up there.</p>
<p>At home, there are less people and less illness. Should people follow biohazard rules at home?  It isn't a bad idea. </p>
<p>Will 100 people get sick if it doesn't happen?  Probably not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are. Women's public toilets, especially in bars and restaurants in the UK, often have special sanitary waste bins in each toilet cubicle so that tampons can be properly disposed of.</p>
<p>They're designed so that things can be dropped in, but nothing can be taken out. They're collected and emptied on a regular basis by the sanitation company that provides them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic answer is that for safety purposes, feminine hygiene products ideally <em>should</em> be disposed of as biohazardous waste and treated accordingly. Blood should always be treated as infectious regardless of circumstances or where it comes from. </p>
<p>In practice, though, collection of feminine hygiene products as biohazardous materials and treating them appropriately (i.e. sending them to a biohazardous waste incineration facility) is very impractical. In a world where some women struggle even to afford basic feminine hygiene products, it just is not feasible to ask all women to collect their feminine hygiene products in appropriate (relatively expensive) biohazard containers and then pay to have them compliantly shipped and treated. When the current method of &quot;just throw them in a trash bag that will eventually be tied up to contain the blood-saturated hygiene products&quot; works nearly just as well but costs infinitely less, it's a lot easier practically speaking to say the benefits of disposing in this manner far outweigh the minimal risks - despite the fact that a minimal risk is present. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason we don't dispose of used bandaids or tissues in a more careful way: the risk of passing a disease on via used menstrual product is very low by normal disposal (flushing a tampon or throwing in the trash). That said, anyone who uses any of the above-mentioned items and has a blood-borne or body-fluid-transmitted illness should take precautions to reduce exposure to others.</p>
<p>Fun fact, only about half of menstrual fluid is blood, with the rest of it being mucous, epithelial tissue from the endometrium, and vaginal secretions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
