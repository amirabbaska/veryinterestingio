		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.mpg.de/7738341/brain-architecture-daydreaming" target="_blank">I suspect this article is what you are interesting in.</a></p>
<p>In short, there are different parts of the brain that are responsible for reacting to novel stimuli and carrying out tasks of habit. Different parts of the brain can suppress the activities of others. Very roughly, the more parts of the brain are involved in dealing with a task, the more time it takes for them to reach a consensus and react. </p>
<p>I suspect that &quot;consciously&quot; thinking about something sets up a conflict between the part of the brain that carries out habitual activities and the part of the brain responsible for higher thinking and novel reactions (see article above). This comes with a &quot;loss of groove&quot; as the various parts resolve conflicting signals. It is the cognitive equivalent of an overly attentive manager inserting himself into the workers' work to try things himself and ask questions, thus slowing everything down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first video is a classic case of &quot;fire together, wire together&quot; wherein you develop an automatic response to a stimulus (e.g. you see a right arrow you tap the right arrow button) so you can reliably execute a complex task at a speed which would not be possible if you were consciously thinking of each individual step/move. </p>
<p>This stuff gets really interesting when you get past simple cue-response activities, like with a piano player during a really fast part of a song where they have tied together all the motor parts required for that activity into a &quot;motor program&quot; (analogous to a macro in excel for example) through practicing it and they get to a point where to execute that motor program at the speeds they want requires them to do the whole thing.
These and other neural strategies result in professionals being able to enter a state of &quot;flow&quot; or something more commonly known as &quot;being in the zone (chief)&quot; where a large repertoire of complex motor programs and responses to stimuli are seamlessly strung together.</p>

<p>I don't understand the current top response, because it's not related. You are not daydreaming, your brain acts out what it learned to do. For example are you ordering your arm and hand to switch gear.</p>
<p>Back when you learned driving manual transmission wasn't that easy to combine with gas and brakes.</p>
<p>And now it's so burnt in, it's like a program running. Sensory input is reduced, muscle memory acts out the movement. You nave reduced the amount of attention you have to pay to a minimum.</p>
<p>Or different.</p>
<p>You can teach yourself to drink automatically, by putting a glass of water into your view and drinking from it every few minutes. Assuming you can reach it comfortably or with a low amount of work needed, you will start doing it automatically.</p>
<p>When you pay attention it stops.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because you're putting focus on what's going on in your brain and doing so interrupts the process. the brain can't work the state you it wishes to observe.</p>
<p>I could go on and on and on. It's my most favourite topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell: Because conscious attention is a very slow, serial resource: it can be allocated to one task at a time, and can at best switch tasks 2-3 times per second, and not for very long at that rate.</p>
<p>Contrast that with all sorts of automated processing we can carry, where literally thousands of tasks can be executed in parallel. As long as they don't place demands for conscious attention, they'll run unhindered.</p>
<p>The conscious attention can (and does!) control the automation to teach it new tricks. That's why properly guided repetition is pretty much all that's needed to learn any sort of an impressive real-time task such as walking or playing an instrument. In case of the latter, good guidance can speed up the process by an order of magnitude or more over worst case, so help of a teacher is usually necessary for making progress at a practical pace. But having a teacher isn't absolutely necessary at the price of very slow progress, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theres something kinda similar called social facilitation. It's an idea that we perform tasks the best at certain levels of arousal. The optimum level of arousal depends on our mastery of the task at hand.</p>
<p>When performing tasks that we have mastered (or inherently easy tasks) our performance is better when we are being watched by an audience. We tend to perform these mastered tasks unconsciously, and as the level of arousal increases with the size of the crowd we perform better. </p>
<p>Alternatively if we are performing a difficult or unmastered task we perform better on our own. The audience increases our arousal level causing us to overthink the task since we have not yet learned to do it unconsciously. </p>
