		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By folding the paper in half diagonally and horizontally, and then further bisecting the resulting angles, you arrive at a handful of standard forms (&quot;bases&quot;) with a certain number of flaps (which can be formed into the wings or limbs of whatever animal you're trying to represent). The crane base has four long flaps (from the four corners of the paper) and one short one (from the center of the square), and those form the head, tail, wings, and back of the traditional crane. A folder who knows this base might decide to use it to make some other kind of bird, or a dragon, fish, etc. Other traditional bases have other numbers and arrangements of flaps that suggest other animals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Mine were quite basic but I suspect the more complex ones require some mathematics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely trial and error, I don't know how long the art of oragami has been around but think about yourself. If you worked on folding paper for an hour a day for the next year I'm sure you could come up with some design. Then just imagine how many man hours and different minds and creative abilities have gone behind oragami for the last hundred years. It's not that incredible to think its trial and error. This is t really a good question because I'm sure there was math and planning involved eventually. And we know that today. But it makes sense that it would be pretty hands on and tactile initially.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
