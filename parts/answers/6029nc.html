		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sallie Mae is more or less an organization that was powered by the government. Now it is the largest US student loan provider and collects for the dept of education. Because of its size it can give fairly low interest loans and it quite safe from failing at any point. It is a privately traded company as well. </p>
<p>There were many governement agencies created like Freddie Mac etc. One for housing, one for students loans and such. </p>
<p>Compared to banks they have less overheard as all they do is student loans so they are very efficient. </p>
<p>Why people hate them is because they owe them money. I am not too aware of anything too wild happening ocer the years. Some people who oppose the federal government may see Sallie as taking business from banks etc. But you cant make everyone happy. They kept the banks from charging obscene interest. Competition is a good thing. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My experience with them, as well as a few older family members prior to the Navient change, was that they'll call anyone and everyone about what you &quot;owe&quot; even after you've paid back your loans in full.</p>
<p>Also, if you auto-pay with them, they are happy to keep pulling money from your account even after the loan is paid, so make sure you cancel that!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sallie Mae is one of many companies that issue private student loans. Note &quot;private&quot;, as opposed to &quot;federal&quot; or &quot;public&quot; loans which are issued by the federal government. Sallie Mae used to offer both but now they just do private.</p>
<p>Private student loans deserve to be abhorred. They are, in general, a horrible thing to have. Federal loans are too, but they do have some basic protections built in, such as being able to delay making payments if you are unemployed, and income-based repayment plans with possible forgiveness at the end of a 20-25 year period. Private loans have none of that. They are simply a debt that you will have to repay under almost all circumstances that don't involve you being completely crippled and unable to work. And they usually have a higher interest rate on top of all that.</p>
<p>Private/federal distinction aside, Sallie Mae is not really much different from any other student loan company issuing private loans. They pretty much all suck to deal with and have been involved with pulling some shady tricks against their customers at some point. And nobody likes repaying a loan especially to the tune of hundreds or thousands of dollars per month, so all you're ever going to hear is complaints.</p>
<p>When it comes to evaluating student loans, focus on two things: (1) Federal or private? Always federal if possible. (2) Interest rate. Lower is better. Actually let me add one more thing: (0) Do anything you can to avoid or reduce the loan in the first place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My experience with this has been pretty bad. You owe them money and they are part of the government so the customer service is pretty bad. I called them to ask how much I need to pay to pay off a student loan. They told me $X and I said to confirm, if I pay exactly $X right now, today, the loan will be paid off, even with the interest accruing everyday. The lady said yes. If it's less than a dollar of interest then they just &quot;write it off&quot; which sounded ridiculous to me. So I repeated the question. And she again said yes. Pay it today and it will be gone. Well, just like I thought. I paid it off. And it didn't all pay off because the leftover interest. I call again a week later and get someone else who tells me no sorry, that's not how it works. You have to pay the $5 that accrued since you thought you paid off your loan in full. And I was like well, how do I know if I pay that $5 that I won't accrued some pennies amount. Like never ending cycle?!? And she's like no. That'll pay it off. So I paid the $5. And have been so wary of them since then. When I call now. I make sure I get the name of the people I'm talking to and voice record the call. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They stopped accepting payments from my bank and never notified me. At the time my mom was helping me pay so automatic payments were set up through her account. When we found out, I was 6+ months behind and I think theyâ€‹ sold my loans to another company. That company has been great ever since. That was about 6 years ago. Sallie Mae trashed my credit by not accepting payments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
