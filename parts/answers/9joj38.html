It would  be nearly impossible to distinguish from the neighboring star, current tech couldn't do it, but it would be the easiest thing to see. there is not going to be enough radioactive isotopes produced to create a spectroscopic signature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nukes themselves would be very unlikely to be noticed. The vast majority of the material put into the atmosphere by a detonation is going to be ordinary dirt and dust. Occasional atoms in that dust will have undergone nuclear transmutation into unusual materials, and the bomb components themselves could theoretically be detected, but we're talking about amounts as low as a few pounds distributed across hundreds of miles of atmosphere, and rapidly decreasing to boot.</p>
<p>One nuclear-age product, however, would have been an excellent sign of intelligent life - CFCs. Commonly used in refrigerators and responsible for the hole in the ozone layer, these chemicals can not be produced by any known natural process. Thousands of tons were released before they were banned, and it takes years for them to break down. Any aliens doing a spectrographic analysis on us at the time would have had a pretty good indication that there is intelligent life on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
