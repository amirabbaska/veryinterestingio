		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, and I'll try to answer in a way suitable for your school project. </p>
<p>First look at your electrons. They &quot;orbit&quot; the nucleus, but not in the way that planets orbit a sun, but by filling quantum orbitals.  These have shapes, which can be seen <a href="http://timelineoftheatom.blogspot.co.uk/p/erwin-schrodinger-1926.html" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://cdn.comsol.com/wordpress/2015/05/orbitals-for-the-hydrogen-atom.png" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/8aDOv.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. If you are trying to find an electron characterised by its specific quantum numbers, these shapes will tell you where you need to look to find such an electron with high probability. </p>
<p>These shapes can be found by solving the Schroedinger equation for a Coulomb potential generated by the tiny, yet massive and positively charged nucleus.</p>
<p>The nucleus itself is built up in the same way. The protons and neutrons also occupy such orbitals. So from the point of the atom you can indeed say that the protons and neutrons are just all lumped in together in the nucleus. Yes, they are highly ordered, but it will make little difference to the atom.</p>
<p>If you need more/different information ask again. It would help to know what year you are in, the most appropriate answer will be different for a senior year in high school or junior high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the features of the atom that all high school books exaggerate is the size of the atomic nucleus compared to the size of the atom. Nuclei have radii of about 10^-15 m while those of atoms about 10^-10 m. So if you draw a nucleus that is 1 mm wide, the width of the atom would be about 100 m!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Considering that you're modelling in 3D... You could come up with the old, outdated model of electrons orbiting around a nucleus made up of protons and neutrons.  </p>
<p>But the more contemporary and better-understood model is one of &quot;electron orbitals&quot;.  A quick google image search of &quot;electron orbitals&quot; should show you what you're looking for.  The balloon-looking orbitals are areas where electrons pop into and out of existence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They don't wander around aimlessly.  They live in 'probability zones' in certain areas around the nucleus.  This is the basics of chemistry.  Read up on electron orbitals.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
