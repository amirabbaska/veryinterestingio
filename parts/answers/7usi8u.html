		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Investment.</p>
<p>Tesla, for example, has all the weight of Elon Musk's considerable fortune and other very successful business ventures behind it, as well as a huge amount of venture capital funding. Investors are often happy to provide large amounts of money to companies that are still establishing a market in the hopes that the company will be successful and increase in value.</p>
<p>I mean, Juicero got $140 million in venture capital. For a $700 juice machine that didn't make juice. Nobody ever said Wall Street was smart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Companies like Tesla and Netflix have taken on billions in funding from venture capital, by selling stock in an IPO (and secondary stock offerings). This effectively gives them a pool of savings to use when they are taking in less revenue than they are spending. At a certain point, the high level investment in building the business will slow down while revenue will climb as a result of that investment, so revenues will become more than the expenses and lead to profits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CPA, here. Operating at a &quot;loss&quot; simply means you spend more than you earn. But that does not necessarily mean you don't have cash to pay employees. A company with billions in cash reserves could still operate at a loss. Hell, some companies may operate at a loss for strategic financials reasons. In cases like Tesla and Netflix, they're selling equity in the company (to investors) for cash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Venture capital. These companies could potentially grow into massive companies that are worth significantly more in the future than they are today (even if they haven't really figured out how to make a profit yet). This attracts investors who buy shares in the company now for dirt cheap with the hope that they will grow, make profits, and yield excellent returns. The money from investors bankrolls the growth of the company.  </p>
<p>If you want an example, <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA705CA705&amp;tbm=fin&amp;q=NASDAQ:+FB&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uLj0c_UNiqosM0pyeAC6ZzDPOgAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1lfjz1YfZAhUGbawKHepUCf0Q6c8CCDYwAA&amp;biw=950&amp;bih=880#scso=uid_g5R0WvRF6eqPBKqSmogC_5:0" target="_blank">look at Facebook's stock price</a> over the life of the company.
