<p>Two billion years. This is roughly when first bacteria started doing this whole carbon dioxide into oxygen thing, vastly increasing the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. Oxygen acted as poison to the existing lifeforms, but some of the life adapted into using oxygen to live</p>

<p>That dot is pretty impactful, and I wanted to convey just how much has happened in such ridiculously short timespan considering the history of life on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably already mentioned, but to sum it up evolution is driven by competition amongst and within species for niches (a fancy term for the roles that a species plays in their environment - for example, large cats occupy a niche that could be described as stealthy apex predator). &quot;Intelligent, tool making critter&quot; is the human &quot;niche&quot;. At one point, this niche was up for grabs, with many different species of intelligent homonid competing to occupy and dominate within that niche (when modern humans appeared, the world was occupied by at least five other species of &quot;bipedal, tool and culture making apes&quot;, and likely more that we haven't discovered, including Neanderthalis, Denosovan Man, Red Deer People, Homo erectus, and Homo floriensis, though there is some debate over whether or not denosovans and red deer cave people are simply subspecies of neanderthal or homo erectus). Homo sapiens, our own species, had slight advantages that enabled us to outcompete the other homonids and &quot;win&quot; this niche for ourselves. Once a species loses its niche, unless it adapts to a new role then it won't be able to secure resources for itself that it needs to survive, and will eventually go extinct. A followup question, then, is why did humans win instead of the competition? Erectus was physically stronger and - at least the male specimens - grew a bit taller than modern humans (I have a pet theory that &quot;giants&quot; are cultural memories of prehistoric encounters with clans of Erectus), but they had smaller brains and were likely limited in their capacity to develop language and culture. We really don't know much about the denosovans and the red deer cave people because we have such few fossils of them, but Neanderthal was widespread in Europe and quite succesful. Built like the stocky dwarves of Tolkien's fantasy (they were short, strong, barrel chested and incredibly tough, with thick bones), they also had many adaptations to the cold, including larger nasal passages for heating their breath and great physical strength (muscles keep you warm). The theory is that Neanderthal was less omnivorous than homo sapiens, and was essentially an ambush predator - their favored hunting tactic was to sneak up on prey and grapple it to the ground (we know this because they had a lot of bone injuries that forensics associate with close-quarters fighting). This worked well during the periods of glaciation, when herbivores like the Irish Elk were forced to migrate through Europe's many valleys in a constant search for thawed patches of grass, making it easy to catch prey in an ambush, but as the ice retreated this tactic was less and less practical. Homo sapiens, being adapted to running and likely practitioners of persistence hunting, which involves following prey over vast distances until it drops from exhaustion, could hunt in open plains and generally had access to a larger variety of potential prey animals. One could say that humans won the evolutionary race because we had the longer legs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the case of animal intelligences provided by galacticleofin, there were actually other sapient species on our planet, as well. Most notably, the Neanderthal. Not technically an ancestor itself - human ancestors lived alongside them, and there's even genetic evidence of cross-breeding. Archaeological studies indicate that they were intelligent and cultured, likely more than our own ancestors at the time. However, our ancestors were significantly more aggressive and competitive...</p>
<p>So. long story short: there are no other forms of intelligent life on earth because we already killed them. And hey, to go back to animal intelligences, look at endangered species lists - we're killing them, too.</p>
<p>EDIT: As an additional remark, the common pig is evaluated to be about as smart as a 5-year-old human, with intelligence much greater than dogs, rivalling apes and porpoises. It's why they make such smart and loving pets, if you have the space for them. And guess what humans usually do with those?</p>
<p>EDIT2: As a disclaimer, I'm not a professional. I'll answer what I can with what I know, but I'm working with limited knowledge gained from being an interested learner, not professionally trained.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of misleading answers here, including ones suggesting we're just underestimating intelligence in other species. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Lets get the basics right first. Humans are far far more intelligent that anything else on the planet. Its objectively not a disputable point. Just look at the neocortex and try to find equivalences in animals.</p>
<p>That said the question becomes suddenly more obvious when you first look at a slightly different scenario. Imagine going back many many millions years in the past, say right as the first birds were taking flight and asking why arent there other species that fly? Or going back to when the first mammals were evolving and asking why arent other animals warm blooded, or give live birth and so on.</p>
<p>The reality is, things take time, and something has to come first. And given how evolution works, usually that something with the advantage then proliferates massively, and often evolves into different paths. It just so happens that when that 'something' is intelligent introspective life, it tends to ask why are we so intelligent and why arent others just as intelligent yet?</p>
<p>So just like the 'birds' first evolved flight and then expanded out to all areas where flight offered advantage, or the mammals first evolved warm-bloodedness, live-birth etc and expanded out to all areas where that was advantageous, the homo branch of primates too happened to have first evolved high intelligence, very very recently in evolutionary history, and are in the process of essentially expanding to all areas where intelligence is advantageous!</p>
<p>In fact, it looks like they will soon be expanding out into space, possibly other planets, maybe even star systems, and they might even ditch biological evolution all together for artificial or digital-and-computing substrates and designed evolution of intelligence. So absolutely without doubt, in the next couple thousand years, and for sure in couple million years, there will be literally thousands and millions of kinds of intelligences populating the universe, all of which will be trace back the evolution of their intelligence capable lives to early humans!! </p>
<p>TL;DR : We are just really really early in the evolution of intelligent life, geologically and evolutionarily speaking. So you just need some patience, in a couple just a couple million years (and much less if we go digital), there will a splendid variety of intelligent life forms that will evolve out of humanity.. almost in the same way we have thousands of kinds of birds all evolved out of the first flight capable dinosaurs!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large brains require a lot of calories to run, and intelligence grants diminishing returns once you can catch your prey efficiently.  Hominids were apex predators with a relative food abundance (endurance hunting works against almost anything and we're omnivores), especially after mastering fire.  Anthropologists estimate it only took ~10 hours/week for food gathering, so we had a lot of idle time so we started sexually selecting for intelligence, building things that improve our survival odds, etc..</p>
<p>Aside from the food abundance, one also needs hands.  Dolphins are smart, but lack hands so they never developed technology.  Likewise, intelligence requires experience so one also has to have a decently long lifespan.  Octopuses are also rather smart &amp; possess tentacles, but sadly they don't live long enough to do much.  They also don't communicate as much as dolphins or humans, so acquired experience dies with the individual.</p>
<p>Given that Homo was the first technologically advanced genus on Earth, the odds of having an energy surplus, dexterous hands, communication, and probably several other factors must be fairly low.  It's one of those things that doesn't help a lot until it hits a critical threshold, then it's a game changer, so it's not a common evolutionary path since evolution doesn't plan ahead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
