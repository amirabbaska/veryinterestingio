</blockquote>
<p>Other users can handle the geology question, but for this I'd like to point out that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7uLfRM1.png" target="_blank">Dinosaurs only showed up fairly recently on the time frame of the history of the entire Earth,</a> and we have discovered countless animals that predate them by millions of years. We are constantly making new discoveries about early life on Earth, including this very year, discoveries showing that life began <em>billions</em> of years ago. However, the fossils from billions of years ago are all basically just microscopic remnants of little microscopic single-celled organisms. Still plenty of complex animal life before dinosaurs though, lots of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/O4psa9D.jpg" target="_blank">weird sharks</a>, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YratuD9.jpg" target="_blank">giant bugs</a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HIFr9H3.jpg" target="_blank">monster fish</a> and things. Always more to discover.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets start by  having a look at the ages of material we <em>actually have</em> observed.</p>
<p>The first blunt observation we have is that the age range of geological materials is much narrower for oceanic rocks than it is for continental rocks. The oldest oceanic crust is about 340 Ma old, in the eastern Med basin; most oceanic crust is quite a bit younger. This makes sense because we observe that oceanic crust is preferentially destroyed by subduction (look up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics" target="_blank">primer on plate tectonics</a> for an overview).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuvvuagittuq_Greenstone_Belt" target="_blank">The oldest continental crust we've found so far is 3.8 Ga old, in the eastern part of the Canadian Shield</a> - that's ... pretty old. But the age of that oldest rock is complex and layered. The 3.8 Ga age is an U-Pb age of crystallisation, the age at which the magma solidified into a rock (it was a volcanic rock). But the very same sample was dated using another method (Nd/Sm geochronology). This yielded an age of 4.38 Ga - the meaning of this second age is different from, and complementary to, the first one. What this Sm/Nd age indicates is the time at which the volume of magma which ended up in that rock was extracted from the Earths mantle.</p>
<p>That 4.38 Ga age is extremely interesting, because we have also been estimating the age of the earth by dating meteorites, which we believe to be leftover material from the building of the Solar System. And the age of formation of most meteorites (4.5 Ga) is getting pretty close to that of the oldest dated event on Earth (4.38 Ga). Those specific rocks, located in the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt, were found about ten years ago; we might find older material still in the years to come. But we  expect the age of older materials to be somewhere within that range of 4.38 to 4.5 Ga.</p>
<p>So ... back to your initial question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have been measuring the age of earth by looking at the layers of ground, how do we know there aren't any older evidence underneath the thick snow of North pole?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, we don't. And that's why people like me and my colleagues keep studying northern rocks. Although it is worth pointing out <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/44/e9/e7/44e9e7aa779630d052f615ec48f69a47.jpg" target="_blank">the North Pole is in the Arctic ocean</a>, and not above a continent. But the rocks of the Arctic seafloor are under study, as are the rocks of the surrounding landmasses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or the deepest ocean floor that human has yet to discover?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentionned earlier, oceanic rocks tend to be destroyed much faster than continental ones. They are still being studied of course, and any abnormally old rocks in the oceanic crust which might be found will certainly be the object of intense scrutiny.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or even unknown creatures that lived before the dinosaurs..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're in luck there. The dinosaurs lived from about 230 Ma ago to 65 Ma ago, but the fossils of complex life forms are quite abundant and diversified in the preceeding time period starting around 541 Ma ago. During this earlier period in the history of life, critters started off in the oceans and eventually colonized the land. New species and genera are identified and described every year by paleontologists. You may want to have a look at the following references, and look up trilobites, anomalocarids, crinoids, orthocone cephalopods, graptolites and brachiopods, for starters:</p>

<p>If you're interested in weird critters that predated the dinosaurs, you should read up on Ediacaran Fauna.  There is a fossil bed in Australia's Ediacaran Hills that preserved a lot of life forms from when evolution was experimenting with early multicellular body forms.  There are some truly alien looking fossils in that area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Key misconception here, we estimate the age of the earth by dating other rocks we find from the early solar system (meteorites). What we've learned about stellar formation, some very esoteric math, and a number of very complicated computer simulations have narrowed down the potential age of the earth by ruling out many many hypothesized ages. We look at layers of the earth's crust to estimate how old the crust is, which is a different question almost entirely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
