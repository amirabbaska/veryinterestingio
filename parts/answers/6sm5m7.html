This thing will last for 2 minutes and then be gone, enjoy it and experience the moment. There will be hundreds of thousands of people with cameras going, dont pressure yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wondering if there’s a visual guide for those of us not in the path of totality? I live in western Iowa, so our % is in the 90s. I’m trying to convince my wife and others of a day trip to St. Joe, but it’s starting to look like I’m going to have to stay put. Will we still get a pretty decent view of the eclipse, or will I absolutely have to be in the path of totality to witness the “darkened sky” phenomenon?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the replies everyone. I ended up buying them from Lowe's and doing an in store pickup. <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/Eclipse-Paper-Glasses/1000255189" target="_blank">Link to glasses on Lowe's</a> provided by /u/Sunshiny_Day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The moon has been moving away from the earth as it continues to *steal energy from earth's rotation etc right.. and currently its just far enough out that we get both total and annular eclipses...</p>
<p>so how long ago was it that there used to be no annular eclipses on earth?</p>
<p>and how long before all eclipses on earth will only be annular?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
