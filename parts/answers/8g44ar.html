		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More or less yes.</p>
<p>There would be differences genetically, we're talking about ten thousand years or more of drift, but functionally speaking the child would grow up and fit in exactly like any other child.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say yes.</p>
<p>10,000 years ago, the only human species left on Earth was our own, meaning that the baby in question would be an Anatomically modern human, so they would be physically and mentally our equal.</p>
<p>Evidence shows that humans from all around the world had long been producing artwork depicting abstract ideas, such as the Lion-man, a mix between a lion and a man:</p>
<p>Sites such as Europe's Chauvet Cave and Australia's Bradshaw rock paintings bear ages greater than 10,000 years, and consistently depict artwork whose production would require some sort of spiritual, imaginative or abstract thinking:</p>
<p>So I'd wager than this person (lets assume he's male and call him Bob, to avoid too many &quot;him/hers&quot; and &quot;Baby Xs&quot;) would be able to do abstract mathematics and get a PHD in Biology.</p>
<p>Being the same species as us, Bob would have a growth rate not terribly different from our own. Having similar mental capabilities here, I'm sure he'd be able to communicate and socialize with other humans and build relationships, and have healthy offspring.</p>
<p>I should think that Bob wouldn't look too physically different from his/her contemporaries, nor would his peers think of Bob as an outsider, provided they didn't know that he was an anachronistic Pleistocene baby</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes for the most part. The only drawback is that there would be a plethora of diseases which his mom never encountered and therefore never passed on the necessary antibodies. Once he gets on the time machine and joins our present time, he will need to receive a lot of vaccines. If he makes it past that, he will live a normal life completely indistinguishable from other people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the time you're talking about.  According to wikipedia, the stone age lasted roughly 3.4 million years and ended between 8700 BCE and 2000 BCE with the advent of metalworking.  So a person from 4000 years ago, would be obviously human.  You wouldn't think twice if you passed them on the street, and they would be as smart as any of us.  But modern humans only go back 250,000 years, so beyond that, you'd get Homo heidelbergensis and Homo erectus and Homo habilis all decidedly unhuman looking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
