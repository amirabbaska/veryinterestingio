It's also why colors don't run nearly as much as they used to. The fabrics are better at holding color and preventing new colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is a field known as &quot;functional metagenomics&quot;.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern detergents are actually weaker now than they have been previously.</p>
<p>There was a very strong detergent in the 80s that was far more effective than they are now. The issue however is that detergents also damage the fabric they are cleaning. As this detergent was so strong it kept creating holes in the clothes it was cleaning and was ultimately pulled from sale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
