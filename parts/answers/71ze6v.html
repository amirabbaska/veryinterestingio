		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves warm food by adding energy to the food in the form of kinetic energy, or making things vibrate. Many different molecules or parts of molecules will vibrate from the range of microwaves given off.  Water turned to steam or heated water inside a plastic plate cover in the microwave heats food the most evenly  because it contains the steam/vapor around the food when I use my microwave.  At the same time the ceramic plate I sometimes use can get hotter than my food. This is evidence that more than water can vibrate from microwaves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes - water has strong absorption at 2.4GHz (microwave and wifi frequency), which means it's more effective than other non-conductive/dielectric materials. Other molecules will respond to the EM waves, but they won't necessarily resonate as strongly and heat up as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The microwave relies on being able to vibrate the molecules with the output energy. So it only really works on things that have a structure that will allow that, things like stone, glass, ceramic etc generally won't get hot. Basically anything with a strong internal structure, crystalline basically, won't really heat up much.<br />
But if you heat up something like glass first with a blowtorch then suck it in a microwave then you can melt the stuff as the initial heating has &quot;freed-up&quot; the molecules enough that they can absorb the incoming energy and vibrate more. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
