		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Originally because FOX didnt know what the fuck they were doing.</p>
<p>The first and foremost cause of FOX refusing to order new episodes after four production seasons is attributed to the price of the show and its decreasing popularity. Despite Futurama's pilot episode, &quot;Space Pilot 3000&quot;, being the most watched pilot episode on FOX when it aired,[3] the show had been decreasing slowly in popularity over time, and FOX was disappointed in the show, which they had assumed could gain a popularity like their other show, The Simpsons, and even within FOX, arguments arose regarding whether they had kept Futurama alive for too long.
However, despite FOX's own disappointment with the show, FOX themselves were to some degree responsible for the decreasing viewership of the show. Indeed, its popularity had not gone down, but rather the amount of viewers it had, as the show had moved to a less popular timeslot since &quot;I, Roommate&quot;. In addition to the less popular timeslot, it was also highly unstable, as FOX would often put off an episode for another event, e.g. sporting or news reports. This made new episodes highly unpredictable for viewers.
Indeed, FOX's unstable airing eventually led to the airing of five broadcast seasons, rather than the four produced.[4][5] Not only were episodes aired out of order, but examples like &quot;The Route of All Evil&quot; had to be pushed back two entire seasons.[6] This unpredictable nature, the unpopular timeslot eventually lead to the demise of the viewership and the show's popularity in terms of numbers.
Despite the fact that &quot;Space Pilot 3000&quot;, the pilot, was a very popular pilot episode in terms of viewership,[3][7] as well as the second episode, &quot;The Series Has Landed&quot;,[8] whose popularity was attributed to the Sunday line up it was in, with the lead-in show of The Simpsons as well as X-Files after the show, FOX decided to move the show to its Tuesday line up instead, beginning with &quot;I, Roommate&quot;, which as expected hurt the show's ratings.[9] And the show continued to dwell on these ratings for four broadcast seasons.</p>

<p>TLDR- FOX kept changing the timeslot and playing things out of order, saw loss of veiwers as loss of populatity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Television shows stay on the air because they are successful, not because they are good. </p>
<p>Futurama got canceled. Two and a Half Men was still the #1 show with Ashton fucking Kutcher.</p>
<p>A great example would be the old Sci-Fi channel's show Farscape. Excellent show. One of the best science fiction shows ever made. But it was expensive, and the execs at the network didn't believe they could expand its audience any further, so it was canceled in favor of higher margin programming. Television networks run on money, not on quality. If both money and quality intersect (like the case with most HBO shows, for example), it's more of an exception, rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Success, more often than not, means appealing to the broadest audience possible, and that often means a lower common denominator.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being a good show doesnt mean a lot of people like it. A show may have great acting, amazing plot, good dialogue, etc., but the genre/premise/etc. may just not interest people. My father doesn't take animation seriously, he would never watch Futurama, no matter how much he would like it if he did.  </p>
<p>There are a lot of shows people praise, but the premise of some are of just no interest to me, that doesn't mean I can't acknlowedge it's a good show.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe I had read somewhere that Groening went through hell to get Fox to put it on the air, and they kept putting it in terrible time slots. Poor and irregular scheduling to make room for sports or other events would make even dedicated viewers stop tuning in.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wikipedia was my source, as a college student that's good enough for me.</p>
