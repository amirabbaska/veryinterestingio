<p>They are designed to curve when you throw them, and if you throw them just right, they will make a loop and return to their starting point.  If you throw them wrong, they can go anywhere.</p>
<p>Note that not all boomerangs are designed to return, and they were originally used as hunting sticks, carefully balanced to fly straight at prey.  A bad hunting stick would curve one way or another, and become more of a toy than a tool.  Eventually, they were designed to curve a lot, enough to return to the thrower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You throw them vertically oriented holding one of the bent ends with the other end facing out and slightly to the right (if you're throwing right handed). </p>
<p>There is a humped side (an airfoil like the top of an airplane wing). That side faces to your left. When you throw, that side sees ever so slightly more lift. As it flies, the lift produced on the inner facing face, pulls it toward the center of a large circle just like gravity pulls the orbiting moon toward the earth as it tries to fly past. The result is circular motion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine an airplane where one wing generates much more lift than the other. This would cause the plane to tilt or bank. This tilting would direct the lift down at an angle and the result is the plane would turn and fly in a circle unless a pilot adjusted the ailerons. </p>
<p>A boomerang is a wing that spins through the air. The side of the boomerang that is spinning in the direction of flight would have air moving faster over that part of it, while the side spinning backwards from the direction of flight would have less air moving over it, and create less lift. The difference in lift causes it to bank and turn just like the plane example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
