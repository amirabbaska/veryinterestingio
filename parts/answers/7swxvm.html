		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, those symptoms are due to the activity of your immune system. There are lots of different types of viruses, but your body only has a few methods for trying to get rid of them. For example: fever, inflammation (sore throat and joints), and physical removal via mucus (congestion and sneezing).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the symptoms you are experiencing are caused by the immune response (immune system activation), not the virus itself. These are symptoms like body aches, fever and malaise.</p>
<p>Sore throat and congestion are not general symptoms for a virus though. It indicates that the virus is affecting the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I could expand on OP's question, why does our immune system make us feel bad? There are plenty of other automatic processes the body carries out without us being aware, why don't we just developed a cough or runny nose and think, &quot;Oh, I must've picked up a virus, better drink more fluids,&quot; and still FEEL fine? (As in not need to miss work or school.) The only thing I can think of is that, evolutionarily, those who felt bad were then compelled to rest, which allowed the body to more successfully fight off the virus. Just a theory though...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are the cardinal signs of the release of an anti-viral protein called 'interferon', a family of proteins. Epithelial cells in airways, gi system, other cells release it in response to viral infection. It blocks invasion and slows infection in a non-specific way, giving the defense time to rally more specific and more potent defenses. Those can bring their own miseries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
