		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the comments here focus on the fact that most of the free porn out there are either samplers or low quality amateur work. However, the proliferation of these tube sites with an indigestible mountain of freely available porn points towards other factors as well.</p>
<p>Why doesn't the porn industry crack down on copyright issues as hard as Hollywood? To get to the root of this issue, we have to think about the role of a movie/film versus that of porn.</p>
<p>Let's first agree that both pornos and blockbuster films are scarce goods. They are limited, and they have some value to consumers. The point I want to make is that porn is commoditized; movies are not. What I mean here is that, for an average consumer of porn, it doesn't matter if they are going to watch Lusty Milfs 5 or Busty Soccer Moms 7; they're just going to pick the one that's most easily available to them. On the other hand, movie goers definitely care if they are watching Star Wars versus Star Trek.</p>
<p>There a variety of reasons for this, but the net result is the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pornos are commodities, and they are priced at commodity prices. Within a certain porn genre, all else being equal, one film is more or less indistinguishable from another.</li>
<li>Movies are hard to commoditize. Even within the same genre, you'll be hard-pressed to convince someone bent on watching the new Star Wars movie to settle for Star Trek, and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are certain exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fans of a certain porn actor/actress will have a stickier (heh) preference towards certain films, and to them, they are not indistinguishable from other films.</li>
<li>Certain genres of movie films are nearly commoditized. For example, people who go for one rom-com probably wouldn't mind if they were told that they had to settle for another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, there are two sets of dynamics we need to look at. First, we need to discuss what the outcome of this type of market is; next, we need to discuss why this is the way things are.</p>
<h3>So what if Porn is a commodity good?</h3>
<p>Well, since porn (especially within a specific genre) is more or less indistinguishable from other porn, they undergo heavy competition. In particular, the competitive nature of the market tend to push their price down towards a nearly-optimal commodity price. That is, porn in its current form tend to be lowly-valued and directly selling porn (in the current state of affairs) is a low-margin affair. This can be seen not only by the proliferation of cheap studio access passes ($1 a month specials are pushing it these days), but also by the fact that most of the porn that are consumed costs absolutely nothing!</p>
<p>Therefore, since porn is valued so cheaply, it's actually very inefficient to sell them directly. Instead, porn producers and distributors have realized that selling the attention of users of their pages to interested advertisers actually captures higher revenues. This is why you see some of the most clever ad-blocker workarounds on these porn sites; that's where they get most of their revenues from, even the more reputable sites.</p>
<p>In addition, because producing porn is a low-margin affair itself, there's really no reason to spend a lot of money towards a high-production film. As a result, the porno landscape is dominated by near-amateur level work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because block-buster films cannot be commoditized, they:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are much pricier, and they</li>
<li>Tend to be higher production value, because in order to price their films at a higher price, they need to give some justification that their goods are higher quality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, companies like Hulu and Netflix are trying to create revenue by commoditizing the movie/film sector, so our perceptions may change in the future. Additionally, porn wasn't always a commodity. When distribution cost (the problem of getting a porn film to the hands of a consumer) was a significant bottle-neck, they couldn't be sold at a commodity price because their supply was much more limited than today.</p>
<h3>So what changed?</h3>
<p>The internet. Let's look at the major way in which porn and films were consumed before the rise of the internet. Blockbuster movies were usually viewed in a movie theater; porn usually in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>Once internet speed and bandwidth were fast/large enough, it was able to &quot;commoditize&quot; (here, improve the efficiency, hence lowering the price of) the distribution of movies to your home. Porn was hit hard by this innovation, but movies were still more or less something that you still had to watch in theater.</p>
<p>Because the porn industry was suddenly able to streamline their supply-chain, porn-sites started popping up. This lowered the barrier of entry into the porn industry, because now you don't have to negotiate deals with brick-n-mortar Adult XXX Videomax store fronts. You just need a website.</p>
<p>With the main distribution bottle-neck solved, content started to flood the internet. As a result of the increase of the supply, its price dropped significantly. As a result, the internet commoditized porn and made it a relatively cheap (discounting opportunity cost) venture to go into.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anyways, other digitizable goods that were/are commoditized by the internet includes video games, music, news, journals, and to a certain extent, movies and television shows. For each one of these goods, you'll often find a similar content pathway. You have way more green-lit Steam games than what has been stocked at Game Stop; Spotify has more music than you can fit on an iPod; etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pornhub, youporn, redtube, and most other main porn websites are all owned by the same company, MindGeek, that owns major porn production cimpanies such as Babes, Brazzers, etc. It is basically a monopoly of producers and distributors, which means that the movies are uploaded directly as they are produced, since the views end up as revenue for the company either way.</p>
<p>Many others producers also upload incomplete videos to these websites in hopes of attracting premium customers. it's the equivalent of handing out movie trailers to cinemas, but the trailers themselves are usually enough to satisfy most viewers.</p>
<p>Since they can't stream in cinemas and the rental industry doesn't pay ad well, the production of online videos is prominent in the industry; that also makes it easier to pirate, and it is difficult to win lawsuits against a large company such as mindgeek so I doubt people would try. You also have a steady production of free videos like amateur porn.</p>
<p>You can find many regular movies online for free, it's just that they are lower quality or not protected by copyright. The movies that are nkt readily available are the ones produced by huge distributors, who make their money off official sales in cinema and dvd stores. </p>
<p>Also, With porn, the demand for higher quality is lower, and the production process is easier (budget and time wise) so there are a lot more movies being produced on a regular basis. You could probably make 100 movies in the time it takes to plan out and film a blockbuster, no bureaucracy to stop the process in its tracks, and the budget is minimal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that most of the free porn out there is either amateur porn (which costs almost nothing to make), free samples from a pay site, or pirated.</p>
<p>Think about it this way. Literally anyone with a camera can make a serviceable porno for literally or almost nothing, but even a half-decent independent movie takes at least a couple hundred thousand dollars to make. Usually millions.</p>
<p>So naturally, there are going to be more porno movies than regular movies to begin with.</p>
<p>Since it costs so much less to make, you could potentially fill an ad-supported site with thousands of user-made videos, free samples from pay sites, or straight-up pirated porn (especially on sites that allow user uploads, since you get plausible deniability) for little or no cost, and then collect all that sweet ad revenue.</p>
<p>To do that with a movie site, you'd have to either pay to make the movie, or pay to license the movie. Which could cost you more than it costs to upload thousands of amateur porno clips. But you'd still only have one movie! So it would be very hard to do it 100% on ad revenue. Since a movie is much longer (two hours +) than a typical porn clip (5-20 minutes), your bandwidth costs per user are also much higher. Especially if, you know, they finish browsing early.</p>
<p>It's also the reason why YouTube is FULL of people talking about their opinions into their webcams but only has a handful of properly free ad-supported (not pirated) movies. Any moron with a mic and a camera can become a YouTuber, but making even a shitty movie requires a budget and at least basic film-making skills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the problem is you are comparing Pornhub with Hollywood when you should be comparing Pornhub with youtube. </p>
<p>Youtube is full of free content made by people who just wanted to make something and put it out there or to rake in a little revenue from ads / merchandise / exposure. It's also a dumping ground of stuff that nobody owns the rights to anymore (or the people who do don't care to challenge anyone for it). </p>
<p>Porn sites are the same thing: amatuer videos made by people who just wanted to make something, or companies uploading shortened clips of their professional stuff for exposure and advertising reasons. When you see professional stuff on these sites it's either a clip of a much larger video uploaded for the reasons I stated before, a movie made by a company that doesn't exist anymore (porn companies come and go like the tides) or doesn't have the resources to constantly challenge pirate uploads, or a pirate upload nobody has caught yet (many porn sites aren't as helpful with fulfilling take-down requests as youtube is).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hope this helps a little but I watched an interview with this crazy porn recruiter once. The man claimed to be Ron Jeremy's cousin and I feel that might have been one of his trust-inducing lines though he did look a bit like Jeremy. His 'job' was waiting at the Hollywood bus station and recruiting witless new 'actresses' into the porn business.</p>
<p>Anyways, he explained porn in such ELI5 ways. He simply explained that in fact they are totally aware that 99% of porn viewers actually do not care about the topic, theme, fetish (or no fetish). Typical guy would just as easily watch &quot;Spanking Lesbians part 76&quot; as he'd watch 'Shaved Juggs' <em>and</em> that they (porn makers) they know full well 99% will pay the lowest price or watch free.. whatever is quickly available. </p>
<p>But wait.. see, he explains, the money is totally in that tiny 1% fraction. All the money. 99% of the cash comes from a tiny little group. Obsessed, niche-market infatuated 'fetish' kink people. </p>
<p>So what they do is make &quot;Lactating Jugs parts 1-110&quot; because they will barely make a penny from the 99% of viewers who are totally satisfied seeing ANY Jugs. They are a 'wash', a neutral, nothing either way.</p>
<p>BUT holy hell.. whoever is the 1% (or.0001%) he explains are psychofans. Yes, they will watch the free episodes but more importantly if they are who signs up for the mailing lists, notifications of new episodes, the exclusive 'lactating jugs VIP memberships' and they will drive across LA in rush hour to be the very first to stand in line paying $59.99 for the new Blu-Ray release of Lac-Jugs 111. Oh and hoarding 110 previous DVDs and Blu-rays like they were made of gold. </p>
<p>In a real way, they actually want to make 99% of their movies available for free HOPING that big free net catches 1% who will then gladly pay a lot of money for the 1% of movies they hold back as pay-only for a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
