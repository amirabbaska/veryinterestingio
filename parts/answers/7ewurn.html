		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skunking occurs when beer is exposed to certain wavelengths of light. This is why beer is typically bottled in brown bottles. Clear and green bottles protect the beer less, which is why popular brands in those color bottles often have the distinctive flavor. </p>
<p>The chemical responsible for the distinctive flavor is called MBT, and is produced when the energy in light causes the riboflavin (produced by yeast during fermentation) in beer to chemically react with the alpha acids from the hops. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Warming and re-chilling beer does not make it &quot;skunky.&quot; Light interacting with the hop compounds causes the skunkiness. That's why it's prevalent in beers that use clear glass. And that is the reason Corona pushes the whole lime business.  </p>
<p>As far as glass goes, clear is worst. Green offers some protection. Brown offers the most protection. Cans, however, are king.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically a chemical reactiin caused by light makes beer skunky. Check this out. It's a little bit long but it's pretty informative. They talk about skunky beer 8 minutes into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/uxh4I9bfjSo" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/uxh4I9bfjSo</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
