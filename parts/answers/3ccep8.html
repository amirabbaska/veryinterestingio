		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Easy way to determine this yourself.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/where/" target="_blank">Google how far away Voyager is</a>. Presently, it's 19,622,661,552 km away.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=19%2C622%2C661%2C552%20km%20%2F%201%20light%20year" target="_blank">Google the distance divided by 1 light year</a>. That will show you how long it takes light to get to Voyager from Earth, in years. Of course it won't be sharp enough to see any details but I realize this is just a thought exercise. </li>
<li>Since it's only about 2x10^-2 years away, lets have google <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;q=%2819%2C622%2C661%2C552+km+%2F+1+light+year%29+*+8760" target="_blank">tell us how many light-hours away it is</a> by multiplying the light years by 8760, the number of hours in a typical year.</li>
</ol>
<p>At 19.6 billion km away, it takes light (and all other radio waves, of course) approximately 18 hours to reach Voyager.  Issuing an instruction to V'ger by radio telemetry means pressing SEND and getting a response no sooner than 36 hours later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been waiting to get an answer to my theory for years now. If we were ever able to reach alpha centauri (4.36 lightyears away) and we'd put a giant mirror there. Now we use a telescope - let's say a v20 version of the James Webb Space telescope - and look in this mirror, which is directed to earth. Would we have created a device that allows us to look back in time more than 8 years? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At first I thought this question must be about Voyager from the Star Trek series because our Voyager doesnt travel faster than the speed of light and so will never see anything before the year it was launched.</p>
<p>If we were talking about the  USS Voyager then it would see Earth sometime around 64,000 BCE. AS for our Voyager it would see about 18 hours ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same year it is now, unless you asked this question <em>just</em> after New Years. Voyager 1 is about 18 light-hours away; the current time is about 2:20 AM UTC on July 7 2015, so the light reaching Voyager 1 right now left the Earth around 8:10 AM UTC on July 6.</p>
