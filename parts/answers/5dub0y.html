		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback#Negative" target="_blank">Wikipedia has a few</a>, but the most important is blackbody radiation. The hotter you are the more heat is radiated. There are a few others but they are hard to measure. Whether clouds are positive of negative feedback is being researched, but given that Venus has super-thick clouds and a runaway greenhouse effect I'm not betting on that to save us.</p>
<p>One thing that has affected the climate in the past is atmospheric pollution, like volcano eruptions. One well aimed meteorite would produce a nuclear winter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I learned about an interesting one studying aqueous geochemistry. </p>
<p>Most periods of increased global temperatures are strongly correlated to periods of high concentrations of atmospheric carbon, so accordingly we are concerned with the concentration of carbon dioxide in our modern atmosphere. At the air-ocean interface, carbon flux occurs as carbon dioxide is absorbed by ocean water and converted into carbonate ions, which through a series of chemical reactions can join with other ions dissolved in the water such as calcium and precipitate into solid carbonate rock which settles on the ocean floor. This carbonate rock is essentially atmospheric carbon that has been sequestered in solid form, just like plant matter is.</p>
<p>The kicker is that colder water can hold more carbonate dissolved in it and warmer water can hold less. This is why all the pretty 'white sand' beaches are at tropical latitudes; the white sand is calcium carbonate and water has to be above a certain temperature (and away from the polluting effects of silicate sedimentation) for calcium carbonate to precipitate. Heating the oceans decreases their ability to hold carbonate ions in solution and increases the volume of carbonate precipitation.</p>
<p>In short, raising the global temperature increases the rate at which oceans sequester atmospheric carbon as limestone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Potential negative feedback terms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>higher temperatures could lead to greater cloud cover</p>

<li>
<p>more CO2 could increase plant growth, slurping up CO2</p>

<p>higher temperatures could increase plant growth, slurping up CO2</p>

<li>
<p>increased plant growth could increase the amount of cloud cover</p>
</li>
<li>climate changes could change ocean circulation in ways that increase plant growth and/or change the oceans' speed at absorbing CO2</li>
</ul>
<p>These are in general pretty hard to model. There's a reason the climate models have such enormous error bars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stable systems are dominated by negative feedback. Positive feedback loops play out quickly because of their nature. Thus, many of the normal mechanisms that take up CO2 act as negative feedback. The more CO2 in the atmosphere, the more taken up by plants and especially the ocean where it can be deposited as minerals. Many people think these negative feedback mechanisms could max out with more warming.</p>
<p>edit: changed play to max</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the ocean has absorbed most of the CO2 we have put up, but there is only so much carbonation it can take.</p>
<p>volcanic eruptions put lots of dust into the air to block sunlight</p>
<p>ice and snow reflect sunlight, but then added heat melts it away... perhaps more sever ice/snow storms could sporadically help</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
