		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, that is not a law.  Second, many countries have not signed or ratified.  Third, in the US at least, you can hire unpaid interns only if certain criteria are met.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The internship is similar to training/education which would be given in an educational environment.</li>
<li>The experience is for the benefit of the intern.</li>
<li>The intern does not displace regular employees but works under close supervision of existing staff.</li>
<li>The employer providing the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the intern and on occasion its operations may actually be impeded.</li>
<li>There is no guarantee of a job at the conclusion of the internship.</li>
<li>Both parties understand that the intern is not entitled to wages for the internship.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UN treaties are really not the place to try to enfoce something like this. They have zero enforcement power., and really just serve as a prebuilt mechanism for large countries to try to get sanctions passed every now and then, if they want to. Also if violating it were really that much of an issue, a country could just pull out of the treaty. The place to stop this is at the national level, with laws that forbid it, and a Government that is interested in enforcing those laws. Trying to bring real change from UN actions is unwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>International conventions have absolutely no bearing on US law and no authority in the US. We are a sovereign nation. So appealing to them means nothing. </p>
<p>Additionally while there are laws regarding wages, and laws regarding slavery there is nothing that bans you from volunteer work. That is what unpaid internships are classified as. You are a volunteer, not a forced worker and as such are not by default entitled to any kind of pay. You also agree to this by taking the volunteer position. </p>
<p>That said, some States have heavily restricted what qualifies as an unpaid internship or outright banned them. But the specifics vary by State. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Legally, interns MUST be paid IF the business is benefitting from their labor in any way. An unpaid internship is supposed to be strictly educational, even to the <em>detriment</em> of the business that is helping you. (People spending time teaching you, etc)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
