		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mainly because he has been the face of the company for decades and one of it's most recognizable figures because of it. And while he may not have had as large of an effect on some of Marvel's most successful series, a lot of his work for the company helped make those series more successful and make Marvel the brand it is.</p>
<p>Here's a really good <a href="http://zak-site.com/Great-American-Novel/ff_Lee-Kirby.html" target="_blank">article</a> talking about Stan Lee's and Jack Kirby's collective influences on Marvel and here is the author's list of what Stan Lee did for Marvel:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Easy to read dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal touches to the stories, based on great experience of what sells and what connects with readers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plot changes to connect with and interest readers (Stan had read a lot of comics and knew what sold).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tireless marketing, so the comic sells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A successful comic company. Stan Lee is also probably the best comics editor in history (according to &quot;Stan Lee and The Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book&quot;). No other comics publisher, and certainly no other Marvel Editor In Chief has achieved so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creative freedom (at least before merchandising provided significant revenue). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He commissioned artists to create new characters and also brought back old characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He created the links: the continuity that we call the Marvel Universe. He created the footnotes, encouraging people to buy back issues. This created the back issue industry, which allowed the comics industry to ride out the bad times and increased the profile and earning power of the best talent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gave publicity to previously ignored people: inkers, letterers, office workers, etc. Without Stan the artists would still be largely unknown and penniless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By conquering the media and being so likable he made comics respectable. Remember that in the 1950s comics were treated as either harmful or kids' stuff. He changed this.</p>
</li>
<li>He increased reader loyalty.  The Hucksterism, brand loyalty, freedom to artists and relaxed letters pages came from EC comics and their &quot;usual gang of idiots.&quot; The only unique innovation was to link it into one big story, the Marvel Universe. This was thanks to Kirby's characters who were powerful enough to maintain long, complex stories with distinct personalities. But still it was Stan who chose those elements and Stan who connected them. This is no small thing. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have any further interest at all in the history of Marvel, I would urge you to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Comics-The-Untold-Story/dp/0061992119" target="_blank">The Untold Story of Marvel Comics</a>.  It's fantastic, and there really isn't any other business that you can compare to Comics, but even more specifically Marvel because the history of the Editors in Chief and the owners is so absolutely crazy.  You could say the history of DC is similar, but even then, they had a much more organized and healthy business model than Marvel.</p>
<p>Better yet, get it on Audible, I listened to it several times and the history and relationships of the creators are pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Stan the Man became Editor in Chief early on and even though Ditko made Spider-Man what it is today, and Kirby made many other titles what they are today, you can say that Stan is the hype man that encouraged Marvel Magazines, Fan Mail, College Tours, and the <em>family</em> that is Marvel (which really never existed).  He pushed for Marvel to have a <em>face</em> and a personality behind the company and he became that face.</p>
<p>Ditko never cared for the lime light like that and the early lime light he got was him getting thrown under the bus per se by Stan.  In fact, Stan threw a lot of them under the bus and didn't back them up in their time of need on several occasions.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:  Lots of typos</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pick up an old Marvel comic and in many of them, there is a letter to the readers about this and that in the Marvel comics universe (Excelsior!) Stan Lee wrote most of these letters and often has a drawing or photo of himself beside it.  Also, he has often willingly put himself in the spotlight to speak for Marvel and comics in general.  So in a sense, Stan Lee is (and has been) the public voice and face of Marvel.  And lastly, ask any fan who the other people you listed are and they will know them immediately, if not intimately, so they do get credit by fandom, if not the general public.</p>
<p>Also, Ditko is a notorious recluse who does not want to be photographed or talk to anyone-look up the documentary In Search of Steve Ditko.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because he was made to be the face of Marvel. In the 70s, he became a publisher and manager instead of writing comic books. People of my generation knew his name not because he wrote the comics, but because there's be a page inside the comics with a few paragraphs he'd write. I can't name the guy who wrote or inked those Spider-Man comics in the mid 70s, but I remember the guy who wrote a note to me and other True Believers in every issue. His name was Stan Lee.</p>
<p>This was the reason he became the public face of Marvel Comics. It wasn't by accident, it was by design.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>Stan Lee was publisher Marty Goodman's brother-in-law, so he always had Marvel's interests at heart and in turn, was given the keys to the kingdom. (i.e editorial control, veto power, providing an overall sense of direction)</li>
<li>It also helped that Stan's choices (Ditko over Kirby on Spider-Man, his ideas about the different characters/teams, even the decision to run something like Conan The Barbarian through Marvel) led to an ever-expanding fan-base and more money.</li>
<li>He was around for the longest time, compared to all others you mentioned. </li>
<li>Jack Kirby was happy drawing by himself. Stan was managing multiple plotlines, people, and upper management.</li>
<li>Steve Ditko left Marvel after a few issues of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange.</li>
<li>Roy Thomas and most people of his generation were completely beholden to the Stan Lee school of storytelling.</li>
<li>John Buscema did not like superheroes, he found his niche in Conan and stuck to it, with the occasional foray into superheroes.</li>
<li>Claremont came in much later, and by that time, Stan's name was already entrenched in Marvel history.</li>
