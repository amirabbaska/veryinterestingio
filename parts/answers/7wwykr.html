		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can tell you how bleach works on some types of stains.  So some Compounds have color because of the molecule is a conjugated system. Meaning that more than 8 groups of alternating double then single bonds in a row all share electrons. When light hits this conjugated system it absorbs then releases energy that we see in the visible spectrum. Bleach comes in and breaks  double bond(s) in this system making them single bonds.   This breaks the conjugated system up either completely or into smaller conjugated systems. So  for example, where you had 8 groups of alternating double then single bonds you now have 2 conjugated systems of  4 groups which emit light in the ultraviolet spectrum and it’s not visible, BUT the stain is still there, you just can’t see it.
I suspect the stains are hard to remove because intermolecular forces between the stain maker to the fabric. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a matter of what the stain likes more: water or cloth? Stains usually are made up by fatty molecules (oils, fats, etc) that don't mix up with water (think oil and water, they don't mix together and form an emulsion). This means the stain likes to stick on cloth, rather than getting dissolved into water...unless you help the stain in the trip! And to help the stain, you need surfactants! (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant</a>)<br />
Surfactants are molecules made by up a &quot;fatty&quot; lipophilic part, and a &quot;watery&quot; hydrophilic part: these molecules bind the fatty part in the stain, then when you rinse the cloth with water the watery part brings them from the cloth to the water side. Easy isn't it?<br />
Disclaimer: I hold a master's degree in chemistry. Not exactly surfactant chemistry, but I got to study the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm still looking forward to somebody answering the main question (removing the particles instead of uncoloring them).</p>
<p>Perhaps some points can lead us closer to the solution? Edit: /r/Mortorz managed to answer some of this while I was writing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Organic/protein stains are easier to remove on synthetic and cotton clothes than wool and silk, because we can use enzymes and/or bleach, which would destroy wool or silk fibers. Is there any hope of cleaning wool at all?</li>
<li>Many of the detergents are &quot;surface active&quot;. What does this mean? Why does this work?</li>
<li>Good old soap contains fatty acids. What I remember is that one of the ends of those molecules is polar (?) and another isn't and that's how they manage to attach to fat and other organic (not so polar) molecules and make them soluble in water (a polar solvent). Is this true?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are also enzymes in detergent! Proteases can break down protein stains, lipases can break down any fatty stains, amylases can break down starch based stains, and cellulases break down the cotton that is stained just enough to break down the fibers that are stained without eating holes in your clothes. Fun fact: the cellulases were discovered during the war in Vietnam. They are produced by a fungus and would eat holes into the tents. There still is a lot of research being done to optimize the enzymes and the conditions they work best under. A lot of work went into getting the detergents to work in cold water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stains can be caused by several different processes. Persistent stains tend to be the result of certain chemicals with a strong color, chemically bonding to natural fibers in clothing. </p>
<p>An example being wine, blood, or coffee. </p>
<p>Blood contains iron(+3) ions which are complexed with proteins that make them reasonably water soluble. However exposure to oxygen and light over time destroys those proteins, which liberates the iron ions. These then form highly insoluble compounds with oxygen, hydroxide, or carbonate ions commonly present in water. This &quot;sets&quot; the iron into the fabric fibers and makes it difficult to remove.</p>
<p>The color of coffee is due to various tannic acids  found in many plants.  Note that some kinds of tannins have been used to create inks since prehistoric times. </p>
<p>These have the ability to react with hydroxide (-OH) side groups found in most natural materials. Cotton or wool for example.  This reaction occurs slowly under most conditions, but failure to immediately rinse a coffee spill can cause some of the tannic acids to permanently link themselves to the cloth fibers. This makes the stain impossible to remove except by chemical means. </p>
<p>The process of deliberate dyeing natural fabrics and threads is actually the same one as that which creates these kind of stains.</p>
<p>In dyeing, the fabric or thread is soaked in a basic, astringent solution called a &quot;mordant.&quot;  The articles to be dyed is then soaked in a solution containing an acid and the dye compound for hours or days.  This causes some of the dye molecules to chemically bond to the fibers. The article is then washed several times in a mildly basic solution containing washing soda (sodium carbonate) this neutralizes any remaining unreacted dye and washes it away, while setting the color in the fabric.</p>
<p>Stains may also occur when some type of binding agent that is highly insoluble in water becomes absorbed by clothing fibers, which traps pigment particles. </p>
<p>Screen printing on shirts does this deliberately by applying flexible wash resistant paint to a shirt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
