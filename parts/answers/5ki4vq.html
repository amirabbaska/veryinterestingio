<p>tl;dr they bleed to death; develop eclampsia (very high blood pressure with fitting); get infections; develop large blood clots in vital organs; and a multitude of less common things. </p>
<p>Investing in high quality midwifery, obstetrics, anaesthesia (and paediatrics for baby) is what reduces the death rates once there are good standards of public health. How much that happens in your own country is a matter of politics. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just transported an infant.<br />
The mother's placenta separated prematurely (heavy loss of blood and no air supply for the infant) but she was brought in on time by her husband.<br />
A c-section and further operations were done on her  (she's stable afaik). The infant had to be revived (about 15min) and was then placed in an incubator for transport. It will most likely survive but needs specialised treatment to reduce brain damage (basically it will be kept a bit colder than usual) which it will receive in the specialised clinic.    </p>

<p>cnn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's going on? A range of experts made clear to me that there isn't any one factor to explain the increase, but a number of issues, including obesity-related complications such as hypertension and diabetes, the dramatic increase in the number of cesarean section births, a lack of access to affordable, quality health care and more women giving birth at older ages. </p>
<p>Record-keeping changes might also explain some of the upward trend, experts say.

<p>The CNN article completely avoids mentioning what's going on in Texas, whereas,</p>
<p>time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Access is inconsistent: Between 2000 to 2015, Texas saw a spike in maternal mortality while the state also underwent changes to reproductive health services, including the closure of several clinics offering abortions and other services. In 2011, the state’s family planning budget was cut by two-thirds. Experts say the lack of access is probably not solely responsible for the state’s dramatic spike in deaths, but as The Texas Tribune reports, it may have exacerbated the issue. “I’ve done my best to try to investigate this as a data error and I can’t find any changes to account for it,” says MacDorman. “It’s very concerning what’s happening in Texas.”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up Preeclampsia and Eclampsia. Now it can be treated, but can lead to death if not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eclampsia is the onset of seizures (convulsions) in a woman with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy in which there is high blood pressure and either large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction. Onset may be before, during, or after delivery. Most often it is during the second half of pregnancy. The seizures are of the tonic–clonic type and typically last about a minute. Following the seizure there is typically either a period of confusion or coma. Complications include aspiration pneumonia, cerebral hemorrhage, kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are part of a larger group of conditions known as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</p>
