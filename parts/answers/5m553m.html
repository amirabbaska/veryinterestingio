		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pilot here. The weather has a serious effect on aviation so it's extremely important to understand how it works.</p>
<p>Many of the answers in here are either saying &quot;It's because clouds only form in warmer air&quot; and &quot;The clouds insulate the ground preventing the heat escaping. Believe it or not, they are both as accurate as much as they are inaccurate and neither explanation is technically incorrect.</p>
<p>Here's the straight dope though: Clouds have no bearing on whether or not it will be hot or cold, regardless of the time of year or where you live. So what dictates whether it will be hot or cold? That would be the sun and it's position.</p>
<p>In short, clouds are a symptom of a warm day, the clouds themselves do not cause it to be warm. Equally, a lack of cloud does not cause it to be cold. A lack of clouds is <strong><em>because</em></strong> it's a cold day.</p>
<p>So to your question then. Why does it always seem colder when the sky is clear during winter? And why are people insisting that the clouds insulate the earth and make it warmer?</p>
<p>It's actually all to do with air pressure.</p>
<p>Air like all forms of gas has mass and weight. You can't see it but its a physical thing you can touch and move. And like most gassy things on earth, if you heat it up it expands. And by expanding it becomes thinner. This means hot air is thinner and less dense than cold air.</p>
<p>So cold air is thicker and heavy, thus the &quot;pressure&quot; of its weight is high, therefore we have &quot;High&quot; air pressure. Warm air is lighter and less dense and rises more easily, therefore it weighs less and thus its pressure is low, so we have &quot;Low&quot; air pressure.</p>
<p>Us pilots love cold days because the air pressure is high and the air is nice and thick. It makes for some good flyin'. Especially if your in a smaller aircraft, you get to save some fuel too as you can lean your fuel mixture back a bit more! Your also at reduced risking of icing up to a certain point on a cold day (Which surprises most people) which is important because icing is very, very bad on a plane.</p>
<p>The other reason that we like cold days is because clouds cannot form generally below a certain height. This is a massive simplification but clouds form when moisture in the air rises with warm air higher and higher until the air begins to cool down and cools to a point where it can no longer carry the moisture. This is referred to as the &quot;Dew point&quot;. It then forms a cloud. If this process continues long enough to a critical mass within a certain amount of time it becomes rain at some point.</p>
<p>Warm air carries more moisture than cold air because its thinner (Thus lower air pressure). Beyond a certain temperature cold air carries very little moisture indeed. If the air is too cold to carry this moisture (Water vapour) up in the first place, clouds simply cannot form and thus this is the reason you never see clouds on a really cold day.</p>
<p>So why are people banging on about clouds insulating the ground and why are they both right and wrong??</p>
<p>Firstly, as the sun shines on earth, it heats the earth up and some of this heat is radiated back out to space, this much is accurate. However whether clouds have any bearing on this process depends on the time of day.</p>
<p>During the day, if cloud forms it actually prevents the majority of the sunlight from reaching earth and thus absorbs or radiates the heat back into space at the cloud level. The heat never makes it to earth and the effect of this is the day feels cooler. However during the day, cloud itself does very little to insulate the earth's heat because that's basically where clouds are coming from as a I described above.</p>
<p>At night though it's a different story. As the part of earth you're on moves out of the sun's rays and starts to cool, the heat that was absorbed by the planet radiates back out to space. With no cloud coverage, this process happens very quickly and the night becomes quite cold.</p>
<p>However if there are clouds, they absorb some of this radiation and slow the process down and the night feels warmer because it's taking longer for the absorbed heat to be released back to space.</p>
<p>However the rules of cloud creation still very much apply, so if it was cold to begin with during the day, there is likely to be very little cloud in the night. It all depends on how much moisture is in the air.</p>
<p>In order to simplify this I have left quite a bit out of this including how wind is formed from differences in low and high air pressure and hot and cold fronts which complicate things tremendously but you now have a base knowledge of cloud formation in a static atmosphere.</p>
<p>I hope that gives you a greater understanding of it but if you need a TL;DR then that would be this: Clouds form because its warm and do not form when it's cold. If it's a cold day, that is the reason your not seeing any clouds, it's not cold BECAUSE there are no clouds.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thank you for the gold kind stranger. Also thank you to /u/devilscolonic who pointed out a paragraph I've messed up somehow by deleting part of it when I added a comma which totally changed its meaning, it was supposed to read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Especially if your in a smaller aircraft as the plane just wants to climb and its performance is enhanced versus a hot day, though riding thermals on a warm day is fun and you get to save some fuel too as you can lean your fuel mixture back a bit more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To those who asked (Many!) I mostly fly a Piper PA28 Warrior II and a Cessna 182 these days.</p>
<p>THE EDIT'S EDIT: Many asking various questions so I will respond here. I can't recommend any particular school to learn to become a pilot because I am in the UK and most of you asking are in the US or elsewhere. Also I am biased. However what I do recommend is if you are able to do so, learn on a &quot;Intense&quot; course where you have your lessons as close as possible. There's nothing worse than having a lesson once a month or something like that and your flying instructor has to go back and cover old ground with you because it's been so long since your last lesson. Sporadic lessons probably ends up being more expensive because you need more lessons to cover old ground, even if intense tuition costs more initially.</p>
<p>The best source of information to learn aviation meteorology is the documents your flight school give you or official aviation publications. We tend to use <a href="http://imgur.com/a/yDKCB" target="_blank">this one from AFE</a> (It changes its appearance a lot so this is what it looks like currently) but bear in mind it's got a European slant (Pressures in millibars, UK/European air laws) but the met in it is valid everywhere.</p>
<p>How much to learn to fly? Varies massively depending on skill level. There's a minimum flight time requirement too. I can only quote for the UK but it's gonna be around £6'000 to £8'000.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm simplifying because we are talking about radiation, wavelengths and it may be complicated but long story short it's a matter of radiation balance: the air temperature is the result of the radiation received from the environment. All the radiation comes from the sun  BUT part of that is reflected by (basically) the soil, back towards space and part &quot;stay&quot; on earth (again we're simplifying) . </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>on a cloudy day the reflected part begin a table tennis game between earth and the clouds, effectively being &quot;trapped&quot; and heating the environment</p>
</li>
<li>on a clear day the reflected part isn't blocked by anything and , bye bye, begins its journey in space to infinity and beyond</li>
</ul>
<p>hope it is clear (the explanation, not the weather).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two parts to this. First, clouds act as a heat blanket keeping in all the heat that would otherwise escape. Generally, a clear day is preceded by a clear night, and without a protective cloud blanket, heat escapes into space. Snow would add to this, as on a sunny day the heat from the sun is reflected and not trapped. Second, colder air can hold less moisture, discouraging cloud formation, meaning fronts of colder air are less likely to form clouds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat is always in motion in our atmosphere. </p>
<p>Most heat arrives from the sun, and leaves from the surface of the Earth. The ground and water act like big rechargeable heat batteries, soaking up heat from the sun during the day but is ALWAYS releasing it back into space (both day and night).</p>
<p>The amount of heat that the Sun emits is fairly constant (ELI5), and the amount of heat that escapes the surface is fairly constant to a particular location (leaving wind out of the equation and sea level). </p>
<p>Temperature varies with how much heat is arriving minus the amount that is leaving. Practically speaking, assuming you are at a constant location the rate at which heat leaves is constant. So how much heat is arriving is more important. The closer to the Sun more heat arrives (closer to equator/summer). If you are further from the Sun less heat arrives (poles/winter).</p>
<p>Clouds change both the amount of heat arriving at the surface of the Earth and the amount of heat that can leave. They reflect some heat from the Sun back to space and trap some heat close to the surface. How much heat they reflect versus trap depends on how thick they are and how close to the surface they are. High, thin clouds don't trap much heat. Low, thick clouds trap a lot of heat. </p>
<p>When you have a day that is cold and clear it is not because there are no clouds. More heat is getting to the surface than would be trapped (by about 20%). It's because (again assuming no wind and at sea level) you are experiencing the unadulterated balance of heat for your location/time of year/time of day. </p>
<p>Clouds are a symptom of how much water there is in the air and what the temperature is at that point in the atmosphere. Since heat moves through the air both vertically and horizontally it is difficult for someone on the ground to correlate the presence or absence of clouds with the temperature they experience at ground level. It could be warmer or cooler above you and there could be more water or less water in the air in layers above you as well. You will experience cloudy days that are colder than clear days and vice versa.</p>
<p>It's because people think of heat rising straight up (boiling water on the stove) and that you can't see how the air above you is moving without clouds revealing wind speed and direction that it gets confusing to try to correlate the two.</p>
<p>If you live somewhere like Seattle it's even trickier because there is a lot of water and mountains nearby that can cause the air to compress (and warm up) or expand (and cool down).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on where you live, cloudy/overcast days may correlate with wind direction coming from a large body of water. Large bodies of water are usually warmer in the winter than land, so the air coming from that direction will be warmer. Sunny weather correlates with dry continental air, which will be cold.</p>
<p>Another reason is that clouds trap warmth. On clear days, all the warmth gets radiated out into space quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
