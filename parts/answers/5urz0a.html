		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an educator, the biggest change has to do with the availability of jobs for unskilled labor. If you look at public high school education, we designed a system for the 50's. A person who wasn't &quot;college material&quot; would take easier classes, get a high school diploma, and work in the coal mine or factory. These jobs offered respectable wages and often union protection, so a person in those days could still live a comfortable life by the standards of that time period. If you went to college, it was pretty cheap (compared to today) so although it was a strain on some families, the possibility of your parents paying for it or working a job through college to pay for it was much higher.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today. Due to automation and a shifting economy, a lot of those unskilled labor jobs are gone. The response, then, by the population that isn't &quot;college material&quot; is to go to college. This has led to a supply and demand boom for colleges who have jacked up tuition prices (well past the pace of inflation) while simultaneously devaluing a college diploma. If everyone has a BS, then having one isn't special. Many jobs that didn't require a college degree in 50's now do. With the tuition rising but salaries not, the return on investment is drastically shrinking for a college diploma. If you don't get a diploma, however, your earning potential is significantly lower, so everyone still goes to college even though now it causes most people to go into extreme debt.</p>
<p>Additionally, with the devaluation of a standard BS degree, many people now feel pressure to get graduate degrees in order to differentiate themselves. If you want to look special on a resume, you need something extra to put you over the top. As a result, many individuals are getting Masters degrees when they wouldn't have needed it in the past, once again devaluing those degrees.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The lack of unskilled labor jobs has created a drastic devaluation of college degrees because everyone &quot;has to&quot; go to college. This leads to many people having tens of thousands of dollars of debt upon graduation. Since wages have increased a lot slower than tuition, this is creating an ROI black hole. Much of wealth people are earning is going to paying back tuition rather than to living.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the gold, stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are 35 astounding facts about inequality that will fry your brain.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In 81 percent of American counties, the median income, about $52,000, is less than it was 15 years ago. This is despite the fact that the economy has grown 83 percent in the past quarter-century and corporate profits have doubled. American workers produce twice the amount of goods and services as 25 years ago, but get less of the pie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of money that was given out in bonuses on Wall Street last year is twice the amount all minimum-wage workers earned in the country combined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wealthiest 85 people on the planet have more money that the poorest 3.5 billion people combined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average wealth of an American adult is in the range of $250,000-$300,000. But that average number includes incomprehensibly wealthy people like Bill Gates. Imagine 10 people in a bar. When Bill Gates walks in, the average wealth in the bar increases unbelievably, but that number doesn’t make the other 10 people in the bar richer. The median per adult number is only about $39,000, placing the U.S. about 27th among the world’s nations, behind Australia, most of Europe and even small countries like New Zealand, Ireland and Kuwait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Italians, Belgians and Japanese citizens are wealthier than Americans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poorest half of the Earth’s population owns 1% of the Earth’s wealth. The richest 1% of the Earth’s population owns 46% of the Earth’s wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More locally, the poorest half of the US owns 2.5% of the country’s wealth. The top 1% owns 35% of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inequality is a worldwide problem. In the UK, doctors no longer occupy a place in the top 1% of income earners, London plays host to the largest congregation of Russian millionaires outside of Moscow, and also houses more ultra-rich people (defined as owning more than $30 million in assets outside of their home) than anywhere else on Earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slice of the national income pie going to the wealthiest 1% of Americans has doubled since 1979.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 1% also takes home 20% of the income. This figure is the most since the 1920s era of laissez faire government (under Republicans Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The super rich .01% of America, such as Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, take home a whopping 6% of the national income, earning around $23 million a year. Compare that to the average $30,000 a year earned by the bottom 90 percent of America.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The top 1% of America owns 50% of investment assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds). The poorest half of America owns just .5% of the investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poorest Americans do come out ahead in one statistic: the bottom 90% of America owns 73% of the debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax rates for the middle class have remained essentially unchanged since 1960. Tax rates on the highest earning Americans have plunged from an almost 70% tax rate in 1945 down to around 35% today. Corporate tax rates have dropped from 30 percent in the 1950s to under 10 percent today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since 1990, CEO compensation has increased by 300%. Corporate profits have doubled. The average worker’s salary has increased 4%. Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage has actually decreased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CEOs in 1965 earned about 24 times the amount of the average worker. In 1980 they earned 42 times as much. Today, CEOs earn 325 times the average worker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wages, as a percent of the overall economy, have dropped to an historic low.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a study of 34 developed countries, the United States had the second highest level of income inequality, ahead of only Chile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young people in the U.S. are getting poorer. The median wealth of people under 35 has dropped 68% since 1984. The median wealth of older Americans has increased 42%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average white American’s median wealth is 20 times higher ($113,000) than the average African American ($5,600) and 18 times the Hispanic American ($6,300).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>America’s highest income inequality is located in the states surrounding Wall Street (New York City) and the oil-rich states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since 1979, high school dropouts have seen median weekly income drop by 22 percent. Ethnically, the highest dropout rates are among Hispanic and African American children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1970, a woman earned about 60% of the amount a man earned. In 2005 a woman earned about 80% of what a man earned. Since 2005, there has been no change in that figure. African-American women earn just 64% of what a white male earns, and Hispanic women just 56%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over 20 percent of all American children live below the poverty line. This rate is higher than almost all other developed countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Union membership in the US is at an all-time low, about 11% of the workforce. In 1978, 40 percent of blue-collar workers were unionized. With that declining influence has come a concurrent decline in the real value of the minimum wage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four hundred Americans have more wealth, $2 trillion, than half of all Americans combined. That is approximately the GDP of Russia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1946, a child born into poverty had about a 50 percent chance of scaling the income ladder into the middle class. In 1980, the chances were 40 percent. A child born today has about a 33 percent chance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite massive tax cuts, corporations have not created new jobs in America. The job creators have been small new businesses that have not enjoyed the same huge tax breaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than half of the members of the United States Congress, where laws are passed deciding how millionaires are taxed, are millionaires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twenty five of the largest corporations in America in 2010 paid their CEOs more money than they paid in taxes that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first decade of the 21st century, the U.S. borrowed $1 trillion in order to give tax cuts to households earning over $250,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1970, there were five registered lobbyists working on behalf of wealthy corporations for every one of the 535 members of Congress. Today there are 22 lobbyists per congressperson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1962, the 1% household median wealth was 125 times the average median wealth. In 2010 the divide was 288 times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the Great Recession, the average wealth of the 1% dropped about 16 percent. Meanwhile the wealth of the 99% dropped 47 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>Between 1979 and 2007, the wages of the top 1% rose 10 times more than the bottom 90 percent.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in the Detroit area, so I can provide a Detroit-related answer to this one. Not sure how or if it was true other places.</p>
<p>After WWII, our economy was in great shape, Asia's was shit. The manufacturing industry in the US had yet to be automated to a significant degree, so there were lots of very good factory jobs. Detroit made a lot of cars, the cars were made from steel refined in the US, and there was little competition to either industry. Auto manufacturing jobs, in particular, paid a lot of money and didn't require education.</p>
<p>After a while (70s), Asia's economy was doing much better. The Japanese were making high-quality cars that cost less than American cars. The Japanese cars were manufactured with cutting-edge technology and techniques that required fewer and fewer workers. In order to be competitive, the US started emulating Japanese manufacturing techniques. It was popular in the 80s to send US executives to Japan to learn how they were so successful.</p>
<p>Part of the success led to more and more automation at home. Auto manufacturing jobs disappeared. The Chinese started making low-cost, high-quality steel. Steel jobs in the Midwest disappeared.</p>
<p>There were other parts to the puzzle, too. Part of the Republican revolution started by Reagan in the 80s greatly decreased the strength of unions. Both the steel and auto industries relied on strong unions to keep wages up. Weakened unions meant decreased bargaining power, which meant wages didn't increase.</p>
<p>The oil crunch in the 70s also contributed to a drive for smaller, lighter, cheaper cars. Japan was on top of this, but it took Detroit a long time (some would say we're still waiting) to make smaller, lighter cars.</p>
<p>I know you're 5, but I'll throw this in there as well. Part of the Reagan revolution was to change the tax code to eliminate <em>very</em> high taxes on the highest paid individuals. The highest tax bracket was 70%. Reagan reduced it to 28%. This helped concentrate wealth to the top. This was very good for wealthy people, but not so good for the middle class.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many others have posted this, but in 5 year old language the reasons are these:</p>
<p>1) After WWII, there were no other industrialized countries to compete with us (and many countries lost a significant portion of their young men to the war), BUT they all needed to buy things, so they imported from us.  With no competition, profits ran high.</p>
<p>2) Automation and much cheaper international shipping has taken away many of those factory jobs, because people were either replaced by robots, or by people in other countries who would work for 1/10th-1/5th of the wage.</p>
<p>3) When society went from 1 income families to dual income families, the first people to do it gained a lot in lifestyle.  Eventually, though, inflation adjusted prices to the extra money households were making.  Now we just work more and get less.</p>
<p>4) Our tastes went through the roof.  Your grandparents lived in small 900 sq. foot homes with two bedrooms and maybe no garage.  A basement was a luxury that families finished off when more kids came around.  Cars were basic.  Today, families demand homes twice that size with two car garages and a standard Ford full size sedan like the Fusion (at $30k) feels more luxurious than a Cadillac or Packard from the 50s.  &quot;Comfortable&quot; has changed.</p>
<p>5) Most people in the Fifties didn't go to university.  Only 5% of men and about 2% of women got a 4 year degree.  That is now over 35%  <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/184272/educational-attainment-of-college-diploma-or-higher-by-gender/" target="_blank">https://www.statista.com/statistics/184272/educational-attainment-of-college-diploma-or-higher-by-gender/</a></p>
<p>6) Healthcare costs and communication/TV costs have taken an enormous bite out of our monthly budgets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your idea of the 50s is a little off.
I was born in the 50s. My dad was in the army in the Korean war and came back with his new wife to a three room sharecropper house with no running water (a hand pump outside), no toilet (outhouse) and certainly no air conditioning. He worked the land by day and worked in a factory by night for several years to save enough to buy a small four room house and a little land. That house had no bathroom facilities either and was heated with a little coal grate in the living room.</p>
<p>My siblings and I were born in a little clinic hospital (physician clinic with a few beds for patients needing inpatient care). We had no health insurance and did not need health insurance. Health care was affordable and unusual costs were paid on an installment plan.</p>
<p>I wore hand-me-down clothes for years. </p>
<p>Slowly, working day and night, Dad began to get ahead, but ahead was not anywhere near the level of comfort that I and most others enjoy today.</p>
<p>One factor which allowed my dad's generation to prosper was that the economy was growing and there was constant inflation. Any home and/or property purchased would increase in value. A 3000.00 house would soon be worth 15,000.00. </p>
<p>Our economy has been slowing for years as jobs have been relocated overseas. During the last eight years, economic growth has been severely held back and inflation rigidly halted. </p>
<p>All the factors which made the 50s and 60s prosperous have been severely limited. Health care costs have become heartbreakingly
burdensome. And the cost of post secondary education is leaving a generation of people with a lifetime burden of student loans.</p>
<p>It is not so much that pay has not kept up as the costs of a middle income life are so much more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
