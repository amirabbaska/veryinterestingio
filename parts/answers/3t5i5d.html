		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's play a game called &quot;guess the outfit before you see the person&quot;. Every time you correctly guess the right outfit, you win $500.</p>
<p>The judges of the game noticed that a lot of smart players would default to &quot;jeans and a solid black T-shirt, black shoes, white socks, no hat and no jewelry&quot; over and over again, and they won a bunch of times. Not every time, but enough times to make some money. A lot of people wear this outfit very much like a lot of people have common passwords.</p>
<p>The judges start making more rules both visible to the players and the people wearing outfits. Now you must wear:</p>
<p>-a hat of some sort</p>
<p>-at least one piece of jewelry</p>
<p>-socks that don't match</p>
<p>-a shirt that has at least two colors</p>
<p>Amazingly, it became harder for contestants to effectively guess the outfits, even though it was made clear of the requirements for the outfit (or password)</p>
<p>Edit: to reflect brute forces, imagine if you were allowed to guess until you got it right, move onto the next person whenever you like. In order to maximize the amount of money you could make every day, you would make a list of the most common outfits(less people wear hats and jewelry than those who choose not to wear them, so you'd just focus on the most common stuff: shirts of various popular colors, blue jeans or khakis, shoes of various colors. Wasting time guessing anything more complicated probably won't win more games than sticking to the absolute basics, especially if people don't like wearing jewelry or hats because it requires more effort on their level when getting ready in the morning(annoying tedious task similar to memorizing symbols and which letter is capital)</p>
<p>Also got a few PMs regarding my profession/experience. I'm a high school computer science teacher on the east coast of the US.</p>
<p>Edit 2: thank you very much for the gold! In bird culture, this is considered a not-a-dick move (I'm not explaining myself).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, technically, but in practice no.  Also, Brute Force wasn't the issue in the first place.</p>
<p>When you're dealing with an online system it is incredibly easy to defeat a brute force attack:  just limit the rate at which people can try to log onto an account, or limit the number of tries they get before they have to wait a long time or go through a more extensive process.</p>
<p>The bigger security hole is people using a super simple, obvious password, like &quot;password&quot; or just their username.  These are the passwords that are easy enough to guess that an attacker can occasionally get in through the front door.</p>
<p>Additionally, even if the hacker manages to get an encrypted database of passwords that they want to use a Brute Force attack on then they'll have a harder time when there are reasonable restrictions placed on the passwords.  For example, if there's no requirements placed on the password then I'd start with a dictionary attack:  guess every word in all lowercase letters.  A lot of people will survive this attack, but plenty won't.  If there was a requirement for a number then I now have to figure out what number the lazy users used (9 times out of 10 it's a 1) and where they put it (almost always in the first or last spot).  Same thing when there needs to be a symbol (it's going to be ! most of the time), or there needs to be a capital letter (it's the first letter).  </p>
<p>By adding restrictions there are now a bunch of passwords that don't need to be guessed, but the minimum complexity of passwords has gone up so I have to work harder to guess them.  Remember:  the hacker doesn't have to search through every possible password; they just have to guess a bunch of passwords that the least security conscious people used. </p>
<p>Ultimately password rules tend to be poorly implemented, but they at least have a theoretical background that makes some sense.  The better approach to password rules would be to implement a minimum length, since length is the ultimate counter to brute force.  Unfortunately many sites go the opposite direction and make a <em>maximum</em> length instead, but that's likely because they incompetently coded part of their site and can't handle larger inputs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The number of passwords that conform to these limitations is far greater than the ones that don't. When disallowing the &quot;weak&quot; passwords, you are still left with many more &quot;strong&quot; passwords.</p>
<p>For example, an 8 character password made up of only lower case letters has 26^8 = 208827064576 combinations. Allowing numbers gives you 36^8 = 2821109907456 combinations, which about 13.5 times more options. If you disallow passwords without numbers, you are still left with 12.5 times more combinations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top comment doesn't answer the question, here is the answer:</p>
<p>OP is contradicting themselves a bit.</p>
<p>Brute force goes through every combination.
Dictionary uses popular patterns / common terms first.</p>
<p>So, saying &quot;brute force dictionaries&quot; is a bit of a contradiction. The idea is that patterns are more common than not (entropy). If you have four numbers in a row, 1234 would be more common than 3412. 2345, 3456, 4567 etc. When you configure a dictionary you can have it insert or move around the &quot;rules&quot; like</p>
<p>[3 letter word][4 number run][symbol] this would do
cat1234!
dog1234@
man3456# and so on.. (obviously with more order)</p>
<p>So by setting up a rule &quot;no 3+ character runs like ABC abc 123&quot; or &quot;No common dictionary words&quot; or &quot;do not put the name of the website in the password&quot; you are reducing the dictionary without making a meaningful dent in the brute force numbers. <strong>Removing something a dictionary might find in an hour that makes a brute force require 999 years instead of 1000 is a great trade off</strong></p>
<p>you could then append
[try most common password dictionary]
[try dictionary with first letter capitals]
[try dictionary with first letter capitals and symbol/number for common substitutions]</p>
<p>apple</p>
<p>Apple</p>
<p>App1e</p>
<p>App13</p>
<p>App!3</p>
<p>App!#</p>
<p>Apple$</p>
<p>and so on...</p>
<p>that is a &quot;hybrid&quot; attack.</p>
<p>Think of it this way:</p>
<p>there are only lower case letters like this
26^8 = 208827064576 </p>
<p>But how many 2+6, 3+3+2, 5+3 etc WORD combinations are there? Way, way less. So you can use a dictionary to go through all of those combinations really fast.</p>
<p>So saying &quot;your password must not include runs of numbers&quot; is because a dictionary attack will rapidly try runs like 1234 attached to common words.</p>
<p>cat1234 is far more common a password than c1at234 which is more common than c1a23t4 etc.</p>
<p>brute force would take a fairly similar amount of time to find each one.</p>
<p>but cat1234 with a properly configured dictionary attack is VERY simple to find.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that these stats are easy to determine by parsing the &quot;millions of passwords stolen&quot; databases. You can see how common certain patterns are and configure your dictionary attack to follow those patterns. </p>
<p><strong>TLDR: bruteforce != dictionary, those rules make brute force trivially more efficient but dictionary/hybrid attacks way, way, way less feasible</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you do the maths you actually still get an increase in the number of passwords when forcing to conform to restrictions compared to simple lower case passwords. Here are a few examples (restrictions used are: password contains a number, a symbol and an upper case character):</p>
<p>8 characters: ~5000 as many 'restricted' passwords as lower case ones</p>
<p>10 characters: ~10^5 as many passwords</p>
<p>12 characters: ~10^6 as many passwords</p>
<p>So you see there is a benifit. Especially since many people do not see a need for safe passwords and would probably resort to using short simple passwords if not forced to choose better ones. </p>
<p>Of course the security could also be greatly improved by simply choosing long lower case passwords.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
