		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get migraines and cluster headaches. First off there are different types and different causes. The type that makes you want to drill into your head is usually due to sinus pressure. it feels like something is pushing against your skull and opening a hole will release the pressure. Now, noone really wants to drill into their head literally they just want the pain to stop. Generally putting counter pressure on the sinus will numb the pain.</p>
<p>Also interesting fact. there are migraines that don't involve any pain. Extremely photosensitive people in certain light can't focus their eyes, may loose balance, or get nauseous. All of this and no headache.</p>
<p>Other causes include constricted veins. High blood pressure. Injury or tightness in the upper neck muscles. And concussion history.</p>
<p>If you never had a history of migraine and suddenly get them get in touch with your doctor asap. They could be the sign of something more serious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a cluster headache sufferer, I once very and completely seriously asked my wife to hit me in the right side of my head as hard as she could. I could not stand the pain anymore, I needed to make it go away. I was hoping she would knock me out. She didn't and talked me down to going outside for a strident purposeful walk as cold as I could stand it. Seriously fuck cluster headaches. I know this does not address the drill a hole in my head, or auto trepanation, question but I hope it helps you understand how debilitating the pain it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have cyclical cluster headaches. The pain of a drill would be a welcome abatement from the pain of the headache. </p>
<p>It is <em>impossible</em> to describe exactly how bad the pain is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Migraines have a bunch of causes. Making a list of recent foods/events/weather/etc and seeing a migraine specialist should help her narrow down what triggers hers.</p>
<p>Mine usually come from a swift change in air pressure, because I got three concussions in college (jujitsu weapon work, etc). You know how old guys say that their bad knee can predict the weather? Same deal, except it's my skull, which brings on a migraine as its predictive element. </p>
<p>I'm also sensitive to some chemicals which can give me migraines too, and I've had two--count 'em, two--pillows that have managed it. One was made of memory foam. A couple hours near that stuff will trigger a migraine. The other was supposedly allergen free, but the filling had been washed with a chemical that some people react to, and I was one of them. It's worth it to read the tag on her pillow and google all its ingredients. I used to buy cheap polyester pillows from Wal-Mart, but now I have one of those barley-hull pillows. Heavy as fuck, but great for my neck and doesn't give me migraines.</p>
<p>Nausea is a thing that comes with some migraines. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. But snacking helps. A trick I learned when I was pregnant is that a little food in the stomach keeps it from freaking out as much as it does when it's all full or all empty. Same works for migraine nausea.</p>
<p>Other triggers can be hormones, foods, pollen, meds, and other allergies. It can be a lot of work to write down anything that <em>might</em> be related, but once you know what the actual trigger is, it's such a relief, because then you can work to minimize that or combat it.</p>
<p>I can't really avoid the weather. Treatments I do include wearing sunglasses like I partied way too hard the night before, heating pad or ice pack on my head, hot showers where I just stand there and sway with my head in the stream, drinking a lot of liquid, very warm socks (these last 3 help open blood vessels and spread blood out more, lowing bp eases the throbbing in the head), drugs, darkness, and distraction. When it gets really bad, I'll put on my sleep mask and stick in some earbuds, and listen to a podcast or a fave movie just to keep my mind off the fact that I'm facing an unknown number of hours in agony and isolation. And I sleep propped up. </p>
<p>Also, at least for me, I get kind of a hangover afterward. My head doesn't hurt, but my brain kind of feels scraped raw. So I like things quiet and calm for a few hours before I feel like myself again. I'll often wear the sunglasses just to keep a sudden flash of light or too-bright screen from re-triggering a migraine.</p>
<p>For your SO, I'd suggest keeping a list of things to do, use, or try, and offer to help her with one or another of them. She may be in too much agony to remember them when she's having a migraine. I've had these migraines for over a decade, and my husband still has to remind me to put on socks or guzzle a Gatorade. He'll literally put the drink in my hand, and I'm all, why couldn't I remember that? So if you can be her mental backup, and remind her that there are things she can do to feel better, and even physically hand her stuff, it'll help her feel cared for as well as feeling better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep, migraines can be completely crazy.</p>
<p>Last time I had a migraine, after an hour or two,  I started to get tingling / prickling sensations in my arms and legs.  My first thought was &quot;Maybe it's not migraine.  Maybe it's meningitis.  I hope it's meningitis.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
