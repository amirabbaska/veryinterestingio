		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thread count is the number of threads per unit area (inches in the USA).</p>
<p>More threads in the same area means that the threads are smaller.  This makes the cloth have less texture and it generally makes it more flexible.</p>
<p>So, higher thread count sheets or towels appear to softer and more pliant.  Lower thread count means the cloth will feel rougher and be stiffer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that a program is a road, and a thread is a car. Each thread knows where it is along the path, and takes some time to get to the end. How much &quot;work&quot; your program has to do is akin to how long the road is.</p>
<p>Most old programs were written to be single-threaded. That's like a road with one lane. You can only fit one car down the road at one time, no matter how fast it goes, and that one car has got to travel the whole distance.</p>
<p>Nowadays you can write programs to be multi-threaded. That's like splitting the road into multiple lanes- now you can fit more cars on the road. A multi-threaded processor gives you more cars, and so overall you're moving more distance at the same time.</p>
<p>Your processor's clock speed is like how fast each car goes. Let's say your program was written for one thread. No matter how many cars you have, you can only put one on the road at a time, so it's best to have a really fast car. So a 60km road with a 60km/h car would take 1 hour to complete.</p>
<p>However if you have a program that does multi-threading exceptionally well (&quot;map&quot; in functional languages is beautiful), it's like having a road that magically splits itself for as many cars as you can throw at it, down to the minimum of say one km per segment. Say you have 8 cars that go at 30km/h. You'd finish the course in 15 minutes! And if you had 60 cars running at 15km/h (like some of my machines), you could complete it in 4 minutes.</p>
<p>Of course not all programs are written to take advantage of multiprocessing, and there's usually a cost involved in splitting up the road segments.</p>
<p>Let's say each split takes up one additional km of distance. Splitting it into 8 segments gives you segments that are 8.5km long each, for a total of 68km. With your 8-car 30km/h setup, that's still completed in 17 minutes.</p>
<p>Splitting it into 60 segments, and running it off the 60-car, 15km/h setup doubles the workload to 120km- but you'll still complete it in 8 minutes!</p>
<p>This is where you need to think carefully about what sort of work you're doing and what kind of processor would best serve it- a high core count, average clock speed processor, or a low core, high clock speed processor. For most uses a quad core 4GHz is better, since most user-friendly programs do not multithread very efficiently. For servers and dedicated processing machines, and where the cost of splitting the task is low, a <em>pair of</em> 16 core 2.6GHz chips fares much better. It will play Doom slower than the 4GHz though!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other posters are correct in that a higher thread count for cotton sheets or other natural fabrics mean softer sheets, up to a limit.  After about 600 thread count you move into man made fabrics such as polyester, nylon, etc.  at this point this number no longer matters and results in a different feeling </p>
<p>Example: 150 thread count cotton sheets will feel rough especially compared to 600 thread count cotton sheets.  1000 thread count polyester sheets will NOT necessarily feel better than 600 thread count cotton sheets as they may breathe less and hold in more static and heat.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the English system, the number after the diameter is the threads per inch count. So a 1/4-20 bolt is a 1/4 inch in diameter and has 20 threads per inch of length. Example, a fully threaded 1/4-20 x 1.5” bolt has 30 threads. Don’t mix threads! A 1/4-20 bolt and a 1/4-28 nut do not work together. </p>
<p>Edit: higher threads per inch helps with self locking or fine adjustments. In addition, their torque values are different</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To insert more beyond your question, in terms of bed linens, op: </p>
<p>The numbers themselves don't mean all that much in terms of quality in real life, since different fibers can affect how sheets feel, but more so because there is an <em>incredible</em> amount of lying in the bedding industry. </p>
<p>In March, the US International Trade Commission found a “widespread pattern” of “grossly inflated” thread counts, one sheet being advertised as 800 thread count, but was in fact 250. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/false-thread-counts-and-other-things-to-watch-out-for-when-buying-sheets/2017/07/31/c090baea-6d58-11e7-b9e2-2056e768a7e5_story.html?utm_term=.868bc3dba495" target="_blank">Here</a> is the Washington Post article about it for more.</p>
<p>Going back to different fibers: a lot of &quot;Egyptian Cotton&quot; sheets were pulled from retailers last year, because they weren't really Egyptian Cotton (per an article in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/nov/19/egyptian-cotton-sheets-luxury-controversy-target-walmart" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>), but even that isn't quite what it sounds like because Egyptian Cotton doesn't refer to a specific type of cotton that is luxurious, just any cotton grown in the country of Egypt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
