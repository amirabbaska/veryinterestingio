		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun experiment time</p>
<p>Get a tall glass and fill it with water. </p>
<p>Start drinking without stopping and pay very close attention to the taste, to your swallowing (number of swallows, frequency, comfort level). </p>
<p>By the time you get to the bottom of the glass drinking will actually be painful</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human brain has a way of regulating how much water a person can drink. When a person is thirsty, similar to feeling hunger, drinking water will taste better than when the person drinks past the feeling of being thirsty. </p>
<p>This is because if a person drinks too much water, the person could deplete sodium levels in the body, and develop hyponatremia, or cerebral edema (excess fluid in the brain).</p>
<p>So just think about when you eat something after being hungry for a long time and then trying to eat the same thing after being full. It will taste better when you're hungry versus when you're full. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have also evolved to avoid stagnant water (due to the higher probability of disease and parasites in standing/stagnant water versus flowing water.) One of the ways we do this is by gauging the oxygen content in the water. Stale water will be less appealing to our senses than water fresh from the tap. You can test this by letting a bottle of water set out for a day or so. take a sip, it will be pretty unappealing. Then put the lid on the bottle and shake it for a bit, aerating the water, and it will taste substantially better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK there is a vast difference in water tastes depending on your supplier. I know in my home village the water was incredibly hard - but I'd grown up on it so I loved it. It would wreck our kettle and taps with limescale. I always hated going to my Grandma's house (roughly 30 minutes away) because her tap water was so soft it felt like slime on my tongue. </p>
<p>Not sure if that's a thing in other countries or just exclusive to England...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this is irrelevant, but I'm 14 weeks pregnant right now and you know how pregnancy causes food aversions? Well one really bad one I'm dealing with is that I can't drink water. I take even a little sip and I feel like I'll barf. It really sucks, I'm so sick of juice and Gatorade. And I can't even drink tea either! All you water drinkers out there, feel grateful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
