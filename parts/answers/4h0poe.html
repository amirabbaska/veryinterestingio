		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The big issue with modern bananas is that they are triploid (have three copies of each chromosome) - this is how we get seedless bananas, as triploid organisms cannot undergo meiosis and produce viable gametes (sperm and egg)-thus they don't have viable seeds. While this is great for people eating bananas, it is very bad from a genetic standpoint. Since bananas can't produce living seeds, they don't recombine genetically (i.e. they don't cross with each other). This means that every banana in a variety is genetically identical, so once the pathogen overcomes resistance in one plant it overcomes the resistance of every banana plant of that variety. Thus it is true that as Panama disease spreads, it will slowly become not economically feasible to produce any of the current banana variety. Breeding new bananas, as mentioned in another comment, is very difficult, because the current varieties are all triploid, and hence can't be crossed. Our solutions are probably to either work really hard to conventionally breed a new triploid banana, genetically modify the current variety to increase its resistance, or simply switch to eating bananas that have seeds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, everybody else has good stuff. Many of the bananas grown are Cavendish (specifically Grand Nain), and yes, they can be killed by Race 4 of Panama Disease (however, they are resistant to the other races, which is why they replaced Gros Michael).</p>
<p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned is the FHIA program in Honduras which is actively breeding new varities of banana. They have several suitable for commercial use. One of the big issues they've got is taste. Most of what they've bred is less sweet and more acid tasting than current bananas. The ones that aren't are too tall. </p>
<p>Some of their cooking varities have a lot of potential too.</p>
<p>Effectively, they've got massive plantations of bananas from all over the world with many characteristics. When one varity flowers, they'll pollinate the female flowers from any one of the other flowering ones, and later, they'll pollinate another variety with the male flowers. </p>
<p>If they're lucky, they'll get 2 or 3 seeds in an entire bunch. They smash all the bananas into pulp and strain out the seeds. Unfortunately, banana seeds are next to impossible to germinate, so they dissect out the embryos and plant them in microculture. They'll grow them out and multiply them, and plant them out into test beds. They'll evaluate them based on taste, size of plant, resistance to diseases (Panama Disease, black sigatoka, banana bunchy top virus, etc...), and a variety of other factors. They use most of theses as breeding stock, and they've named some as potential alternatives to Cavendish (or other bananas).</p>
<p>FHIA-1, also known as Goldfinger, is among the most suitable ones they've produced. It is highly resistant to most banana diseases, it is tolerant of cooler temperatures, it has fruit that ship really well, and the plants are fairly sturdy in comparison to some varities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gros Michael, and Cavendish are cultivars of banana. Two of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banana_cultivars" target="_blank">numerous edible cultivars</a>. I've personally worked with 10 different varieties which are part of 20 others native to my country (Sri Lanka), when I was working as a food scientist. I know other countries have many more edible cultivars. Each cultivar is really distinct in taste and appearance, and they're all seedless. Wikipedia has an interesting comparison picture <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Bananavarieties.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>. Incidentally, the big green one tastes a lot like watermelon.   </p>
<p>I'm not sure if they're as vulnerable as Cavendish or Gros Michael are to Panama disease, I just hope this helps answer the first part of your question.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> I realise the picture on wikipedia states the big green one is a plantain. It looks similar to this variety, which is not a plantain (also note the seeds) <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzDZLEGRHkD1REt2QjZscHY4bXM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plant Breeder here so I'll attempt to give insight. Thing is, in the US we import and eat mainly one cultivar of banana, the Cavendish, while in the parts of the world where they are grown there are around 5,000 edible cultivars of various species but the trick is to find one that can replace the American dessert banana (most banana are actually quite starchy, not sweet). Bananas were bred to not have viable seed so they are vegetatively propagated thus they are very vulnerable to new diseases as you can't actually breed them (potatoes also are clonally propagated but still can produce viable seed). So the current options are to A) Genetically modify them with a virus resistance gene B) find a new cultivar of banana that is resistant but also will be sweet enough to replace Cavendish and have no seeds or C) We suck it up and eat starchy bananas or ones with seeds in them. I think A would probably be the most cost effective option but with all the fuss of GMO companies and growers are probably not going to go for it. So that leaves us with B and C, the Panama disease issue has been known for years and breeders have been screening not only current cultivars but lines that are in seed banks to see if they resistant to the disease, are sweet and have other important agronomic traits. If the fruit has a lot of seeds then there could be work to breed a less seedy variety or induce triploidy which can be done artificially but is risky as a lot of genes can be silenced due to methylation after genome or chromosome duplication. The Cavendish won't go &quot;extinct&quot; it just won't be able to grow on the large industrial scale that it is now. Fusarium in general is a problem for most crops grown around the world and resistance has a tendency to break down or the strain becomes resistant to fungicides which is used to manage it which it can do in 3 ways: Produce more of the virulent toxin/spore, change receptors so the chemical can't affect it as well or export the chemical out of the cell (this one is the most concerning). So then we have to rely on resistance breeding which can last for quite some time until the disease gets a new virulence gene to overcome the resistance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
