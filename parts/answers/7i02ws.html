		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other posters are right that, to first approximation, it does not depend on the cross sectional area of the vessel, since the downward force is F = Ahρg (A: area, h: height of water column, ρ: density of water, g: gravitational acceleration), while the upward force is F = AP (P: pressure).</p>
<p>So as long as P &gt; hρg, you'll be able to hold water in the column upside down. This is why you can do experiments like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKHsJAy_peo" target="_blank">this</a>, where you can hold a glass of water upside down by covering the top with a notecard. Note that when the notecard is removed, it can't hold the water up, though.</p>
<p>In sufficiently wide vessels, air can percolate through the water and ruin the vacuum at the top of the glass, causing the water to fall. This is because the surface tension of the water in the glass is not strong enough to resist deformation by the bubbles of air.</p>
<p>The surface tension sets the &quot;capillary length&quot; which is how high the water will climb in a tube due to the force of surface tension against gravity. For a <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/surten2.html#c6" target="_blank">circular tube</a>, it is L = 2T/ρrg (T: surface tension, ρ: density, r: radius of tube, g: gravitational acceleration). To rough approximation, <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/science-blog/why-does-liquid-stay-horizontally-turned-straw-not-glass" target="_blank">if the tube's diameter is less than about 1.7 times the capillary length, then liquid will stay in the tube against gravity</a>.</p>
<p>So for water in our circular straw, d = 2r = 3.4sqrt(T/ρg), which gives a diameter of about 1 cm for our column of water, which probably matches your experiences with turning water vessels upside down.</p>

<p>EDIT: I want to encourage you all to read Mark_Eichenlaub's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7i02ws/how_wide_can_a_straw_be_before_holding_water_in/dqvx6wm/" target="_blank">excellent post</a> farther down the thread, which is much more thoughtful than my hastily googled scaling relations.</p>
<p>The main takeaway as it applies to my post is that the buoyant force on the bubble must be less than the force of surface tension, so for a forming half-spherical bubble that's 2/3 πr^3 ρg &lt; 2πrT with the choice of variables in my post. From here it is simple algebra to get to the relation I grabbed from the literature.</p>
<p>Also, yes your thumb must be big enough to cover the straw. I am assuming most of you have thumbs that are wider than 1 cm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About 1 cm, which I know from experiment (try it with a thick straw from a bubble tea shop and you'll see it's just barely possible). I'll sketch the theory below in a back-of-the-envelope way.</p>
<p>The force that holds the water up in the straw is pressure from the air. The water can't just fall out of the straw because if it started to, the air trapped in the top of the straw would expand to fill the space left behind by the fluid as it fell. This would lower the pressure in the air. With the pressure in the air at the top of the straw smaller than atmospheric pressure and the pressure at the open bottom end of the straw at atmospheric pressure, there would be a net upward force from pressure on the fluid in the straw, balancing out the net downward gravitational force.</p>
<p>This is what happens; the fluid in the straw does fall a small amount, reducing the pressure in the air at the top a bit below atmospheric pressure. For a column of water 10 cm tall, the pressure drop from atmospheric pressure to the air at the top of the straw is about 1% of atmospheric pressure. If you had a very long straw, longer than about 10 m, this trick wouldn't work any more; the weight of the water would be enough to overcome atmospheric pressure and water would fall out of the straw. You could leave behind very low-pressure air in the top of the long straw as water leaked out the bottom. Eventually, the air pressure would be so low the water remaining at the top of the straw would start boiling at room temperature, creating new gas in the top of the straw allowing even more fluid to leak out.</p>
<p>That's all about a very long straw, though. For a normal drinking straw, the water is light enough to be held in by air pressure, but there is an instability here. In a wide straw, air at the bottom of the straw can form a bubble that travels up the straw and eventually joins the air trapped at the top of the straw by your thumb. This lets that air take up more volume at atmospheric pressure, meaning it can expand more, and this lets fluid leak out. Then another bubble, or a continuous stream of air, can form and more air joins the top of the straw and more fluid leaks out until it's all gone.</p>
<p>The reason bubbles don't form like this in narrow straws is related to the surface tension of the liquid. </p>
<p>Mechanical systems like this one try to minimize their potential energy. (Technically their thermodynamic free energy; surface tension can be partly entropic, but we will think of it as purely a potential energy here.) If the air at the bottom of the straw pinches off to form a bubble, the system's gravitational potential energy goes down as the bubble rises, so this is favored. But forming the bubble raises the potential energy by the surface tension times the area of the bubble - you have to do work to create a new surface. These effects are competing, with surface tensions trying to prevent bubbles from forming and gravitational potential energy favoring them forming. The balance between these effects depends on the size of the straw.</p>
<p>If we scale the entire system up by a factor of 2 as a bubble forms, the surface energies scale up by a factor 4 (because all areas do), but the gravitational potential energies scale up by a factor 16 (because the mass of the water displaced by the bubble scales up by a factor 8, while the vertical displacement of the bubble scales by a factor 2, and gravitational potential energy released is proportional to both of these.) So scaling up the straw favors gravity, which favors forming bubbles, and at large straw radii, bubbles form and liquid falls out of the straw.</p>
<p>Imagine a bubble of nearly the radius of the straw half-way formed. i.e. poking a hemisphere of radius R into the bottom of the straw. We will calculate the energy released by allowing this bubble to rise a small distance into the straw.</p>
<p>The gravitational energy released as the bubble rises is the buoyant force on it times the distance, dx, it rises. This is rho*.5*(4/3*pi*R^3 )*g*dx (ignoring the mass of the air in the bubble), with rho the density of water and g gravitational acceleration.</p>
<p>The new surface created has area 2*pi*R*dx, and so an energy 2*pi*R*sigma*dx, with sigma the surface tension of the water-air interface.</p>
<p>There may also be new surface area created between the water and the straw, but I will ignore that here as a first-order analysis. This means the actual maximum size of the straw will vary some from our estimate based on the material the straw is made from.</p>
<p>In order for this rise of the bubble to be favorable, we need a net decrease in potential energy, so</p>
<p>.5*(4/3 * pi * R^3 ) * rho * g * dx &gt; 2 * pi * R * sigma *dx</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>R &gt; sqrt(3 sigma / rho g)</p>
<p>This is equivalent to demanding that the Bond number (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s_number" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s_number</a>) of the system be greater than 3.</p>
<p>This is just a rough analysis; a real one would need to include the surface tension of the water-straw interface and minimize the energy of the system for an arbitrary bubble shape; not just assume the hemispherical bubble I'm using here, so the actual critical Bond number would be somewhat different from 3, but probably not dramatically different in most circumstances.</p>
<p>Plugging in </p>
<p>rho = 1 g/cm^3
sigma = 72 dyne / cm
g = 1000 cm/s^2</p>
<p>gives 0.46 cm</p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt(3*72+dyne%2Fcm+%2F+(1000+cm%2Fs%5E2+*+1+gram%2Fcm%5E3))&dataset" target="_blank">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt(3*72+dyne%2Fcm+%2F+(1000+cm%2Fs%5E2+*+1+gram%2Fcm%5E3))&dataset</a>=)</p>
<p>so a straw diameter of about 1cm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have given math and real numbers, but there's still a wikipedia link missing.</p>
<p>The related phenomenon is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor_instability" target="_blank">Rayleigh–Taylor instability</a>, and is an effect wherein if you have a more dense fluid above a less dense fluid, there is an instability.  Random fluctuations in the interface between the two will cause locations where the heavy one is lower, and the lighter higher.  This will cause a pressure difference forcing the bulges to be larger (causing an even greater pressure difference, and so on).</p>
<p>The limiting factor here is thus if the surface tension of the interface is strong enough to prevent it from doing that -- if the force due to surface tension preventing the interface from bending more is higher than the force of the pressure difference, it will stay stable.  If it's not, it's unstable and will flip.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
