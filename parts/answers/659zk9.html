		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's mainly in puritan societies that are heavily influenced by religious entities. In many European movies nudity is not such a taboo. </p>
<p>Violence is a reflection of a society that's focused on war and guns, where physical strength is important to subdue &quot;enemies&quot;.</p>
<p>Since the US has a huge influence over global entertainment you end up with a skewed view.</p>
<p>Go check French movies and Brazilian TV. Nudity is not a big deal there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying this is an acceptable or reasonable argument, but in general it seems to be based around the fear of imitation.</p>
<p>While some violence can be imitated, most of what we see in films really can't. Your kid isn't gonna be able to fire off a missile or get in a sword fight or fire off a machine gun or stuff like that unless you're a <strong>really</strong> bad parent. But a kid with some free time and a friend of the opposite (or same in some cases) sex and some curiosity? That can go places.</p>
<p>Combine this with a heavily lobbied focus on abstinence-only sex education (the argument generally being that teaching them how to be safe during sex &quot;encourages&quot; it) means that there's a paranoid fear of sex among more heavily conservative parents, which means they don't want their kids exposed to it at all under fear of them doing it. And that fear can tie back into the heavily puritan roots of the founding of the USA, which focuses a lot on the &quot;original sin&quot; of man being sex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is because of a deep rooted mentality in America of Sex being Taboo or something not to be talked about. This first cane out of Puritan ideology during early America and rose again during the late 1800s and 1900s.
This conservative nature can be seen in portrayal of the Gibson girl vs the &quot;Flapper&quot; where freedom of expression (of ones body) was shunned and so on...</p>
<p>We've became more liberal as a society as time goes on but sexuality and nudity still is a big NO because of this old way of thinking. </p>
<p>It's funny because this wave of puritan Ideology with began England long ago never really rose back up like it did in America. Moreover, Europeans have a great understanding of Nudity used in Art as they have been subject to it in their history and culture unlike Americans. Just look at the statues and paintings around old Europe and then look at the younger but still older American paintings... you will see a variation in the amount of clothing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on where you live. It's quite the opposite in places like France and Australia. The US has a ridiculously prudish culture in many ways. Where else in the first world do you see shit like abstinence only education and no sex until marriage pledges?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
