		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They've done some SCIENCE on this and it turns out whenever you cross some kind of threshold, like a doorway, your brain does a kind of reset. This is presumably so when you leave your house you need to start being aware of lions or whatever.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The doorway effect I think it's called. I remember looking it up a while ago so I don't remember the specifics. It's basically that you take a mental image of your surroundings when you have a thought, about anything, and you associate the two with each other. So when you walk into a different environment, and your mind has strayed slightly from what your doing, it's easy to completely forget as your brain doesn't match the environment with the thought you had in the previous place.</p>
<p>It's why people walk back into the room they had the thought and often remember what it is they were thinking of. It's kind of strange that people so commonly do that and most likely don't even know why they do it and how it helps them.</p>

<p>top memory folks build &quot;memory palaces&quot; with objects / ideas in them to remember as a physical space.</p>
<p>LSD can have little or no effect if you sit in one spot before ingesting and stay there ... but when you move it will &quot;kick in.&quot;</p>
<p>i don't buy the threshold theory, I think any single room point of view suffices. if you move from one room to an identical room the same thing doesn't happen</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
