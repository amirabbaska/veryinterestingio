		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is basically an optical cavity. The most simple variation of cavity is just mirrors facing each other, but there are also ring resonators that basically do exactly what you are suggesting, which is keeping light on a circular trajectory by total internal reflection.</p>
<p>Even the best cavities have a maximum lifetime of less than milliseconds (in vacuum). In order to get such lifetimes you need incredibly stable configurations and high finesse cavities are definitively delicate instruments that are susceptible to even small fluctuations in temperature and the like and need to be constantly locked to references and only very narrow-band light can be coupled inside.</p>
<p>Fibers would be even worse for the task. Attenuation in silica fibers is at least 0.5 dB/km, meaning after 20km there is only 10% of your initial power. Light will travel this distance in 0.0000001s in fiber.</p>
<p>So no, using them for energy storage is not reasonable. There are still tasks were we need to store light coherently (or more precisely store the information that is encoded in the light) as in my field which is quantum information. There we use effects as slow/stopped light or absorption by single atoms or collective excitation of several atoms. Just using fiber delays is not satisfying option for the reason that I mentioned above. Research on such so called quantum memories is a considerable field in experimental quantum info currently and I might even join a research group doing exactly this in autumn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are no superconductors for light yet. And fibres absorb quite a bit of light. So for now, not so much chance of getting there. </p>
<p>Typical fibre loss rates are in the order of 1dB/km. Let's be generous and assume a super low loss of 0.01dB/km.</p>
<p>Per second light travels 300000 km. This means that after a tenth of a second in a fibre loop the loss would already be 300dB which corresponds to an energy by a factor of 10^30 less than what was there in the beginning. </p>
<p>To put that into perspective, if you were to come the entire output of the sun into the fibre, after a tenth of a second you'd hardly be able to detect a signal.</p>
<p>Basically, any interaction with light causes losses so for now the better option is to store other forms of energy using light as an input, such as solar panels. </p>
<p>Tiny edit: light is actually slower in fibres, but just by a factor of 1.5. It takes slightly longer to run through my fictional fibre but the rest of the math still stands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bose-Einstein condensates can &quot;stop&quot; light in a way that allows it to be released much later with pretty high efficiency. I can't see that being practical any time soon though, they are extremely difficult to make and not well understood yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's what plants do with photosynthesis. They take light, they use its energy to excite electrons in the photosystems (the bits where chlorophyl is) and then they use those electrons to pump protons (H^+ ) through a membrane. The protons then want to move back to the side of the membrane with the least concentration, and they deposit the energy that was transferred to them by the excited electrons, into a protein that acts like a pipe. Then that protein converts the energy into chemical energy (ATP). Throughout this process other chemicals are produced that pass through another big process (Calvin cycle) to produce even more energy stored in glucose (sugar).</p>
<p>There are many projects around that try to take advantage of photosynthesis. The problem is:</p>
<p>a) to create machinery that can convert efficiently the chemical energy we have produced to store energy, into a more usable form of energy, like electricity or heat. Plants (and all other organisms) don't do this very efficiently at all. 70% of that energy is dissipated as heat.</p>
<p>b) To make artificial photosynthesis be fast enough, so that it can create a bulk of solar fuel. To do that we need to make it capture way more energy from sunlight than what plants achieve.</p>
<p>Artificial photosynthesis has been a thing since the very early 20th century (1910-1920), but only recently did we make it industrially feasible by creating artificial leaves that capture 10% of sunlight when using pure CO2 or 3-4% when they use atmospheric CO2. In comparison, plants have a 0.3-0.6% efficiency (When I say efficiency here I mean how much energy from the total sunlight radiation that hits them gets captured to be used in photosynthesis).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As everyone else says it is not possible in any real useful way, at least with current technology, to store light as you suggest. That said, it is very easy to store <em>the energy</em> from light. There are many ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.solarreserve.com/en" target="_blank">Hot salt storage</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tesla.com/commercial" target="_blank">Batteries</a></li>
<li><a href="http://energystorage.org/compressed-air-energy-storage-caes" target="_blank">Compressed Air</a></li>
<li><a href="http://interestingengineering.com/energy-storage-trains-work-power-gravity/" target="_blank">Trains</a> (Really!)</li>
</ul>
<p>That last is just one example of using gravity as an energy storage device. There are lots of variants. Basically you use solar power during the day to move something heavy up a hill, then at night the heavy thing moves down to generate electricity. Another way to use this is with hydro-electric. Pump water up to a basin during the day, let it flow down at night to generate electricity.</p>
<p>That list is by no means exhaustive, just a few methods that come immediately to mind.</p>
<p>Edit: Added &quot;in any real useful way&quot; to appease the pedants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
