		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the space sector I have seen a tons of news about automatic image processing to be able to exploit all the satellite imagery. Is that something that NASA is part of? Do you have projects that use that kind of pipeline?</p>
<p>A few companies are also promising high frequency images (the whole Earth every 24h kind of deal). What usage do you foresee for that kind of data?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool project! I've used Landsat data before and really like the commitment that NASA appears to have to open information sharing.  </p>
<p>Technical question: what kind of spatial resolution are you guys working at?<br />
Relatedly, I could imagine a scenario where some areas with a lower population density will not receive a lot of interest relatively. Of course, one could argue that these areas are also less interesting for many land cover data uses, but still, do you guys have a method in mind for dealing with this? And abroad? I'm currently looking into, among other things, remote sensing for disaster risk reduction in developing countries and the availability of high resolution data is often a problem; these kind of projects could really help, but at the same time of course in many developing countries such a project is also much harder to pull off...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Do you have plans for further updates to the GLOBE observer app? any more tools?</p>
