		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Devaluing domestic currency gives an international trade advantage. That's why many things you see are made in China and why many politicians complain about China keeping it's currency artificially weak. An American dollar will buy you much more in China than it will in America because of their weak currency, therefore trading with China is often cheaper than manufacturing in country. Basically an inflated currency will lose you international buying power, but increase international exporting power. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Chuckie Cheese and a Dave and busters are next door to each other (very different establishments but it works for the metaphor). They decide to form a partnership of sorts, knock down a wall and connect their arcades allowing them each to have entertainment for both kids and parents. Everyone is better off: kids, parents, and the businesses each attract additional clientele.  Both have a prize shop where tickets can be redeemed for prizes, but D&amp;B has relatively nicer and more expensive prizes, and therefore their games are more expensive to play.  Because of this D&amp;B tickets have the buying power of three CC tickets at the CC prize shop and three CC tickets the buying power of one D&amp;B ticket at the D&amp;B prize shop.   However you must exchange your D&amp;B tickets into CC tickets to shop at the CC store and visa versa.   The head of CC wants to sell more items from the prize shop, and  artificially increases ticket payouts in their machines relative to D&amp;B without telling them.    Because so many CC tickets &quot;appear&quot; out of nowhere compared to the relative amount of amount of D&amp;B tickets, all of a sudden you can exchange one D&amp;B ticket for 6 CC tickets.    Making the D&amp;B tickets have a lot more buying power at the CC store after being converted into CC tickets.    D&amp;B ticket holders are now more likely to convert to CC tickets and buy items from the CC prize shop rather than the D&amp;B prize shop. </p>
<ul>
<li>China is CC</li>
<li>Chinese trading partners are D&amp;B </li>
<li>They increase the amount of their currency in circulation (CC tickets) through expansionary monetary policy like the Federal Reserve does in the U.S, oversimplified they just print additional money. </li>
<li>The CC prize shop is the market for Chinese made goods, which look attractive to foreign trading partners after becoming relatively cheaper.   </li>
<li>China increases its exports (CC prize store sells more)</li>
</ul>
<p>This oversimplifies A LOT, but you are 5 and I am drunk after watching this debate.</p>
<p>edit:  Thanks for the gold yo!   Fun Fact: D&amp;B was founded when a Bar and an Arcade, Dave's and Buster's (i forget which is which), were next door to each other and decided to connect them like in my example to mutually benefit each other.  Kind of where i got the idea.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of flawed answers are getting a lot of traction here.</p>
<p>For many years, China has been running a fixed exchange rate regime.  Lots of countries do this.  All countries used to (Bretton Woods), including the US.  </p>
<p>Most Western economies have moved to a floating exchange rate mechanism, where the market determines the exchange rate (ie the currency is worth what people will pay for it).  Floating exchange rate regimes allow trade imbalances to work themselves out (equilibrate), because countries that are selling (exporting) a lot, find that their currencies become worth more (appreciate) and countries that are buying (importing) a lot find that their currencies are worth less (depreciate).  </p>
<p>This is because when the world buys, for example, Apple products, Apple receives revenue in all sorts of currencies that it then converts into dollars, creating an increase in the supply of those currencies on the market, and an increase in the demand of dollars, both of which push the price of the dollar up.</p>
<p>As exports drive the currency up, the price of the goods being exported goes up, dampening demand for the exports.  This process eventually evens out the trade imbalance and the currency stops rising.</p>
<p>OTOH, Fixed currency regimes involve a country &quot;pegging&quot; its currency to one or more other countries' currency, intervening in the money markets to keep the currency at a set relative price (or within an acceptable range), e.g. 8 yuan to the dollar.</p>
<p>Fixed currency regimes are basically doomed from the start.  This is because counteracting the demand and supply on the currency markets so as to maintain the desired exchange rate involves two tools and one can eventually run out.  The infinitely available tool is money-printing.  The one that can run out is foreign currency reserves.  All central banks have a supply of foreign currency.  A central bank matching demand for their currency by money printing as China has for most of the last few decades, can do so forever.  A central bank matching supply of their currency by selling foreign currency will eventually run out of money.</p>
<p>Once traders see this is going to happen, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, until the central bank abandons the fixed exchange rate regime or at least adjusts it downward.  This happened to the UK in 1992 (Black Wednesday).  It happened to Argentina in 2002.  It's happened to Mexico (who peg to the US dollar) multiple times in the last few decades and many other countries besides.  It's what the markets tried (and as yet have failed) to do to Greece.</p>
<p>It is worth noting as a comparison with China, that the Euro is just an unusually strong currency peg, where all parties have agreed to it (whereas the US doesn't approve any countries that choose to peg to the dollar), and go so far as to share a currency and a central bank.  After the European Exchange Rate Mechanism collapsed in 1992, some countries concluded the common currency (effectively reinforcing the peg(s)) was the solution to the power of the markets.  The UK which had been burned so bad chose to stay out.  So far, the peg has held, but at great cost, which, after a decade of emergency measures and controversial debt guarantees, most interested parties (particularly Germans and Greeks) would probably conclude wasn't worth it.</p>
<p>The reason why what China has been doing is so politically sensitive is that they have been slower to revalue the yuan in the wake of their manufacturing boom than the countries whose manufacturing bases have been suffering would like.  They presumably did this intentionally, to prolong the boom beyond how long it would have lasted, had they had a floating exchange rate regime, because that balances out trade deficits, as I said earlier.  </p>
<p>However, they started pegging to a basket of currencies about a decade ago (rather than just the dollar) and since their economy started slowing down, they've been selling off foreign currency to protect the Yuan, just like Argentina, Mexico and the UK before them.  That is to say, they are no longer &quot;devaluing their currency&quot; but these days are more often propping it up.  Because they amassed so much foreign currency in the boom years, it will take a long time for their reserves to run out, but they're still finite.</p>
<p>Interestingly, most of their foreign currency is held as US treasuries, which kept US interest rates down for the past 20 years,
allowing Americans to buy more (often Chinese) goods on cheap credit, enabling excessive government deficits to be racked up in the Bush years (those unfunded &quot;temporary&quot; tax cuts), fuelling the housing boom and leading banks to invent new &quot;AAA-rated&quot; assets so as to satisfy demand from the pension funds and other investors who would normally be holding tons of US treasuries so as to keep their portfolios less volatile.</p>
<p>That is to say, that Chinese monetary policy inadvertently played a massive role in the buildup to the Global Financial Crisis.  So, the impact it could have here on out is tough to predict, and likely to be massive.  You can expect tons of unintended consequences to follow from a country as big as China intervening in currency markets in this way, beyond just making their exports more competitively priced.</p>
<p>Economic intuition (and libertarians) would tell you that China's &quot;managed&quot; slowdown is likely to be messier than a market-led adjustment, and the fixed exchange rate will play a large role in any fallout, potentially exacerbating it.</p>
<p>But given how volatile markets are generally, I would take that reasoning with a pinch of salt.  Most microeconomics textbooks are 2 chapters explaining how great markets are, followed by 28 chapters discussing when and why they fail to produce an efficient outcome and governments MIGHT do better to intervene.</p>
<p>Edited: because I left out a paragraph that finished explaining how floating currency regimes balance out trade deficits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of good answers on what devaluing currency means and its impact, so I won't be redundant and explain it again. A quick recap is that it helps make international trade easier if businesses know a rough a value of what your currency is worth and what it'll be worth in the future (maybe it's better to wait). China sets a value related to the dollar and then buys or sells dollars to keep it around that value (a lot of countries do this). The more your currency is demanded, the more expensive it is. The more of your currency on the market relative to the dollar, the cheaper it is. A cheap currency makes your goods cheaper to buy for foreigners and their goods more expensive. There was a long period where China kept the value of its currency cheaper than what the free market would have placed it.</p>
<p>That's no longer true. <strong>China has been trying to increase the value of its currency for the last 10 years.</strong> The really cheap Yuan is good for exports, but it hurts domestic spending (everything is more expensive) and its leading to inflation. For much of the last 10 years, the Yuan has actually been <em>more</em> expensive than it would be based on the free market and some economists think China should devalue its currency in order to bring it in line with reality. But so far China's Central Bank has been against that idea and has been intervening in the market to <em>prevent</em> a devaluation of the Yuan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an outdated accusation. Countries that hold down the value of their currency can sell goods in other countries more cheaply. And many economists see evidence that China suppressed the value of its currency for years, contributing to its rise as an industrial power. But in recent years, China has sought to stabilize and even increase the value of its currency, part of a broader shift in its economic policies. There is no evidence that China is presently engaging in currency devaluation. (source: New York Times fact checkers)</p>
