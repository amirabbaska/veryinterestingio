		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ten years in the military so far and this is my biggest accomplishment. When I was on my ship I could fall asleep anywhere, anytime on a whim. I called my rack my time machine because on days I only had duty and could wake up late I'd routinely sleep for 15+ hours.</p>
<p>It also helped that being away from my family was depressing as fuck and I hated being at sea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Marine, and I can assure you that many, if not most, Marines are able to fall asleep any time, anywhere. I think it is initially because of exhaustion, but over the course of a couple years, it becomes a legitimate ability rather than an involuntary necessity for sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taught myself to fall asleep on demand from long drives across Australia as a kid as well as 10 hour bus rides through plain desert. Suppose it’s easier as a kid but the trick is to let your body sink into where your sitting on each exhale of your breath, let your head droop and focus on each part of your body, slowly relaxing it, once that’s done slowly let your eyes close without over thinking or forcing it (should feel natural by now) continue to distract your mind from stress by focusing on breathing and relaxing each individual body part, work from the tips of your toes all the way to your ears sometimes helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
