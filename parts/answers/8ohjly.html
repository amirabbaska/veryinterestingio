		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can feel frequencies below our audible range. Some film producers/directors use &quot;infrasound&quot;, as in, sound that has a frequency of below 20hz to introduce suspension or fear in the audience to enhance a scene.</p>
<p>When you are walking on a suspension bridge and it sways, you can feel that, its still vibration, just not audible. If the bridge vibrated hard enough and fast enough, you would hear it as it would push and pull the air fast enough to make it audible.</p>
<p>In terms of headphones, the effect of infrasound and sounds above 20khz are negligable. That's because the drivers (speakers) in your headphones are more than likely too small a diameter to accurately produce those frequencies to a sound pressure level (db) that you would be able to &quot;feel&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to make performance better in the audible range is to make performance acceptable well beyond the audible range. Just like you might want a car that can go 150 miles per hour just because it will go from 60 - 80 for passing much better than a car that can barely get up to the speed limit. An audio amplifier or speaker that is capable of playing much louder than you need and at frequencies much higher than you need will sound better at the levels and frequencies you actually listen to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>No, you cannot perceive frequencies higher than 20 kHz, either by hearing or by vibrotactile perception (feeling it). Depending on your age, you might not be able to hear above 15-16 kHz. </p>
<p>There are several reasons we can't hear above these frequencies. The primary one is because the physical organ of hearing doesn't resonate at these frequencies. The organ of hearing lies along a membrane which is narrow and stiff at one end, where it resonates more with high frequencies, and floppy and wide at the other end, where it resonates more with low frequencies. It's much like piano strings. It's a pretty basic physical system in that sense. Above around 20 kHz, you're not going to get a lot of sympathetic vibration along the membrane. Secondly, cells (and attached nerves) are arranged along this membrane which are activated basic on frequency, with cells and nerves at the short, stiff end coded for high frequencies, and cells at the other end coded for low frequencies. This &quot;tonotopic&quot; organization is preserved all the way to the auditory cortex. As we age, we lose cells and nerves coded for high frequencies first, which is why by out teen years we start to be unable to hear up to 20 kHz. </p>
<p>There is really no vibrotacile perception of high frequencies. It may be possible, but the level would have to be extreme, way above any potential output of an earphone.</p>
<p>The other thing to consider is that most sound files aren't going to have information in frequencies above around 20 kHz. The sampling rate of CDs is 44.1 kHz, making the Nyquist frequency (above which no information is coded), 22.05 kHz. This gets into signal processing stuff, but essentially the way the digital information is preserved is such that you aren't sampling fast enough to accurately encode frequencies above about 22 kHz. The sampling rate of CDs for example was chosen at 44.1 kHz because humans cannot hear above 20 kHz, so it didn't need to be any higher. There will also be a low-pass filter used which will further restrict frequency information above the Nyquist frequency in order to avoid something called aliasing. </p>
<p>The short of that is: even if we could hear above 20 kHz, and even if headphones can reliably produce these frequencies, even if drivers can pump fast enough to create these, there aren't frequencies that high present in most common audio formats.</p>
<p>Very low frequencies you can feel, sure - but most music doesn't contain frequencies below 20 Hz (most won't go below probably 50 Hz), so again, unlikely to matter if the headphones can go super low.</p>
<p>As with many audiophile things, the extended frequency range of most fancy headphones is just kind of a dick swinging contest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The response range of headphones is the point where response decreases by some amount, usually -3dB. That's a 50% reduction in sound pressure (but less than a 50% reduction in perceived loudness). </p>
<p>Now, &quot;theoretically&quot;, you wouldn't want performance to decrease at <em>all</em> throughout the entire audible range. If you produced speakers where that was the case, the point where response <em>did</em> decrease would be outside of the audible range. </p>
<p>In reality, headphones/speakers never perform perfectly flat within that range, nor are those extreme frequencies any more important than other aspects of their behavior. But they have practical designs which don't stop working at <em>exactly</em> 20hz or 20khz, sometimes a design that performs well in that range will also reach quite a bit higher. </p>
<p>So, showing off those ratings is partly a pissing contest, as others noted.</p>
<p>But one thing I will note is it suggests they <strong>actually measured</strong> the frequency response. If I see 20hz-20khz on a $20 pair of earbuds, I know they guessed (or lied) about that and who knows what else they guessed/lied about. Let's say they did have good frequency response, what are the chances of 20hz-20khz being the range instead of 21hz-19khz, or 18hz-21khz, both of which would be equally good? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very large pipe organs (think cathedral type installations) sometimes have a whole set of pedals which operate pipes with tones below 20hz.  There is interaction between these inaudible frequencies and those higher up that cause a change in the quality of the sound. The music sounds more full and carries out into large spaces better.</p>
<p>This works for a live performance or an analog recording. Digital recordings and playback are limited by their samples. In standard digital recording and playback, the sub-sonic sounds are not recorded and wont be properly played back. </p>
<p>For what its worth, most peoples hearing falls in the 30hz- 15khz range and not 20-20k. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
