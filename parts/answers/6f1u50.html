		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we think, often imagining in the form of your senses conveys a lot of information in one quick move. The voice on your head is just that with sound. It's not too different from picturing a scene.</p>
<p>Some people don't have a voice in their head. Just like some people can't picture a visual scene.</p>
<p>Ironically, while it may be useful for some things, subvocalization is slowest for what it's most commonly used for - reading. That's a prime example of using the wrong tool just because it works and you know how to use it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One controversial theory of consciousness is called the bicameral mind. It was explored in the recent TV show Westworld. </p>
<p>Essentially, it says that consciousness developed from language. Once we had a spoken language, our brains formed a second level that spoke to the lower level and told it what to do. The animal brain did mostly what it was told by that higher brain, and presto, you have a basic system of consciousness. </p>
<p>Our modern brains developed from there, and the voice in your head is the remnant of that bicameral mind our species once had. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't really know. There has been psychological and philosophical work on this, but it's still very theoretical and and no view at all has reached something like &quot;consensus&quot;.
What I believe: I believe that our inner voice is a simulation of an auditory perception. We do these simulations to either plan ahead in time how we want to react to a sound perception (e.g. hearing a voice), or if we want to actually plan an utterance for ourself. (We may perhaps practice a speech by using the voice in our head.)
How this inner voice is related to propositional thought is very controversial. I don't really have an opinion on it. It's also not well understood how auditory imagination relates to the memory of sounds and metacognition. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
