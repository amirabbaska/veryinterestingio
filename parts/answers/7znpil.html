		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Phosphorus. high quality phosphate ores to be specific. They play a huge role in industrial scale agriculture as fertilizer. The amount of readily available phosphates for fertilizers is worryingly low, and might lead to a drop in global farming output in the near future (1 or 2 generations), and food shortages.</p>

Contrary to what is said here in this tread, it is not Lithium that we will run out of, but cobalt, one of the main elements in high energy density <a href="https://journalofeconomicstructures.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40008-016-0035-x" target="_blank">cathodes</a>.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here! There are a nearly inexhaustible amount of sources of lower grade ore for all elements across the entire planet. The only problem with there extraction is the increase in cost. 99% of potential mines never get mined because the market doesnâ€™t allow them at the time. If there is a higher need to mine them then they open up and make me a happy Geologist!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprised i didn't see anyone say platinum. Platinum is an excellent catalyst, but it is quite hard to get. If production of fuel cells goes up, there is no way there is enough platinum for large scale production. Yes i know platinum is used in catalytic converters, but only 2-3 grams. Fuel cells use a lot more than that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far, what I see here is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Responses naming one or a few elements that the commenter has heard concerns about.</p>
</li>
<li>The general argument that it's just a matter of economics and there's no real scarcity.</li>
</ul>
<p>What's missing is a perspective on which belong at the top of the list, for reasons other than popularity on Reddit.  So I found <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/2007/1294/reports/paper9.pdf" target="_blank">an artlcle</a> that lists reserves/consumption ratios for dozens of minerals.  Most are at least 225 years, and the majority over 50 years.  The few in the 10-25 year range are, in order of highest reserves to lowest:</p>
<p>Thallium, sulfur, mercury, gold, arsenic, lead, zinc, diamond, silver, and indium.</p>
<p>The article is specifically about minerals, so, for example, helium doesn't show up at all.  And it lists diamond, even though carbon is plentiful.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to specifically discuss those 10.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
