		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Primary routes have two digits. Odd numbered highways run north and south, with lower numbers in the west and higher numbers in the east. Even numbered routes go east-west, with the lower numbers in the south and higher numbers in the north.</p>
<p>Three digit routes starting with an even number are loops within or around a city. Three digit routes with an odd number are spurs into a city. For such three digit routes, the last two digits indicate the primary route they are based on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also related... the US Highway System's numbering is the same way but numbers ascend east to west, and north to south as to not have them confused with the interstate numbers. Hence why in California, for instance, they have US-101 and I-5, and in Idaho, where I live, they have US-2 and I-90. Needless to say, it works well except towards the middle of the US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the previous responses ... The Interstate numbers get higher the farther north you go. That is why Interstate 10 runs along the southern border. Interstate 94 runs near the northern border. I-90 is to the south of it, I-80 to the south of it, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
