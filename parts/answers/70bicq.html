		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally a question I can answer. I was at the optometrist 3 days ago and I asked him why my right eye had a blue-sih, cooler tint than my left eye; most notably in bright sunlight conditions.</p>
<p>He chuckled, said he gets this question once every 10 years, and explained that it due to protiens in the lens of each eye. The lens inside the eye works much like a camera lens, focusing light onto the retina for clear vision. It also adjusts the eye's focus, letting us see things clearly both up close and far away.</p>
<p>The lens is mostly made of water and protein. The protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it. But as we age, some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. You might recognize that this is a cataract, and over time, it may grow larger and cloud more of the lens, making it harder to see. </p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.04436.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;Over the course of life, UV in sunlight, chemicals, trauma or radiation experienced by each individual start to denature the proteins in lens. Denaturing means that the nature of the proteins change and gradually the lens loses its transparency thus starting to scatter light.&quot;</a></p>
<p>As for me, one of my eyes is more sensitive to light than they other (thanks mom), and standing in sunlight causes my right eye to close almost involuntarily. I would think that the greater exposure to UV radiation in my left eye than my right eye caused different amounts of denaturization in each lens. </p>
<p>However your experience could also be explained by cone cells sensitivity or eye dominance. </p>
<p><strong>I am not an optometrist, please consult with a professional optometrist and get your eyes checked annually. This could also be caused by a myriad of other factors, including pressure on the optic nerve and lead poisoning</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from differences in the light that is entering each eye, it could have something to do with having a slightly different number of the types of cone cells in the retina of each eye.  The cones come in 3 different types and they each pick up a different wavelength of light.  If you have more of one type than another in one eye compared to the other eye, that could account for a slight difference in the tone or saturation of color that you are seeing.  I have this too - one eye sees color as warmer than the other.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed this too and it's been driving me insane for years. The best way I can explain it (not answer, just further clarify the question) is that one eye seems to be a &quot;warmer&quot; color and the other a &quot;cooler&quot; color, like default setting options on a T.V. I hope this helps explain the question more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I don't mean to undermine the other comments here, since you said sometimes it guessing it isn't a permanent thing, so I think it's just a matter of having one eye better adjusted to your environment than the other (say you were sleeping on your side and talking to someone with one eye open and one buried in the pillow. Then they turn the light on and you get up. One eye has had time to adjust to the surroundings and the other has not, so one eye will see in a darker shade and the other will not) and I'm no scientist but I think your brain just matches the images and finds a middle ground between the two hues of color..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like a dominant hand there is a dominant eye. So, when you look with your both eyes your brain is catching the information from the dominant eye first. I'm sure there is a better way to explain it, but that's what my eye doctor told me once. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
