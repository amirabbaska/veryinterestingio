		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Larger particles are absorbed by mucus and swept up the respiratory tract by what's called the ciliary elevator, a system of tiny hair-like projections of endothelial cells that beat upwards in unison to move things up and out of the lungs for exactly that purpose, where you will eventually cough it all out as phlegm.</p>
<p>Smaller particles are ingested by macrophages within the lungs and bronchi. The majority of this is essentially carbon soot, which our cells cannot metabolize, so it just builds up in the lungs as black <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/assets/gallery-images/_galleryThumbnail2x/pathology_anthracosis20x04.jpg" target="_blank">anthracotic pigment</a>. It looks gross and harmful under a microscope but it really doesn't do anything, it just sits there and gradually accumulates as you get older with no ill effects.</p>
<p>Other inhaled substances can have immediate cytotoxic effects on lung tissue, other local effects such as bronchodilation/constriction (asthma inhalers), or be absorbed into the blood for systemic effects (smoking, anesthetics), but it really depends on the substance. The majority of inhaled particles are handled as above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pollutants can mean many things but I'm going to assume you mean the pollution that accumulates around cities and populated areas (usually from traffic/factories etc).</p>
<p>Some gases do direct damage to your lungs and that is managed by the same inflammation and healing process that happens anywhere else in the body where there is injury. Other gases can be absorbed directly into blood plasma or hijack the haemoglobin and bond with that on your red blood cells. The gas will either pass out through your lungs or your kidneys will process it and you will excrete it through your urine.</p>
<p>Dust particles will normally get trapped in the cilia that lines from your nostrils to your lungs. The inside of your nose is somewhat convoluted to make the air more turbulent. This give dust particles more opportunity to get stuck to the mucous on the walls of your airways. The cilia will uniformly beat to move particles to the back of the throats where they are usually swallowed. Depending on amount of particles or other pathologies, sometimes your body will need to cough to move the mucous to the right place where it can be swallowed or spit out.</p>
<p>Sneezing is another way your body has of expelling foreign material. This is normally due to something stimulating mechanoreceptors in your nasal cavity causing a sneezing reflex. Interestingly, you do have some conscious control over the repression of sneezes due to the circuitry involved in sneezing.</p>
<p>Hope this answers your question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had 4 sinus ops and it seems that my mucus membrane no longer works at all. I get the most horriffic headaches from strange things. Tamiya acrylic paint takes about 10 seconds, soldering 15 seconds, sawdust totally kills me and I can't deal with traffic because the exhaust fumes go straight up my nose. It always feels like there is a rope tied aroung my eyeballs pulling them together. I wash my sinusses with saline 2 or 3 times a day and it does help. I often wake up in the midddle of the night with a blinding headache and it seems that it is because my sinus cavities dry out. A desk fan or fan running while I sleep also gives me a headache very quickly. I really don't understand why air moving around me gives me such a headache. I've seriously considered getting a mask and an oxygen tank to be able to do the things I love (building scale models, electronics etc) Do you have any advice or thoughts on what I could do to make life easier. I am not trying to hijack the post, I just noticed that there is someone here that may offer some insight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small particles can affect the body in a lot of ways, some of them are categorized as &quot;endocrine disruptors&quot; because of their ability to interact with cell receptors. I don't remember a lot about it now, but one of the most researched is Bisphenol, a polycarbonate that is used in a lot of products, like plastic bottles, and seem to have some effect in reproduction, arthritis and others. If you are going to research, try also micropollutants. It is an interesting reading and also very relevant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course their is also the unanswered question, what effect do these substances have on the brain. Especially the developing brain ( children's).</p>
<p>I have a hypothesis. That large numbers of people are being exposed to damagingly high levels of polutants. Also that some of these victims of circumstance have no choice but to live in environments that damage their health. Of course that's obvious, as no loved child would choose to harm their own health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
