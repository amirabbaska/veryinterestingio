		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physician here. It usually is a manifestation of underlying stress or anxiety. Found a paper that explains it more. </p>
<p>When you yawn, you stretch a load of muscles in the face and chest etc. These feed back onto an area of your brain that is associated with a good feeling. When you are stressed, you can't 'let go' enough to relax fully and achieve that stretch, so you feel unsatisfied. </p>
<p>The scientific explanation is:</p>
<p>&quot;Frustration due to an incomplete or inharmonious development of a yawn is a frequent complaint. Yawning is a stretching of respiratory muscles and muscles of the face, and is sometimes associated with a generalized muscular stretching of the trunk and limbs. The yawner perceives differences in muscle tonus, a veritable and conscious extraction of the progress of the phenomenon, its stimulus and contextual valence, through interoceptive pathways (projections by the lateral spinothalamic tract onto the insular cortex) leading to a hedonistic perception. The dissatisfaction felt seems to be linked to an unconscious inhibition of the ‘letting go’ that underlies a complete yawn. &quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I kept having the feeling of unfulfilled yawns, sometimes to the point it felt like I couldn't breath right. I went to my doctor, thinking it had to do with my asthma. They took my BP (which has always been very good) and it was through the roof. Doc asked me some questions and imagine my surprise when I was told I was having a daily, nonstop series of Itty bitty panic attacks. (Life at that time was very stressful)</p>
<p>If you are having this problem please go see your doctor!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I literally cannot make it through the headline or the comments in this thread without yawning. I am holding my fourth one back now. Can someone explain why the compulsion to yawn is so powerful, even when just reading about it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think its the same as the case of dyspnea I have.
(In germany, also referred to as &quot;Lufthunger&quot;[airhunger] because you open your mouth to get as much air as possible down your throat, kind of like eating the air.</p>
<p>It feels like the air gets stuck in your throat, and no air gets down
to your lungs, though this isnt whats actually happening.</p>
<p>This doesnt have to start with a yawn, but can occur pretty much
anytime. Reasons why it happens are pretty mysterious to this day.</p>
<p>Pretty sure it at least CAN be psychosomatic, because thats the case for me.</p>
<p>When my mental problems act up, I sometimes have it half the day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is very often caused by anxiety. I've dealt with this feeling for the last 5 years, but I've learned to deal with it. Don't try to complete the breath/yawn. Actively trying to take a big breath like that almost always leads to more and more anxiety for me, because you think you have to take those breaths or you'll not survive or something which puts a lot of pressure on you. But that is not the case. Your body does not need that fulfilling breath to survive.</p>
<p>Just breath calmly and evenly. Trust that the air you are getting is enough. Eventually you may get relaxed enough and sometimes you're able to take that fulfilling breath without even trying. Just breath calmly and trust your body. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
