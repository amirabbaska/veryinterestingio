		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll throw in my two cents. Rep for a large pharma whole saler. Every visit I make to a pharmacy I'm checking the parking lot and the general look of the area for any suspicious activity and we are constantly monitoring thresholds to prevent abuse or diversion. It's not an ELI5 problem so it doesn't deserve an eli5 answer unfortunately. The problem is so fantastically difficult to solve. From the wholesaler perspective it's up to the pharmacist and physician, but when we cut thresholds they threaten to pull out of their contracts so we fee the pressure. The funny and ironic thing is that we genuinely make very little money on C2 control substances. I know that in the past we have considered not selling them in the first place but unfortunately there is a legitimate need for these medications and it's difficult to determine legitimate vs illegitimate. To solve the problem would require coordination between every doctors office in the country, all 22000 retail pharmacies, all of the chains and every wholesaler. That's why this is an issue.</p>
<p>Edit: there is some confusions between manufacturers rep and pharmacy business consultant. I do not represent manufacturers of drugs. I work for a drug wholesaler, I do not interact with the doctor and have no control over what they prescribe. I sell generic and brand name drugs to pharmacies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Canadian pharmacist here.</p>
<p>Getting opioid medications is a 2-step process: the physician needs to OK it, and the pharmacist needs to OK it. Both of these checkpoints are failing.</p>
<p>From the physician's side:</p>
<p>Imagine you're a physician and a patient presents to you saying they are in pain (or has a bad cough.) Pain is very subjective so it's difficult to judge if they're lying or how much pain they are in. These people also tend to be very clingy and would refuse to leave your office until they get something. What do you do? You give them something hoping the pharmacist would stop them.</p>
<p>There are also other perspective the physician can take. They could consider it as harm-reduction (at least they're not using xxx.) They could be an irresponsible practionner (money is involved.) They could be working in a area with a high addict population; suddenly opioids become the norm and it's hard to judge what is abuse and what is common place.</p>
<p>From the pharmacist's side:</p>
<p>A patient arrives to the pharmacy. You have your doubts that the patient needs it, but the prescription is valid. Like the physician, the pharmacist really also don't want to deal with this BS: You want to get on with your day and move onto other patients; You want to make that patient leave ASAP; You want to make money; You consider it as a harm reduction approach. If you're a busy pharmacy processing 300 prescriptions a day, you don't have time to deal with this. if you're a slow pharmacy processing 50 prescriptions a day, you really need the money.</p>
<p>If you don't fill their prescription: They might attack you or threaten to be outside for you when you leave); They might rob you (robberies for narcotics are VERY common); They might sue you for discrimination; The physician might also get mad that you for not trusting them. One other common tactics that pharmacists use is to lie that they don't carry it. In this case, the prescription is handed back to them which only pushes the problem onto other pharmacists; they can easily find someone else to fill it for them.</p>
<p>What doesn't have much repercussions is actually filling the medication. The prescriber has already OKed it and the adverse effects are well know. If the patient is abusing it or is harmed, everyone expected it so pharmacist doesn't really take the blame. Both the prescriber and the pharmacist know that they're only responsible for the medication itself. No one will take responsibility for addiction.</p>
<p>Illegitimate ways to obtain prescription narcotics are actually very limited. Addicts would much rather illegal drugs over prescription drugs that are more difficult and expensive to obtain. Common strategies these people use are &quot;Double Doctoring&quot; - going to multiple prescribers to get multiple narcotic prescription; or &quot;Prescription Forgeries&quot; - faking/copying/editing a prescription. Physicians and pharmacists who get involved in this get into a lot of shit, so they are very careful and aren't afraid to call the patient out on it with strict laws behind them.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>
<p>There are a few questions concerning how we know a prescription is forged. There are a few safety measures/red flags:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many pharmacies are equipped to automatically and instantly upload prescriptions online</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some pharmacies have a procedure to confirm with the prescriber for each one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance companies instantly know if it has been filled</p>
</li>
<li>Some prescriptions require special paper for the prescription to be written on</li>
</ul>
<p>Red flags include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The patient has never been to this pharmacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prescriber has never been documented at this pharmacy (they might be a legit prescriber, but far away; why would the patient travel so far)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient looks anxious/is lying/not cooperating with the pharmacist's questions/counselling</p>
</li>
<li>The hand written prescription is legible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: </p>
<p>Firstly, I am an Albertan Canadian pharmacist. I have no ideas of the roles/laws outside of the province, let alone the US or other countries. Just to list off a few things Albertan pharmacists can do: independently prescribe any medication (except narcotics), independently adapt the strength, dose, formulation, regimen, type of drug, ect. for any medication, independently renew prescriptions, prescribe in an emergency, dispense for animals, administer vaccines, administer injections, develop care plans, order lab tests, refuse prescriptions. And we get paid for all of them. Yes, even the refusal. When a pharmacist make any change, they are a sole responsible prescriber. No, family physicians aren't happy.</p>
<p>Now just because we CAN, doesn't mean we should/will. A responsible pharmacist will know when they are not competent enough and refer to someone else. This is like how although dentists are allowed to prescribe anything, they should stay within their scope. Pharmacists know the medications very well, but we're not the best at diagnosis, so we will still be referring to physicians for most ailments. Most pharmacist aren't comfortable with prescribing and will refer for most things. However, we are getting more comfortable with prescribing for minor ailments. Also, many pharmacists are also getting specializations for a specific field (eg. diabetes.)</p>
<p>Second, I am getting a lot of comments about it's not the pharmacist's business how to manage patient's prescription. This is absolutely false as this is literally our job description, especially in Canada and the US. When something goes wrong, both the pharmacist and the prescriber are equally responsible. <del>For many countries in the world, &quot;pharmacist&quot; are people straight of out high school with no higher education. In these cases, their role is very limited.</del> Looks like I'm completely wrong on this. Canadian and US pharmacists have a ~3-4 years of university professional degree, and for various reasons, we're paid literally 2-4 times more than pharmacists from most European countries (yes even the developed ones).</p>
<p>Our job description: We make sure that your medications are indicated, effective, safe, and manageable. Indicated means that it's the right medication for the right condition for the right patient. Effective means that the dose/strength of medication is appropriate. Safe means that the benefits outweigh the potential harm. Manageable means that you can actually take the medication by the prescribe regimen - this includes addiction concerns.</p>
<p>If we do see a problem, we can either take care of it independently (and be the sole responsible prescriber) or contact the original prescriber to give a second opinion (this is why your prescriptions take so long, because we're always on <del>the phone</del> hold with the receptionist.) The prescriber can change the prescription and fax us a new one or cancel it completely. Nevertheless, we will contact everyone involved about the actions we took. No matter what happens, best practice states that the pharmacist must refer the patient to someone to can help them.</p>
<p>Example 1:
A family physician gave a patient a narcotic prescription. The pharmacist caught that the patient was double doctoring. The pharmacist refuses to fill. After the patient leaves, the pharmacist notifies all prescribers involved and all pharmacies involved to cancel the prescriptions.</p>
<p>Example 2:
A dentist gave an antibiotic prescription for a urinary tract infection. Although dentists are legally allowed to prescribe anything they want, this is not within their scope of practice. The pharmacist deems the dentist incompetent in the field and refuse the fill the prescription. The pharmacist refers the patient to a walk-in-clinic. The pharmacist then notifies the dentist.' NOTE: just because it's outside of their scope doesn't mean that we have to refuse. The dentist could be fully competent and assessed the patient appropriately, plus pharmacists also can assess the patient and confirm the dentist's prescription.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prescribing opioids for pain is a murky business. You're treating something that's not objectively measurable, with something people can rapidly become tolerant to, so dosing is substantially based on what patients say. There are no tests which can establish that patient A's pain is controlled on 200 mg/day of hydrocodone but not 150.</p>
<p>The most common immediate source of pills is from friends or family, but indeed, those pills had to either come from a pharmacy or be smuggled across the border. Heroin and synthetic opioids continue to come in illegally, but pills usually come from legitimate makers. So, how does the supply get as big as it is?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prescribing too long. It's quite common to prescribe anything in intervals of a month, for no real reason besides habit and tradition. A notorious example is a 30-day supply of opioids after wisdom tooth removal, which often requires no more than a few days' worth, or can even be controlled without opioids. The rest of the 30-day supply may linger in a cabinet until someone else wants it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prescribing too much. Let's say patient A gets OK pain control on 100 mg/day of hydrocodone. They could accurately report that... but they're unemployed, and worried about making ends meet... so they say it takes 200, and sell half their supply. &quot;Pill mills&quot; may simply not care.</p>
</li>
<li>Doctor shopping. While state databases have helped reduce this problem, a dedicated person may still be able to obtain multiple prescriptions from different providers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: To clarify, doses here are purposely on the ridiculous end to prove a point about the ample supply of opioids. That said, highly tolerant users and abusers absolutely do go well into the hundreds of morphine equivalents per day.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>U.S. Pharmacist here
To answer your question directly (most responses here are parroting the everyday reasons/causes of our current opioid epidemic), you asked how is it not obvious the pills are being abused if we know the number of manufactured pills and number of prescriptions.</p>
<p>The thing is that we <em>don't know</em> either of those numbers. The number of pills manufactured &amp; sold by a company is proprietary information and therefore not publicly available. That information also wouldn't be meaningful in identifying severity of widespread abuse: Person A and Person B can both rate their pain an 8 out of 10, but Person A may need 20 mg a couple times a day to adequately reduce their pain while Person B may need 60 mg (this example is assuming neither person is lying about their pain score nor abusing the drug).</p>
<p>The story of the second number is similar. The number of prescriptions doctors' offices and hospitals' dole out just isn't data that has been extracted by anyone. It isn't public information, and again wouldn't really enlighten where the problem is coming from.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the Netflix documentary, Dr. Feelgood. It follows a physician that was convicted of widespread narcotic distribution. It really highlights the muddy line between treating someone's pain and enabling addiction &amp; dependence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Knowing how many pills are being prescribed isn't going to help anything. The problem lies in whether or not the patient is taking their meds or not. If you have medication expenses totaling $1000 a month, and you can live with your pain, selling 90 percocets for $10 a pop covers your heart meds, your blood pressure meds, and the others that keep you alive.  Nobody dies from being in pain so many of those prescribed pills get sold off. There is no way to track this without having someone physically check every patients pill bottle every day and count pills. </p>
<p>The real problem came about 5 years ago when doctors realized pain pills were being overprescribed, and cut back on how many and how often they could be dispensed. Suddenly thousands of people who are addicted to pain pills are sick. Heroin is cheap and everywhere, and if your sick from not having any pills, and you will be if you take them every day, heroin will fix that for you really quick.  No more waiting 45 minutes for swallowed pills to work, just snort a little dope and you feenit within minutes.  And it's so cheap compared to pills, I could spend ten bucks a day and not feel sick.  10 bucks turns into 20, 30, 50 bucks a day really quick.  </p>
<p>Suddenly you're unable to snort enough dope to get you high. You hate needles and you swore you'd never do this, but it's getting expensive to snort dope all day and not get the same feeling due to tolerance, so you let your friend shoot you up. The effect is super strong and immediate. Everyone I've ever know who shoots up dope says it's the most amazing and orgasmic feeling they have ever had, and it's cheaper!  Now you can use $2 worth of dope to get high, so why not double the dose and feel double good?  $2 becomes 10, 40, 100 real quick.  When you don't have dope you get sick in a few hours, really sick compared to pills, and now you're broke. You need to feel better to be yourself, so you take some stuff to the pawn shop. Then one day you realize you e taken everything of value to the pawn shop, you're sick and it's awful. Your neighbor has some nice jewelry you could get a few hundred bucks for and you'd be well for a few days, maybe a week. This is how the addict mind rationalizes these things and this is how people's lives are ruined.  I should know, I lived out this scenario for 10 years. The first time I snorted too much heroin and woke up covered in crusty vomit was the end of the rod for me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
