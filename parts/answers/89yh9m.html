However, the combination of natural concentrations and the mechanics of salt flats has created the world's most cheaply-accessible lithium source. There are other deposits around the world, and there are other salt flat sources (Argentina and Bolivia both have some, as do Tibet and Nevada USA), but Chile's the biggest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lithium is a very interesting element which is actually ubiquitous in the earth's crust but occurs in very low concentrations in most terrestrial rocks. As a result of fractionating magma crystallization, lithium is most often concentrated in granites in the earth's crust. Furthermore, it occurs in higher concentrations in sea water than in rocks. As a result, we source the majority of our lithium from either pegmatites (highly fractionated granites) and sea water/groundwater brines and resulting evaporites (salt beds).  </p>
<p>There are pegmatite deposits all over the world since they occur in different geological terranes and they are actually a source many of our rare earth elements. The Li-bearing salts and brines (a brine being a fluid with high salt content) are not unique to Chile and they are exploited in other countries like the US and Australia... but Chile (and to an extent, Argentina and Bolivia) has the largest reserves in the world.  </p>
<p>A couple of key geological components are needed to contain and naturally concentrate lithium in order for it to be profitable to extract and refine. The geology of Chile is dominated by the Andean mountain range. This extensive orogeny has resulted in a large-scale subsidence adjacent to the mountains. This tectonic subsidence has become a drainage basin, collecting any sea/river/ground water running off the mountains and from surrounding areas. Since the extensive Andean mountain range in Chile also created the driest desert/region in the world (i.e. the Atacama), you now have a massive drainage basin that collects water and it evaporates incredibly fast, leaving behind salt flats and salt lakes. When you evaporate water with anything dissolved in it, the water will leave behind these dissolved constituents (primarily salts and carbonates/sulphates/borates). This process is how the Li is naturally concentrated in the salt flats - a constant recharge of Li-bearing water being added to the basin and then evaporation leaving the Li-bearing salts in the salty brines and ultimately salt beds.  </p>
<p>Like I mentioned above, this process isn't unique to Chile and the same hydrogeologic system feeds Li-bearing deposits in the adjacent countries of Argentina and Bolivia. But the massive scale of the Andean orogeny and the incredible evaporation rates in the related deserts probably results in an ideal environment to concentrate lithium. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chile's lithium comes from brine extracted from salt flats like Atacama. Salt flats are basically dry lake beds or inland seas that have completely evaporated away. Atacama and the nearby salt flats are in close proximity to many active volcanoes, and the water that runs off the slopes of those volcanoes dissolves the lithium salts found in the volcanic ash, flows down to the Atacama salt flats, and evaporates. Over millions of years this has concentrated very high amounts of lithium and other salts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not that all the lithium ended in Chile, its that the easiest extraction happens there. Its all about the profits you can make extracting it, and researches found that the most profitable extraction is there, almost 40% of the earth territory has a significant amout of this element.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lithium is a common element that is present both in the seawater and Earth's crust. Yet, the concentrations are normally too low to be considered mine/extractable while turning a profit.</p>
<p>So you need processes enriching the Lithium for you. One of the most common and efficient processes for this is evaporation of sea or lake water. By evaporating, the Lithium gets sedimented. If you evaporate water many many times in a cycle of evaporation --&gt; water ingress --&gt; evaporation, you create a mineable resource. </p>
<p>The problem now is, this cycle usually also sediments other stuff in the water like salt, calcium carbonate and especially clay that is hard to seperate in industrial processes. So you need a place where you have as few as possible of these undesirable things. Turns out there are some, but not too many places where this happened, many of them in Chile.</p>
<p>Another source for Lithium are a certain type of magmatic rocks called pegmatites. If you have a big blob of those with high Lithium concentrations you may be lucky to turn a profit.</p>
<p>Still, if price goes up there are other countries with even larger resources (which is different to reserves!), namely Argentinia and Bolivia. Other countries with substantial resources are China, USA, Australia and Canada.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
