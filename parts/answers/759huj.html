		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may be better to describe the traits you are looking at in particular rather than using terms that people may confuse with another. I like this question in general because it asks whether or not people are self aware when they have a social mindset that is different from their peers. More importantly do they use it to their advantage or does it just hinder their ability to connect?</p>
<p>I look through the posts and I see psychopath mentioned quite a bit but that wasn't what you asked about specifically, but people assumed. So as long as we are speaking about traits of a personality disorder, sociopaths and psychopaths get lumped together and I have read a book on Psychopathy that gave me a whole different appreciation for the very wide range of affects it can have on people.</p>
<p>Dr. Kevin Dutton's book The Wisdom of Psychopaths was the book that really opened me up to at least understanding some core concepts behind the diagnosis and history of the disorder. I would say that yes, they can understand what makes them different. At the very least that they are different from other people. Another thing to point out is that while the disorders do breed bad apples, it's still the upbringing that holds the most weight. So the awareness in this scenario would come from childhood parenting. In the book one of the psychiatrists/psychologists that he talked to became aware of his own psychopath diagnosis while looking for others. It was his family that read his research and went back to him and told him to get tested for the warrior gene.</p>
<p>The core question for me here was, are people with these disorders capable of becoming aware of their differences? Yes, I think they are capable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question and I appreciate this being asked in r/askscience. To begin, sociopathy is not really a thing, per se. The construct you are referencing is almost certainly psychopathy, which has some relationship to antisocial personality disorder. However, many people with antisocial personality disorder do not exhibit traits of psychopathy. For example, if I steal from other people, con others, cheat, and lie, but do so for reasons that are based on my survival (regardless of whether this causes distress or impairment), one could argue that such a person does not exhibit traits of psychopathy.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is certainly possible to be high in traits of psychopathy and not meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder. One example of this is sometimes referred to as the successful psychopath (think Wall Street executives, etc.).</p>
<p>Antisocial personality disorder is a disorder that is largely behavioral. As such, many people who have been incarcerated may meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder. However, that does not mean that they would be a &quot;psychopath.&quot; The vast majority of people who are high in psychopathy do not commit murder. While this is a common stereotype of psychopathy, it is overly shallow. </p>
<p>People who are high in traits of psychopathy exhibit superficial charm, manipulativeness, empathy differences, and impulsivity. It gets confusing when we try to disentangle the lines of delineation between psychopathy, machiavellianism, and narcissism, however. For example, some people who are otherwise high in psychopathy, exhibit traits of grandiosity and intense planning/politic playing. As grandiosity is a hallmark of narcissism, and careful premeditated planning is a hallmark of machiavellianism, we will sometimes refer to these three constructs as the dark triad. The dark triad has certainly been the center of much research, and a simple Google Scholar search will yield some interesting results for you. </p>
<p>Now on to your question. The short answer is that we don't actually really know yet. One major finding that comes to mind is from Meffert et al.'s (2013) publication in the journal Brain. They found that, when asked, &quot;psychopathic offenders&quot; could mediate their internal response to observed pain in others, much like a switch. </p>
<p>I have a professional opinion based off of my own experience in this area as a fourth-year Clinical Psychology PhD student. I believe that individuals who exhibit traits of psychopathy develop strategies in response to a harsh childhood environment to protect themselves from experiencing the emotional pain induced by empathy. The funny thing is, we all do this just to a much smaller degree. Take for example my sister who savagely wails on my arm when watching a horror movie, until ultimately saying &quot;Oh my God, screw this bleep, she's stupid for even going in there. I don't care what happens to her. I hope she dies.&quot; It is protective to deidentify with the other in pain. However, when one learns that they can circumnavigate the rules of society in a way that others can't, who can blame them, they might think. Life is so much easier this way, and it's not my fault that other people are so stupid as to play by the rules. </p>
<p>I could talk about this a lot more but I hope this helped! I would just encourage anyone reading this to know that psychology is very much a science, and many of these questions become answered with all kinds of novel techniques, such as factor analysis and fMRI. Sometimes within the psychology community personality disorders and personality constructs tend to get a bad rap. This is primarily due to the fields origins in Freudian psychodynamic theory, but I just want to say that most personality research today has moved far from that realm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've found one research project where researchers investigates self-insight amongst teens diagnosed as psychopaths and their parents opinions of them. Three was little agreement, teens weren't as aware of their callousness and unemotional traits as their parents were.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our findings revealed low levels of parent–child agreement on these measures (ICC values ranging from .02 to .30 for psychopathic traits; ICC values ranging from .09 to .30 for externalizing behaviors). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I've not found a similar investigation involving adults. It's possible some develop insight as adults and this knowledge compounds their psychopathic traits. Indeed, diagnostic questionnaires of psychopathy require the subject to describe themselves. </p>
<p>That said, would Moores murderer, Ian Brady, have described himself as a psychopath? From reading what he wrote of himself, he obviously didn't think he was a psychopath. He tight himself as superior, a narcissistic psychopath. He had no insight at, then again he was an extreme case.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ASPD w/ Factor two traits (Sociopathy) can and do recognize that something is missing. But the thing is, sociopathy isn't something that the person was born with. The way they were treated as a child lead up to them being that way. They haven't become numb to the emotions, they've completely rewired their brains. Because that's the thing, the emotions that are supposedly &quot;not there&quot; are there in most cases, but in less amounts. </p>
<p>A researcher by the name of Kevin Dutton made a <a href="http://www.kevindutton.co.uk/the-psychopath-mixing-desk/" target="_blank">really good point saying that it's like dials on a mixing board</a>. For normal people those switches would be up in the 6 and 10s, but for the sociopath they would be more on the range of 5-1 with absolutely varying degrees. So some would have the dial, the emotion turned up enough to notice that it is there. But going back to empathy, some sociopaths CAN and do have empathy, but in a completely inhibited way. But that doesn't mean that they'll feel sorry for doing anything bad, because for the most part when they behave that way, there's always a reason behind it. Justification. </p>
<p>Everything they do has been done by choice, so feeling bad about it is pretty pointless to them as they've really done nothing wrong from their point of view. But when they really think about it, they know the wrong they've done they just didn't pay attention or care enough to adjust their behavior. </p>
<p>So to really answer your question, it's really a yes and no. It depends where the person with Sociopathy is at in their lives and how they were brought up and what they've done. Not all sociopaths are criminals or even diagnosed. So there will be varying degrees of cognitive empathy, so their perception of their difference will again vary.  </p>
<p>Edit: The way they'll find out that they are different would be through trial and error. Most criminal sociopaths failed at fully adapting to their environment, so the same would be said for the noncriminal sociopaths, except for the ones that can adapt and &quot;mask&quot; their behavior to truly fit in. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mask_of_Sanity" target="_blank">A la the Mask of Sanity</a></p>
<p>Really commenting any further would be pure speculation, it's really hard to seriously scientifically pin down whether or not most sociopaths can be aware, as most sociopaths that are talked about are the ones that have had the history of crime and the diagnosis to count. And the ones that aren't within these structures are hard to seriously analyze and study. Many research teams have tried, but have been highly faulty and completely inaccurate because the way the disorders are specified and the way the disorder itself can hide and blend in. But that's not to mean that the research isn't pointless, they're more on the lines of detailing the thoughts and traits of psychopathy within the general public, not people who would seriously be considered actual sociopaths/psychopaths. Because everyone can have traits of psychopathy but the cause is totally different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>First, this is a fantastic question. A simple answer. Many are. Many aren't. The problem comes in their intelligence level. A lower IQ will generally come with a lower self awareness and therefore, they might not realize that they aren't experiencing certain emotions as they should. They'll think they're normal and everyone else is wrong. While others of average or higher intelligence are very aware. </p>
<p>To note other people's answers. Psychopath and Sociopath are still commonly used terms. As mentioned in another comment, Psychopath is the term primarily used in academic research. The debate is typically between whether or not the terms are interchangeable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
