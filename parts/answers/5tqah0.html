		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>on a very simple level - they move around money. and they move this money between things which are all the time changing in value.</p>
<p>so if $100 is moved over into the form of a share in a company, the next day (or the next minute..) that money could now be worth something else.</p>
<p>given the size of wall st, we are talking about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars. and when an investment goes badly and $100 million becomes $50 million, or vice versa, and when this happens all the time with BILLIONS of dollars - it effects the economy.</p>
<p>So what purpose does it serve society..? Not too much really... but what effect does it have? HUGE</p>
<p>Edit: i have received some flack for my last line saying Wall St does not do much to serve society. What I meant by this is to be neutral - Wall St certainly has its benefits, but was also the cause of the global financial crisis in 2008. But I think its effects are more interesting to discuss then what purpose it serves society.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I am receiving more and more aggressive messages about how wrong my post is, followed by long complicated answers which simply expand on exactly what I said - Wall St moves money around. And by moving it around, it causes ripple effects across the economy. I apologise for not being able to explain the ins and outs of Wall st in less than 100 words - shout out to SteelGun for his great response below</p>
<p>Edit 3 (and final edit): HOLY CRAP REDDIT YOU'RE SO MEAN. While I am getting abused to death I still have not had ANYONE disagree with my fundamental explanation of what the people on Wall St actually do. I have however mislead people into believing that Wall St serves no purpose to society - I accept that this was written extremely poorly, and not meant to come out that way. Never have I even thought that Wall St is just a thing that's there that serves no purpose.. and you shouldn't either. I wanted to edit the post when it was on like 20 likes but only bad redditors remove things they said that people didn't agree with, so I'll leave it but yes that last line was fucking dumb. HOWEVER I have also received messages from many people backing me up and saying my answer was pretty well written for such a massive question in ELI5 terms. If you are new to this thread please read many of the long well written posts below for <em>other</em> good answers too. peace</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h1><strong>First lets define wall street</strong></h1>
<p>If by &quot;wall street&quot;, you mean the general financial institutions and markets around the world including in the United States, then this is a <em>very</em> broad question.</p>
<h2>With that being said, I will give it my best shot.</h2>
<hr />
<p>We have three basic divisions of the financial industry. This theory on the financial industry I learned when getting both of my undergrads is not all encompassing, and obviously one could come up with other divisions that would equally describe the market. Neither description would be wrong and this will suffice.</p>
<h1><strong>Financial institutions</strong></h1>
<p>These are (generally) the regulatory agencies that intervene in the market for various purposes. Examples include the SEC, the Federal reserve and so on. These (mostly) government institutions help regulate the market, provide various services (like issuing money), and pursue legal action against criminals. </p>
<p><em>example</em></p>
<p>The federal reserve may raise interest rates to stop or curtail inflation or it may increase reserve requirements for banks for a variety of reasons. </p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Financial markets</strong></h1>
<p>These are the physical and virtual (ie: internet) meeting places where the various parties meet up to conduct business. In the same way you and I have a market to pick up our groceries or buy a car, markets in the financial industry are set up to reduce the cost of doing business and to allow for interested parties to conduct said business. </p>
<p><em>Example</em></p>
<p>A farmer wants to sell an options contract on the bushels of wheat he is growing for harvest. In order to meet with potential buyers, this farmer sells options contracts for a specified price on the Options market. He may do this at the Chicago Mercantile exchange, which was famous for exactly this kind of transaction. Without the Chicago Mercantile exchange it would be nearly impossible for prospective sellers and buyers of the options contracts to meet and conduct business. </p>
<p>Another example may include a company looking to raise revenue for planned business expansion by listing shares in the company on a market (through a broker, which we will discuss below). Without being able to have buyers and sellers meet, this task is made nearly impossible, and the benefits to this transaction would not occur, namely the business would be much less likely to expand and at the same amount, and investors would have less avenues for wealth creation. </p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Financial Brokers</strong></h1>
<p>This is a lot easier to explain. The brokers are the various clearing house associations and stock market intermediaries that facilitate these market transactions. To use the brief example I gave above about going to the store to buy groceries, if grocery stores <em>as a whole</em> are the market, then the Shop and Save company would be a broker in this analogy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now that we have a Very^very^very basic understanding of the background information needed to understand the financial industry, lets start answering your questions. Keep in mind, I answer these as someone with two 4 year degrees, one in Business, and the other in Economics, both with a focus on finance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do create anything?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply, yes.</p>
<p>Types of services offered include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trading risk from risk averse to risk takers, like in our options contract example above</li>
<li>Allowing groups of people, like corporations, to raise funds, including but not limited to debt and equity issuance</li>
<li>Investment banks provide a wide array of services like business appraisal, Mergers and Acquisitions, and identifying market trends.</li>
<li>engineering complex financial instruments (usually a type of derivative) to meet some kind of goal EG: collateralized debt obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>Etc</p>
<p>From an economic standpoint, one might distill it down to simply this saying, That the financial industry allows &quot;Net-Savers&quot; (used broadly) to lend funds to &quot;Net-spenders&quot; for a return, who then generally use the funds for some end. These transaction <em>generally</em> only occur when both parties benefit more than they lose out, and everyone is left better off. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are they just playing with everybody's money</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No serious person who has studied the financial industry believes this. There are <em>real</em> socially beneficial services provided by this industry. Furthermore competition in finance is intense, and those companies and individuals that are not serious about providing value for stakeholders are ushered out or lose money quite fast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really have no idea</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fear not, most people have no clue. In a similar fashion to medicine, or physics, Finance is a highly specialized field with professionals that often need bachelors degree or higher to break into entry level positions. There is industry specific jargon, lots of math (which the general population has issues with), and abstract concepts that take awhile to truly understand on the second level.</p>
<p>It took me about a year of undergrad finance courses to really <em>truly</em> understand what the heck is going on in finance. </p>
<p>I hope that helps, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask, and if I have the knowledge, I will answer to the best of my abilities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, 15 years in an investment bank here, and I'm slightly disappointed with the top answers I'm reading, so here is my version. </p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street&quot; is a pretty broad term and most of the big firms do a lot of things, however I'll broadly split them up as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1) Corporate Banking / Advisory</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Providing advice, lending, and all kinds of services to big companies, ranging from multi-billion dollar merger/acquisition to day-to-day payment processing</p>
<p><strong>Who benefits?</strong> This one is easy... the big companies benefit, or they wouldn't pay the fees. Every big multinational operating in different countries relies on the services the big banks provide.</p>
<p><strong>Why do they get paid so much?</strong> At the top end, the biggest transactions (e.g. the $85 billion merger between AT&amp;T / Time Warner last year) are worth so much that the advisor's fee is like an afterthought. If you believe some good advice will get even 0.5% difference on the price paid, that's still almost half a billion dollars. Which makes a $50 million fee look like great value.</p>
<p><strong>2) Sales &amp; trading / intermediary services</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> This is probably the most complex to explain. Broadly it is buying and selling shares and other securities on behalf of other people, either private individuals or professional investors. That includes offering advice to and making purcheses on behalf of buyers (Broking), as well as advising issuers, creating derivatives, and marketing financial products on behalf of sellers (Sales). Finally there are pure intermediary services where a firm acts as &quot;market maker&quot; in other words offers to act as buyer or seller for anyone in the market to speed up the operation and avoid having to individually pair up every buyer/seller who wants to exchange their shares/securities. The market maker gets paid from the small difference (&quot;spread&quot;) between buy price and the sell price. </p>
<p><strong>Who benefits?</strong> As before, many services have a direct fee that the client pays - so it is the client who benefits. In many cases the client is another bank or a professional investor.  Ultimately, any company that relies on the markets for funding, or any individual who has investments or pensions, will benefit from markets operating efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Why do they get paid so much?</strong> In a word, volume. Not many companies can provide these complex services, and the amount of money that goes through big banks' trading floors is immense, so even small percentages or spreads add up quickly. It's not just traders on phones buying and selling, there are large numbers of mathematicians, lawyers, IT people, researchers and so on making sure the services are efficient, legal, and the advice is the best available. </p>
<p><strong>3) Professional Investors</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Operating funds and making investments. This is often what people think about when the term &quot;casino banking&quot; comes up. Fund managers operate funds with other peoples money, such as pension and investment funds. Proprietary traders use a bank's own money, but they often have to try and manage the bank's own risk to ensure it has a stable overall risk profile and is less likely to fail if there is a big shock or crash. Hedge funds use a combination of their own money and other (generally large) investors to borrow money and invest it, with higher risk but higher chances for rewards too.</p>
<p><strong>Who benefits?</strong> The investors, clearly, if the fund is successful. Everyone's savings and investments are likely managed by one of these fund managers and we all rely on them doing a good job for our own prosperity and retirement prospects. </p>
<p><strong>Why do they get paid so much?</strong> They manage large amounts of money and when they get it right, they make huge sums for their investors. The rewards follow the performance of the fund and it's a cut-throat world if you fail. </p>
<p>Overall, the answer to the question of &quot;who benefits&quot; comes down to &quot;money makes the world go round&quot;. There are people with money to invest (savers, pension funds, big companies with cash reserves) and many people who want access to that money (startups, governments, major corporations wanting to invest, individual borrowers). Banks help put two and two together, in all the hugely complicated ways that a modern economy operates. Everyone who needs money, who wants to borrow or invest or even just store and move money benefits from the banks doing their job properly, in all the different ways I outlined above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a big variety of roles in Finance. At a high level, financial institutions essentially facilitate the growth of literally every other industry there is by finding someone with money to invest in someone with a plan/project. Think small business going to a bank for a loan, but it gets scaled up and more complex with huge companies.</p>
<p>In more detail, you have the &quot;sell-side&quot; and the &quot;buy-side.&quot; The sell-side is what you think of as Investment Banks. These are the companies like Morgan Stanley, Citi, JP Morgan, Goldman, etc. that work with institutional clients. This mainly happens through advisory and trading functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advisory is what is &quot;Investment Banking,&quot; think analysts grinding away for 100 hours a week. Let's say a client retail company comes to a bank and wants to raise money/acquire a company/get sold. Let's say raise money for now, and they want to do that by selling equity (i.e. ownership stakes). First, the industry coverage group for retail learns everything about the company, and uses their expertise in this industry to put a value on the company. Once they do a lot of that, they hand it off to a market facing product group called Equity Capital Markets (the product meaning equity). This group sees what the market will accept and finishes pricing and marketing these new shares in the company. Let's say selling these shares raises $100 million. The advisory group earns a fee for doing this, as a percentage of the amount raised.</p>
</li>
<li>Sales and Trading. This is what you'd see in Wolf of Wall Street. Trading teams are called &quot;market makers.&quot; Someone wants to buy a stock/bond, someone wants to sell, they're in the middle. They buy the security from the seller and sell it to the buyer and a SLIGHTLY higher price and make a spread. They are out of the door at 5 PM and don't work weekends. Clients are large asset management funds (see below) and hedge funds and shit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The buy-side is actual investing. You have things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutual funds: Pretty standard funds of stocks and bonds and shit</li>
<li>Large asset managers: Think Blackrock. Has many mutual funds and other strategies</li>
<li>Alternatives: Real estate investors, private equity investors (buy a whole company, grow it for a few years, sell it for profit), and hedge funds (similar to Sales and Trading but they're the ones actually buying and selling stocks/bonds)</li>
