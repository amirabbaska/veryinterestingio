		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forces are not literally mediated through particles. Forces can be approximately described as being mediated by &quot;virtual particles&quot; in the approximation framework known as perturbation theory. For example, electrons interact via the electromagnetic field, and ripples in the electromagnetic field are called photons. So it makes sense that you could approximately describe the interaction between electrons in terms of exchanges of ripples in the electromagnetic field. Similarly for the strong force or gravity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do not know your background, so if this is too advanced please let me know.</p>
<p>The notion that forces are mediated through particles is a bit misleading, but we can give an explanation in a QFT framework.</p>
<p>A particle is an excitation of a field (e.g. the electron field), i.e. a state in a Fock space. Particles can have different charges, which characterise their transformation properties under the internal symmetries. For example, the electric charge of a particle corresponds to a global U(1) symmetry.</p>
<p>We also have to distinguish between on-shell particles (they satisfy the equations of motion) and off-shell / virtual particles (they do not satisfy the eom, and they are not, in fact, particles)</p>
<p>A very successfull branch of theories are so-called gauge theories. Here, we take a QFT with a global symmetry and impose it also locally (i.e. the transformation may now depend on one space-time coordinate). To impose this symmetry, we need to introduce additional fields to our theory, so-called gauge fields. These gauge fields are the fields that &quot;mediate&quot; the forces, e.g. the photon field for U(1), the gluon field for SU(3) and so forth.</p>
<p>Now how does this work?</p>
<p>The local gauge symmetry generates couplings between the charged matter fields and the gauge fields, so the two fields interact.</p>
<p>Now let's consider on-shell particles. Examples are the electron or the photon. They satisfy the equations of motion, and they are what we use e.g. in electron beams. As the electron is charged, it will react with the gauge field (the electromagnetic field for example). So you can imagine that the field around the electron is perturbed. These perturbations are not photons. They are &quot;virtual&quot; photons.</p>
<p>Imagine two electrons passing by each other. Both will cause disturbances in the electromagnetic field, and both will react to these disturbances (they will repel). The process can be treated perturbatively, and diagrammatically using Feynman diagrams. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Bhabha_T_channel.svg/220px-Bhabha_T_channel.svg.png" target="_blank">They look like this</a></p>
<p>This example is an electron-positron scattering.</p>
<p>Now, we can interpret this as the exchange of a &quot;photon&quot; (the curly line) between an electron and a positron (the straight lines). However, the &quot;photon&quot; in the diagram is not an on-shell photon, it is a virtual particle, a disturbance in the electromagnetic field, and it is only the first term in a perturbative expansion (there can be higher order terms with loops, quantum corrections).
So to answer your question in short:</p>
<p>How are forces mediated through particles: They are not.
However, one could think of them being mediated through the exchange of virtual particles, but then one has to keep in mind that they do not have the same properties as an exchange of real particles (e.g. forces can be attractive).</p>
<p>If you want to read further on this, a much more detailed and better explanation can be found <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/virtual_particles.html" target="_blank">here</a> a bit more mathematical.</p>
<p>If there is anything unclear, or I should elaborate on anything, please let me know :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if you're in a canoe, and a motorboat passes you, and the wake from the boat causes your canoe to shift direction. Your canoe has interacted with the boat, it wouldn't have changed direction otherwise, but the boat didn't hit you, only the waves did. This interaction was mediated by the perturbations in the water caused by the boat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
