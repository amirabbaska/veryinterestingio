		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I want to thank OP for starting this discussion.  I'm half Armenian; my grandparents emigrated to the US in the 1920s, after fleeing Armenia.  While I've been aware of the Armenian Genocide for many years (or at least the acts contained therein), I've never really understood why it would have occurred.  Being able to place it within the context of the Balkan Wars, the concurrent conflict with Russia and the obvious religious division between the Armenian Orthodoxy and the Muslim government is very important to me.</p>
<p>All I ever really knew about the Genocide was the mass slayings and forced marches through the desert, and that my grandfather managed to escape when a Turkish soldier's pistol misfired during an attempted execution.  I remember my grandmother going on about &quot;those damned Turks&quot; on occasion when I was much younger, but she spoke mostly Armenian and I didn't understand a lot of what she said.  My parents didn't really help place it in context, I suppose because they had only really experienced one side of the issue.  It honestly wasn't a topic that came up very often in our household, and naturally was never brought to my attention at school.  For most of my life, the term &quot;genocide&quot; was synonymous with the Holocaust; it wasn't until much later that I learned the significance of what had happened to my ancestors, as well as the crimes perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge and others.  And you can imagine my shock when I learned that more than half the world doesn't officially recognize what happened as a genocide, including the American federal government.</p>
<p>I'm the kind of person who needs context to understand something, and reading about the historical events and complexities surrounding the Genocide really helps me here.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR - I'm half Armenian and this thread helps me make sense of some of this stuff, so thanks.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Armenian Genocide was the systematic killing of approx. 1.5 million Armenians in 1915 by the Ottoman Empire. It occured in 2 stages. First all able-bodied men were either shot, forced into front line military service (remember 1915 was during WWI) or worked to death in forced labour camps. Second, women, children and the elderly were marched into the Syrian Desert and denied food and water until they died.</p>
<p>Turkey don't recognise the genocide because when the Republic of Turkey was formed after the war they claimed to be the 'Continuing state of the Ottoman Empire' even though the Sultanate had been abolished. This essentially means that they take proxy responsibility for the actions of the Ottoman government during the war and so they would be admitting that the killed 1.5 million of their own people. This is obviously really embarrassing for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not a complex issue but it requires some history:</p>
<p>Early 1800s:</p>
<p>After military losses to the Russians and Austrians in the late 18th century, the Ottomans would go on toy lose territory from within as well. The Serbians revolted successfully (1804-1815) and the Greeks followed in 1821.</p>
<p>Secularization and military modernization (no more Janissaries) continued through the century. During this time, the Christian population pulled ahead of their Muslim peers economically. From the beginning of the Empire, each religious group had to fund its own schools and Christians would voluntarily impose taxes on themselves for schools. The number of Christian students vastly outnumbered Muslim ones. Armenians now had large voluntary roles in the Sultans government, serving as the Sultan’s goldsmiths, his architects, and secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Finance for example. In cities, Armenians worked as skilled laborers, bankers, and industrialists (an Armenian family controlled the entire ammunition industry of the empire). In the villages, Armenians were also prosperous. They would work in agriculture or as skilled laborers. The prosperity of Armenians created some resentment.</p>
<p>Then again, the Empire was stressed from inside and out. Reforms in the country were expensive and The Crimean war (a 1853 game of power between France and Russia for control of the Ottoman lands by proxy) ended and pushed the Ottomans into debt. When France was occupied with the Prussians, the Russians declared war again in 1877 and liberated Bulgaria (partially) and Romania. In 1878, Austria Hungry occupied Bosnia-Herzegovina. Several years later, Britain took over Cyprus and Egypt.</p>
<p>The pressure on the Ottoman Empire grew and grew and it was going to release sooner or later.</p>
<p>Hamidian Massacres:</p>
<p>In response to loss of territory and military status, the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire reasserted Islam as a state ideology. At this time Armenians had seen the Greeks, Bulgarians, Romanians, and Serbians gain freedom and wanted better treatment themselves. Europe had added provisions in the Treaty of Berlin (1878, after Russo-Turkish war) to instruct the Sultan make reforms in the Armenian provinces (Eastern Ottoman Empire) which were not secure.</p>
<p>The Sultan tied all woes that the empire was facing to Christian Europe and the Armenians were seen to be an extension of this force. He responded to a reminder in 1881 to honor the Berlin Treaty reforms by doing the opposite. He gave semi-official status to Kurdish bandits (the reason the eastern was not secure for Armenians) along with weapons and permission to attack Armenians, steal their food, and drive off their livestock without repercussions. In response to the now armed Kurds, the Armenians formed militias of their own and battles between the bandits and militias occurred over several years.</p>
<p>In 1894, the Armenian militia attempted to fight off an organized front of the Ottoman Army and Kurdish bandits but failed. It was for this event that the Prime Minister of Great Britain called the Sultan “the Great Criminal” and “the Red Sultan”. The European powers demanded the execution of the Treaty of Berlin and European representatives were sent to examine the event. This event was followed by an incitement of anti-Armenian sentiment around the Ottoman Empire. Turks would be gathered into mosques and told that the Armenians were attacking Islam. Violence against Armenians spread throughout the entire Empire.</p>
<p>European powers again forced the Sultan to sign a reform package, but again, it wasn’t implemented. Armenians in Constantinople gathered to petition for reform to no avail. Upon receiving the reform package, the Sultan remarked “This business will end in blood”.
It did. This was the start of the Hamidian Massacres.
The protests were violently broken up and anti-Armenian passion flew through the empire as neighbors, soldiers, and Kurds mercilessly killed Armenians (and also Assyrians). This lasted throughout the year (1895-1896) as thousands and thousands of Armenians were killed across the Empire.</p>
<p>The French vice consul of Diyarbakir recounted that the Turks would refuse to attack people who defended themselves, instead concentrated on defenseless districts. He also wrote about the Ottoman troops burning down a Cathedral in which 3,000 Armenians had taken refuge and shooting anyone who tried to escape.</p>
<p>The violence lasted until 1897 when the Sultan relented.</p>
<p>A German Pastor who collected data on the destruction estimated that 88,243 Armenians were killed, 546,000 were forced into poverty, 2,493 villages were destroyed, 456 villages were forcibly converted to Islam, and 693 Churches were destroyed or converted into Mosques. Other estimates of deaths range from 80,000 to 300,000 Armenians.
25,000 Assyrians were also killed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I can't understand is this (may be this should be it's own ELI5 post) - what do we attain by not apologizing for our past actions? Japan wouldn't apologize for its treatment of Chinese/Koreans during WW2, Russia wouldn't acknowledge it's mass rapes in Germany after allies victory in WW2...and so on. I'm sure there are dozens more we could find. I read somewhere that Japan doesn't even want it's younger generation to know about its role in the war.</p>
<p>Why can't we (by we, I mean every country that has a shitty past behavior - which is probably most countries on the planet) apologize? Wouldn't that help heal wounds? How hard would it be to say &quot;I acknowledge and recognize my past actions. I am sorry I put you through this. Let us work together now and make sure it doesn't happen again&quot; - how hard can that be?</p>
<p>Edit: Not sure if I explained it well, but made a ELI5 question on this topic. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/33gsax/eli5_why_dont_countries_and_societies_acknowledge/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/33gsax/eli5_why_dont_countries_and_societies_acknowledge/</a> For some reason, this kinda behavior really really really bothers me</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
