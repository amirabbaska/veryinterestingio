		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question. The short answer is we are not sure. Here is one potential explanation: Eggs need to be distiguishable, because otherwise another bird could infiltrate their own eggs into other birds's nests. Some Cuckoo birds do this (it's called brood parasitsm if you want to learn more). If all eggs were all camoflauged they would be fairly indistinguishable  and such parasitic birds would florish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question.  I did a bit of digging and found <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2016/07/25/why-are-robins-eggs-blue/#22c11d126408" target="_blank">this</a> write up which cites some research indicating that the blue color provides protection from UV radiation, which can damage embryos.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120514122838.htm" target="_blank">article</a> cites research showing that male robins take better care of offspring from bright blue eggs...essentially saying that the color is a signal from the female indicating her offspring are high quality and worth investing time into.  </p>
<p>Note that both of these explanations could well be true.</p>
<p>In a broader sense, camouflage is usually stronger in ground nesting bird eggs, such as the eggs of plover.  Robin eggs are in nests usually located well off the ground.  Visual camouflage on the eggs is less important because the eggs themselves are fairly well hidden by the nest and the leaves around it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
