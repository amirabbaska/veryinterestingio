I can't find a source atm, but i recall reading that when Apple was first developing the iPod a common complaint about the shuffle feature was that it wasn't &quot;random&quot; enough. In fact, the original version <em>was</em> random, or as pseudorandom as possible.</p>
<p>They reworked the shuffle function to weigh highly played / recently added tracks more than seldom played / old tracks, so the songs you love most or just discovered got played first. This rework tested much better with focus groups, and is the version released.</p>
<p>i wish i had the article though...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is my crazy observation. I have a giant playlist (1300 songs) that I have both on iCloud that I stream on my phone and PCs, and on an ipod classic that lives in my car. The ipod has no internet connection and has no knowledge of the play count or order on the iCloud version. Yet both will pay the same songs consistently. Meaning I may hear the exact same song with in a day from either source. </p>
<p>At first I thought I was crazy or my mind was smoothing the data, but I brought it up to my wife and she confirms that from that huge list of songs, both lists choose to play the same songs in the same span of time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of responses to how random number generators work...not a lot to answer the question.
I googled this a while back and there's lots of articles. It comes down a few factors. Primarily, I learned, each song is given a weight based on if you gave star values, how long it's been in your list, how many times you specifically requested the song (this one I think is bullshit), and whether Apple promoted the song, artist, or publisher. This last one is debated hotly. Those who truly believe that Apple would never do such a thing deny it. People who remember the U2 SNAFU can believe it. Interestingly Apple neither confirms or denies.
So now each song has weight. You hit shuffle and the algorithm picks up songs based on weight and throws a few curve balls in to make it seem more random. Again, part of the algorithm.  Every time you hit shuffle the algorithm starts anew. Theoretically just hitting play will pick up the algorithm where you left off but in my experience and the experience of the authors I read, that's not actually true either.
Does this help?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
