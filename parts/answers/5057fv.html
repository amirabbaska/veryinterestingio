		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question. Typically the rule of thumb is that drafting in cycling lets you go the same speed as the leader using 30% less power. In running however, a much smaller portion of the overall drag is due to air resistance. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7380693" target="_blank">This article</a> estimates it at about 8% of the total power for sprinting (at 22 mph), meaning that if that were <em>totally</em> eliminated then the same athlete (let's call him Usain) could go about 2.5% faster (because power consumption is proportional to the cube of velocity). <a href="http://klotza.blogspot.com/2015/10/an-empirical-look-at-scaling-of-world.html" target="_blank">Usain's top average speed</a> is about 23.5 mph, while his peak speed is about 27.3 mph. With this estimate, extreme drafting would still only bring him up to 28 mph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a bicycle you can change the gearing so that your legs can keep pedalling at the same cadence. In running your legs have to move faster, and I suppose that is where the limit actually lies. Even in a vacuum your legs would probably not be able to move much quicker than they do at 1 atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FYI, you can replicate this exactly on a treadmill. There's no air resistance due to forward motion, but the other laws of kinematics and &quot;leg swing&quot; drag still apply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is the point of this thought exercise to get a legal medal winning time, or just to reach 30 mph? As someone mentioned, tailwinds are considered against a time trial and invalidating the run, so too would an automated sled that acts as the front running object to escape the drag.
If you really wanted to hit 30 mph no questions asked, just set the running course going downhill, add high velocity fans to give the runner a tailwind, and watch the speed go to 30mph and beyond.
The new running tracks would be bell shaped, as the starting point wound be on a hill, the end point at the bottom, and the backstop being the hill rise on the other side to slow down runners. It would be more exciting to watch, as going downhill at top speed leaves the runner in very little control, and wipeouts are sure to come.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
