		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your memory is organized in a way called &quot;associative&quot;, which is kind of like looking up things based on &quot;tags&quot; in things like email. But there are so many things with so many different tags that the tags get &quot;weighted&quot; by how many times you have used them before. when you try to remember something that you know you know, but can't quite think of, you have found a tag that takes you to a memory of having known something but the tag from that memory isn't weighted enough to get you to the actual memory you want. In ELI5 terms, you have found the entry in library card catalog that tells you what book you need, but you can't find the book in the stacks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to the top comment, but the way i understand it is that it comes down to a lack of 'retrieval cues'. Things like how you feel, where you are (external and internal cues) are a part of your memories and when you have those around you, retrieving memories from Long Term Memory or Short Term Memory is easier. If you dont, it becomes harder. </p>
<p>Studies have shown that people recall information better when their external environment is the same as it was at the time of learning. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way I've seen it described before is that, when you're searching for something you have memorized like a name, your brain &quot;crosses out&quot; similar things to make it easier to find the right thing. Unfortunately, it sometimes crosses out what you're looking for as well. This is also why if you stop thinking about it, it'll often come to you: what you were actively looking for is no longer being crossed out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
