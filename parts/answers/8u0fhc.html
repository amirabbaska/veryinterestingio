		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Babies survive initially on their mother's natural antibodies (shared through the placenta and then through breastmilk) until the baby itself has developed an immune system capable of protecting itself. The thymus in particular is an organ that needs to develop for a while before it can handle any vaccines. Otherwise, without a functional immune system, the vaccine can just make the baby sick and won't result in the development of any immunity.</p>
<p>It then comes down to A) whether the vaccine is attenuated, dead, or a toxin vaccine, which each require the developing body to be a certain age/immune strength to be effective.  B) The age of administration of the vaccine is also relevant to the diseases the baby will encounter at that age. Many are given at 6, 12, 18 months etc because babies are very prone to whooping cough, measels, pertussis, polio, with lethal outcomes. On the other hand, the gardasil vaccine isn't really necessary until the child is much older (I think the current age is 12, may soon be 10), because it is unlikely that a 12mo baby will encounter a sexually transmitted virus. </p>
<p>The vaccine scheduled has been refined to make sure the greatest amount of immunity can be achieved at the earliest time possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Giving repeat doses of vaccine to infants addresses Maternal Interference — newborns receive a “starter set” of antibodies from the mother in the colostrum or placenta (it varies with species; horses are totally colostrum-dependent, humans less so).</p>
<p>If you vaccinate while circulating maternal antibodies are high, the vaccine antigen will be attacked by those maternal antibodies, short-circuiting the need for baby to mount a cellular immune response of his/her own.</p>
<p>But vaccinate too late, and baby is left at risk to the fully-virulent pathogen in the interim.</p>
<p>The idea is to vaccinate as soon as possible after maternal antibodies start to decline. The simplest way to do this is to vaccinate repeatedly, hopefully catching a majority of infants in that variable time window.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A baby mammal receives a certain amount of antibodies in the colostrum.  Those antibodies provide resistance to certain illnesses, but they run out after a certain time.  Vaccines are given in a series based on when that resistance begins running out.</p>
<p>So to use puppies as an example, 25% of the puppies will no longer be protected by maternal antibodies at 6 weeks and 100% will no longer be protected at 15 weeks.  We give vaccines every three weeks between those two ages because we want to minimize the amount of time they are unprotected by either maternal antibodies or their own generated in response to the vaccine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have evolved to be a vertebrate, you have developed what is called an adaptive immune system.  This is your T cells and B cells, which are really unique in terms of all the other cells in your body.  Clones of T and B cells express unique receptors-they've rearranged their DNA to produce a TCR (T cell receptor) or BCR (B cell receptor).  This makes them respond only to a single antigen-just a tiny part of a potential pathogen.  But they do it really well, and they have memory, so they respond quicker and better with each exposure.  </p>
<p>We vaccinate because this long-lived memory response will protect you if you're exposed to the pathogens you've been vaccinated with.  Live virus vaccines aren't given until after 1 year of age because you don't always develop long-term memory if you're exposed very early in life.  But in general, only 1 or 2 exposures to a live attenuated virus vaccine will give life long immunity.  This would be, in the US at least, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.  </p>
<p>Other vaccines contain only peptides or killed bacteria or polysaccharides from bacteria, usually mixed with something to help stimulate a good immune response.  These vaccines usually create a long-term, but not life long immune response.  That's why you need diptheria, tetanus, and pertussis boosters every 5-10 years. </p>
<p>Since life long immunity isn't in the cards with these vaccines, and since they don't have a live virus component that could impact children with undiagnosed immune deficiency, and because the diseases they protect against (pertussis especially) can be lethal in children in the first few months of life, babies are vaccinated earlier with this type of vaccine.  </p>
<p>The vaccine schedule has been extensively tested to balance providing protective immunity to as high a percentage of vaccinated children as possible, as soon as possible, and as safely as possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason to spread vaccines out a bit is the possibility of serious side effects. Check out the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm" target="_blank">CDC's list of side effects</a>.</p>
<p>If a child suffers a severe side effect (such as a seizure) after receiving a vaccine, it may be in the best interest of that child to not receive certain other vaccines, since they're at a higher risk for a similar reaction. And even less serious, but more common side effects (such as headache, swelling, soreness, or fever), while by themselves are usually harmless, can compound and put a lot of stress on a child's small body if they receive too many vaccines at once.</p>
<p>Some vaccines have different effective rates when administered at different ages. Also, some vaccines have multiple doses given months or years apart. For example, after the first dose, 80% a population might acquire immunity. After the second dose, it might increase to 90%. And after a third dose, the immunity rate could increase to 95%. The second and third rounds are unnecessary for the 80% who acquired immunity from the first round. But there's often no cheap, safe way to tell who needs it again, so everyone gets it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
