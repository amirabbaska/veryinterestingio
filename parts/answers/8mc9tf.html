		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;sensor&quot; part of a metal detector is made of coils of wire, usually in a plastic of epoxy shell.</p>
<p>Metal detectors don't detect metal directly.  They detect changes is magnetic permeability.  They send out a magnetic signal and measure how the surroundings effect it.  Sure, many parts like the arm are metal, but they don't move relative to the sensor.  You use the detector by sweeping it from side to side.  If there is a metal object, the magnetic permeability is different and when you sweep the sensor through the space around the metal object, it beeps.  Only change in metal-i-ness around the sensor makes it beep, and the metal arm doesn't change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Metal detectors don't detect metal so much as they detect <em>change</em> in the amount of metal around them.  </p>
<p>All alone, the metal in the detector serves as a baseline that goes up as it gets near other metal sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A metal detector puts out a magnetic field and looks for disturbances in it caused by the presence of other metals. It doesn't detect itself because it is constructed to recognize its own field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The detector coil is part of a tuned circuit that can induce an electrical current into any metal around the coil assembly. The amount of current induced is determined by the conductivity of the metal and it affects the tuning of the coil detector circuit. That change of frequency is converted into an audible signal such that the tone heard is changed by different metals, so an experienced detectorist can tell the difference between rusty iron and gold, for example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A metal detector doesn't detect itself in the same way a scale doesn't weigh itself. It <em>does</em>, really, but it's calibrated in a way that makes that measurement the zero point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
