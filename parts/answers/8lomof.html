<p>&quot;Overall “skin–iron odor” mechanism: The metallic odor from iron contacting skin is surprisingly a type of human body odor. Sweaty skin corrodes iron metal to form reactive Fe2+ ions that are oxidized within seconds to Fe3+ ions while simultaneously reducing and decomposing existing skin lipidperoxides to odorous carbonyl hydrocarbons that are perceived as a metallic odor. This fast reaction creates the sensory illusion that it is the “metal in itself” that we smell right after touching it. Similar mechanisms underlie the skin–metal odors of iron, copper, and brass (<a href="https://application.wiley-vch.de/contents/jc_2002/2006/z602100_s.pdf" target="_blank">Supporting Information</a> ) used as every‐day objects. &quot;</p>
<p>Basically, it's the different chemicals from our skin/sweat etc reacting with the metals. The metals don't smell-- we do!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the smell comes from <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2006/061023/full/news061023-7.html" target="_blank">your skin</a> after handling certain metals. You'll notice if you just go up and smell a copper pipe, without touching it, there is little odor. But handle copper, and the smell is quite obvious. It is caused by reactions with the oils in your skin. Similarly, you'll notice finger prints on clear fresh shiny copper. These tiny reactions can lead to quite noticeable smells. The linked article explains in more detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe my high school Chemistry teacher said something along the lines of:</p>
<p>Something has to touch the metal before you can smell it on your fingers. This is because the oxide coating is dissolved into your skin's oils and lipid tissues. In some cases like silver, the oxide layer can't even be smelled. This is as silver oxide isn't as soluble, and silver is also antibacterial, removing any organic molecules that can carry the smell on your skin. I believe that all martensitic, ferritic and austenitic steels are able to be detected by scent. This concept also applies to zinc and copper oxide groups.</p>
