		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool is more than just a word for something good. It does mean that, but it has other related uses.</p>
<p>It can refer to a &quot;cool head&quot; which is someone who doesn't get worked up about things, as opposed to a hothead.</p>
<p>This calm demeanor is frequently interpreted by onlookers as confidence or surity, which are generally desirable traits.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;cool&quot; is accepted use for more moderate levels of desirability. &quot;That was cool&quot; can express anything from relatively mild approval to outright amazement depending on inflection.</p>
<p>Other slang terms, like radical or tubular were necessarily used to represent more dramatic emotions regarding the subject. This likely results in a sort of burnout of the words because people get sick of here how <em>everything</em> is so great, while &quot;cool&quot; is just, well, cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As physical creatures with bodies, we learn words by relating them to direct experiences from our senses. We say things like, 'He's getting high up there in the company' or 'That was a heavy decision.' Note that though we are talking about abstract concept, we are describing them in terms of the physical experiences heavy and high, a kind of knowing that happens as a result of being inside a body.</p>
<p>Everything we experience is perceived through our bodies. This is called embodied cognition. A psychologist named George Lakoff discovered that all of our abstract metaphors are rooted in concrete embodied ways of knowing things. The word 'cool' is a temperature sensation that we commandeer to refer to abstract concepts such as the cool-headed father or the cool highschooler.</p>
<p>Because it is directly tied to an embodied sensory perception it is easy for us to interpret it abstractly. In contrast, words like 'rad' or 'groovy' are not as easily visualized and so a speaker would have to do more cognitive legwork to generate a visualization of the word's meaning. </p>
<p>Not so with cool. We've all felt a cool breeze. We know people who are hot headed and cool headed. Emotionally cold. Or just simply cool to be with. It is easy to attach to, direct and visceral. Words that are catchy and easy to relate to in this way stick around while others go by the way side, a kind of survival of the fittest, like a meme.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is it just me that find all these words and phrases charming and kind of humorous? Rad, tubular, bodacious (damn that's a good one) and pretty much anything of the sorts is just plain... Attractive from a linguistic standpoint. It's kind of like British slang, you know how they can say pretty much whatever they want and it still makes sense somehow?</p>
<p>&quot;Chop some gonder on the blimp before you turn purple, will ye?&quot; could mean anything between &quot;Please remember to take out the thrash before you go to bed&quot; to &quot;I fully expect you to pay back your debt within a reasonable timespan or else I'll strangle you and your family&quot;... Yet still it makes some kind of sense as long as you say it with a witty British accent and some confidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool is the Swiss army knife of words. It is a word whose meaning changes completely depending on inflection. Rad, groovy, far out, bitchin', sick, tight etc. Sort of have the inflection built into them. </p>
<p>Cool, along with the right inflection can convey entire paragraphs worth of thought. I think this has to do with its longevity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The Carpenter I hired to help me restore and old farmhouse had just finished a rough first day on the job. A flat tire made him lose an hour of work, his electric saw quit, and now his ancient pickup truck refused to start. While I drove him home, he sat in stony silence.</p>
<p>On arriving, he invited me in to meet his family. As we walked toward the front door, he paused briefly at a small tree, touching the tips of the branches with both hands. When opening the door, he underwent an amazing transformation. His tanned face wreathed in smiles and he hugged his two small children and gave his wife a kiss.</p>
<p>Afterward he walked me to the car. We passed the tree and my curiosity got the better of me. I asked him about what I had seen him do earlier.</p>
<p>'Oh, that's my trouble tree,' he replied. 'I know I can't help having troubles on the job, but one thing for sure, troubles don't belong in the house with my wife and the children. So I just hang them on the tree every night when I come home. Then in the morning I pick them up again.'</p>
<p>'Funny thing is,' he smiled, 'when I come out in the morning to pick 'em up, there ain't nearly as many as I remember hanging up the night before.'</p>
