<p>I'm assuming if you looked at the sky, it would always be filled with stars, but punctuated with black silhouettes like the moon or some other planet/asteroid that are close enough to see with the naked eye.</p>
<p>And would it be much darker on the surface of the earth than our current night-times? Or about the same?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Potentially, for decades or even centuries.</p>
<p>The effects of a disappearing sun would hit us in about 8 minutes. After that everything goes dark except for stars and artificial light. It also gets quite cold. By a week, the global average surface temperature would drop under 0° F or -17° C. Since there is no photosynthesis, plants would die, herbivores die, and then carnivores. </p>
<p>We could still survive though. Plants can be grown with artificial light we gain from light-independant energy. The places that wil stay <em>warm</em> longest will be the oceans. Because the surface will freeze, the oceans will be insulated for a very long time, possibly millions of years. So big submarines or underwater complexes, powered by oil or better torrents could keep us alive for quite awhile. Though most humans would probably die first.</p>
<p>Another place would be Iceland. Iceland has a lot of geothermal energy sources which don't depend on the sun. That would also solve the heating problem. </p>
<p>You should just better start building your bunker soon. You won't get much done in the one week of total chaos while society breaks down.</p>
<p>Edit: This is if the Sun suddenly disappears without a trace. For the case that it explodes, dies, or flies away, /u/TheB3stEv3r has the correct user name.</p>
<p>Also, I was just referring to human life. For all life, /u/Redshift2k5 rightly said that some <del>micro</del>organisms deep in the oceans or the Earth's crust would most likely survive for millions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't an easy question because it would depend on what happened to the sun. Here are a few possible cases and explanations: </p>
<p>Case 1: Supernova.
About eight minutes. We would all be burnt to a crisp. And assuming we could survive the heat, the radiation from losing the ozone layer would kill everyone pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Case 2: The sun is somehow 'turned off' like a light.
We wouldnt notice anything for ablut 8 minutes when it would suddenly be dark. The earth would be able to retain enough heat to sustain life for a few days. Maybe some people could survive a few more by going to extreme lengths, but the temperature would soon be unhospitable to life. It might be possible for microorganisms nearest the core and deep near thermal vents in the deep ocean to survive this at least for a while.</p>
<p>Case 3: The sun is suddenly gone.
This is the most unpredictable case. The earth is moving extremely quickly around the sun, held there by gravity. Now if the sun vanished, so does that gravity keeping us from being slingshotted  into space. Assuming we didn't collide with another planet or sufficiently large asteroid which would rather immediately cause mass extinction, the results would be the same as Case 2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's some good answers here regarding what happens on Earth as a result of no light or heat, but there's a much larger problem: gravity.</p>
<p>If the Sun suddenly disappears, Earth is no longer in its orbit. Not such a big deal: we cannot leave the Habitable Zone  where liquid water happens if said Zone no longer exists. The cold is still a problem. The real worry for me is what happens to the minor bodies: asteroids and comets. </p>
<p>For the most part, asteroids hang out in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. This is, however, a simplification. There's quite a few asteroids closer to the Sun. There's also a bunch in gravitationally stable points on Jupiter's orbit (they're called Greeks and Trojans) [A wildly simplified picture] (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/InnerSolarSystem-en.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/InnerSolarSystem-en.png</a>). There's also a bunch of comets that have no particularly defined region; they're just kind of all over the place. Asteroids are mostly in the same plane as the rest of the solar system (the ecliptic), but comets can be far above or below that plane at any given moment.</p>
<p>Gravity keeps all of these things in orbit around the Sub. Gravitational effects travel at the Speed of Light. If the Sun magically winks or of existence, none of these things are bound to their orbits anymore, and they'll start zipping off at a tangent to their orbit as soon as those effects reach them. This means Mercury starts wandering off in 3.2 minutes. Venus at 6. Earth at 8.3 and so on.</p>
<p>Here's something else: things close to the Sun move faster, because the gravity pulls them really hard. In the case of comets, they get super-quick and come around the other side with enough force to fling them billions of miles before they run out of steam and are pulled back again. So the things closest to the Sun are moving the fastest. And they're also the ones that will be affected by the Sun's disappearance first. </p>
<p>Space is big, and the Earth is relatively not big, so we're not a huge target. But we are suddenly talking about a bunch of stuff shooting all over the place at very high speeds. Things that were in stable orbits to never hit Earth are no longer in those orbits, and neither is Earth. And they're not easily predicted either, because any time they get close enough to another object, both paths will be altered slightly be gravity. </p>
<p>That's bad enough for the stuff near the Sun. Wait until it hits the Asteroid Belt. </p>
<p>Jupiter is 40 light minutes from the Sun. That means that in less than an hour, our neighborhood of space has become an utter chaos of ballistics. In less than 6 hours, the effects reach the Kuiper Belt, where there's a lot of stuff that's a lot bigger. </p>
<p>Now, none of the stuff in our neighborhood is huge, except the planets. In diameter, Ceres is a bit smaller than Texas, and that's by far the biggest asteroid. Many more are the size of a skyscraper or a few city blocks. But when these things are traveling at, usually, well over 40,000 miles per hour, they carry a big punch. </p>
<p>Destruction of the dinosaurs at Chicxulub? Asteroid the size of San Francisco. Something the size of comet 67P (downtown LA)? There goes North America. Stuff the size of your house? Goodbye most of a city. Ceres or Vesta? Repave the planet with a new crust.</p>
<p>If the Sun disappears, we're looking at a brief but intense bombardment that could destroy huge portions of this planet's surface. Or none of them could hit us, and we have exactly the same scenario as everyone else is saying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. It'd take 8 or so minutes before we knew about it. Up to that point we would still be orbiting the &quot;sun&quot; as usual. Once it ceases to exist, and assuming we wouldn't be on collision course with any of the other planets, then we'd just fly off in a straight line into space.</p>
<p>With no sun to keep us warm, we'd start to get cold. It's probably take about a week before the surface becomes uninhabitable, but a bit more time before anything like the oceans freezing over starts happening.</p>
<p>In theory, if someone had a bunker full of other power sources, a place to grow food and some supplies then they could survive for quite a while, but eventually they're run out of something they need and die. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
