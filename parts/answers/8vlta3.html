		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When researchers give chimps eggs, they often search the area for a particular plant that they like to eat with eggs. They gather some leaves, put the whole raw egg in one cheek, and a few leaves from the plant in the other cheek. Then they crack the egg inside their cheek and mix the egg and leaf together in their mouths, I would consider that a sort of spicing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://nagonline.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Chimpanzee-Nutrition.pdf" target="_blank">Often leaves are added to soft fruits that have been crushed against the
ridged palate of the chimpanzee, and sometimes to eggs and meat. This mixture of leaves and other foods forms a &quot;wadge&quot; that is sucked for 10 minutes or more to extract its juices. A wadge may be held in the mouth as the chimpanzee moves to another feeding site (Goodall, 1986).</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some animals, Elephants specifically, will eat charcoal or clay when they have consumed a toxic plant to help absorb the toxins. Not like they accidentally ate a toxic plant but more like resources are short and they eat a lot of a plant they know is toxic. They will then go eat charcoal as well. Not sure is qualifies as the recipe style you are aiming for but it came to mind and itâ€™s neat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but I recall this story about the Japanese macaque (these are the little dudes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OliaeMp7ao" target="_blank">chilling in the natural hot tubs</a> at the opening of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baraka_(film)" target="_blank">Baraka</a>). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To facilitate observation they lured the creatures out of the forest with rations of sweet potatoes and wheat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With these daily handouts, and more free time, the macaques began to invent new behaviors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great innovator within the Koshima troop was a one-and-a-half year old infant female named Imo. In 1953, Imo was the first to begin washing the sweet potatoes. She passed the behavior to her mother and it slowly began to spread. A decade later, potato washing had become a fixed behavior in the troop. Most newborns picked up the skill quickly. By 1962, about three quarters of Koshima monkeys over two years old washed their food.

</blockquote>
<p>Now, these sweet potatoes were given to them by humans, and I'm not sure if you'd consider this &quot;intentionally combining foods&quot;, but it's the closest natural behavior to what you're asking. </p>
<p>I think there's also a chimp that started cooking their food, but I think that one is more closely tied to structured efforts by a research team and probably toes the line on interference a lot more .</p>
<p>EDIT: added link to movie scene, and referenced article. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey bees produce several &quot;foods&quot; that are not strictly collected, stored and eaten substances.</p>
<p>Honey is nectar collected in a bees honey crop (an upper stomach)  where it is mixed with enzymes. That nectar is passed to other bees in the hive who blow bubbles with it reducing the water content from around 80%. They then store it and reduce the water content further (ideally below 18.4%) before capping. They enzymes are an important component changing the nectar into honey. And the processing has to occur to make the nectar honey.</p>
<p>They also produce bee bread. They collect pollen, place it in cells along with gut bacteria and a little honey and allow it to ferment. This seems to be a <a href="http://scientificbeekeeping.com/reevaluating-beebread-part-3/" target="_blank">preservative</a> step as they can use unfermented pollen. But they are changing the pollen and mixing components to do so. There are 3 articles in that link all under <a href="http://scientificbeekeeping.com/bee-nutrition/" target="_blank">Reevaluating Beebread</a> which focuses on the bacterial component.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
