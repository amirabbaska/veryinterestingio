		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main extrinsic finger flexors (excluding thumb musculature, which would add another few layers of complexity to hand movement) called flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS). Extrinsic means they originate in the forearm, but insert in the hand. FDP inserts into the distal segment of the fingers, while FDS inserts into the middle segment. There are also other extrinsic muscles that individually act on the index finger and little finger, specifically to extend those fingers. In addition, there are multiple sets of individual and group muscles that are intrinsic to the hand, meaning they originate in the hand and insert on the fingers, each with a unique action they produce with the fingers. </p>
<p>If you try to flex the distal joint in the fingers, you will have an incredibly difficult time doing it with individual fingers (while you can flex one more than another, you will still be getting at least a little bit of flexion in the other fingers) . However, if you flex the proximal finger joint, you will have an easier time individually flexing digits because of one of those sets of intrinsic muscles called the lumbricals that can act individually on the fingers which flex at the knuckles and extend the proximal finger joint, allowing better voluntary selection of movement.</p>
<p>tl;dr there are a plethora of muscles that act on the fingers, which gives us incredible control and unique movement patterns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscles have subdivisions (motor units) that can be recruited individually. If the muscle fibers of a single motor unit in flexor digitorum profundus all terminate on the ring finger's insertion tendon, firing that motor unit will flex the ring finger, with some slop accounted for by interactions with other muscle fibers, and by tendon interconnections (vinculae).</p>
<p>You may be able to feel this at work on your extensor side: grasp one forearm (left side, for the sake of explanation) so that the tip of your right middle finger is ~3 cm away from the point of the elbow. Now alternate lifting your left middle and ring fingers. You should be able to feel different regions within the same muscle (extensor digitorum) firing to produce different motions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can extend all your digits individually (ring not so much). A fun experiment is to extend all your digits and then flex all but your index finger while monitoring the tendons on the dorsum of the hand.</p>
<p>You'll see the primary tendon shift from extensor digitorum to extensor indicis. The body utilizes a primary agonist for the path of least resistance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
