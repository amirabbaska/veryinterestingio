		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;No two fingers are found to have identical prints, and it is an overwhelming mathematical probability that no two ever will be found to match. The ridge patterns are formed in the human fetus before birth and remain the same throughout a personâ€™s life and even after death until they are lost through decomposition.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is more to it than this, but for all intents and purposes, the ridge-line pattern does not change over time (unless the fingers have been disfigured), but the distance between ridges and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutiae" target="_blank">minutiae</a> does change due to the size of your finger changing (growth). That is why most biometric companies have both child and adult algorithms for fingerprint matching.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask the question then... what is the theory on why do we have fingerprints in the first place?</p>
<p>Edit:  Yea I'll google that next time.  </p>
<p>These epidermal ridges serve to amplify vibrations triggered, for example, when fingertips brush across an uneven surface, better transmitting the signals to sensory nerves involved in fine texture perception. These ridges may also assist in gripping rough surfaces and may improve surface contact in wet conditions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this why police and fire departments have a &quot;kids day&quot; or something where kids get to check out a fire truck, see what it's like in the police department, and get their fingerprints done? The fingerprinting adds you into a database of prints that they can use to identify your body if you're murdered or if you are accused of a criminal act...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
