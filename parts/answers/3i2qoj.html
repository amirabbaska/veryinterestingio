		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is your question why we don't sneeze during sleep, or whether we wake up to sneeze and don't remember it? </p>
<p>If your question is the former, while part of the reason is due to the lack of airflow and movement while you're asleep, there's also the idea that during sleep, the brain does not receive (as many) signals from the motor neurons responsible for reflexes such as sneezing due to 'REM atonia'. You would need much greater stimulation than a little tickle to be woken up from that state. </p>
<p>Here's a nice summary of both of these concepts: <a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/sleep-on-sneeze-not/" target="_blank">http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/sleep-on-sneeze-not/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I scared myself so much that I sat up in bed going, &quot;AH! AH!&quot; before I quickly surmised it was a random sneeze, my sneeze. So weird. My dog and cat responded with glares of severe annoyance and shame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have woken up from sneezes and coughing. Normally by a severe sneeze or cough though. I assume the better answers are correct and that if you do wake when you sneeze or cough, it is during lighter sleep cycles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party, but it can take up to 6 minutes to realize that you are awake from your sleep. I didn't know this until I had a sleep study done to find out I was constantly waking up in my sleep, which felt like a solid sleep to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
