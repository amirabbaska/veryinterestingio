		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Erections are stimulated by the parasympathetic nervous system causing Nitric oxide release within the corpora. This pro-erection process is counter-balanced by an anti-erection effect from the sympathetic nervous system. Normally, they cancel each other out. The Sympathetic nervous system activity dips in the small hours whilst you are asleep and the parasympathetic effect 'wins'. Coupled with a normal diurnal rise in testosterone levels; you get a stonking boner. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This other poster is incorrect, it has nothing to do with the bladder pressing on the prostate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the absence of norepinephrine during the REM phase of the sleep causes erections. In women, this phenomenon is called Nocturnal clitoral tumescence while it is called Nocturnal penile tumescence in men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering women have a similar phenomena, and dont have a prostate....it should be fairly obvious that this has nothing to do with a prostate...</p>

<p>EDIT: Note that there is apparently some debate as to the exact reason for morning wood. The stimulation of the prostate is from a sentence on Wikipedia where citation is needed. While the cause is not entirely known, stimulation of the prostate is absurd</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before I became sexually active (with anyone but myself) especially as a teenager, I would have REALLY sexual sensations in my dreams. I wouldnt necessarily come during these dreams, but because I was pretty  sexually frustrated my body would begin the sexual arousal process in my dreams. So, this is equatable to morning wood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
