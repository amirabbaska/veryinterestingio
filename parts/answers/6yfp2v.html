You can feel it on your toes though, can't ya? Well, your toesies are the fish deep down and your fingers are like the fishes at the top.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> thanks for the gold! And I have to say I didn't expect this to blow up! As for the comment breaking rule number 4, I joined ELI5 when it was first created, I don't think I even knew you can't explain like a literal 5 year old. Sorry mods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Off the coast of Key Largo in about 100 feet of water is the wreck of the USS Spiegal Grove. It was intentionally sunk to form a reef and scuba spot. They botched the sinking and she came to rest upside down on the bottom with the bow extending above the surface. With a second effort they got it completely sunk and laying on her side.
Then in 2005 Hurricane Dennis came thru the area. the first divers to visit the wreck after the storm were shocked to find the wreck sitting upright on the bottom as originally intended!</p>
