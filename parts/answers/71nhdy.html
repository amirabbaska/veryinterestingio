		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parasites must overcome the host immune response. This is probably their greatest challenge. It also depends on the parasite, of course. Small parasites like malaria are well suited to live in the oxygen/nutrient rich blood of humans.
Parasites, like all other living things, also have other organisms that prey on them. Infectious bacteria and viruses have been found for nearly every living thing, so I doubt parasites are an exception. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One big challenge is just the body temperature of a warm-blooded organism.  As I understand it, this is one theory behind why warm-blooded organisms evolved in the first place.  The high temperatures inside a body are not ideal for most potential pathogens (perhaps not obligate parasites though).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is more a follow-up question than a direct answer, but wouldn't the biggest challenge for a parasite be spreading from one host to another?  As hosts are fairly self contained but the parasites are slowly killing the host they have a limited span in which to spread.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others are saying, especially about the host immune system- bacteria/microorganisms can evolve to actually use the host immune system. For example, it's stipulated that group A strep (the bacteria that gives you strep throat) has good defenses against macrophages (a type of white blood cell), and actually hides in them from other host defenses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Key things an organism needs to survive are: oxygen, food and warmth. Parasites will also need to have some way to reproduce to complete their life cycle. </p>
<p>Parasites that occupy the blood stream often stay by the lungs for the high o2 content and it also allows them to lay eggs which are subsequently coughed and swallowed and passed out through the digestive tract. See here for further detail: <a href="http://thorax.bmj.com/content/early/2010/09/29/thx.2009.132217" target="_blank">http://thorax.bmj.com/content/early/2010/09/29/thx.2009.132217</a>.</p>
<p>Food would be acquired via absorbing nutrients from its surroundings. Warmth for the parasite would be maintained by the host. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge for a blood-parasite would be the host's immune system (depending on size). That said, some parasites are known to purposely induce an allergic response to induce coughing and wheezing to pass the eggs out of the lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
