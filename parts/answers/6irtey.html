		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't know. The whole thing is anonymous.</p>
<p>The risk is incredibly low though. Anything more distant than first cousin isn't really even worth worrying about, and even closer the only way you're going to see an immediate issue is if you have a bad recessive that ends up getting expressed...This a risk factor  you'd probably already know about.</p>
<p>Otherwise the only real likely problem is a slightly less robust immune system. We have this idea of inbreeding that is way scarier than the reality. We commonly inbreed our animals (you have a purebred pet? Yea, their family &quot;tree&quot; is more of a bush) and you can see issues, but they're still basically normal in most cases...Mutts are healthier, but not dramatically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There really aren't any safeguards. Safeguards against 'what-if's tend to only be put into place after some kind of tragedy, so I wouldn't expect to see anything legislated until someone's kid comes out badly inbred.</p>
<p>One would suppose that over time this will become a larger and larger problem; as sperm donation is objectively more evolutionary fit behaviour, so a small number of donors with the desire to donate will produce legions of new donors.</p>
<p>It's likely that we'll start doing whole genome scans of everyone before it becomes a problem though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a doctor who used his own semen instead of that of anonymous donors. Fathered some 80 children before he was caught (I'd like to think with his pants down). Apparently someone noticed some the kids looked similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First you must understand the incidence of mutations is about 3% in children of unrelated parents. With inbreeding, of full siblings, the incidence increases to 6%. So it is not actually a huge change. Second, the chance of donor siblings meeting is very low. If you have one unknown half-sibling, which is not unusual in the general population, you have a 1 in 300 million chance to meet, as there are about 300 million people in the USA. Let us suppose you have 100 half siblings. So now you have a 1 in 3 million chance to meet. A 1 in 3 million chance that your chance to have a child with mutations will go from 3% to 6%. Finally, incest is full siblings having a child. Sperm donation isn't going to result in full siblings, it results in half siblings. So now you have a 1 in 2 chance of a 1 in 3 million chance your incidence of mutation goes from 3% to 4.5%??? It's just not worth worrying about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
