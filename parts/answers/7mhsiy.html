		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it simply, whenever a sound comes out of both the left and right channels at an equal volume, your brain will often trick you into believing that the sound is coming from the midpoint between the two channels, creating what's known as a Phantom Center. And since the left and right channels are on either sides of your head, your brain will have you believe that the sound is coming from the middle of your head. Here's a link if you're interested in a slightly more detailed explanation: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_center" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_center</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. GOOD headphones try to reproduce the neutral sound of flat speakers as best as possible, including making it sound like the audio is coming from around you rather than inside your head. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends a lot on the recording technique, actually.</p>
<p>Your brain uses a number of queues to determine where sound comes from. The most obvious is that sound is louder in the ear closest to the sound source. It also arrives sooner to that ear. </p>
<p>Less obviously, the external part of the ear changes the frequency spectrum of the sound, emphasizing high (treble) or low (bass) content depending on the angle the sound approaches from. For sounds produced externally from the ear, the brain is <strong>great</strong> at figuring out where they're coming from.</p>
<p>What this means is even if sound isn't recorded in a way that intentionally gives the impression of coming from one direction or another, you'll still be able to tell the location of the speaker that's playing it for example.</p>
<p>Only headphones (especially in-ear headphones) can bypass all these systems and deprive your brain of the info it needs to understand the source of a sound. </p>
<p>But for it to sound like it's coming from inside your head the audio engineers need to have NOT done any tricks to make it sound like it's coming from some other location... which can be as simple as an instrument being louder in one ear than the other. So lots of audio won't sound perfectly centered. The microphone or a number of other items/effects may create frequency content differences that may give the impression of direction (or at least an external source) as well, even if it wasn't intended by the audio engineer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
