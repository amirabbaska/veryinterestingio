		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/RobusEtCeleritas is correct, you could create a black hole.</p>
<p>Another thing that will likely happen is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_physics" target="_blank">photon-photon scattering</a>.  When the intensity gets large enough, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwinger_limit" target="_blank">the Schwinger limit</a> makes the electric field nonlinear:  photon-photon scattering becomes possible, leading to nonlinearities even in a vacuum.  The Schwinger intensity is much smaller than the intensity necessary to create a Kugelblitz, and will hopefully be reached in our lifetime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is. After a certain amount of photons of specific energy are put in a volume of space, the space itself starts interacting with the said photons. So while you techinically can have an unlimited amount of energy in any point in space (up until the black hole situation that was mentioned), you cannot have a beam with unlimited energy density.<br />
The maximum energy density of any beam of photons depends on their wavelength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the photons are traveling through a medium (air, water, etc.) and there is enough photon flux in a small area, they will create a plasma. This plasma will reflect photons. In fact the plasma will move closer to the source of the light if there is enough photon flux, and reflect the photons even sooner.</p>
<p>This limits the amount a photons in a specific space when traveling through a medium (not empty space).</p>
<p>This is how laser eye surgery works. The laser cut is actually performed by a supersonic shock-wave created by the plasma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't spacetime itself breakdown at some energy density of photons, and transform the photons into matter/antimatter?</p>
<p>I always thought this was the reason for E=MC^2.  That spacetime itself has an energy density limit, and after that limit, energy of any sort &quot;crystallizes&quot; into matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
