		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright, </p>
<p>So, I was doing my Fire Inspector training and I was able to test this at a newly built NFL stadium about 4 years ago. We called it the &quot;Super bowl.&quot;</p>
<p>We recruited local Girl and Boy Scout organizations, schools, and had volunteers sign up to flush all the toilets in the stadium at exactly the same time. The purpose of this was to test the plumbing and simulating &quot;half-time&quot; when most attendees go to the restroom. As the local fire department we were assessing the stadiums ability to handle that much pressure loss. The reasoning is the sprinkler systems require a certain amount of pressure and we wanted to simulate the worst case scenario: Fire during half-time when everyone is busy flushing shit, literally. </p>
<p>Tldr; Fire department I was at did this at a NFL stadium being constructed. We had volunteers flush all the toilets as a stress test, called it the &quot;Super bowl.&quot; Nothing exploded.</p>
<p>Edit: Inclusion. </p>
<p>Edit 2: System we inspected was getting its water supply from a small body of water nearby. Our fire department was ensuring that this eco-friendly water system was capable of handling a heavy workload (bunch of flushing at same time) and still maintain enough pressure for fire sprinklers while being stressed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things will happen.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Water supply pressure will drop. If you have a high building, water could flow back to lower sinks by gravity.  </li>
<li>An air bubble will be trapped inside the sewer lines. Between the flush of floor 1 and the flushes of floors above. This air bubble wants to get out of the way. The air will take the easiest route, which could result in your toilet &quot;exploding&quot; or pushing all water back trough the sifon. The sifon is the j shape that prevents smells from leaving the sewer.</li>
</ol>
<p>We used to have this problem with our toilet on heavy rain. All the water would storm its way down the sewer pipes. And since we were at the lower part of town, the air pushed away by the water would let our toilet &quot;explode&quot; the sifon contents on the ceiling.</p>
<p>An extra vent was placed in the streets to be the easiest path for the air. It has not happened since then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We did this at our High School back a lonnnngggg time ago. After a few unsuccessful attempts due to lack of timing we initiated &quot;Operation Royal Flush Phase IV&quot;.  At the bell all toilets were to be flushed, all taps turned on at the sinks. All tolled there were probably two or three hundred fixtures.</p>
<p>At the bell we all did our thing...I was in the B-200 wing Men's washroom...</p>
<p>Flush.......a slow gurgle.....the water down the trap then........nothing..........then....... a low rumble.....then.....you could feel it coming.......every toilet and sink literally exploded with regurgitated liquid.....hitting the fan......omg nothing so grand had ever been seen before it was a total success. Even more so as they had to close the school for a week to get it back in shape....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it's a modern building and there are no obstructions in the waste line, the toilets will all flush normally.  The water service is sized to supply every fixture at the same time.  The waste lines are as well.</p>
<p>Edit - Apparently that isn't true for a skyscraper though, I never built one of those.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The Don and Mike radio show did a stunt at Jack Kent Cook stadium (now FedEx Field) where participants would poop in the toilets first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
