		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Iron Law of Prohibition. This is a term coined by Richard Cowan in 1986 which posits that as law enforcement becomes more intense, the potency of prohibited substances increases. </p>
<p>It is based on the premise that when drugs or alcohol are prohibited, they will be produced in black markets in more concentrated and powerful forms, because these more potent forms offer better efficiency in the business model—they take up less space in storage, less weight in transportation, and they sell for more money. </p>
<p>For example, in the era of alcohol prohibition, people started drinking more whiskey than beer. Why? It's easier to smuggle more alcohol content this way because whisky contains more alcohol than beer. Another example is opiods. Opium gave way to heroin once the substance became harder to obtain legally.</p>
<p>In the era of marijuana prohibition, the same rules apply. If it's possible to increase the potency (other Redditors here have explained how this can be done), economic forces dictate that it will indeed increase so long as prohibition persists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Selective breeding is a big part of of. There are actually some places (I think the Netherlands does it) where contests are held to see who can bring the most potent marijuana. </p>
<p>With enough selective breeding you can seriously alter a plant ( or animal) into something way different than its ancestors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It used to be more popular to buy a raw product that had minimal trimming and had seeds and stems all included with that potency. Now when you buy weed, it tends to be seedless with minimal stems. </p>
<p>Selective breeding, nutrient lines made specifically for cannabis, hydroponics, indoor gardening, and Co2 injection have also made a big impact on THC levels. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marijuana farmers have developed better methods, better strains of the plant, etc.  It's just like corn or soybeans, the selectively bred version is much more productive than the wild species because farmers preferentially plant the more productive strains.  Over hundreds of years, farmers find the limit.  It will increase, but a little less each year, until some other factor becomes as important to buyers as THC content.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the old days, marijuana was grown outdoors and the entire plant sold as product. In the 1980s, Canadian pot activist Marc Emery started importing seeds from the Netherlands, breeding plants, and selling seeds by mail in Canada and the US. At the same time, electric lights became powerful and efficient enough to grow marijuana indoors. The plant were prevented from fertilizing, creating female flowers, and only the most potent parts of the plant were sold as product.</p>
<p>Also, in the 1980s, Canada passed a new law called the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and one test case from the early 1990s was R v Kokesh. In that case, a policeman had gone up to a house and peeked in all the windows before getting a warrant &quot;in the course of his duties.&quot; The Supreme Court ruled that unconstitutional, and police were from then on required to get a warrant before stepping anywhere on the property.</p>
<p>This led to a rush of growers renting large luxury homes on large properties in British Columbia to build grow shows, which the police could not effectively bust. Selective breeding and sharing seeds led to better and better product and a boom in smuggling from BC into the US. Eventually, American growers adopted the same techniques and seed stocks. Marc Emery was arrested and extradicted to the US for trial, but his project to revolutionize the pot business was effectively complete.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
