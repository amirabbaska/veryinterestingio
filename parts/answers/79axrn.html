		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About 10 years ago there was actually a black fungus collected within the reactor walls of Chernobyl that was found to be feeding off of the abundant radiation. </p>
<p>&quot;'Just as the pigment chlorophyll converts sunlight into chemical energy that allows green plants to live and grow, so might melanin help fungi make use of ionizing radiation, said nuclear medicine specialist Ekaterina Dadachova at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a lot of others have pointed out living off of the radiation is not a problem.  Essentially that's what all plants do when they photosynthesize, and many of the other things we've found that live in places like Chernobyl are essentially doing the same thing but using the energy released by radioactive decay.</p>
<p>What you're getting at is something different, the actual consumption of the radioactive materials themselves.  This is definitely possible as we have a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithotroph" target="_blank">lithotrophic</a> organisms, usually single celled.  These are bacteria and such that eat stone and extract what they need from material itself.</p>
<p>There are a lot of variations of this using different strategies, such as chemolithoautotrophs (chemical - stone - self feeders).</p>
<p>Around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotroph#Chemoautotroph" target="_blank">deep sea volcanic vents there are chemotrophs</a> that consume the chemicals coming from the vents and form the basis of life for a whole ecosystem.</p>
<p>It's certainly plausible that there are organisms living off of direct consumption of radioactive materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's first important to understand what radiation is. It's the result of a radioactive decay of an unstable atom. There's a few different types of radiation gamma ( a photon is emitted), alpha ( a helium-4 nucleus is emitted), beta (an electron is emitted), neutron emmision, fission (atom splits roughly in half and emits some neutrons and photons). What's important to understand is the only thing that is different about radiation than their ordinary counter-parts is the kinetic energy that they carry. Plants already use gamma radiation to grow (just ordinary light) via photo-synthesis. Something similar could be used to &quot;eat&quot; other types of radiation. </p>
<p>This however wouldn't speed up the radioactive decays of the fission fragments left over from fission (this is where the harmful radiation comes from after said nuclear war). So yes something could eat radiation but not actually help us survive in highly radioactive conditions. </p>
<p>Now simply speeding up the decays wouldn't necessarily help either. All unstable atoms have an associated half life. Meaning that if an atom has a half life of 1 minute that after one minute you would expect that whatever quantity of the atoms you started with half will have decayed. Now with fission fragments it's not the ones that decay quickly that are an issue (Something with a half life of a week would be essentially gone in about 5 weeks). And the long lived ones aren't really a problem either if something has a half life of 10,000 years you're never gonna be in danger being near it because aging will kill you faster. It's the middle of the road ones that cause issues the Goldie lock zone if you will. Not too long and not too short. But if you speed up all decays than nothing really changes since the longer lived decays will take the place of the middle ones.</p>
<p>TL;DR yes you can absolutely have something eat radiation (plants already do) but it wouldn't really help clean up a nuclear disaster or the fallout after a nuclear war.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sure, we could. The thing is, what we really need is something that feeds on radioactive material(the stuff that emits radiation). A fungus or bacteria that fed off of the contamination left over from nuclear projects and fallout would be fantastically useful and could clean up the environment dramatically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
