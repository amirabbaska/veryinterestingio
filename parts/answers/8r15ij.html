		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First let's ignore the space shuttle because it was a very weird and unique spacecraft that broke a lot of rules.</p>
<p>We do not launch rockets just to launch rockets. The goal of rocket launch is to send a satellite in orbit to do something. Most of the satellites are used for communication and TV. They need very powerful radios that weight several hundred kilograms. Those powerful radios also need big antennas and powerful solar panels. Once you add up all the systems needed to make the spacecraft work you get a satellite that weigh a few tons. </p>
<p>In order to get your satellite in orbit the rocket need to bring it to a few thousand kilometer altitude. However the real issue is that if you want it to stay in orbit the rocket needs to accelerate the spacecraft up to at least 7.5 km/s (27,000 km/h or 16,000 mph)! This is were most of the fuel is spent. So basically the size of the rocket determines how much mass it can launch into space. </p>
<p>The obvious solution is to make smaller and lighter spacecraft. With the progress in electronics (size and power consumption) this is somewhat feasible. This is why we are seeing a real commercial boom right now in small satellite design and manufacturing. And people are trying to take advantage of this by building small rockets. There are dozens of startup designing such small launcher that have popped up in the last few years. <a href="http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Rocket-Lab-Peter-Beck-The-Weatherford-Electron-Rocket-Lab-photo-posted-on-SpaceFlight-Insider1-647x479.jpg" target="_blank">One of the most successful example so far is the Electron rocket from RocketLab</a>. However it can only launch a couple hundred kilogram into a relatively low orbit. </p>
<p>But small rockets have another drawback. In general they are less efficient than larger ones. There are several reasons for that but the main issues are that the tanks weigh more for the same quantity of fuel, small motors are less efficient and they are more affected by air drag. The result is that they are not necessarily less expensive in term of dollars spent per kilogram sent in orbit. A better compromise might be to build a small satellite and share a launch with others. That gets you the lower price to space but you might not have the exact launch date and final orbit you want since you are sharing the rocket with others.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Volume to surface area ratio. Volume increases faster than surface area as you increase size. Air drag is the second most important limiting factor to overcome for a lift vehicle behind gravity and is directly tied to surface area. Weight to thrust is a linear relationship, area to thrust is a roughly squared relationship, and volume to thrust is a roughly cubed relationship. So to a point (and very much in general), the larger you make the lift vehicle, the more stuff you can carry per amount of thrust you generate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever we talk about orbits or moving around in space, we are really talking about <em>velocity</em>. If I am in orbit and increase my velocity, I move to a higher orbit. Eventually I will break free of whatever body I am orbiting. Changing velocity requires energy, and usually a lot of it.</p>
<p>Standing at rest on Earth's surface and moving into orbit requires a significant change in velocity. Let's say I want to launch a satellite into low earth orbit. I need to accelerate that satellite to almost 10 km/s - imagine an object the mass of an SUV traveling across a major metropolitan area in around one second. That requires a <em>lot</em> of energy.</p>
<p>Let's say I build a rocket with the necessary thrust and fuel to lift and accelerate that satellite to orbital velocity. It will probably be rather small compared the rockets we normally see. We turn on the rocket motor and it takes off... only to crash on the launchpad.</p>
<p>We forgot that the rocket itself <em>and its fuel</em> have mass that need to be accelerated. So we build a larger rocket and add more fuel. We launch this one, and it rises a few hundred meters before crashing. Oops, the extra mass we added <em>also</em> needs to be accelerated.</p>
<p>Eventually some really smart engineers applied calculus and figured out that this does not go on forever: as the rocket accelerates, it loses mass as it burns fuel. Using math that is above my head but I understand the concept, we can figure out that not only can we determine how much fuel is required, we can even lower that amount by using <em>stages</em>. The rocket itself has quite a bit of overhead - mass that exists even when the fuel tanks are empty. If we can jettison part of the rocket after it is empty and no longer of use (preferably high up over a large, uninhabited body of water such as the Atlantic Ocean), we can lower the mass and increase the efficiency of the later stages. However, even adding stages adds mass and complexity as they need to be tightly coupled but have mechanisms and circuitry to release at the proper time.</p>
<p>This means that for a given payload, there is a lower bound on how small a rocket can be. Even if your &quot;payload&quot; is &quot;just put the rocket itself in orbit&quot; we can only make it so small. No matter what, it requires energy to accelerate <em>any</em> mass to orbit, and the fuel itself must be accelerated for at least part of the journey.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great replies above on why rockets are big in general. I'll address the economic reasons of why big rockets are often used when a small one could have done it. As a company, maintaining more different products is expensive, especially at low volume. And yes, even though SpaceX launches something like half of the rockets on earth, they're still low volume in terms of manufacturing. It's less expensive to build a few more big rockets than develop an entirely separate product line.</p>
<p>Also, SpaceX doesn't have a lot of different sizes of rocket (they currently have the Falcon 9, medium-tall, and Falcon Heavy, XL), but they have a lot of different ways they can fly them depending on how much performance is required for a given mission. Least performance, they land the first stage, and have enough reserve fuel to fly it back to the launch site. A bit more performance, land it on a ship a few hundred miles off shore. This is more expensive than land, and riskier, but you get more performance because you don't need to spend fuel flying back home. Even more performance, strip off the landing legs, grid fins, etc., and throw the whole thing out after exhausting its fuel. With one rocket, they have multiple performance options, priced appropriately. Then you get into the Falcon Heavy modes...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
