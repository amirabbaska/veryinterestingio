		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allmost all genetic traits like eyecolor or skin color are influenced by many genes. In this specific example, most genes that code for skin color also code for eyecolor. Fair skinned people have brightest eyes way more often, and dark skinned people with bright eyes really stand out because of its rarity.</p>
<p>Bright skin was adaptive to sustain vitamin D production in the skin with less sun. Bright skin contains less melanin, which gives the skin and the eyes it's darker color. Bright eyes don't have an optical advantage, the iris always blocks light, no matter the color.
Maybe after the first bright eyes appeared, there was some sexual selection because they were outstanding, or it made communication easier because the pupil increase due to arousal is much easier to see in bright eyes.</p>
<p>Tldr: bright eyes are a side effect of less melanin in the skin to allow Vitamin D production. Also Sexual selection</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

In Northern European populations where blue eyes are common, the sun is not as bright, so this is less of a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All eyes are brown eyes. The posterior most layer of the iris (posterior pigment epithelium) is brown in all eyes. Lighter color eyes appear the way they do because of a difference in the more anterior layers of the iris. The difference between light and dark eyes is not due to different pigments. The tyndall effect, similar to why the sky is blue, is the primary reason light eyes appear the way they do. Light colored eyes dont actually have a definite color. Since The color the iris is perceived to be is dependent on scattering of light, the ambient light will influence what color the iris appears to be. Some one can appear to have green eyes in certain lighting conditions  but more blue in others.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the effect of color on peacocks. Their feathers are all brown but it is the microscopic structure of their feather that create various light scattering effect producing what we see as vibrantly colored feathers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One hypothesis that I found very interesting was that eye color can be influenced by neuronal development. In other words, eye color can be a function of frontal lobe construction. There are a bunch of second hand blog posts and articles describing that if you're an introvert you can have a particular eye color, etc. here's one scientific article source describing how eye color is influenced by neuronal development (pppulation study examining SNPs):</p>
