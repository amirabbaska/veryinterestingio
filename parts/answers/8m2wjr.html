		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes are one of the parts of your body where blinking is voluntary and involuntary at the same time. You can control how you blink but no matter how hard you try to keep your eyes open, your body will force you to blink. This may be why keeping your eyes open when sleepy is difficult sometimes because your body itself is forcing them closed and your consciously trying to keep them open. Your brain also releases sleep chemicals which makes you feel more lethargic until you succumb to sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you’re moving around your body is sending signals to parts of your brain (the cerebellum) so you don’t fall over. Those signals stimulate key areas in your brain stem (the reticular formation) which trigger other key parts of your forbrain (thalamus) which tells your brain brain (cerebral cortex): “hey jackass, we can’t sleep right now or we’ll fall over and get hurt!”</p>
<p>Sometimes when you stand up too fast or have serious problems going on there’s not enough blood keeping all those parts working and your brain says:”nah we’re going to sleep now” ... otherwise you stay awake and upright.</p>
<p>If you’re not moving there’s no stimulation telling your brain it <em>has</em> to stay awake and all the signals change and your eyes close and you’re out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vision processing takes a considerable amount of mental resources, way more than muscle coordination.   Your muscles do most of the work when walking, your brain just tells them what to do.  Your eyes on the other hand require a lot of mental processing so if you're tired it's much harder to focus your vision than it is to walk.</p>
<p>Tension headaches from eye strain are quite common too, where you have a headache but it feels better if you close your eyes.</p>
<p>Imagine working on a computer all day.  Eventually your eyes get tired, but your muscles are not as you've not used them much. </p>
<p>On the other hand if you go out hiking all day, your legs will tire while your eyes might be fine.</p>
<p>It's a matter of whether your tired is muscle fatigue, or mental fatigue.  Mental fatigue makes it hard to keep your eyes open and is what makes you want to sleep.  Muscle fatigue just makes you want to lie down and rest while watching TV or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
