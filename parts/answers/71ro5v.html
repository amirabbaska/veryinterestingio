		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can be explained using basic principles from the science of behavior analysis. If you want to know more, google avoidance and escape learning. I hold a BS and MS in behavior analysis and have studied it for 7 years.</p>
<p>Assuming the sound your alarm makes is aversive, one of two things will happen.
1) You will wake up when it goes off and shut it off immediately (such is the case for me). You respond to remove the aversive stimulus while it is present, i.e., escape it.
2) You wake up prior to the alarm and turn it off, thereby avoiding the aversive stimulus. Your response would be considered avoidance because you acted prior to the presentation of the aversive stimulus and your response prevented its occurrence.</p>
<p>Now you might be asking yourself, &quot;How does my body know to wake up before the alarm?&quot;</p>
<p>When you set an alarm time you have never been exposed to, your body will not wake up prior to the alarm. What happens is that waking up and turning it off will reinforce that response (a classic example of negative reinforcement). Your body will gradually come under the control of the reinforcement contingency. Sometimes you wake up after the alarm sounds 3 times, sometimes twice, sometimes 4 etc. This is a natural variation in responding. One day you will wake up before the alarm due to that variability. When you turn it off prior to the alarm ringing, you avoid the aversive stimulus, and reinforce waking up before the alarm. Soon enough you'll regularly wake up before it.</p>
<p>Now the reason you can wake up before the alarm on different days, despite different times, is because you have been exposed to each of the various times repeatedly and have come under the control of the overall contingency of reinforcement. You do not need to be consciously aware of a contingency to come under its control. You are completely unaware of the vast majority of contingencies that control your behavior, this one is not any different.</p>
<p>P.S.
People who sleep through their alarm obviously do not find the alarm aversive, and therefore do not act to remove or avoid it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's probably a memory bias in many cases. Waking up just before the alarm is a striking coincidence and therefore much more memorable than waking up well before the alarm. It's natural to then overestimate how often that happens, and conclude that it's more frequent than it would be by chance.</p>
<p>Edit: In response to some comments - I'm not saying the memory bias explains all cases, just that it's something to take into account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ll give this a go because the answers seem to be lacking.  How the brain understands and perceives time is poorly understood but there is evidence for some parts of the big picture. There are regions of the brain associated with time, the striatum and hippocampus. Of these, the striatum monitors the passing of time while  hippocampus is primarily responsible for memory and the transfer from short-term memories into long-term. The question that Op is asking is how the brain can anticipate some event in the future.  The answer is that there are “timekeeping” neurons in the striatum that “tick away”, depolarizing at regular intervals. Other parts of the brain “pay attention” to these neurons and contribute to our perception of time passing. </p>
<p>Together, the memories related to when you have to wake up on a given day are connected to the ones watching the seconds go by. Thus we have a mechanism where your brain “knows” and can anticipate when to wake up. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, follow up to this. I don't (remember) dream(s) often anymore but when I did, I'd often dream of looking at a clock or even my phone and noting the time. A pretty significant amount of times, I'd wake up not long after and the time I'd noted in my dream was almost always accurate. A lot of the were false awakening dreams. Dream you're waking up and checking the time. Then you wake up, check the time, and it's a pretty damn-near match. Any theories for this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some alarm clocks make a very faint <em>click</em> sound shortly before sounding the alarm. You won't normally hear it unless it's very quiet, but it's loud enough to condition you to wake just before the annoying alarm sound.</p>
<p>This won't be the case with every alarm clock, but I noticed it myself some time ago after getting a new alarm clock. Shortly after getting the new clock, I started waking up right before the alarm sounded. Stranger still, it would even happen on the mornings after daylight savings adjustments, so I couldn't think how my internal circadian rhythm knew it was time to wake up. Also, when my alarm was off, I wouldn't wake up right before the normal alarm time.  </p>
<p>Then, one morning when I was already half-awake and just waiting silently for my alarm, I heard it.  A faint <em>click</em> two or three seconds before the alarm sounded, and when I heard it, I felt my body wake up.  It was an ah-ha moment.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It seems like I'm not the only one who has noticed this effect:</p>
