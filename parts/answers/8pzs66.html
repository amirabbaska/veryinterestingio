		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's about the sauce. Sauces cling on to each shape differently. Lighter sauces coat long pastas well. Tube shaped and ridged pastas work well with thicker sauces because they can pick up the sauce better. Buttery sauces are best with filled pastas. There are many great online guides. You should check them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, different shapes of pasta pick up sauce differently. Different sauces are best with certain shapes of pasta. Second, thicker pasta feels and tastes very different than thinner pasta, and the shape affects how evenly and how much the pasta gets cooked. Thick pasta can be cooked to be harder than thin pasta. This then affects the taste, because pasta that's cooked less tastes different than pasta that's cooked more.</p>
<p>Try different shapes of pasta with the same sauce, and you'll notice that you'll prefer some shapes to others.</p>
<p>Also Italian pasta is usually made without eggs because semolina flour contains enough gluten to be sticky enough on its own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
