		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In chemistry there isnt technically a limit, since a polymer chain is a molecule and that could go on until all the atoms in the universe of the elements that make it up are used.</p>
<p>However a single chain would be pretty weak and easily broken, and if it was tightly coiled eventually it would be crushed under its own gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no limit, because carbon atoms can chain to another carbon atom indefinitely, and this is what makes carbon-based lives possible. A chain of some carbon atoms + other atoms make a protein, and the proteins are the building blocks of our body. It's our meat, organs and blood, at subcellular level. The factories that produce proteins in our bodies are proteins themselves, just at different lengths and folded differently into different things. Our body uses proteins to make proteins. </p>
<p>Carbon molecules are very interesting because most forms of energies are stored as carbon molecule chains. Gasoline, diesel, propane and butane are carbon molecules. Basically these are the same thing just with different number of carbon in the molecule chain. Cut a single carbon atom out of a butane molecule, you will get yourself a propane molecule. Or if you add a bunch more carbons to the chain, propane molecule will become an octane molecule. Sugar is a carbon molecule, so are alcohol and other solvents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ball park figure is in the range of 8.256x10^46 carbon atoms. Based of of the largest rocky planetary objects being ten times the mass of earth and composed of a single crystal/polymer chain of carbon. Although the number is likely to be significantly less than this as the core of such an object would contain too much heat for stable chemical bonding to occur. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
