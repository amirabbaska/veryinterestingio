		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your confusion arises from the assumption that the wavelength determines the “size” of the wave only in the direction of propagation. In free space, this is true because fields are constant in the transverse direction. But EM waves behave differently near conductors. When a wave travels through a metal hole, the electric field must go to zero at the edges due to the metal boundary conditions. So there must be some variance in the field in the transverse dimension.  These are no longer fully transverse plane waves but are other solutions to maxwells equations that are valid for waves near metal sources. This site has some decent pictures of these modes <a href="https://www.testandmeasurementtips.com/basics-of-tem-te-and-tm-propagation/" target="_blank">https://www.testandmeasurementtips.com/basics-of-tem-te-and-tm-propagation/</a>. It turns out that the frequency and wavelength also limits how much “curvature” is possible not only in the direction of propagation but also in the transverse direction. So the result is that waves of certain frequency cannot “fit” through small holes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct. But you must remember that the high conductivity of the screen material shorts out the field and makes it go to zero - reflecting it in the process. The microwaves cannot match the zero field condition at both edges of a hole that is much smaller than its wavelength. Fundamental law of wave too: cannot form a spot smaller than the wavelength. Think of water waves, e.g. and try to form a wave let smaller transversal than the wavelength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you familiar with waveguides? Think of each hole as a really short rectangular waveguide with a cutoff frequency that is higher than microwave frequencies. </p>
<p>If any microwaves entered the waveguide, they could only exist as evanescent modes, which quickly decay as it passed through the front of the waveguide, and would decay to practically nothing before reaching the end of the waveguide, despite the waveguide being short by human standards. </p>
<p>The evanescent decay is similar in form to the decay that happens to a wave that is transmitted into a solid conductive material. So these microwaves react to an array of small waveguides the same way as it does to a sheet of metal. </p>
<p>So in a nutshell, microwaves can't pass through the holes because if they did, they would die immediately. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find faraday cages and hole size easier to understand the more I think about it like light. Somebody may correct me about propegation of different frequencies, standing waves, etc, but it IS all in the EM spectrum. </p>
<p>So, light is just different wavelengths, from red at the low, up through, green, blue, then to violet, being the highest. So, different colours of glass actually let different wavelengths of light through.
If you check out this site: <a href="http://ca.rosco.com/en/products/catalog/roscolux" target="_blank">http://ca.rosco.com/en/products/catalog/roscolux</a>
Many of the gels (coloured plastic for colouring lights) show the graph showing what they let through.</p>
<p>A faraday cage is just like this, except since the waves are so long, they interact iwth things differently than the light we know does. The cage acts like a high pass filter (or a gel that only lets by violet light and stuff that's higher). The waves themselves interact with the metal structure and are filtered out. Light itself is higher frequency, to it gets through no problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Technically, some microwave radiation does make it out.  If you could see microwaves, you'd see some leakage around the door, etc.  That's why it's not a good idea to stand too close.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
