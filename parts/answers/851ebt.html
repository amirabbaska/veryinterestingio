<p>Same goes for everything else. For example, we can use geometry to precisely measure distance to an object by observing it from two points and doing the math. Your eyes observe things from two points, <strong>but they don't do the math</strong>. They just know from experience that an object of that size and with this eye focus is about that far, because it has seen it before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately most of the answers here are incomplete. They are correct in that we don't explicitly calculate the advanced trig instantly, but many answers suggest that we learn this ability through simple stimulus-response mappings: e.g., if a ball is thrown as such in this situation, then we just know where to put our hand. Most cognitive psychologists that study motor planning and physical reasoning don't believe this: our predictions are very sensitive to small changes in the scene that would have important physical effects, and we can learn these dynamics quickly, so simple caching of memories cannot capture human behavior.</p>
<p>However, scientists are somewhat split into two camps: those that believe we use a rich mental model of the world to simulate how the ball will travel and move our hand to intercept it, and those that think we can do this planning via more simple (though still flexible heuristics).</p>
<p>The mental model approach is best captured most recently by <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/45/18327.short" target="_blank">Battaglia et al</a> that suggests we have an &quot;intuitive physics engine&quot; that supports our interactions with the world. Under this view, we simulate how the ball might travel (though have some uncertainty about that trajectory) and move our hands to where we think the ball is going to go. Note that this does not suggest we solve Newtonian motion equations: it's much more like using a game physics engine that takes small steps in time but, because it needs approximations, can diverge from Newtonian equations.</p>
<p>The heuristics approaches typically focus on individual tasks -- e.g., showing that a good way to run to get into position to catch a fly ball can be calculated by trying to keep a constant motion trajectory of the ball projected onto the retina <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~mmcbeath/mcbeath.research/pdf/JEP2002%20baseball.pdf" target="_blank">(e.g., Shaffer &amp; McBeath)</a>. This theory suggests that we are either born with or have compiled our observations intelligently into algorithms that can quickly get us the answer, but are more general than simply doing the same thing you did in a similar prior situation.</p>
<p>I personally believe in the intuitive physics engine approach since we encounter a huge variety of physical situations that it could handle, whereas different heuristics would be needed for each different situation. However, this is an ongoing debate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mind uses gaze heuristics. You aren’t really doing a bunch of calculations in your head, it’s more like rules on how to do things. For example, “keep the ball in my field of vision at a constant angle while it approaches me”  so you adjust your body or run towards the ball as necessary etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Got to remember that math is something we made up to make sense of things that happen in the natural physical world. Many millions of years of evolution has fine tuned our motor skills and hand eye communication/coordination, our brain doesn’t go through trig functions to catch objects, <em>we</em> made those mathematics to be able to understand the catching of objects, for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In neurobiological terms, there are massive parallel processes going on in the visual, somatosensory, and motor corticies to represent the information needed for an accurate throw. The frontal lobes and basal ganglia are used to recall and select the learned motor programs, and the cerebellum is used to modify the programs to provide additional accuracy and correct for errors and changes in the system. The ways these circuits perform these calculations is not completely understand and is an active area or research, but the information represented by their activity appears to be well characterized by trajectories along high dimentional manifolds - the brain seems to follow paths to represent the movement.</p>
<p>It's a great question and one the warrants a lot more study!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
