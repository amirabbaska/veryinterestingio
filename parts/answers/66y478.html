		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the vast majority of normal (baryonic) matter is contained within stars, and obviously stars give off light. We can work out the ratio of how much mass a star has compared to how much light it gives off - this is called the mass-to-light ratio. For example, our Sun is a fairly typical star and has a mass-to-light ratio of  5133 kg/W. </p>
<p>This ratio differs depending on the exact size and composition (stellar class) of the star, but the figure above gives a reasonable &quot;average&quot; value for a population of stars. Therefore if you measure the brightness of a galaxy, you can then work out the mass by simply multiplying by the mass-to-light ratio. As to the errors in this calculation, I'll have to defer to someone more knowledgeable.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The relationship between color/magnitude of stars and they're mass is something that's very well known to the point that if you can know the entire lifetime of a star just on it's mass alone.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram" target="_blank">There's a diagram</a> you've probably seen of this color/magnitude vs mass diagram.  The reason for this comes from basic principles of the two forces of gravity trying to collapse the star and which type thermonuclear explosion that wants to break it apart.  Heavy stars need bigger explosions (brighter, bluer colored explosions).</p>
<p>Okay.  So stars are easy.  Well a galaxy is just a collection of stars, so the matter becomes a problem of measuring or estimating the stellar distribution over the space the galaxy occupies, which can be calculated by measuring the brightness and knowing how far away it is.  The techniques for determining the distance vary based on how far a galaxy is.  Then it's just a math problem to integrate all the masses together into the total mass.</p>
<p>tld;dr There is a very clear relationship between the color/magnitude of a star and it's mass.  Add them all up and you get the mass of a galaxy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astronomers use spectroscopy. They measure the redshift (how the wavelength of the light shifts with motion) of the center of the galaxy, then stars on the outskirts of the galaxy. Subtract the two redshifts and you end up with the velocity of the stars on the outskirts. Then using the redshift of the center of the galaxy, you can calculate the distance using Hubbles Law where distance to the galaxy is measured as D = v / H0. </p>
<p>H0 is Hubbles Constant, and v is the recessional velocity calculated via redshift. Once you have the distance to the galaxy you can use the small angle approx. to calculate the size of the galaxy. With the size, you know the radius of the outskirt stars orbits. Once you have the star's orbital velocity and the radius of it's orbit, you can plug it into the orbital velocity law. The mass enclosed by the orbit is given by
m = (v^2 * r) / G.</p>
<p>Where v is the orbital velocity, r is the radius of the orbit and G is the gravitational constant .That gives you m, which is the mass of everything inside the orbit. You'd want to do this many times on different stars on the outskirts of the galaxy to ensure an accurate measurement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always been curious about the same. Even with mass and distance of nearby stars. Until recently we didn't even have the gravitational &quot;wobble&quot; effect from their planetary system to try and judge size/brightness/distance/mass.</p>
<p>Stars vary in brightness, distance, and size which makes it an extremely difficult calculation for mass. Now we are talking about light from galaxies from millions or billions of years ago which helps us judge their current mass and distance? It's nearly inconceivable to me! </p>
<p>Are these judgements actually accurate or a wild guess based on how we feel about the distance and mass of other objects?</p>
<p>(Edited to incorporate distance)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
