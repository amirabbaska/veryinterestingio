<p>TL;DR since the fossil record is incomplete, you have to extrapolate from areas where samples are available before and after extinctions and support that data with modern populations and genetic information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those estimates are mostly based on the analysis of large species databases such as the <a href="http://fossilworks.org/" target="_blank">NCEAS Paleobiology Database</a>. You basically generate humongous tables and start noting where points of first and last appearance of various genera/species occur in time, depending on how deep you want to look. A lot of the work done on the subject comes from DM Raup, JJ Sepkoski, which is certainly as good a place as any to get your info.</p>
<p>see, for instance:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extinction events are not characterized by an estimation of how many individual animals die.  After the Permian extinction event roughly 90 percent of all known species prior to that were driven to extinction.  </p>
<p>An example would be if you had one specemin that is a trylobite and two hundred sponges.  If the one trylobite does not appear in the fossil record after a certain time then 50 percent of species in the data set  went extinct during that event, even though the one trylobite specemin represented less than half a percent of the total number of animals in the data set.  Hope that helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
