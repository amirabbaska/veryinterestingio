		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>While no one owns all of the parts of the internet, each step of the way is owned by someone.<br><br>Part of that is the DNS <del>system</del> - that maps names (www.google.com, reddit.com cogeco.ca etc.) to ip address.  Ip addresses are the things actually computer equipment uses to talk to each other.  <br><br>The DNS <del>system</del> was created by treaty (edit:  a treaty agreeing that everyone in the ITU was going to just use the US system, not that the treaty actually built the system), and while the top of it is a non profit organization it still 'owns' the right to give out top level domains to countries, every country has their own registrar (for .ca, .uk, .us, .fr etc.) and the US owns a few others (.com, .gov. mil), some countries have more than one (e.g. Russia/Soviet Union), and somewhat like wireless spectrum, ownership is implicitly assumed to belong to national governments, and you need the permission of their agencies to own a domain.  They contract out these services to various companies.<br><br>Now for example, lets say I wanted to own CoolDeathFalcon.ca - I'd find the organization responsible for handing out domains on .ca and ask them for it.   That organization needs to handle requests for names, it needs to resolve disputes (what if you own CoolDeathFalcon.com already, but I own a competing business in Canada already called CoolDeathFalcon.ca, and how do you resolve this dispute?).  All of those people who handle that stuff need to be paid.  And then the physical hardware that stores this information needs to be paid for, and people and software that connect to the world all need to be paid for.  Companies that sell these things are allowed to do so by national governments - Verisign which is the big one in the US does so with the approval of the US Department of Commerce.  <br><br>In addition to paying for your national registry there are 13 root name server (2 of which are controlled by verisign, the other 11 each have one operator), these form the backbone of the name -&gt; IP address system.  All of those servers need to be kept reasonably in sync with each other and they all need to keep running.  13 was a technical limitation at one point, but now we also have replication of those servers - your ISP probably runs a clone of one of those 13 for example and when you access the internet you're probably doing so via the clone.  But either way, the web traffic those servers could have to handle is significant, the reliability requirements are extreme, and keeping everyone happy is expensive. <br><br>So that's what you're paying for - people to make sure that when you buy a domain I can't buy the same one, that we agree on where that domain points, and that it will be the same everywhere, and all of the equipment used to make sure that happens.  </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) is a non-profit that was founded in '98 to handle the reserving of names for websites. Before ICANN, it was literally handled by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel" target="_blank">some dude</a>. If you wanted a unique website name you had to contact that dude. That was becoming unsustainable so everyone got together and decided on some rules.<br><br><br><br>When you pay for a domain name, some of that money is going to ICANN for operational costs and some of it goes to the registrar (like GoDaddy).<br><br>The reason some domain names cost more than others is simply because they are more desireable. They work a bit like stocks. So &quot;coolwebsite.com&quot; is going to cost more to register than &quot;coolwebsite92thatpeoplelike.biz&quot; because there are probably more people that want it. Supply and demand.<br><br><br><br>EDIT: Hey guys. I know that Postel was not just &quot;some dude&quot;. But this is ELI5. I was just trying to give some background without going on a tangent or getting complicated. Which is why I linked to his Wikipedia page. Also, ICANN was not created because Postel died. The US government was discussing alternatives back in '97 - well before his death. A bigger reason for the creation of ICANN was probably that time Postel decided to change the root zone server of most of the Internet to his own server without telling anyone (again, ELI5). That freaked a lot of people out.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Where did you get the impression that nobody &quot;owns&quot; the internet? It's certainly not one person or organisation, but each and every part of it is owned by someone. <br><br>For instance, all the physical connections are owned by the corporations that operate them (usually). And on top of those connections sit routers and switches owned, again, by corporations that operate them. And using that equipment and those connections, we speak a protocol called IP which uses numbers (as addresses) that are given out by IANA (of which ICANN is part). We all decided to use that protocol a long time ago and decided to give IANA the authority to distribute the IP addresses. <br><br>And then we decided that remembering IP addresses was a pretty shitty idea so we invented DNS. Which we then also gave a central authority (again IANA) the ownership of so that they could coordinate things and actually run and administer the system. This of course requires money, which is where your fees come in.<br><br>It's technically possible to do this all yourself, but you'd have to invent your own protocol and then set up your own DNS-like system. The latter is not difficult (but getting people to use it is), the former however, is, because no other companies are going to route your traffic unless it uses IP.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Alot of people seem to have part of it right. Basically 3 R's and ICANN:<br><br>Registrant: That's you, he/she who owns the domain name for a specified period (usually 1-10 years). And there is no argument over that, you do OWN that domain. It's just not yours forever, if you don't renew it or delete it, then it's gone and someone else can pick it up. However for the time you have it registered, it is your domain which you own. Enough lawyers and people spend alot of money on online presence, it's real.<br><br>Registrar: Company officially recognized by ICANN (and Registry) to sell domain names. This is your GoDaddy, Hover, Network Solutions, Name.com. You buy a domain from them and they directly connect to the Registry system (below) and register the domain for you. <br><br>Registry: Verisign (com/net) Afilias (info/mobi/pro) Neustar (BIZ). They maintain the technical systems and backend that run a particular Top Level Domain, ie com, org, me, info, name etc. You rarely as a domain owner hear about the Registry, but Registrars have to use their system to register and manage your domains. Without the Registry, your domain wouldn't &quot;exist&quot;. <br><br>ICANN: A non-profit (<em>COUGH</em>NEW GTLDs<em>COUGH</em>) organization who policies which company runs which Registry (above). Usually lots of money and bidding to gain control of one. They spell out the general policy all Registry and Registrars must follow with respect to the domain industry. They decide which .whatevers exist, which right now is a big deal because they opened it up some for people to apply for new ones <a href="http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/" target="_blank">http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/</a> it's why you'll see .guru, .blue, .sex this and coming years. <br><br>When you watch that overpriced super bowl ad and decide to go to godaddy and fork over 10 bucks, you as a Registrant are paying the Registrar.  The Registrar on their end have various fees to pay to ICANN and the Registry, but that doesn't involve you as a domain owner. <br><br>Source: I work for a Registry<br><br><br><br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">
