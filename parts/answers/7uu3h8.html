		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was assuming you meant the colorful iMacs not the later all black machines. Throughout the 90s supply chain management software radically changed what could efficiently be manufactured. This led to a much broader array of colors in manufactured items including computers. Apple’s wild colors was all about being able to efficiently sell a big ticket item in multiple
colors. They weren’t always successful and had to force some colors on retailers. Their foray into aluminum was also driven by tech efficiency, there’s a great video out there about how the various computers pieces are all cut from single aluminum blocks with minimal waste, driven by 3D modeling and manufacturing software.</p>
<p>Apple has lead the way most likely because they get away with charging a premium to cover their experimentation. Even if you’re not a fan of their pricey machines, they’ve had a radical influence on industrial manufacturing that’s interesting in its own right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apple. </p>
<p>People started seeing computers as more than just tools for business. They started becoming integral to daily life and Apple turned them into colorful statements about personal identity. </p>
<p>Beige is a default plastic color called natural in PC-ABS (the plastic most computers are made from). Beige was a non-decision. Apple got people caring about how.comouters looked </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
