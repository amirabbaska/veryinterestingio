		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's quite a good analogy. Our ears do in fact have protective measures. There are 2 muscles in the ear, the tensor tympani and the stapedius muscle. The tensor tympani, as the name suggests, tenses our ear drum (the tympanic membrane). The stapedius recedes or pulls the stapedius (one of the bones in the ear) out of its socket. Both these actions decrease the intensity of sound reaching our inner ear, thus preventing damage to the sensory part of the ear! This is the acoustic reflex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm one of them, and I make my ears &quot;rumble&quot; whenever I'm being subjected to loud noises and it's too rude or too late to cover my ears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd speculate that the ear doesn't have a specialized defense against loud noises (going by /u/BakedBrownPotatos's description of the stapedial and tensor tympani reflexes) because truly &quot;loud&quot; noises are generally rare in nature.<br />
Our eyes have several defense mechanisms against bright lights (pupal contraction, wince/squint reflex, eyebrows) because every single person is more or less constantly exposed to light levels that could damage or destroy our vision if they arrived unfiltered. The sun is a constant in our evolution, and it makes sense that we would evolve defenses against it.<br />
Truly, harmfully <em>loud</em> things are a fairly recent development.  I can't think of anything in nature that would be loud enough to harm us while being common enough to negatively impact reproductive probability.   Thus it isn't surprising that we never developed the ability to &quot;squint&quot; our ears.<br />
Bats are a good example of an animal with extremely sensitive hearing.  In fact, bats actually go deaf for a split second when they emit a sound, so the noise they are making doesn't damage their own hearing.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would think that, as far as the evolution of our features go, there weren't a lot extremely loud sounds in nature (except for disasters maybe). This means that it wouldn't have been as necessary for our ears to be as sensitive as our pupils are to changes in light. We would also want to know when the magnitude of a sound changes from previous moments, and if our ears adjusted the level, we wouldn't have as clear of a picture of the distance of a sound or a threat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
