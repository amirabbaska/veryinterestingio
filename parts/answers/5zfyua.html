		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy costs on an open cold case are not as high as you might imagine. It's very different from simply leaving the door open on your refrigerator. Open cold cases are equipped with air curtains, which are sets of narrow vents that blow cold air from the top of the case into corresponding vents at the bottom of the cases (which draw that air in). This effectively forms a &quot;curtain&quot; that helps prevent the cold air inside the case from mixing with the warmer air outside. </p>
<p>Cases that are heavily shopped and require frequent re-stocking (many times per day), such as produce and meat cases, are less likely to have doors because this reduces the time needed for employees to work the product, which saves money on labor, and it also makes it easier for customers shop, which invites more sales. These items are also much less perishable and able to withstand greater temperature fluctuations than frozen products like ice cream, which you will never find without doors.</p>
<p>Side note: the retailer I work for once experimented with doors on all of our wall coolers, including meat and produce, for a little more than a year, not to save money directly, but to collect some kind of energy-efficiency tax credits. Those same doors came off just as soon as those tax credits expired (or so I was told).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most items in the open refrigerated section are things that need to be cold but not necessarily frozen. Like you said, it's easier to see and grab items when there isn't a door in your way. The items in the freezer section (ones with big glass doors) are things that, you guessed it, need to be frozen so they are needed. </p>
<p>At night when supermarkets are closed, they actually drape plastic or something similar over the refrigerated section to save energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The counter height open top ones are surprisingly efficient. </p>
<p>In the modern stores, the only ones with doors are frozen foods and easily spoiled like milk. </p>
<p>And yes - not having to open a door makes folks much more likely to just buy it. The energy costs just aren't that huge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything everyone said about them being surprisingly efficient is true. They can actually be more efficient then ones with doors. Depending on how often or how long they'll be opened. On a meat case where there's always someone looking through the steaks to find the right one the doors would always be open. Or very heavily shopped sections the doors would always be open. The milk and eggs are often in fidges with doors because there's a whole walking fridge behind the display where the back up is kept, and the restocking is done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
