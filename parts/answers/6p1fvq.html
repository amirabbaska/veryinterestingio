An important one is that when the weather/temp/humidity changes it can dry out the mucus membranes of your nose and eyes as well as the rest of your skin. Dry skin equals micro-cracks in those tisues which can allow microbial invasion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd be curious to hear if this phenomenon also occurs in climates near the equator where the weather remains hot throughout the year. </p>
<p>In my temperate climate, it has always been explained to me that people get more sick in the winter due to spending more times indoors with one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few things at play here, as /u/Impossiblyrandom has suggested.</p>
<p>Illnesses often spread in winter, not really because the cold makes people more susceptible - though cold weather can slow your immune system, but because when the weather gets cold, people gather indoors more often and in greater numbers. So instead of being spread out enjoying the outdoors, they crowd together for warmth and companionship and most socializing occurs in places with lots of surfaces to hold germs.  </p>
<p>Another factor (one I experienced regularly when I started teaching) is that your immune system goes into overdrive during times of stress.  When the stress is lifted, your immune system slows down.  </p>
<p>When I started teaching, I was being continually bombarded by germs (Kids are filthy), but during the school term, I was continually stressed. New teachers end up doing 16+ hour days, working weekends etc - all to get the planning and marking done for a full schedule of classes they've never taught before.  So my body would be full of germs that my immune system was fighting like hell to beat down because I was too busy to be allowed to get sick, but then the minute a vacation hits (spring break, summer vacation, Christmas - all coinciding with seasons) my body would relax, my immune system would relax, and all the germs still in my body would go nuts and I'd spend a good chunk of the break sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flu and colds spike when people move indoors, creating a great place to swap germs. The most obvious-- to anyone with kids, at least-- is when school goes into session and everyone comes into one sealed room to trade whatever they've encountered during vacation. </p>
<p>College students do one better by going out to bars after class and having up-close conversations, with lots of spit spraying in an aerosol all over. But a good cold rainy weekend that sends everyone indoors mid-fall will do the same.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Changing of seasons always brings migratory birds, increased human travels, and viruses that thrive in cold or warm weather.  And no, cold weather doesn't decrease your immune system as long as you're normally healthy. </p>
