		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer that question, you must know that Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a compulsive disorder, in the same family as OCD. A diagnosis of BDD features a prominent obsession with appearance or perceived defects, and related compulsive behaviors such as excessive grooming/mirror-checking and seeking reassurance. Keep in mind, these behaviors occur at a clinical level, meaning it is not the same as simply posting a 'fishing' status on Facebook; it's markedly more frequent and severe behavior.</p>
<p>The differential diagnosis between BDD and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) focuses on the prominence of preoccupation with appearance and the presence of compulsive behaviors. While appearance can be a factor in MDD, an individual with BDD will be markedly more concerned with appearance and will exhibit the aforementioned compulsions. </p>
<p>It should also be noted that MDD is commonly comorbid with BDD, meaning that they are often diagnosed together. BDD often causes individuals to develop depression. In these cases, however, the diagnostic criteria for <em>both</em> disorders are met.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Patients with bdd tend to be concerned with specific aspects of their appearance (normally 1 but sometimes more). These aspects are normally features around the face such as skin, nose, hair, mouth, ears; but can be any aspect of appearance such as wrists, legs, feet etc. </p>
<p>As others have said, excessive preoccupation is a differing factor. Bdd has similarities to OCD where the patient has trouble not thinking about the supposed 'defect' and this can completely consume their day to day thinking. </p>
<p>The actual thoughts are also a differing factor which are seen in other disorders such as anxiety and depression. 'Thinking errors' as they're called in psychology are things like 'all or nothing' thinking (my appearance must be better or I am hideous and unlovable), catastrophising (if I show my appearance people will laugh, mock me etc). </p>
<p>So that leads into behaviours. A patient with bdd engages in behaviour that is meant to (in their minds) help or alleviate the 'problem' which is the supposed defect. Typical behaviours are mirror checking, mirror avoidance, comparing, reassurance seeking, covering the body part, seeking cosmetic surgery, excessive exercise, excessive dieting , touching and feeling the 'defect'. </p>
<p>The behaviours ultimately lead to many patients avoiding social interaction, becoming housebound and even committing suicide. Ultimately for a patient with bdd, being alive becomes an exposure. Overall the illness has a high suicide rate, around 25%.</p>
<p>Which brings me into treatment. CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy) is efficacious in treating bdd. The cognitive aspect essentially has the patient 'thinking about thinking'. Challenging unhelpful thoughts and thinking of things in a different, more helpful and logical way. The behavioural aspect is exposure to the anxiety, without the patient engaging in the behaviour that makes them feel safe in that moment. A 'theory A theory B' component is normally used which can be very helpful. </p>
<p>Muscle dysmorphia is also another subtype of bdd and it is a very real illness, mostly affecting men. </p>
<p>Lastly, bdd is not to be confused with vanity. It may seem like that to some because normally patients with bdd are actually quite good looking. But as I start at the beginning, it's normally specific features that the patient becomes preoccupied with in combination with thinking errors. I.e. because my nose looks like that it means I am hideous, unlovable, defective as a person etc. </p>
<p>Any questions please ask me!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Body dysmorphia can be clinically differentiated from being depressed about ones appearance. In laymans terms body dysmorphia requires the person see their body differently to what it actually is, often with some inconsistancy. </p>
<p>This inconsistancy can be highlighted by a study done on bodybuilders who had BDD. These BBs were shown topless pictures of regular males who didn't work out and asked if they thought they were more muscluar, less muscular or as muscular. A significant amount of BBs said they were as muscular as a regular guy. However when shown pictures of Mr universe-level bodybuilders, who clearly had more muscle than the males from the other pictures, a significant amount of BBs also stated that they were just as muscular or more muscular than these stage-ready professional bodybuilders. </p>
<p>To my knowledge being depressed with the way you look is usually fairly consistent and doesn't contain the nuances that BDD can entail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who suffer BDD describe things about their appearance that are objectively and measurably incorrect.  They might say their skin is covered with acne but a clinician observes little to no blemishes.  They might say they are fat but objectively they have a normal BMI.  They may describe their nose as huge but it falls into average parameters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
