		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT2: A lot of people say it's too complex and includes extraneous information. I agree, and will edit this to be more nicely digested later. <em>Never let your brain drink and describe!</em>
MORE EDIT: I hope everyone who comments understands that this isn't a perfect answer, and no answer is. There are a billion ways to simplify talking about the same exact, specific thing, and not every single person will understand the way it is explained. I encourage all of you who say this is &quot;too complicated, I'm literally five years old and you suck&quot; to use Google... The brain is the most complex organ and computer in the universe we know of, practically. It DESERVES a high level conversation. It REQUIRES high level conversation, because using analogies and metaphors is an EXTREMELY POOR way to convey the information about what is actually happening, to develop a real understanding of this question. It would be depriving you of a beautiful, incredible thing that is our brains to just tell you &quot;drugs work like drugs because drugs are like keys and receptors in your brain are like locks, so they activate and you get high.&quot; That's dumb as shit, and it doesn't even BEGIN to express how fucking awesome our brains are.</p>
<p><em>&quot;LI5 means friendly, simplified and layman-accessible explanations - not responses aimed at literal five-year-olds.&quot;</em> I know most of you are white twenty-somethings with nothing to do at work. Relax, read through more of the comments in this thread if you don't like mine. I'm not going to get mad at you because you don't think what I said was right or explained it easily enough. That's okay! </p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5z29zs/eli5_why_do_various_recreational_drugs_have_such/deuxf50/" target="_blank">&quot;Yo, yo, stump me...&quot;  &quot;Sex? Talk about sex? Like dude, I haven't ever done that topic before...&quot;
&quot;Yo man, stump me, talk about <strong>WEED!!</strong>&quot;...</a></p>
<p>There are multiple neurotransmitter systems which have high or low concentrations in certain brain circuits - parts of the brain that apparently have a specific function. The actions of drugs are directly related to their affinity for particular receptors (strong, moderate, weak) and their binding type (agonist/activator vs antagonist/deactivator, in basic terms... The following may not be entirely accurate, and shortcuts in language will be used to more easily express the idea. Still a good overview though!) </p>
<p>Hallucinogens, for example, mostly operate on 5HT, or serotonin receptors.(DA=dopamine, NE=norepinephrine, 5HT=serotonin, GABA=gamma aminobutyric acid, etc... DAT= dopamine transporter of the synapse, NET = NE transporter of the synapse, etc...)  There are many serotonin receptors in the gut, which is one reason why hallucinogenic substances can cause transient nausea, for a specific example. The 5HT subtype, 5HT-1A is most closely related the the &quot;psychedelic&quot; experience often described, and has a high density in the hippocampus (related to memory,) the amygdala (emotional response and emotional memory,) and the prefrontal cortex (decision making, thought processes, etc.) You can see, then, why a &quot;trip&quot; acts like a &quot;trip&quot; on a basic level. The actions of drugs is MUCH LESS about &quot;more dopamine here, less dopamine there,&quot; than it is, &quot;this drug tends to cause activation of this particular circuit which leads to this more complex behaviour with x many iterations and variations, and suppresses circuits here which reduces xyz behaviour.&quot; </p>
<p>Confused yet? Perfect!</p>
<p>All drugs have different, but interrelated effects. Some don't touch dopamine or serotonin at all, and some drugs actually reduce the actions of those, yet can remain recreational. The most common and most used recreational drugs almost invariably hit a dopamine target, but not all of them. A good rule of thumb is if it hits dopamine as an agonist directly or indirectly, it's abusable. Similarly, sex, food, and all the other lovely behaviours we enjoy? Probably have a basis in indirect dopamine agonism. </p>
<p>A &quot;downer,&quot; like benzodiazepines, doesnt actually DIRECTLY affect dopamine or serotonin. It does, indirectly, with what you might call &quot;downstream effects,&quot; but primarily, benzos operate on a specific site, which isn't the normal site that GABA binds to. GABARs, or GABA receptors, have MANY separate sites for drugs or other molecules to bind to. The benzodiazepine site is one of them. When bound, it tends to sensitize the GABAR to GABA, the neurotransmitter, which leads to a depressive action in MANY areas or circuits of the brain. GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain. Benzos are highly specific. This inhibitory action prevents or reduces neuron activity and &quot;firing&quot; of electrical signals. This is why memory doesn't quite work, you dont have all gears engaged, etc... Not all your neurons are firing! </p>
<p>Alcohol, or ethanol, its a very peculiar molecule. It permeates nearly all membranes, and equally diffuse throughout cells (including neurons) in the body. It leads indirectly to dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and other limbic areas, which are associated with the feeling of reward and learning. It also operates on GABARs, and 5HTr's, and glycine receptors, and NMDA and AMPA receptors (sometimes associated with learning, tolerance to drugs, dissociation, anesthesia...) and quite literally almost anything we have knowledge of in neuroscience. It's also destructive and damaging to cells in any quantity to some degree.</p>
<p>Compare the following, which are all similar to dopamine, and bind to DARs in some form or another, as well as NE. receptors. The molecular and atomic nuances of drugs are extremely important in determining their effects: all receptors are slightly different, and subtypes are variant as well. This leads to your question - different drugs have different effects, because atomically, they are different, and bind differently to the variety of sites they can possibly attach to. </p>

<p>I'm sure you know the difference between methamphetamine and propylhexedrine, for example. The difference? A couple of carbons and aromaticity in the main phenyl ring. One is an extremely addictive drug which will destroy any congesting you may have from a cold, and the other is a piece of shit masquerading like it does anything in cough syrups because lawmakers are scared. The proof is in the molecular structures and our hardware, which has many many subtypes and main types of receptors! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Here's a real ELI5:</strong> </p>
<p>First thats not true. Some recreational drugs act on cannabinoids (uh, weed), enkephalin s (heroin, oxy, vicodin), or glutamate (PCP, ketamine, cough syrup) as well. second, you have to look at the receptors in the brain. That's where the magic is. </p>
<p>Receptors are the buttons which neurotransmitters push. For serotonin alone, we have something like 20 different buttons that all do different things. Some buttons make you hallucinate, some make you love everything on the face of the earth, and some will make you vomit and shit your pants. This is all from the same neurotransmitter. Different drugs that all act on serotonin press these buttons differently. LSD and molly are both serotonin drugs, but they feel way different because they push different buttons, and on different circuits. </p>
<p>But you're right, all recreational drug circuits lead back to dopamine. It just so happens that our pleasure and habit circuit seem to be one and the same, so take something pleasurable enough and it will turn into a habit. That's recreation. Take it too many times and it will become addiction. </p>
<p>TLDR Every drug pushes different buttons. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your brain as a book, and neurotransmitters as letters or words. Although there are only a few letters, they can be put together in different ways to spell different words, which make sentences, etc. Sometimes altering a letter produces little change in meaning, sometimes it produces a massive change. Where this change occurs matters too; if it happens in the table of contents, it can reference chapters that aren't really there, or it could change how the story is interpreted completely. The neurotransmitters can be thought of as the letters, neural circuits as the words/sentences, and the different lobes and areas of the brain as the different chapters. An increase of dopamine in the orbitofrontal cortex and basal ganglia will have 2 different effects, just like the word change in the example.</p>
<p>As easy as it is, neurotransmitter functions can't be reduced to facilitating pleasure any more than you could say that the letter &quot;e&quot; is only used to spell nouns. It's also noteworthy that reuptake inhibition is only a part of most drugs pharmacology, so there may be more upstream effects that have not been studied as thoroughly. Some drugs also mimic neurotransmitters, which further complicates things, and some even have no apparent effect on neurotransmitters at all! Despite this, the book metaphor is useful in describing the brain in regards to how neurotransmitters effect it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to give a simple answer. It's not JUST dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine is implicated in reward and serotonin in mood. </p>
<p>Basically, there's a whole host of neurotransmitters in the brain. There is Glutamate (stimulation) and GABA (inhibition) - your stop and go signals. Then there's Noradrenaline/Norepinephrine which is involved in general alertness. There's also Acetylcholine, which is involved in movement and some autonomic functions (this one contributes to some drug side effects like dry mouth). There are other neurotransmitters such as Adenosine but that's less relevant.</p>
<p>ALSO, there isn't just re-uptake and release! There's also breakdown inhibitors and among those, there are different ways to prevent breakdown of neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Finally, each drug binds to different neurotransmitter receptors with different strengths (avidity), different proportions (affinity), for different lengths of time, are absorbed at different rates, cross the blood brain barrier at different rates, are broken down at different rates and cleared at different rates. Also, different parts of the brain have different densities of certain neurotransmitter receptors. Among each receptor class, there are variants. For example, there at least 5 main dopamine receptors. Different drugs bind differently to each of these subtypes of dopamine etc.
The combination of all of these factors (and probably more) all affect the drug experience. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the question concisely: that's not true, they don't all do the same thing. </p>
<p>The media loves to talk about dopamine release when talking about drug mechanisms of action but for most that release is only a secondary effect, not the primary source of the 'high'. </p>
<p>Strong stimulants like amphetamine and cocaine are the drugs that work primarily through increasing dopamine levels. But others do not. Alcohol, benzodiazepines and other sedatives work mainly through activating GABA receptors, cannabis through activating cannabinoid receptors, opioids through opioid receptors, dissociative through antagonising (reverse-activating of sorts) NMDA receptors, psychedelics through activating serotonin receptors. MDMA works through increasing serotonin levels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
