		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The photon gets &quot;absorbed.&quot;  In reality, the energy that the photon was is transferred into an electron (thus making the photon cease to exist).  The electron would thusly move to a higher energy state (and move faster).</p>
<p>The higher energy state would manifest as heat in most things.  In the eye, it manifests via a receptor that reacts to the higher energy state by sending a signal to the brain.  (Though in practice, it would take far more than just a single photon to stimulate this process).</p>
<p>In a solar panel, the higher electron energy state is rectified into useful electrical energy.</p>
<p>It's sort of like throwing a marble at a bowling ball, except the marble has no mass (no actual stuff, just the energy of it moving).  The marble would give all of its small amount of energy to the bowling ball making the bowling ball move a bit, but the marble would be gone after striking it.  Note that the &quot;bowling ball&quot; in this metaphor is an electron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To take it in a more biochemistry direction:</p>
<p>Your rods and cones have specific proteins called opsins; rhodopsin for rods and S, M and L opsins in cones (corresponding to the short, medium and long wavelengths of light). </p>
<p>These opsins bind a <em>cis</em>-retinal molecule which, when exposed to light converts to the <em>trans</em> isomer. This starts the signalling cascade through the outer segment of the cell and eventually propagating through the rest of the retinal cells. The <em>trans</em> isomer is recycled to <em>cis</em> by the retinal pigment epithelium which cups the outer segment of the photoreceptor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
