		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Repost of my answer from when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2h3tf7/do_gas_giants_have_a_surface/" target="_blank">this question</a> was asked before:</p>
<p>For the interior of Jupiter, let's imagine taking a descent from cloud-tops down to the core based on our best guesses of what lies below.</p>
<p>You start falling through the high, white ammonia clouds starting at 0.5 atmospheres, where the Sun is still visible. It's very cold here, -150 C (-240 F). Your rate of descent is roughly 2.5x that of Earth, since gravity is much stronger on Jupiter.</p>
<p>You emerge out the bottom of the cloud deck somewhere near 1 atmosphere. It's still somewhat bright, with sunlight filtering through the ammonia clouds much like an overcast day on Earth. Below, you see the second cloud-deck made of roiling brown ammonium hydrosulphide, starting about 2 atmospheres.</p>
<p>As you fall through the bottom of this second cloud deck, it's now quite dark, but warming up as the pressure increases. Beneath you are white water clouds forming towering thunderstorms, with the darkness punctuated by bright flashes of lightning starting somewhere around 5 atmospheres. As you pass through this third and final cloud-deck it's now finally warmed up to room temperature, if only the pressure weren't starting to crush you.</p>
<p>Emerging out the bottom, the pressure is now intense, and it's starting to get quite warm, and there's nothing but the dark abyss of ever-denser hydrogen gas beneath you. You fall through this abyss for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>You eventually start to notice that the atmosphere has become thick enough that you can swim through it. It's not quite liquid, not quite gas, but a &quot;supercritical fluid&quot; that shares properties of each. Your body would naturally stop falling and settle out somewhere at this level, where your density and the atmosphere's density are equal. However, you've brought your &quot;heavy boots&quot; and continue your descent.</p>
<p>After a very, very long time of falling through ever greater pressure and heat, there's no longer complete darkness. The atmosphere is now warm enough that it begins to glow - red-hot at first, then yellow-hot, and finally white-hot.</p>
<p>You're now 30% of the way down, and have just hit the metallic region at 2 million atmospheres of pressure. Still glowing white-hot, hydrogen has become so dense as to become a liquid metal. It roils and convects, generating strong magnetic fields in the process.</p>
<p>Most materials passing through this deep, deep ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen would instantly dissolve, but thankfully you've brought your unobtainium spacesuit...which is good, because it's now 10,000 C (18,000 F). Falling ever deeper through this hot glowing sea of liquid metal, you reflect that a mai tai would really hit the spot right about now.</p>
<p>After a very, very, very long time falling through this liquid metal ocean, you're now 80% of the way down...when suddenly your boots hit a solid &quot;surface&quot;, insomuch as you can call it a surface. Beneath you is a core weighing in at 25 Earth-masses, made of rock and exotic ices that can only exist under the crushing pressure of 25 million atmospheres.</p>
<p>You check your cell phone to tell you friends about your voyage...but sadly, it melted in the metallic ocean - and besides, they only have 3G down here.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: You would stop falling about 10% of the way down, where your density matches the density of the surrounding hydrogen &quot;supercritical fluid&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There actually was a man made probe that has &quot;fallen&quot; into Jupiter as a part of the Galileo spacecraft, look here - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Probe" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Probe</a></p>
<p>From the main Jupiter article on wikipedia:
A 340-kilogram titanium atmospheric probe was released from the spacecraft in July 1995, entering Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7.[28] It parachuted through 150 km (93 mi) of the atmosphere at speed of about 2,575 km/h (1600 mph)[28] and collected data for 57.6 minutes before it was crushed by the pressure (about 23 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153 °C).[104] It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003, at a speed of over 50 km/s, to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and possibly contaminating Europa—a moon which has been hypothesized to have the possibility of harboring life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the part we have trouble imagining is the supercritical fluid thing. We know what a gas is like (air or mist), we know what a body of liquid is like (water)...but the idea of a mist so thick, so dense, under such pressure that it becomes liquidy (at least in the sense that a human body might &quot;float&quot; at the point where densities match) is foreign to our imaginations, especially since the transition is gradual not abrupt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
