		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cornea and lens both lack blood vessels, since they need to be clear for good vision.</p>
<p>The cornea (front window of your eye) is only about 0.5 mm thick, enabling it to get the oxygen it needs via diffusion (the front half gets oxygen from the outside air, and dissolved O2 in the tear film. The back half gets its O2 from dissolved O2 in the aqueous humor).</p>
<p>The lens is not nearly as metabolically active as the cornea, so its oxygen needs are much lower. The oxygen it needs, it gets via diffusion from the aqueous humor (eye fluid).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As nuclear Cadillacs said.... I would add that the vitreous jelly that constitutes the largest part of the eye (from a volume standpoint) embryologically was a vascular structure. That allowed the eye to develop in utero when it's metabolic demands were higher and all parts of the eye needed more blood flow. But in order to have a clear medium for light to travel through, those vessels regress, leaving a virtually clear cavity through which light can travel. There are disease states associated with failure of this process (eg persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous).      </p>
<p>One other interesting fact is that despite having some avascular parts, there are other parts of the eye with incredibly high blood flow. The choroid which supports the outer third of the retina has the highest blood flow density of any tissue in the body as well as the highest oxygen tension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
