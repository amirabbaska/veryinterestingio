		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: As others have pointed out, parents choosing to withhold common allergens has been due to infant feeding consensus guidelines and advice provided by trusted medical professionals, such as their family GP. <a href="https://theconversation.com/introduce-eggs-and-peanuts-early-in-infants-diets-to-reduce-the-risk-of-allergies-65564" target="_blank">The Conversation makes a great point in their article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is, there have been so many changes to guidelines over the last few decades that parents are no longer sure what to believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's speculation it has to do with parents choosing to withhold common allergens until too late. As far as I'm aware, there's no published work investigating what percentage of parents are making these choices, and their temporal trends, however there has been a meta analysis looking at the effect of timing of allergenic food introduction^1 which is supported by a randomised trial investigating peanut introduction in the first year of life vs complete avoidance.^2</p>

<p>&quot;The clinical history can be difficult to interpret, measurement of peanut-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) is of limited usefulness due to its poor specificity, and the gold standard (double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge) is time-consuming and labour-intensive, limiting its use in daily practice. Under-diagnosing peanut allergy is considered dangerous, because of serious reactions like anaphylaxis. As a result, there is a high probability of over-diagnosis of peanut allergy in the general population, leading to unnecessary peanut-free diets and parental anxiety.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In Israel the popular peanut-flavored snack, Bamba, is consumed from very young ages. Because of this, scientists have seen extremely low rates of peanut allergies throughout the Israeli population. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>.4% to 1.2% is a pretty rough estimate of the percentage of the population allergic to any given food. Peanuts, eggs, dairy, soy all fall close to this range.</p>
<p>So really, peanut allergies aren't that prevalent. I would alternatively suggest that you may be hearing more about peanut allergies due to how extreme and dangerous the reactions are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's also evidence showing that babies born in c-sections are a lot more likely to develop allergic reactions.

<p>This study doesn't necessarily focus on peanut allergies, but finds that babies who aren't exposed to the vaginal flora during birth are much more likely to become allergic. Super interesting, and more research is still being done on our microbiome and its impact on our overall health. However, I believe c-sections are another important piece of the puzzle that I didn't see mentioned here. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
