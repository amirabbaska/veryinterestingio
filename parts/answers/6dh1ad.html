		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to appreciate the history of the bicycle. We didn't leap from nothing to the penny-farthing. The first historically verified bicycle was a German invention that was called a &quot;running machine&quot;. It had two wheels and was steerable, and you sat in a saddle and walked. The bicycle allowed you to glide and save effort. It looked much like a modern bicycle with two wheels of equivalent size, a frame, handle bars, and a seat between the two wheels.</p>
<p>The penny-farthing eventually evolved because people realized that driving the wheel itself might be more advantageous. At this point, if you can glide on a running machine, it doesn't take much more to drive pedals, you can already maintain balance. They used a gigantic wheel because machining and materials were not sophisticated enough to build chains and gearing, the large wheel allowed you to build appreciable speed. The style of bicycle of the penny-farthing is called a &quot;Standard&quot; bicycle.</p>
<p>There was a strong desire to build a modern bicycle, called then a &quot;safety bicycle&quot;, because the standard was quite dangerous in a few scenarios - it had the inclination to pitch you forward and drive your face into the ground. The only thing that held it back was the gearing and chain mechanism, because small wheels under direct drive can't go fast.</p>
<p>It was all an evolution, from one working concept to the next, and only a little daring. A lot of early innovation was like this, that the concept is sound, you just have to figure out what you're missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking of it in the wrong order. </p>
<p>When an object is invented, it has a purpose. You already know what it is for. </p>
<p>If you want to throw a knife far away, and you work with strings and sticks every day, it's easy to imagine a bow. You will invent the bow. You'll probably be very bad at it at the start but you know what it is for and if you want to kill some animals without taking any risk, you will practice.</p>
<p>For object that are more complexe, like a bicycle, or musical instrument, the practice existed even before the object, it's just before there was a simpler object and we made this new one because it would be better at accomplishing its purpose. It might be harder to use but you will go faster, or you will make better music.  </p>
<p>String -&gt; harp -&gt; guitar</p>
<p>Wheel -&gt; Draisine -&gt; Bicycle </p>
<p>The man that invented the bicycle already knew what he was going do to with it. Before even having one. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is certainly a great deal of evolution from easy to practice required as /u/mredding points out.</p>
<p>However there is also a reason that your crazy uncle exists from an evolutionary perspective.  You know the one I'm talking about.  The uncle who goes &quot;This should work!&quot; as he does something again and again even as his wife shouts at him to stop messing around with that stupid X.</p>
<p>99 times out of 100 he is wrong and the thing won't work, doesn't work.  But once in a while that insane dedication pays off big and we get something cool out of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Musical instruments are maybe the hardest to understand.  Many of them require thousands of hours to become proficient, much more to achieve mastery. But virtually every musical instrument evolved from something simpler, and that simpler thing from something even simpler still. An oboe is a difficult instrument to play well, but go far enough back and you understand that it evolved (in <em>many</em> steps) from simple flute-like instruments that were easy to learn.</p>
<p>Ten thousand years ago young people observed older people playing an instrument similar to a modern recorder, and were inspired that their own poor playing could someday equal the talent of the older player. Over time the instrument became more complex, perhaps more notes or a more complete scale. At every improvement more experienced players existed to inspire less skilled players. Woodwinds then evolved to flutes, to single reed instruments, and then to double-reed instruments like the oboe. But every step was slow and gradual, and at every step there were older skilled players to inspire - and teach - less skilled players.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans understand that things take practice. So long as the device works mechanically, and can physically be operated by a human, we know that we can learn to use it, even if it isn't perfect right away. If you understand how a wheel works, and understand how a crank works, and understand that you are physically capable of balancing, then you can deduce that a bicycle will work, even if you've never seen one used before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
