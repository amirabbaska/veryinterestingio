<p>Apparently yellow has been repeatedly been used to refer to Asia as a whole since the 400s BCE (Greco-Persian Wars, when &quot;Persia&quot; encompassed a bunch of different peoples). It could be similar to how society shifts it's perception of color (i.e. red hair is more orange to us today, or that the ocean was &quot;wine colored&quot; in Homer's Odyssey). The world yellow is also etymologically close to gold, and I would say that you could accurately describe some Eastern Mediterranean skin tones as &quot;golden.&quot;  </p>
<p>Edit: New source of info and we're back to square one. &quot;Applied to Asiatics since 1787, though the first recorded reference is to Turkish words for inhabitants of India.&quot;</p>

When shopping for foundation we'd pick one with a yellow undertone or else we'd end up looking orange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I myself am asian, and I used to think the same thing, however, if you actually compare skin tones side by side, the difference can be seen. Most of the time, I can spot a slight yellow tint, but from a distance, it's hard to tell. This doesn't apply to all asians, but it definitely exists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert but I'm half-Japanese half-Chinese; and most of the east asian people I know look distinctively yellow-brown tinged, especially in the light and when compared to the pink-white hue I see in &quot;white&quot; skin.  I'm wondering if it looks that way simply because my mind is incorporating the stereotype, or if the melanin actually reflects some shade of yellow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
