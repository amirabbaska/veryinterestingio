		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;official&quot; rule is that the main course of the river is the one that travels the longest path from source to sea. But if you look at actual rivers in, say the United States, you'll find that that's a custom honored in the breach. The branches of a river often got named before their upper reaches are mapped, and sometimes the question of which of them is the main channel got leaned on for political or financial reasons.</p>
<p>Consider the Potomac river; at a place called Harper's Ferry (famous for John Brown's insurrection), it splits in two. Which side was the main river, and which was the tributary? After all, the two branches were about the same size when they met. Well, the surveyor who was drawing the maps was being paid by the Virginia colony, and their charter said that all the land south of the Potomac belonged to their colony. The surveyor, knowing which side his bread was buttered on, just <em>decided</em> that the north branch of the river was the main one, and the south branch (now called the Shenandoah) was the tributary. That meant that all the land in between them belonged to Virginia, instead of Maryland. By the time the rivers were more fully mapped, and it was clear that the Shenandoah actually flowed along a much longer course than the (upper) Potomac, the question was moot, and the Virginia colony was firmly in control of the land in question. (Well, compared to Maryland, anyway. The Indians were still putting up a fight.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways to decide which is the main stem and which is the tributary - compare the flow rate at confluence, compare the length from source at confluence, or compare the angle of the river to the resulting compound river (so the one with the least deviation would be the main stem).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to cultural/historic reasons, these aren't definitive rules. The Missouri e.g., is longer than the Mississippi from its source. The Ohio has a larger flow rate than the Mississippi at their confluence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When Lewis and Clark were navigating their way west, their technique when arriving at a confluence was typically to send a team up each branch and a team would setup camp near the confluence.</p>
<p>The separate teams would proceed upriver a number of miles, taking measurements of average streambed width, depth and estimations of discharge along the way. Then the teams would reconvene at the downstream confluence and a decision would be made as to which direction to proceed.</p>
<p>Lewis and Clark followed the convention of contuining the named waterway along the wider path (remember they're walking/traveling/rowing upstream). They would then give the thinner branch a new name.</p>
<p>For example, if you're traveling upstream along the Missouri river, near Sioux City, between present day Nebraska/Iowa/SD and came to the confluence in that city- you'd notice the river continuing westward is much wider than the river continuing northward. Proceeding westward (up the larger channel) the name Missouri River held and the smaller was named 'Big Sioux River.'</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought it had to do with stream order, with the larger of the two being the main. </p>
<p>Basically, a headwater is first order, and then add up the orders whenever two waterways join. </p>
<p>This this the <a href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/how-stream-order-works.htm" target="_blank">Shreve method described here,</a> though there are other ways of doing it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
