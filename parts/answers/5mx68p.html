		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly by radiation. There are some particles but the density is so low that conduction is extremely, extremely ineffective.</p>
<p>The reason the Earth is warm is because the Sun is shining on it. The Sun is particularly hot but it is no special case, anything with a temperature above absolute 0 radiates, and that radiation can travel freely through a vacuum. When that radiation is absorbed by something else then it heats up and that is how heat is transferred through space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We talk very loosely of heat. Heat is not a substance, or thing, or even really a distinct form of energy in its own right. “Heat” as a scientific concept belongs to the early empirical days of thermodynamics when atoms and radiation were not at all well understood. </p>
<p>If we put a hot thing and a cold thing near one another in a vacuum then the hot one will cool and the cold one will warm. The amount of heat, the internal energy, in each object will change but heat as such is not transmitted between them—energy is. Overwhelmingly this is in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The result of this is that after a time the hot thing will have less heat in it, and the cold thing will have more, but the “heat” never was in the intervening space. That space contains an electromagnetic field that holds some energy, and that energy goes in and out of the things, but it isn't the right kind of energy to be considered “heat”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever stood in front of a camp fire?</p>
<p>Did you notice how if you looked at it, your face got really really hot, but as soon as you turned away, it got cooler? The air itself isn't that hot, you only feel that heat when the light of the fire shines on a part of your body.</p>
<p>That's radiant heat, essentially just light that heats your skin (and everything else it touches). You would still feel it even through a vacuum. That's the only way to transfer heat in space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>heat can be transferred in three ways:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_heat_transfer" target="_blank">convection</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction" target="_blank">conduction</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation" target="_blank">radiation</a>.  like others are saying, the sun warms the earth through radiation.  you probably asked this question because you were conflating convection with radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three methods of heat transfer - conduction, convention, and radiation. The last one doesn't require any sort of contact. Elections move to lower energy states, shoot out photons.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, your oven works primarily by radiation too. The air isn't really moving. If you could look at a 3D thermal map, there is a blanket of colder air around whatever you put in there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
