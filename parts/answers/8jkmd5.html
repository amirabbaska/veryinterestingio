		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That disclaimer isn't protecting them from a celebrity suing them.  </p>
<p>What is protecting them from a celebrity suing them is the fact that the 1st Amendment has been held to allow you to use someone's name and likeness in certain limited ways when that person is a &quot;subject of public interest.&quot;  The short of it is that celebrities are &quot;subjects of public interest&quot; and the manner in which they are being depicted in those tv shows is one of the limited ways in which the 1st Amendment permits someone else to use their likeness.</p>
<p>That phrase is just some generic legalese that has been stuck in the credits of every movie and tv show going back decades.  It's designed to stop some random, non-celebrity from claiming that a non-celebrity character in the movie/show is so similar to them that the movie/show is using the random person's likeness.  </p>
<p>In all likelihood that blurb of legalese doesn't actually do anything - if some random person could actually prove that their likeness was being used the phrase wouldn't protect the movie/show producers.  And if the random person can't prove that their likeness was used, well, they can't win a case against the movie/show producers.  </p>
<p>But it does protect the movie/show owners from the one in a billion case where a judge says &quot;well you didn't put that phrase in your credits so I'll let this go to trial.&quot;  While the random person still won't win in that situation, going to trial costs money while putting that phrase in the credits does not, and so that phrase ends up in every movie/show's credits. </p>
<p>The reason its showed at the start of the intro for South Park, rather than in the credits, is as a joke.</p>
<hr />
<p>edit: This is more in depth so feel free to skip it if you're just looking for a basic explanation on why South Park doesn't get sued, but I'll just add a bit in because I wasn't very clear on <em>why</em> that phrase keeps getting put in the credits of every movie and tv show despite not doing anything and I'm getting two general lines of comments. </p>
<p>The first line of comments is &quot;I'm a lawyer and its because it protects against defamation!&quot;  I too, am a lawyer, though if you're making this comment I doubt you are.  You cannot say &quot;I'm not defaming X but by the way X is a child molester&quot; and think that does not constitute defamation (which was one of the examples a &quot;lawyer&quot; used).  But perhaps the best response is the fact that the phrase is usually put in the credits where no one sees it anyways.  If no one sees it, it doesn't affect how they view the defaming material. </p>
<p>The second line of comments is &quot;but they put it in for other countries where they don't have the 1st Amendment!&quot; </p>
<p>The best response to this is just to be more clear why the phrase is put in the credits.  As /u/ByeByeLiver and several others have stated there was a historical reason for putting it in the credits.  </p>
<p>But modernly its put there solely because of inertia, that is to say, there is no one alive today that remembers a time when it wasn't in the credits.  It also costs nothing to put it in the credits.  But there is an extremely remote possibility that removing it from the credits might result in a situation that costs money - nobody knows how that situation could actually come about, but nobody can say <em>with absolute certainty</em> that it won't come about if that phrase is removed.  So it gets put in the credits because the default position is that its in the credits, its free, and free is cheaper than a remote possibility of &quot;something bad happening.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, its not being added because it contains some magical protection against non-US laws.  Its largely being added in the US and just exported along with the rest of the movie/show.  In countries where its being added domestically, the sole purpose for its addition is because people in that country are just assuming that it does <em>something</em> in the US or other English speaking countries and adding it, and again doing so is free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The disclaimer does not give them full protection from libel laws. It might offer them some protection in certain cases. However it is the overall perception that the viewer is left with that is important and not just a single disclaimer. It show however be noted that people who have chosen to become famous have less protection from libel laws then people who do not. For example Trump should expect people to make jokes about him being a fat dumb sick upper class snob with a small penis when he started his own reality show staring himself and then later joining politics. However if a writer met someone he did not like and then publicly portrayed him in a similar manner then the law would be much stricter. The disclaimer may have a grater impact on the ruling in those cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all goes back to Mad Magazine running a satirical strip they called &quot;Stupidman,&quot; a guy in leotards and a cape with an &quot;S&quot; on his chest that did really stupid things shortly after the first issue of &quot;Superman&quot; was published.</p>
<p>D.C. Comics immediately sued for copyright infringement on their Superman character and lost at the Supreme Court. The Court ruled that no reasonable person would confuse Mad's Supidman with D.C.'s Superman and satire has been the first amendment protected Free Speech ever since.</p>
<p>No one will confuse a Southpark send-up of any celebrity with the real person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
