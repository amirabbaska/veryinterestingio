		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Wyoming we have granite mountains with no springs or streams, a thousand feet above the dry prairie floor. They are almost solid rock with very little dirt, large rounded massive structures. When it rains, small depressions in the rock fill up with water and I often find what looks like tiny shrimp swimming around in the water. They can't be full of water for more than a few weeks at a time. Independence Rock, a tourist spot, is an example where you can find small shrimp in puddles on top, the higher mountains around it have them too.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'll also see a small basin in the prairie floor fill up with water and there will be tiny fish fry swimming around in them, after only having rained a few weeks ago at the most. They look like little guppy babies or something, very tiny.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like the top answer would explain either of these. Anyone familiar with Wyoming or similar environments know how these happen?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds definitely play a roll. We found a foot long trout laying in our back lawn. The nearest lake is a mile away so a hawk probably dropped it and never came back. Now, just have a small lake where my lawn is and have the trout have lots of fish eggs with it and you have yourself an isolated but fully fishable new lake.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work with cranberry producers who make small man made lakes as reservoirs because they need to flood their fields for harvest. These lakes are usually spring fed and far from any other river or lake. The first year small fish like minnows appear. After that a variety of carp, usually sunfish, and finally predatory fish like speckled trout. It's amazing how as soon as space is available, life fills it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bit of a side note but, in many cases these isolated fish may be much less related than they appear. Convergent evolution is where two species who are genetically unrelated evolve to have similar features to deal with the same problem. As all fish are under much of the same external pressures they often find the same solution for the problems they share. Meaning, though they are morphologically similar they may not be genetically similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
