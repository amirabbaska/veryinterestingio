		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This phenomenon is called the <em>&quot;Pain Gate Theory&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>When you injure yourself, pain signals travel from the site of injury to your brain. </p>
<p>When you do something else to that part of the body, for example rubbing it with your hand, this also sends signals to your brain. </p>
<p>However, because both signals are coming from the same part of the body, only one signal can &quot;enter&quot; your brain at a time. And this can be thought of as a gate. The <strong>gate only allows one signal at a time</strong>. And it just so happens that other stimuli such as pressure, vibrations, touch, etc. have priority over the incoming pain signal.</p>
<p>You feel less pain because you are interpreting other signals form the injured body part, instead of the pain</p>
<p>Hope that helps.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nurse here. Remember when you were a child and sometimes fell to the ground and hurt yourself, while playing tag or rollerskating in the street. You would start crying because of the pain and your mom or dad picked you up and started comforting you by stroking your hair, blowing on the wound, saying &quot;there, there nothing to worry about&quot;. You immediately felt better and the pain from the wound faded a bit, and you stopped crying as you moments later would be back on the street playing and having fun as if nothing happened. What happened in your body was the pain stimuli being send from the wound to the brain got some competition from the sensory stimuli your parents did by comforting you. This is called gate control theory, and meaning your brain can only receive so much stimuli (touch, hearing etc.) before it closes the gate for say pain stimuli and the feeling of pain subsides. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nerves that carry the pain signal are the same nerves that carry the touch and pressure signals. If you add more signals, not as much of the pain signal gets through. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerves basically compete for the brains attention.  It is called lateral inhibition.  It is as if a teacher asks a classroom a question and only calls on students with their hands up.  If a student gets their neighbors to not raise their hands, they are more likely to be called on.</p>
<p>Similarly, when a neuron fires it can release inhibitory signaling molecules to its neighbors getting them to put their hands down.  </p>
<p>This is useful because it sharpens the image (literally in the case of neurons used for vision) but cutting down the amount of noise.  You can think of how hard it is to hear someone talk in a noisy restaurant with all those competing signals/sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
