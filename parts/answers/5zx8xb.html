<p><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations.html" target="_blank">What you are talking about is Permutation</a>.</p>
<p>The random chance of the songs in the correct order.</p>
<p>It's factorial of the number of songs on the album.</p>
<p>11 song album = 11!= 11x10x9x8.......= 1 in 39916800</p>
<p>12 songs = 1 in 479001600</p>
<p>Edit:  This is only if assuming that it doesn't play the same song twice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course it could - provided it has a really random shuffle, i.e. if the album is shuffled the new sequence is taken from the set of all permutations with equal probability.  This also gives you the probability: If the album has 12 tracks, then it has 12! = 12 <em> 11 </em> 10 <em> 9 </em> 8 <em> 7 </em> 6 <em> 5 </em> 4 <em> 3 </em> 2 = 479,001,600 different permutations, and the probability to pick any one is  roughly 2x10^-9 .</p>
<p>I don't know enough about the shuffle algorithms used, but when doing a quick search on google I get a feeling that the algorithm is more sophisticated, and may bias towards songs with high ratings. In that case the math changes.</p>
<p>Of course you could just create a playlist with three songs, and shuffle that a couple of times, and note down the order of play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Rio Karma (an iPod competitor) actually had two settings: Random and Shuffle.</p>
<p>Random was truly random, where you could have songs 1,2,3 play in order, or 5,6,7, etc.</p>
<p>Shuffle meant that the programming logically made sure no two songs played in the correct order.</p>
<p>The terms are used interchangeably now, but the Karma treated them differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, Apple's <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/181517/why-itunes-shuffling-order-isnt-really-random/" target="_blank">random/shuffle</a> algorithm is not really random. Because Apple's users complained how the same song can be played twice in a row or in short interval, Apple actually went and changed the algorithm so that no repeats can happen.</p>
<p>In that case, the probability would be:<br />
(1/n) • (1/(n-1)) • (1/(n-2)) • ... • 1 = 1/n!<br />
Where n is the number of songs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
