		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The critical point is the end of the coexistence curve. There is clearly one for liquids and gases, but it is not so clear in the case of liquids and solids.</p>
<p>If there were a critical point for solids and liquids, one would expect to have a region in phase space (for example, in temperature plotted against pressure) where the supercritical matter can change between solid and liquid without ever encountering a phase transition. </p>
<p>Can a liquid continuously transform into a solid? We're not sure, it seems unlikely, and we haven't observed it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would have to with the crystal structure of a solid vs the liquid's lack of structure.</p>
<p>The critical point on a phase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(thermodynamics)#/media/File:Phase-diag2.svg" target="_blank">diagram</a> is the point when a substance can no longer be distinguished between gas and liquid phases.</p>
<p>Once the crystalline structure of a solid is broken, it can be distinguished between a liquid and gas.</p>
<p>Or at least that's what I believe I know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
