		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide" target="_blank">waveguide</a>. One of the most common and low-cost implementations is simply a Pringles can. </p>
<p>Also newer wireless protocols, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ac" target="_blank">802.11ac</a> in specific, use something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamforming" target="_blank">beamforming</a>. Beamforming emphasizes the best channels between (multi input multi output) MIMO transmitter and receiver. In more detail, since MIMO uses multiple antenna, the physical path seen between the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna will differ for each antenna pair. Since these routers are transmitting signals in the gigahertz, even a small change in position can cause a large change in what the received signal looks like. As a result, many of the channels will between the transmitter and receiver will be good, many will be bad. Beamforming is method of providing more power to the antennas which provide a good channel. </p>
<p>In any case increasing the SNR will always increase the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_capacity" target="_blank">capacity</a>. Although the capacity of channels with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersymbol_interference" target="_blank">intersymbol interference</a> is unknown, we approximate it (for stationary objects) with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem" target="_blank">Shannon-Hartley theorem</a>; the capacity is then B log(1+SNR), where B is bandwidth. Of interest, the Shannon Hartley theorem provides a lower bound on the capacity of any continuous additive and <strong>memoryless</strong> channel. Since a ISI channel is not memoryless, the shannon-hartley does not simply directly apply. Only through use of clever coding techniques to remove the ISI does the approximation make sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cheapest option like mentioned before is a pringles can, but if you're even lazier you can use use cardboard covered in foil. I folded the sides in to make it more directional when I needed to travel long distances with wifi. The receiving antenna also had a strip of foil behind it to help can't and resend the single. It boosted strength an amazing amount. Also, the router started picking up access points that were two miles away.</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that single strength behind the tinfoil wall was greatly diminished even at short distances.</p>
<p>Second edit: use a program like inSSIDer to check the strength in different parts of the house and behind the now directional router. Rise and adjust as needed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. </p>
<p>The concept you are looking for is gain, measured in decibles.</p>
<p><a href="Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_gain" target="_blank">Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_gain</a></p>
<p>In essence, a simple antenna (think a wire sticking straight up) transmits and receives in a circle. This is a simplification of how the real world works, but an OK one. </p>
<p>By changing the shape of the antenna, you can in essence focus it, meaning it receives or transmits less well in some directions and better in other directions. </p>
<p>Antenna design is a) Insane and b) powered through the consumption of human souls. It also works amazingly. Don't let the math scare you away, just go online and look for directional wifi, or if you want learn more about antennas in general go to someplace like dxengineering.com or hamradiooutlet.com to start looking at antennas. </p>
<p>Finally, find and go to your local ham radio club. They are filled with people who love radio in general, and have learned a lot about antennas, laws, and doing things you didn't think possible. </p>
<p>See <a href="http://hackaday.com/2016/07/02/ham-radio-wifi" target="_blank">http://hackaday.com/2016/07/02/ham-radio-wifi</a> for example of  directional antenna hacked into a low power wifi device. </p>
<p>Best stories I've heard about are hams using 1500 watt transmitters and directional antennas to set up data links (not wifi, different frequency and hardware but same concept) over very long ranges. </p>
<p>Edit: found another better example of antenna gain, transmit power, and laws:</p>
<p><a href="http://hak5.org/episodes/hak5-1515" target="_blank">http://hak5.org/episodes/hak5-1515</a></p>
<p>Enjoy! You can end up doing crazy things: build an effective 60 watt wifi transmitter, aim it at a skyscraper or mountain, and reflect the beam into a place you cant see into (a valley for example). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can use a directional antenna which changes the base distribution from your router, or you can position the router in a different location so it creates stronger signal in certain locations.</p>
<p>Your router makes standing waves of signal in your house, not unlike a bobbing buoy in a pool.  The signal is analogous to waves.  Walls analogous to submerged walls (depth based on absorption spectrum of the wall, a completely reflecting wall would be above the surface in the pool example).</p>
<p>So if you have walls that block more wifi and there are lots of turnbacks, signal will be weaker.  More transparent or less walls and stronger signal.</p>
<p>Distance universally reduces strength, simply because the signal cross section is diluted.  Think of an expanding sphere from your router (a perfectly non-directional antenna, which doesn't exist) where the power of the router covers that entire area.  More radius (distance) means more surface area for the same output, and thus less strength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A friend and I setup an old satellite dish with a USB wifi receiver. Used an extension cable and double side tape to put the receiver at the end of the arm then pointed the data lite dish at the router. Worked great. </p>
<p>The router just happened to be 1or 2 houses over and had an unlocked access. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
