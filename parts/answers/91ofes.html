		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>At its most basic, kissing is a mating behavior, encoded in our genes. We share the vast majority of those genes with the mammalian species, but only humans (and occasionally our close primate relatives like chimps and bonobos) kiss.</p>
<p>But the reason for kissing is still mostly a mystery, even to scientists who have spent decades studying the behavior. It’s not possible to say which is the overriding factor: that people kiss because of a psychological attraction, or because of a subconscious urge to mate with the chosen kiss-ee. Most likely, it’s a combination of the two. “You can’t have psychology without a biological brain,” says Rafael Wlodarski, who has devoted much of his career to philematology—the science of kissing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was taken from <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/ask-smithsonian-why-do-we-kiss-180958059/" target="_blank">this article</a>. The article goes into greater detail, but does not give a clear definitive answer. </p>
<p>Go forth, young philematologist. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientific American did a piece on this and one of the findings was that ~96% of people lean their heads to the right when kissing. There was no correlation between this trend and which hand is their dominant hand, but rather between this trend and how the subjects’ mothers held them when they were being breast fed as infants. So maybe kissing reminds of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly this was/is not a universal behavior amongst humans. When Europeans initially invaded the Americas, records indicate Native Americans found the European custom of kissing strange and kind of gross (share your saliva with someone else?). Therefore, I disagree with any strictly evolutionary explanations, as it is clearly a cultural phenomenon, albeit an ancient one.</p>
<p>From a physiological perspective, your lips have far more real-estate in your brain in terms of feeling sensations than almost anywhere else (excepting genitalia and fingertips). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
