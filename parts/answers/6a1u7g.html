		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A crush is on someone you have not had a relationship with (generally) and this means that you have to fill in any gaps in your knowledge of how the relationship would be.  This leads to a fantasy of the ideal relationship with the person rather than a realistic one.  This makes it hard to move beyond the crush because it will always seem to be a perfect relationship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am probably going to get my comment removed because it is just a link, not an explanation, but I thought this article did a good job of explaining and rather than paraphrase and plagiarize, I thought I would post it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedebrief.co.uk/news/real-life/ask-an-adult-why-do-i-get-crushes-what-happens-in-my-brain-20150748582" target="_blank">http://www.thedebrief.co.uk/news/real-life/ask-an-adult-why-do-i-get-crushes-what-happens-in-my-brain-20150748582</a></p>
<p>However, something not noted in the article is how intense they are in teen years. I think this is because of more chemicals in your brain called hormones, which intensify reactions, and your not being accustomed to those feelings. Think about the first time you eat a really yummy dish at a restaurant, and then the next time you have it you are like, &quot;Meh, I remember it being better.&quot; You know hat to expect now so it is not as intense. I think first crushes are sort of like that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
