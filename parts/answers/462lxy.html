<p>It's the difference between the mass (weight) and surface area. To put it crudely, if it fell off a high building an insect would feel nothing, a cat would bruise and bounce, a person would crack and a horse would splash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a very interesting  physical principle behind this.It's called the the square cube law. When size of something doubles, the surface area quadruples (2 squared) and the mass octuples/ is multiplied by eight (2 cubed). </p>
<p>The reason is because surface area is 2 dimensional and volume, upon which mass depends, is three dimensional. The area of a square is l x w. Double the size of the square, and you get 2l x 2w. Separate out the 2s and you get 2x2xlxw, or 2 squared times the surface area you had before you doubled it's size. Now for volume, you have l x w x h, so double that and you get 2lx2wx2h, 2x2x2xlxwxh or 2 cubed times the previous volume. Thus the law. It's called the square cube law rather than the four eight law or something because this principle holds for any multiplier. Triple the size, the surface area becomes 9 times larger (3 squared), and the mass becomes 27 times larger (3 cubed)!</p>
<p>Now, strength of materials is proportional to the cross section, so let's look at a leg bone as an example. Cut a leg bone in the middle and you'll see how thick it is, the cross section. This cross section is proportional to the surface area: double the size of the leg, the cross sectional area quadruples. But the mass that leg must support is eight times heavier. </p>
<p>So say you have a leg that can carry 20lbs of weight. But the creature it's attached to only puts 10lbs of weight on it. Supposing it has four such legs, the creature can therefore carry 40 extra pounds, or 4x its body weight. The weight carrying ability of the leg is once again proportional to the cross section  and thus the surface area. Double it's size, the leg can now carry 80 lbs because it quadrupled. But the mass it must carry is now 80lbs! Still just fine because there are four legs, the creature can now carry 240lbs extra. Seems like an improvement, right? But it's not, really, when you compare that to the body weight. The creature can now only carry  3x it's body weight instead of the previous 4x, and that keeps diminishing the larger the creature gets.</p>
<p>Now, i used weight carrying ability because it's more intuitive, but the same principle applies to any other force you apply to the creature from any direction. A flick technically counts as an impulse, I believe, which makes the math a little messier, but it's the same principle at work. A smaller creature can resist larger accelerations/forces/impulses compared to its body weight because it has proportionally less mass compared to its structural and muscular strength.</p>
<p>Edit: I screwed up the example a bit. If the creature puts 10lbs of its bodyweight on each leg, it would weigh 40 pounds total, and could carry it's bodyweight extra. Double the size, and it would barely be able to carry it's own body weight and could carry no extra.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly to do with mass. The less mass an object has, the easier it is to accelerate (so more energy goes to actual movement, and less to the object deforming.)
Insects have very little mass, so they don't experience much resistance to acceleration (the flick.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, squishing against a hard surface results in most of the energy being used to actually deform the insect, as it doesn't have anywhere to accelerate to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Now if you were standing against a building and that car hit you at 20-30, different results.  More resistance and no give against the force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
