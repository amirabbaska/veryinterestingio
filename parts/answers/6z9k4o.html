		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>COPPA states that companies aren't allowed to track the <em>personal information</em> of people under 13 without their parent's consent. Here's the definition of personal information <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6501" target="_blank">from that law</a></p>
<pre><code>(8) Personal information. The term “personal information” means individually identifiable information about an individual collected online, including—
  (A) a first and last name;
  (B) a home or other physical address including street name and name of a city or town;
  (C) an e-mail address;
  (D) a telephone number;
  (E) a Social Security number;
  (F) any other identifier that the Commission determines permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual; or
  (G) information concerning the child or the parents of that child that the website collects online from the child and combines with an identifier described in this paragraph.</code></pre>
<p>Opening an account on a website generally requires collecting at least one of those pieces of information (usually an email address). Facebook's ad tracking for users without an account doesn't collect any of that information, and they have no way of tying the information they do collect back to an individual's real life identity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say Timmy is wandering around the mall. Timmy visits the google store. The google store has a shower at the exit that paints everyone's arm a different color based on what they do in the store and what the google store knows about them. The google store can't paint Timmy's name on his arm, but they are allowed to color men differently then women. There's actually 1000 different colors based on how old you are, gender, and interests. Timmy is welcome to clean his arm, but most people don't because the coloring is not very noticeable. </p>
<p>Now Timmy walks into the amazon store. Because Timmy went first to the google store, amazon knows Timmy's age, gender, and interests simply by seeing the color of his arm. Amazon knows Timmy is between 12 and male and lives in a Chicago suburb based solely on the color of his arm! Timmy browses in the amazon store for a shaving kit and some football jerseys for his local football team. The amazon store also paints peoples feet when they leave the store. Amazon has 1,000,000 different colors depending on what a person's interests are or what their actions are. Just like google, amazon can't paint the person's name (even though they know the name) but can paint enough information that is even more useful. Amazon can even claim that they don't know that Timmy was 12 when asked, because no one knows for sure how much they know about google's coloring scheme.</p>
<p>Now Timmy walks around the mall for a while, and gets a different body part painted after exiting each store. Each store isn't allowed to paint Timmy's name or super specific information, but each store probably knows Timmy's name and can definitely paint a pretty good picture of Timmy based on his activity in the amazon store or the google store or any other store like the yahoo store or the credit card store or the facebook score. Each store can plausibly claim that they didn't know Timmy's age or name when he walked in or when they painted him (even though they do).</p>
<p>In real life, there's paint stores too who help all the stores in the mall paint colors that help them and make sure that each company that uses the whole painting thing benefits by working together. And help provide all the stores in the mall with scanners that help identify all the members who walk into the store and information about them so they can serve Timmy better.</p>
<p>There's also a way for Timmy to clean himself before he enters into each store, so that no one really knows what he has been up to. However, because the paint doesn't really tell anyone anything that compromises Timmy's identity, its probably in Timmy's best interest to not stay clean so that all the stores in the mall can serve Timmy better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't Facebook have in its terms of use that you must be 13 or older? I imagine it's for this very reason. Plus when you sign up for apps or websites, you generally agree to the use of cookies and all kinds of other data tracking. All kinds of good stuff in the fine print. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
