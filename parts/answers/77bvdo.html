		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you drown, you're drastically decreasing the available oxygen in your body/lungs as it all gets spent as you suffocate. When you collapse from heart problems, you tend to have available oxygen still in your lungs, as well as in your blood, so the priority of CPR is to circulate the blood until emergency response gets there. Sometimes pausing and taking a breath burdens the effectiveness of the CPR, but it could be necessary in someone who drowns (or else you're circulating spent blood). So if there is oxygenated blood in the body already then breathing can do more harm by pausing CPR compressions</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on your level of training and the country/standards you are following. I'm a Medic first aid +CPR instructor and the most recent update of our standard (g2015) still recommends the use of rescue breaths for both cases. Compression only CPR is viewed as an alternative to standard CPR when a would be rescuer becomes apprehensive about doing the breaths. This can be especially effective in a witnessed arrest because it's likely the oxygen saturation of the blood is still high enough that circulation alone will benefit the patient for a period of time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short version: Current American Heart Association CPR teaching is NOT different for pulseless victims of drowning.</p>
<p>People who drown generally aspirate water, and experience respiratory arrest which leads to cardiac arrest (death.) AHA guidelines for an adult with no pulse and &quot;death rattle&quot; (agonal) breathing or no breathing is the same every time - check for pulse and breathing simultaneously for no more than 10 seconds. Delegate someone else to call 911 and get an AED. Start compressions. Perform 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths. Continue until the AED arrives. Turn on the AED. Follow the instructions. Continue CPR. Follow the AED prompts until the patient responds or help arrives. </p>
<p>In drowning, there is an obstruction (inhaled water) that isn't allowing gas to exchange in the lung tissue - this is why it is very important to get advanced life support as soon as possible. These patients need advanced airway management, ACLS (advanced cardiac life support), and to be kept warm. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same for with children; the root cause of the arrest was it was first 'respiratory arrest' (typically) rather than a problem with the heart (cardiac arrest). The issue began in the lungs and a lack of oxygen getting to the tissues, muscles, organs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here. Rescue breaths in drownings are recommended to essentially try to clear the lungs of fluid for better gas exchange. Chest compressions alone will provide sufficient ventilation in a patient with clear lungs. Hard and fast. 100 compressions a minute 1 1/2” to 2”  in adults. If I walk into a call and see quality CPR and no one getting maced I’ll be happy! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
