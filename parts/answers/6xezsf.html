		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are four r-stem kinship terms in proto-Indo-European (pronounce h₂ like the sound you make in the back of your throat when you blow on your glasses to fog them up):</p>
<ul>
<li>*ph₂tḗr</li>
<li>*méh₂tēr</li>
<li>*bʰréh₂tēr</li>
<li>*dʰugh₂tḗr</li>
</ul>
<p><em>-tḗr does seem to be an agentive suffix elsewhere in the PIE corpus (e.g. </em>h₂eh₁s- (burn) + -tḗr (-er) &gt; <em>h₂stḗr (burner) &gt; &quot;star&quot;), but it's hard to say what (if any) role it plays in the kinship vocabulary, because we don't find e.g. </em>ph₂-, <em>méh₂-, </em>bʰréh₂-, and *dʰugh₂- as separate morphemes, either free or in combination with other suffixes.</p>
<p>&quot;Sister&quot;, a fifth term that seems to fit the paradigm in English, has a different etymology: <em>swé (self) + </em>h₁ésh₂r̥ (blood) &gt; *swésōr (sister). It was probably brought into line with the four terms above through analogical leveling in proto-Germanic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
