		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The contacts on the battery and your device can develop a layer of corrosion as they're exposed to oxygen. This layer does not conduct well. By replacing it you're scraping the contacts clean allowing better conductivity. When the batteries get low, this can make the difference between a usable amount of current and not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One little nitpick for the pretty good explanations above. Unless you are using a car battery, the cells you are using don't have acid in them, they have the opposite, a base. Hens the name &quot;alkaline&quot; battery for the disposable versions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are cases where removing the battery and replacing it will restart the software processes running on the device.  Here is a famous example of this - <a href="https://autarkaw.org/2008/06/02/round-off-errors-and-the-patriot-missile/" target="_blank">Patriot Missiles are more accurate after a reboot</a>.  This has to do with an accumulating error of 9.5E-8 seconds every tenth of a second in the clock used to estimate target trajectory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A less common possibility: the firmware on the device crashed and pulling the battery resets it.</p>
<p>Even high code-quality firmware should be expected to crash eventually, whether it's caused by a software bug or a cosmic ray flipping a bit in memory. Well implemented devices will implement a hardware watchdog to reset the device before you ever notice it crashed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More often than not, spinning the battery will accomplish the same thing.  The connection the battery has to the terminal can oxidize, which increases the resistance.  Moving the battery around scrapes this oxidation off.  That reduced resistance allows for a lower voltage to run the device because less is being lost across the connection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
