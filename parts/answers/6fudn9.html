		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Often it is the case that water is acting as a solvent, so as to prevent the glue from solidfying into a self-stuck mass. The amount of air inside the container is insufficient in the short term to evaporate that water. </p>
<p>Once you've applied the glue to some surface, it can more readily interact with the air and lose its water content.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glue needs a reaction to solidify. Superglue reacts with water, PVC glue melts the PVC it's in contact with, and other glues generally have a solvent (like water in Elmer's glue) evaporate leaving behind the solid glue.</p>
<p>So the short answer is that the container keeps whatever reaction is supposed to happen from happening. If you left the cap open for example, water (in the form of humidity) could get into a superglue bottle and react with the liquid glue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because the container is (supposedly) sealed, so the solvent (ie, water) in the glue cannot evaporate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
