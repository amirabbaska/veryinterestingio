		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Welcome to this thread. You may know me as a Flaired User over at /r/askhistorians in the History of Mathematics. I'm going to write a short history of Pi in different cultures in Ancient Mathematics. I will go into less detail than some of the Mathematicians posts here, who will explain why certain things work, while I'll just mention them briefly (I also don't have room to mention the vast developments done by the Greeks, but everyone will answer those).</p>
<p><strong>Mesopotamia and Egypt</strong></p>
<p>Throughout most of early history, people generally used 3 as an approximation for the ratio of the circle's circumference to its diameter. An example of this can be seen, in, of all places, The First Book of Kings in the Bible. Written between the 7th Century and 3rd Century BC (<em>The Oxford Annotated Bible</em> says evidence points to around 620BC, but there is some evidence it was constantly edited up until the Persian era). The quote from Kings 7:23 is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high. A line of thirty cubits would encircle it completely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I don't want to get into past Theological issues with what the Bible says, and if it matters, but I would like to briefly mention one person, Rabbi Nehemiah, who lived around 150 AD, who wrote a text on geometry, the Mishnat ha-Middot, in which he argued that it was only calculated to the inner brim, and if the width of the brim itself is taken into account, it becomes much closer to the actual value.</p>
<p>In most mathematics the Babylonians also just use π= 3, because, as shown on the Babylonian tablets YBC 7302 and Haddad 104, the area of a circle would be calculated by them using 1/12 the square of its circumference (you notice most Babylonian calculations on Circles are solved through calculations on its circumference, this is especially prominent on Haddad 104.). However we don't want to dismiss Mesopotamian calculations of π just yet. A Babylonian example found at 1936 on a Clay Tablet at Susa (located in Modern Iran.) which approximated π to around 3+1/8.</p>
<p>In Egypt we come across similar writings. In problem 50 of the Rhind Papyrus (probably the best examples we have of Egyptian Mathematics) dating from around 1650 BC, it reads “Example of a round field of diameter 9. What is the area? Take away 1/9 of the diameter; the remainder is 8. Multiply 8 times 8; it makes 64. Therefore, the area is 64.” This is described by the formula A = (d − d/9)^2 which, by comparing leads to a value of π as 256/81= 3.16049...</p>
<p>It does appear many of the early values of it were calculated through empirical measurements, instead of any true calculation to find it, as neither give us any more detail on why they believed it would work.</p>
<p><strong>China</strong></p>
<p>In China a book was written, named <em>The Nine Chapters on Mathematical Art</em>, between the 10th and 2nd centuries BC by generations of Scholars. In it we get many formula, such as those for areas of rectangles, triangles, and the volume of parallelepipeds and pyramids. We also get some formula for the area of a circle and volume of a Sphere.</p>
<p>In this early Chinese Mathematics, just as in Babylon, the diameters are given as being 1/3 of the circumference, so π is taken to be 3. The scribe who wrote this then gives 4 different ways in which the area can be calculated:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The rule is: Half of the circumference and half of the diameter are multiplied together to give
the area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another rule is: The circumference and the diameter are multiplied together, then the result is
divided by 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another rule is: The diameter is multiplied by itself. Multiply the result by 3 and then divide
by 4.</p>
</li>
<li>Another rule is: The circumference is multiplied by itself. Then divide the result by 12.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 4th result of course being the same as the Babylonian method, however both the Babylonians and the Chinese do not explain why these rules work.</p>
<p>Chinese Mathematician Liu Hui, in the 3rd Century AD, noticed however that this value for π must be incorrect. He noticed it was incorrect because he realised that thought the area of a circle of radius 1 would be 3, he could also find a regular dodecagon inside the circle with area 3, so the area of a circle must be larger. He proceeded to approximate this area by constructing inscribed polygons with more and more sides. He managed to approximate π to be 3.141024, however two centuries later, using the same method Zu Chongzhi carried out further calculations and got the approximation as 3.1415926.</p>
<p>Liu Hui also showed that even if you take π as 3, the volume of the Sphere given would give an incorrect result.</p>
<p><strong>India</strong></p>
<p>The approximation of π to be sqrt(10) was very often used in India</p>
<p>Many important Geometric Ideas were expressed in the Sulbasutras which were appendices to the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of  Hinduism. They are also the only knowledge of Mathematics we have from the Vedic Period. As these aren't necessarily Mathematical pieces, they assert truths but do not give any reason why, though later versions give some examples. The four major Sulbasutras, which are mathematically the most significant, are those composed by Baudhayana, Manava, Apastamba and Katyayana, though we know very little about these people. The texts are dated from around 800 BCE to 200 CE, with the oldest being a sutra attributed to Baudhayana around 800 BCE to 600 BCE. </p>
<p>This work contains many Mathematical results, such as the Pythagorean Theorem (though there is an idea that this came to India through Mesopotamian work) as well as some geometric properties of various shapes.</p>
<p>Later on in the Sulbasutras however we get these two results involving circles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it is desired to transform a square into a circle, a cord of length half the diagonal of the square is
stretched from the center to the east, a part of it lying outside the eastern side of the square. With
one-third of the part lying outside added to the remainder of the half diagonal, the requisite circle
is drawn</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To transform a circle into a square, the diameter is divided into eight parts; one such part, after
being divided into twenty-nine parts, is reduced by twenty-eight of them and further by the sixth
of the part left less the eighth of the sixth part. [The remainder is then the side of the required
square.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As this is easier to show with pictures, I'll take some from the book A History of Mathematics by Victor J. Katz:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IjS35vi.png" target="_blank">For the first statement</a></p>
<p>In this construction, <strong>MN</strong> is the radius <strong>r</strong> of the circle you want. If you take the side of the original square to be <strong>s</strong>, you get <strong>r=((2+sqrt2)/6)s</strong> this implies a value of π as being 3.088311755.</p>
<p>In this second statement the writer wants us to take the side of the square to be equal <a href="http://i.imgur.com/bsksXEj.png" target="_blank">to</a> of the diameter of the circle. This is the equivalent of taking π to be 3.088326491</p>
<p>Later on in India, the Mathematician Aryabhata (476–550 AD) worked on the approximation for π. He writes </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Add four to 100, multiply by eight, and then add 62,000. By this rule the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000 can be approached.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is ((4 + 100) × 8 + 62000)/20000 = 62832/20000 = 3.1416. And after Aryabhata was translated into Arabic (c. 820 CE) this approximation was mentioned in Al-Khwarizmi's book on algebra.</p>
<p><strong>Islam</strong></p>
<p>Finally we get to the Islamic mathematicians, and I will end here because Al-Khwarizmi's (780-850AD) book on algebra, he sums up many of the different ways ancient cultures have calculated π</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any circle, the product of its diameter, multiplied by three and one-seventh, will be equal to the
circumference. This is the rule generally followed in practical life, though it is not quite exact. The
geometricians have two other methods. One of them is, that you multiply the diameter by itself,
then by ten, and hereafter take the root of the product; the root will be the circumference. The
other method is used by the astronomers among them. It is this, that you multiply the diameter
by sixty-two thousand eight hundred thirty-two and then divide the product by twenty thousand.
The quotient is the circumference. Both methods come very nearly to the same effect. . . . The
area of any circle will be found by multiplying half of the circumference by half of the diameter,
since, in every polygon of equal sides and angles, . . . the area is found by multiplying half of
the perimeter by half of the diameter of the middle circle that may be drawn through it. If you
multiply the diameter of any circle by itself, and subtract from the product one-seventh and half
of one-seventh of the same, then the remainder is equal to the area of the circle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first of the approximations for π given here is the Archimedean one, 3 +1/7 . The approximation of π by
sqrt(10) attributed to “geometricians,” was used in India as well as early on in Greece.
(As an interesting fact, however, it is less exact than the “not quite exact” value of 3 + 1/7). The earliest
known occurrence of the third approximation, 3.1416, was also in India, in the work of
Aryabhata as previously stated. This is probably attributed to astronomers because of its use in the Indian astronomical works that were translated into Arabic.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good morning, /r/AskScience! I'm here to talk a bit about an example of pi, or some similar mathematical concept, in the archaeological record. Jooseman has the Old World cover, so I'm focusing in on one spot in the New World.</p>
<p>The site in question is the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Newark_Works_Squier_and_Davis_Plate_XXV.jpg" target="_blank">Newark Earthworks</a> in Ohio, which were constructed around 250 CE. As you can see on the survey image, the complex includes several circular features. The two largest are known as the Observatory Circle (upper left) and the Great Circle (lower center). The diameter of the Observatory Circle is approximately 1050 feet (1054 to be more precise), appears to be a common unit of measure at several other Ohio Hopewell sites. <a href="http://www.earthworksconservancy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/earthworks-collage.jpg" target="_blank">This image</a> shows the regularity between five prominent Ohio Hopewell sites, though it does have a typo (saying 1500 instead of 1050).</p>
<p>What makes the Newark Earthworks interesting in the history of pi is the relationship between the sizes of the Observatory Circle, the Great Circle, and the Square (more properly known as the Wright Earthwork). The areas of the Observatory Circle and the Square are the same. Likewise, the Square's perimeter is the same as the Great Circle's circumference. There is a very slight error in the Great Circle's construction that allows us to know that it was constructed in two large arcs. </p>
<p>The implications here are that the Ohio Hopewell were able to do the geometric calculations to produce squares from circles, circles from squares, and determine the areas and circumference / perimeters of both. We use pi to do these calculations today, but we're not sure whether the Ohio Hopewell used pi, tau, or perhaps some other unknown method to construct this complex.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
