		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: They didn't feel like it.</p>
<p>Conversations with a 5 year old:</p>
<p>5YO: How did they stall the nomination for so long?</p>
<p>Me: they didn't feel like it</p>
<p>5YO: so if you don't feel like doing your job, you can just not do it?</p>
<p>Me: yeah, but then you can get fired</p>
<p>5YO: will they get fired?</p>
<p>Me: No, politicians don't get fired. All they have to do is convince enough people that all the bad things happened because of politicians in the opposing party and get re-elected </p>
<p>5YO: and people don't see through that?</p>
<p>Me: Nope</p>
<p>5YO: But don't they have a moral obligation to try to improve this country and help the people that elected them? </p>
<p>Me: Yep</p>
<p>5YO: so they just don't care?</p>
<p>Me: Nope</p>
<p>5YO: ....Fuck</p>
<p>Me: Yeah...don't tell mom we had this conversation. Here is some money for video games....and please get off Reddit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>ELI5: How the US Congress was able to stall Obama's nomination for late Justice Scalia's place on the Supreme court?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The constitution requires the Senate to give confirm the President's nominee. However, it doesn't set any other requirements- it doesn't say it has to be done by a certain time, or at all. There's also no repurcussions, other than if voters decide to change how they vote over it.</p>
<p>The Senate was Republican last year, meaning they could refuse to hold a hearing. It's up for debate as philosophy whether stalling counts as  &quot;and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate&quot;, since stalling kind of isn't a yes/no advice. Practically speaking, it doesn't matter, since there's no way to contest it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would keep Congress from stalling the next president's nomination for Supreme Court?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends. If nothing changes, there's nothing preventing Democrats from filibustering the nomination. However, Republicans could threaten to retaliate by eliminating the filibuster (which is basically tradition, there's no legal requirement to keep it). A filibuster requires 2/3 vote, but if it's eliminated, they only need a majority.</p>
<p>If Democrats do filibuster, it's seen as fairly likely that R's will get rid of the filibuster, and put in a different conservative candidate anyway. Even if they want to keep the filibuster, it's wildly accepted that it would be political suicide to let it go for 4 years.</p>
<p>aside:
Comments implying it's common/normal are poppycock. Whether you agree with the delay of Merrick Garland, it's historically unprecedented and a very big change in precedent. /u/Delehal posted a nice list in the comments. Quite frankly,&quot;letting the people choose&quot; doesn't even make sense, since President Obama was elected.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>I derped, as several commenters mentioned, cloture is only 60 votes.Don't post late at night, kids!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The President gets to suggest supreme court judges, and the senate needs to approve or reject them.  It is widely considered a &quot;perk&quot; of being president that you get to pick the supreme court judges because it is hard for the seante to vote against a qualified candidate for blatantly political reasons.  So generally speaking the President's &quot;suggestion&quot; ends up getting Senate approval.</p>
<p>This time however there were a couple of pretty big twists.</p>
<p>First The vacancy opened up in Obama's last year in an 8 year term when he had appointed several supreme court justices already.  This last year is an odd time because the next president is running for election and its pretty rare for anything major politically to be done by the &quot;lame duck&quot; president.</p>
<p>Second the vacancy was an arch conservative.  It is one thing to fill the seat of a swing vote with someone on your side, its one thing to fill the seat of a conservative with another conservative or a liberal with another liberal.  But Obama was going to be FLIPPING a seat.  on a court that is 5-4 splitting frequently.  THIS WAS HUGE.</p>
<p>Third Obama had suffered a series of painful electoral defeats and had lost control of the senate.  </p>
<p>Fourth during his terms Obama had systematically ruined his relationship with the Republican senators.  He used the &quot;nuclear option&quot; for judicial appointments, he made &quot;treaties&quot; that didn't get senate approval as constitutionally required, he didn't have any give and take to him like Bill Clinton or Bush did.  There was no bipartisanship and that really was as much his doing as anyone else's.</p>
<p>Fifth, everyone thought Hillary would win.</p>
<p>So ordinarily you can't vote against a supreme court candidate for blatantly political reasons because it looks bad.  But suddenly Republicans could just not bring the matter up for consideration (because they were in control), and argue that because it was the end of Obama's term and new people were running, it was appropriate to leave it to them.  And since everyone thought Hillary would win... no one was really all that pissed off about it.  </p>
<p>Turns out trump won.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
