		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without refueling, the power out put will eventually begin to decline.</p>
<p>Most nuclear plants are on a 18 month or 24 month refuel cycle. The difference being the enrichment (concentration) of the Uranium-235 in the fuel assemblies, where the fuel assemblies in a 24 month core is at a higher enrichment than those in the 18 month core. </p>
<p>As the Uranium-235 is depleted, the reactor power would decrease. This probably leads to another question about the characteristics at the beginning of the cycle. The fuel is configured to ensure constant, 100 percent reactor power over the entire cycle with few exceptions.</p>
<p>In Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs), the amount of criticality is controlled using boron that absorbed neutrons and controls the amount of fission going on. As the fuel depletes, boron is removed to allow more free neutrons to interact with the fuel. </p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p>
<p>Edit: I missed a key part of your question. Yes, the spent fuel is radioactive, however the energy (heat) from that radiation is minimal compared to the amount of energy produced from the fission of Uranium-235. </p>
<p>Edit 2: Remember this is a high level discussion, a full blown discussion of reactor theory would be a little more in depth and lengthy. </p>
<p>Edit 3: Anything nuclear is exciting to talk about, but over sensationalizing it hurts the public perception. It’s important to discuss facts and not sensationalize it, but to understand how critical it is to ensure safety is the over riding principle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So...there are differing types of radiation and reactors that control slightly differently. I will discuss light water PWR’s because that’s what I’m familiar with. </p>
<p>Most of the power comes from fission, specifically breaking the binding energy in the nucleus of U-235 atoms, although later in core life, PU-240 (which is a neutron capture byproduct) can contribute to the fission population with some significance. Decay products produce heat, and build in through neutron capture. At peak, decay products produce around 7% of total thermal power. After 10 minutes of shutdown, it’s less than 1% due to many of the products having very short half lives. </p>
<p>Control rods are only a portion of the system. PWRs also use a chemical shim, typically boric acid, in some capacity in order to allow the control rods to remain within their bands, maintaining proper reactivity coefficients, and maintain shutdown margin. At the end of core life, power begins to taper off, and this is referred to as “coast down” in the industry. Only around 1/3 of the fuel is actually replaced during refueling. There is a point where coasting down can cause some of the fuel characteristics of the remaining fuel to be undesirable, or unanalyzed which would impact how the core was refueled in future cycles.   Because of these parameters (as well as many others) the reactors are shut down for refueling with the fuel in a safe, predictable, and analyzed condition. Things that have to be considered in these analyses are how long the fuel has been used, how much fuel is left, its current, and future location within the core or spent fuel systems, and flux distribution/power history of the core. </p>
<p>In theoretical land, power would continue to taper off until the reactor was subcritical. And would then only produce decay heat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Imagine if you're taking a hot shower for a really long time. The water is exactly X degrees.
It will eventually start to get cold as water runs out. So you turn the faucet up to try and keep the temperature at X degrees, but at some point it runs out of enough hot water to keep the temperature at X degrees, even though there's still warm water. This is what happens with the fuel in a nuclear reactor over many months (depending on the design.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Initially it’s just power dropping. When you run out of hot excess reactivity and you’ve done everything to keep power up, reactivity slowly drops. For a BWR you can expect to see up to 0.5% power loss per day, and I’m told pwrs are up to a 1% loss per day. As power drops, other physical reactivity feedback mechanisms keep the reactor in a critical condition at lower power levels. For example, loss of power in a BWR means less steam production. Less steam in the core reduces core dP, helping to raise effective core flow and prevent power from dropping rapidly. </p>
<p>Eventually you run into issues for your coastdown. The cycle analysis only assumes a certain number of coastdown days, so you would need to keep re-analyzing core safety and response to operate beyond that point. Additionally you have fuel based limits which you will run into for heat generation, lifetime in core, etc. </p>
<p>If you continue to do nothing you’ll end up with unanalyzed flux conditions as power continues to drop, eventually reaching a point where power production is unsatisfactory and the core starts to be unable to maintain required temperatures and pressures. </p>
<p>Your comment about radiation seems to confuse fission and rad levels. Fission is what splits atoms and produces power. The radiation level the fuel puts out is a RESULT of fission, not the cause of fission. Fresh nuclear fuel is safe to hold with no shielding, just wearing some gloves. Once you irradiate it in a reactor core it quickly builds up enough fission products (waste products) to become lethally radioactive. The radiation only produces a small amount of the reactor’s heat. The majority of the heat (93% typically) is produced by fission itself and the short term decay effects from fission. </p>
<p>Older fuel simply has less fissionable material inside of it. Furthermore it also has more waste products which act as poisons. When you pull a typical BWR fuel assembly out, the spent fuel is about 0.7% to 0.8% enriched (around natural uranium levels). New fuel can be as high as 5% enriched. So you absolutely have to swap the fuel out to keep the reactor operating at power. You also have the fact that fuel is only qualified for up to 10 years in a core, and only for a certain amount of power generation. Additionally the fuel rods degrade over time and have much less margin to their linear heat generation limits that you absolutely have to swap them out. </p>
<p>We try to swap as few bundles as possible during a refuel, because spent fuel still breeds small amounts of plutonium to burn, and because the oldest fuel (in low leakage core designs) is typically placed on the core outer ring and acts as a neutron reflector. You save a lot of money by swapping less bundles. Again this has more power limits and can cause higher fast neutron fractions and positive moderator temperature coefficients. </p>
<p>Edit: see this picture for an end of life BWR core that only has 1 control rod left to remove. It’s a bit older. But it checks out : )</p>
<p>I actually was the senior reactor operator on shift for this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a water-cooled reactor, power isn't determined by the reactor itself, but rather the steam demand for the turbines. If more thermal energy is extracted from the coolant, its temperature drops, which means it becomes more dense, which means it has a larger moderating effect, leading to a rise in thermal neutron fission events. Coolant temperature would rise and drop due to power transients, and would have to be corrected with movement of the control rods.</p>
<p>The radioactivity of the fuel has nothing to do with reactor power. Any fission product radioactive enough to put out a significant amount of heat decays too rapidly to do so for very long; the vast majority of heat in an operating reactor comes from fission.</p>
<p>If you were to run a nuclear reactor with increasingly spent fuel, you would eventually reach a point where controllable neutron absorbers (whether control rods or liquid control poisons) would not be able to account for the drop in temperature due to steam demand (control rods would be nearly all the way out). You could continue to deliver the same level of power with a drop in temperature, but this could lead to other undesirable effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
