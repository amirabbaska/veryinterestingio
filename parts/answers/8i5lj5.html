		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>given the intensity of radiation is greater in the forward direction, will the source not be acting like a photon drive, and hence decelerate?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>No - the total force due to the photons emitted in the forward and backward directions will be equal in the reference frame of the moving object. Hence, no deceleration in any and all inertial frames.</p>
<p>Edit: this is because all inertial reference frames agree on whether there is a net force acting on the object. No net force in one of them means no net force in all of them (and correspondingly no acceleration).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light source will lose mass, and correspondingly momentum, while keeping its speed.</p>
<p>In the reference frame the light source cannot accelerate, obviously - the situation is symmetric. This means it cannot accelerate in any other reference frame from simple velocity addition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
