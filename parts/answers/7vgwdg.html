<p><strong>No</strong>, the lava depicted in the lava zone is completely unrealistic (but <em>so</em> cool.)  Let me comment on the pieces of the answer that people have already given:</p>
<p>As /u/Little_Mouse points out, real underwater volcanism on Earth doesn't have much glow to it: the water cools the lava so fast that it's almost all dark except for a few glints of red.  Their video was taken at shallow depth by a scuba diver: here's a video from 1 km deep, similar to the lava zone in Subnautica:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmMlspNoZMs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmMlspNoZMs</a></p>
<p>No glowing pools, no red lava falls.  Water is a fantastic reservoir for heat, and the fact that warm water rises lets it carry away heat by convection really <em>really</em> well.</p>
<p>/u/PresidentRex has a great analysis of pressures and the phase diagram of water, but there's one thing they didn't realize: <strong>hot supercritical water is always less dense than cold</strong>, as shown in the graphs <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_density.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  Thus, there will be no &quot;stable layer of supercritical water&quot;: it would be buoyant, rise, and be replaced by cool water, carrying away heat by convection.</p>
<p>What if the layer of water near the lava surface had a ton of salts dissolved in it, so it was denser?  As /u/Bassmanbiff points out, the thermal radiation law applies to <em>everything</em>, not just rock: the supercritical water layer <em>itself</em> would glow.  But that's clearly not what we see in Subnautica, and in any case the water above this layer would still convect, rapidly cooling it just as if it were lava itself.</p>
<p>Finally, as /u/UniqueUserTheSecond points out, there's a thermometer in the game, and it reads 70 degrees C in the active lava zone.  That's probably a reasonable temperature, actually -- note that in the video I linked to, the submersible isn't damaged by the volcano's heat, and /u/Little_Mouse 's video was taken by a scuba diver swimming just a few feet from the lava!  But this is nowhere near the temperature at which stuff starts to glow -- no matter what stuff.</p>
<p>As a side note, several people are commenting on air pressure and O2.  One thing's for sure: the way Subnautica handles air and breathing at depth is completely wrong, and trying to dive the way you can in Subnautica would kill you dead.  Nobody in the real world has done a dive on pressurized gas to a depth greater than 700 meters, the people who've done it to a depth below 100 meters only do so with hours of preparation, a special gas mixture, and slow cautious pressure changes, and even then many people who've tried to dive below 300 meters have died.  The vehicles and seabases behave as if they are at sea-level pressure (if they weren't, they wouldn't implode if you take them too deep), but you can't just hop from 800 meters of pressure into your sea-level pressure vehicle without dying immediately.  And let's not even talk about how moonpools work....</p>
<p>Of course, a realistic approach to lava and air pressure wouldn't make for nearly as fun a game!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak directly to lava coexisting next to saltwater at depth, but there's some other misinformation thrown about this thread that I wanted to clear up:</p>
<p><strong>Lava temperature</strong></p>
<p>Lava glows because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">thermal radiation</a>. This is linked with the concept of blackbody radiation, where matter emits electromagnetic radiation based on its temperature. All matter emits this radiation above absolute zero, but the color becomes visible to humans around 800 K (980 째F/526 째C) as a dull red. As temperature increases further, objects appear yellow and then white hot (possibly with a tinge of blue).</p>
<p>The in-game lava is a deep red, so it's likely on the lower end of visible thermal radiation (800 - 1000 K). So while it's possible the lava doesn't have the same composition as typical earth-like lavas, it can't have a temperature much lower (e.g. lead melts at 600 K, but you can melt lead without it emitting a red glow).</p>
<p><strong>Atmospheric composition and air pressure</strong></p>
<p>The planet in Subnautica could have an atmosphere of anywhere between about 0.4 to maybe 5 atm of pressure. The partial pressures (pp) of various gases in the atmosphere are the important part for humans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_pressure" target="_blank">Partial pressure</a> is neat because if you take out the percentage of each gas in a gas mixture, the partial pressure would be equal to that percentage. Earth's atmosphere is (currently) 21% oxygen and basically 1 atm at sea level; that means that the oxygen has a partial pressure of 0.21 atm. On Mount Everest with a pressure around 0.33 atm, that's 0.07 atm of oxygen partial pressure. We need about 0.15 atm of partial pressure to breathe over the long term, but we can survive in less for brief periods (minutes/hours). </p>
<p>On the other extreme, our bodies would suffer if the <a href="http://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jappl.1970.29.1.23" target="_blank">composition in a high-pressure environment was not just right</a>. Non-noble gases start having detrimental effects at high partial pressures - including oxygen. Oxygen-related problems can start at 0.3 atm pp (aside from a risk of fire, this is one reason why we don't use 100% oxygen atmospheres at earth-like pressures in spacecraft), but up to 2 atm can be used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_gas#Oxygen" target="_blank">for short periods</a>. Carbon dioxide starts negatively affecting us around 0.06 atm of pp. Nitrogen narcosis is also well known in diving circles. The only somewhat safe options are neon and helium, and they can even start affecting our cell structures at extreme pressures. This really only applies to a human on the surface breathing air, though. </p>
<p><strong>Pressure at depth</strong></p>
<p>(Tiny edit: I should note that these pressure calculations are based on normal earth gravity. Higher gravity means more pressure for equivalent depth; lighter gravity means less pressure for equivalent depth.)</p>
<p>Atmospheric pressure ends up being of little concern once you get deeper. The water pressure exerted at 1300 m of depth is about 130 atm. Adding 0.5 or 4 atm on top of that is miniscule. Water at normal temperatures is still just a normal liquid at this pressure (as we can experience here on earth diving into deep ocean trenches). Nobody is really going to dive that deep on a regulator though; you'd need a pressurized tank to breathe (otherwise the water pressure would collapse your lungs) and the gases will do unpleasant things to your blood and body once you start breathing gases at those pressures. There are reasons the current free dive record is 214 m and the scuba record is 333 m. </p>
<p>As an explanation for the <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_phase_diagram.html" target="_blank">phase diagram for water</a>: Temperature is the horizontal axis (in Kelvin); pressure is the vertical axis (usually in Pa and/or bar). The basic ice/water transition is the vertical line around 273 K (0 째C, naturally). In the big graph on that page, E is basically normal earth conditions (293 K or 20 째C and about 1 atm or 1 bar of pressure). Pressure in water (like any fluid) increases with depth. The rule of thumb is 10 m of water = 1 atm of pressure (technically it's 10.33 m = 1 bar, but everything else I wrote is in atm and 1 bar is just about 1 atm). This means you increase pressure by 1 atm each time you go another 10 m down.</p>
<p><strong>Phase state at pressure and temperature</strong> </p>
<p>Water is a normal liquid at 130 atm at standard temperature. Water is a supercritical fluid at 130 atm at 800+ K. (I wouldn't recommend swimming in it; it'll do unpleasant things to your body other than just burning you). This means it will be stable and won't turn into steam because it's already a weird mixture of steam and water. Unfortunately, my chemistry isn't good enough to tell you how salt is going to affect this in detail (other than to say that solids tend to dissolve better at higher temperatures and pressures so it could be denser).</p>
<p>So, at the very least, it's at least plausible for the lava to sit there covered in a layer of supercritical, denser saltwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>to people answering, i want to point out if we go super technical, this water must have a property we do not know about, there's light from the local star at 100+m depth, which is just impossible on earth and the player goes to depths of 300m with only a high tech wetsuit. This means i would imagine that the water on this planet is less dense than water on earth which might allow for other possible interactions than the usual</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, not really. Well, for a hot second maybe. At midocean ridges lava cools almost instantaneously on contact with water, so quickly that rocks with basalt compositions have glassy shells. For example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmMlspNoZMs" target="_blank">here</a> is an underwater volcano in action. You'll see that even very hot, not particularly viscous melts don't have time to flow much before freezing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
