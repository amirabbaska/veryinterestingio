		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Threadworms or pinworms actually use the stomach acid to trigger hatching. The eggs are ingested and the stomach acid strips away the sacrificial outer layer causing them to hatch later when they have passed through to the lower intestines. The adult worms irritate the sphincter to aid the dispersal of the eggs by scratching so that they are not simply passed into the stools of the host but are instead lodged beneath the fingernails etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a sidenote, autoimmune diseases are rare in areas of the world where parasites of various kinds still are not totally uncommon. IBS is on trial for treatment with intestinal worms. The theory is that the immune system has evolved alongside gutworms over along time, and when we don't have any, it can run amok. So not only shitty diet, but lack of parasites is a double whammy. :P</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some parasites can enter through the skin, and then eventually make their way to the intestines.</p>
<p>For others that enter through food, they can get into the intestines in a few ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>a parasite egg can hide inside a chunk of food. If that chunk of food is large enough, the acid can't penetrate the chunk of food, and the egg won't be hurt by acid. It later hatches in the intestines.</li>
<li>stomach acid can be very weak in some people. Older age is correlated with less stomach acid, so parasite eggs can survive it.</li>
<li>some parasites like cryptosporidum eggs can't hatch unless their outer shells are dissolved by strong stomach acid.</li>
