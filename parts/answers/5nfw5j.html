		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/business/volkswagen-diesel-emissions-investigation-settlement.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Schmidt deceived American regulators “by offering reasons for the discrepancy other than the fact that VW was intentionally cheating on U.S. emissions tests, in order to allow VW to continue to sell diesel vehicles in the United States,” the affidavit said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Said a different way, Schmidt actively lied and hid information from the US government. With the bankers intimately involved with the housing crash, there wasn't enough evidence to prove criminal wrong doing on their part. Their basic defense was that the they didn't think the toxic assets were actually toxic, instead relying on the professional opinions of credit rating agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify for all the replies, I personally think it's extremely likely that there was at least one banking executive that knowingly sold toxic assets. Furthermore, such people <em>should</em> be held responsibile. A big difference between the VW scandal and the housing bust is that the diffusion of responsibility was larger for the banks involved, whereas it was harder for VW.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The VW execs committed fraud (basically knowingly lying). Even worse, they lied to the government. If you commit fraud, it's a jailable offense. There was also a lot of proof. It's hard to accidentally design a system that just so happens to turn on during regulation testing. Can't really &quot;oops&quot; that.</p>
<p>What the bankers did was more complex. They didn't necessarily commit fraud, rather they were being kind of &quot;dumb&quot;(or if you prefer, risky). Being dumb isn't a crime. However, if everyone is dumb, it can really screw up the market when people start realizing it was dumb, even if it wasn't intentional.</p>
<p>It's possible that some did it knowing they were taking risk, but that's very hard to prove unless they were dumb enough to put it down on paper/email.</p>
<p>However, big banks have compliance offices. Basically they're the private &quot;police&quot; for the bank. They're supposed to make sure people who work at the bank don't go doing dumb stuff (but again, it can be hard to find. there's a lot of people involved, and judgement calls).</p>
<p>So what the SEC <em>can</em> do, is fine the bank itself, and say &quot;those guys were dumb. we can't tell (or care) if it was intentional, but you're supposed to make sure they don't take on too much risk&quot;.</p>
<p>In addition, when the SEC fines banks for being &quot;dumb&quot;, there is a lot of subjectivity for the prosecutor and judges to decide what is actually too dumb to be reasonable.</p>
<p>If everyone is buying something that is worthless, how do you prove that they're buying stuff that's worthless knowingly, to rip people off? Maybe they just think it's good.Everyone else is buying it,you know?</p>
<p>It's hard! And for the most part, a lot of banks didn't intentionally do risky stuff. It was an &quot;oops, hey guys, we just realized we're screwed.&quot;. It was an honest mistake. However, if enough banks all make the same mistake and go out of business, it can really mess with the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>The bankers who were dumb enough to say &quot;we know this is crap but we're selling it anyway&quot; did go to jail. For obvious reasons this is fairly rare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem with most white-collar crime is that it's often very hard to prove, not only who is responsible, but even that there was a crime at all.  The line between &quot;shady but legal&quot; and &quot;fucking criminal&quot; is extremely blurry.  It can be as tiny a difference as &quot;did you know that what you said was untrue?&quot;  If it was actually lying then it's fraud, a crime; if you simply didn't know and were bullshitting to make a sale, it's impossible to prove that there was any fraud; and if you just handed off responsibility and read the company line, it's shitty but legal.</p>
<p>In the case of the housing crash there's a large legal difference between fraud and incompetence.  When the bubble burst everyone washed their hands of responsibility, pointing the blame everywhere else.  It was impossible to say who had actually &quot;committed fraud&quot; and who was just going along with the prevailing culture.  That culture created a strong pressure not to look too closely at what was going on.  The people selling mortgages weren't the people selling the bonds, who weren't the people rating those bonds, who weren't the people repackaging those bonds, who weren't the people gambling on those bonds, etc.  People upstairs blamed the people downstairs, people downstairs blamed the people upstairs, they both blamed people outside, people outside blamed people inside....</p>
<p>Most of the people responsible for the crash were &quot;knowingly ignorant&quot; of the issues at hand.  It's almost impossible to believe they couldn't see the risks, but they also didn't care to actually look for them.  It's like covering your ears and singing when someone tells you bad news.  If you didn't hear it you're not lying when you don't repeat it, but at the same time you kinda know you're wrong.  After the crash we couldn't prove who had heard the bad news and lied about it and who had covered their ears and pretended everything was still okay.  Both are shitty, but only one is illegal.</p>
<p>Ultimately the issue isn't a lack of punishment after the fact.  It was a lack of oversight and regulation before the fact.  Oversight and regulation that haven't come and aren't likely to.  Just because nobody did anything illegal doesn't mean that what they did should have been legal.  And just because we can't now prove that there was anything illegal now doesn't mean that if we'd been watching more carefully we couldn't have spotted illegal behavior then.</p>
<p>With VW it was much easier to pinpoint who was lying.  That lie was what meant fraud, which meant jailtime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people here are commenting that Bankers did not commit any crimes.  This is incorrect.  A big example of this is how credit ratings agencies (S&amp;P, Moody's, etc) knowingly rated financial instruments as very secure investments when they knew those instruments were worthless.  You can read about this in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-sues-standard-poor-s-fraud-rating-mortgage-backed-securities-years-leading" target="_blank">civil lawsuit</a> filed by the justice department.</p>
<p>Why was this merely a civil lawsuit, and not criminal prosecution?  Quite simply, many wall street banks are &quot;Too big to jail.&quot;  Eric Holder testified about this in congress when referencing the HSBC scandal:</p>
<p>The report is available <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/07072016_oi_tbtj_sr.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am concerned that the size of some of these [financial] institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy. And I think that is a function of the fact that some of these institutions have become too large . . . I think it has an inhibiting influence—[an] impact on our ability to bring resolutions that I think would be more appropriate.9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at that, the ample evidence available to the justice department, and the lack of criminal prosecutions from the 2008 scandal, it's possible to connect the dots about what happened here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
