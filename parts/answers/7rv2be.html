		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the wikipedia page you link to in the section &quot;Youngest popes&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All four were members of the Theophylacti family that dominated Roman politics during the 10th century. This period is known to historians as the saeculum obscurum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was very much an anomaly, the section also shows that the average where people become pope was already over 60 between 1500 and 1700 and has increased little since then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Pope had power and it was important to keep someone who was a member of your faction as the Pope.  You'll notice that there are also a lot of Popes during that timeframe who had <em>very</em> short terms in office and not all died due to natural causes</p>
<p>The 4 youngest popes were all members of the same powerful family who backed a lot of different popes through the years.  From 904 to 963 there were 12 popes with an average reign of slightly less than 5 years.  When you're chewing through a pope every 5 years you're going to have some interesting picks.</p>
<p>Modern popes only have power over the church and the church only has power over itself so it isn't a hotly contested position.  In the past 80 years we have only had 5 popes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
