		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some to a lot is the broad answer. I'm not aware of a drug that  100% selectively acts on the CNS.</p>
<p>Some highlights(each receptor is also found in the affected organs):</p>
<p>Mu-opioid agonists cause constipation.</p>
<p>Anti-cholinergics cause dry skin/mucous membranes and lower muscle tone.</p>
<p>5HT-2B agonists can cause heart valve disease.</p>
<p>5HT-2A agonists cause pupil dilation(opiates cause constriction).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the responses I have seen are valid but I would like to mention that drugs have active metabolites that do not penetrate the Central Nervous System. For example, Amphetamine gets metabolized into 4-Hydroxyamphetamine <em>via</em> CYP2D6. The Hydroxy group makes the amphetamine molecule resemble a water-soluble monoamine named Tyramine and act as TAAR1 agonists although only peripheral effects occur as a result of an inability to penetrate the BBB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there is a fair bit of literature about the effect of chronic use of NO2 and itâ€™s effect on B12 levels. As far as i can tell, the NO2 deactivates B12 which can result in Subacute Combined Degeneration of the spinal cord...as well as demyelination in the brain and nervous system. this can lead to poor brain-performance and severe debilitating peripheral neuropathy. </p>
<p>sidenote: how is nitrous not considered a psychotropic?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a medical student, I'm more interested to hear what the long term &quot;plastic&quot; effects of psychotropic drugs have on the peripheral and enteric nervous system, if anybody is aware of them?</p>
<p>For instance, SSRIs theoretically cause long term changes to the serotinergic pathways. Addictive meds can alter the networking of the mesolimbic pathway, etc.</p>
<p>Are there any similar mechanisms peripherally?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In relation to this, I remember a rumor in high school that people who regularly took LSD.  When they were not on it, sometimes if they cracked their back they would get a small high.  Any truth to that?</p>
<p>I did acid a few times in college, I never had such an experience. Just the usual smiling so hard my face hurt the next day, and universal truth revelation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
