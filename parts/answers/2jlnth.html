		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, I bet most people don't know what this stuff really looks like: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta#mediaviewer/File:Human_placenta_baby_side.jpg" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta#mediaviewer/File:Human_placenta_baby_side.jpg</a></p>
<p>Second, a retired professor at Emory University once rambled to me for an hour about the evolution of the human placenta, and how genes found in fruit fly wings show up in it, apparently to distribute the blood vessels. He explained three different major classes of mammalian placentas, having evolved at different times.</p>
<p>It's an amazingly complicated organ, transferring nutrients and antibodies while integrating two animals with different genetics and making sure neither side's antibodies attack the other. Plus it looks gross as hell.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The whole &quot;assembly&quot; - embryo, placenta, and the umbilical cord between them, etc. - everything that grows in the uterus - grows from the fertilized egg. It therefore contains the DNA of the child, since it grows from his cells.</p>
<p>The fertilized egg &quot;digs in&quot; to the uterine wall as it starts to grow and split into multiple cells. As it attaches and starts digging in, the woman may experience minor bleeding, &quot;implantation bleeding&quot;.
The placenta grows a whole lot of fine thin long pieces (placental villi) that embed their way into the wall of the uterus. The surface between the uterus and the placenta exchange nutrients for the embryo and help carry away waste products from the growing embryo. This is how the growing embryo &quot;feeds&quot;.  </p>
<p>Once the baby is born, a little while later the placenta also detaches and is expelled. Birth is messy. </p>
<p>(The placenta can also shed occasional cells into the mother's bloodstream, so there is a much less invasive way nowadays of doing paternity tests fairly early in the pregnancy. The old way involved sticking a needle into the embryonic sac, more risky.) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The placenta structure is made entirely of cells that originate from the fertilized oocyte, but are extra-embryonic. Maternal uterine tissue reacts to this tissue and specializes as an appropriate interface. Maternal blood moves into spaces created by the placental cells to allow transfer of gases, proteins, and other material between the mother and the embryo/fetus. The umbilical cord is entirely from the extra-embryonic tissue and contains genes from both paternal and maternal origin. However, imprinting mechanisms may favor the expression of maternal genes in the placenta over those of paternal genes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
