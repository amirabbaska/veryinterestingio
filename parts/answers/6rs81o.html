		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Am I wrong for thinking that the most optimal design would/could/should be used everywhere with the only difference being speed to control the airflow (CFM)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, your thinking is wrong here.</p>
<p>First up is, how do you define &quot;optimal&quot;? Any real world problem has multiple variables at play and there is no one &quot;optimal&quot; solution. You brushed up on a couple aspects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>air flow per speed and efficiency</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fan A might have more air flow, but fan B has better power efficiency. Which is &quot;optimal&quot;? Fan C might be better than both, but costs more to manufacture. Fan D might be better than all 3 in efficiency, flow rate, and cost, but is horribly loud. This is the basis of optimization: you first have to define what &quot;optimal&quot; means for your particular use case, and there's generally a lot of competing factors. They're often barely related by any physics, which is the basis of &quot;multi-disciplinary design optimization&quot;, or MDO.</p>
<p>This is even separate from physics, where how fluids behave change dramatically based on scale and what you're trying to do. There's no reason why a 50 meter diameter wind turbine built to extract power from oncoming flow should look anything like an 80mm computer case fan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blade design is <strong>very</strong> application specific.  Wind turbine blades wouldn't work on a submarine.  Well, they <em>might</em>, but there would almost certainly be issues of cavitation, esp. near the end of the blade.  Having a noisy screw on a ship or submarine means it can be heard dozens or even hundreds of miles away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a short addition to the other great answers:
Apple once made it a distinctive feature of their new MacBooks to have asymmetrical fan blades in order to make the noise of the fans less monotonous and therefore less irritating to hear (I am explaining this poorly, but basically they seem more quiet than they actually are, at least that was the claim)
These fans prioritized noise over absolute efficiency or performance, so they should be great in specifically the desired use case but for example less relevant in industrial cooling facilities or car engines etc.
Just  goes to show that it's all a matter of priorities, basically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why do fans on air pumps speed up when pushing against a blockage? </p>
<p>Case in point - I have a camping air mattress with attached pump, but when it gets to a certain point of inflation, and is unable to inflate any more (against the pressure in the mattress I guess?) the motor seems to speed up, rather than slowing down...always wondered!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem is fans have a lot of parameters that they need to optimize for. A brief example list includes efficiency, airflow (CFM), variable speed operation (one fan may perform better across a range despite a lower peak efficiency, noise (sound is usually sacrificed for static or airflow) , and static pressure (force behind the air flow) . No single fan is the best at all of the conditions. </p>
<p>I work in HVAC and we use many different types of fans for various applications. Off the bat, there are probably 4 or 5 different arrangements I use on a weekly basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
