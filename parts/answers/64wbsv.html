		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I did a little research for you, and basically it comes down to 3 things: </p>
<p>1 - when looking at someone you like your brain releases dopamine and dopamine also stimulates eye dilation </p>
<p>2 - people find individuals with dilated pupils to be more attractive, as it demonstrates sexual compatibility, kinda like a peacock's tail, except more low key </p>
<p>3 - pupils tend to dilate more drastically when women ovulate and this can signal fertility to the male </p>
<p>Hopefully that helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It could also be that when you see somebody you like, your body becomes sympathetic dominant meaning the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response is more stimulated than your &quot;rest and digest&quot; state. Your sympathetic nervous system causes sweating, more blood flow to your extremities as well as dilation of the pupils.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I remember from high school, and this could be complete BS, but my teacher mentioned that they also dilate because they are trying to receive more light off the object you like essentially making the object &quot;prettier&quot; or more appealing and allowing you to see every detail of the object. When you see food you like or something you really want they will also dilate.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
