		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is wrong (except Mjolnir2000). Socialism doesn't mean state ownership. Communism doesn't mean totalitarianism where no one owns anything. Capitalism doesn't mean free-market economics.</p>
<p>Socialism is when workers democratically own productive property. Capitalism is when productive property is owned privately and those owners hire workers to operate the property to make commodities for sale. Communism is a stateless, classless, moneyless, society. Socialism is the transitionary stage between capitalism and communism. </p>
<p>Among socialists there are two basic divisions: democratic socialists and revolutionary socialists. There are also social democrats who are not socialists, but people mistakenly believe they are (such as Bernie Sanders).</p>
<p>I like to explain it this way:</p>
<p>If democratic Capitalism is an ongoing game of Monopoly, then,</p>
<p>1) Socialists propose that we play Hungry Hungry Hippos instead.</p>
<p>2) Democratic Socialists say we keep playing Monopoly for now, and gradually convince the other players to change the rules to resemble Hungry Hungry Hippos until we are effectively playing Hungry Hungry Hippos.  </p>
<p>3) Revolutionary Socialists want to flip the table and force everyone to play Hungry Hungry Hippos immediately.  </p>
<p>4) Social Democrats don't actually want to play Hungry Hungry Hippos, they just want to make some rule changes to Monopoly so it doesn't suck as much for players who are losing (like the popular free parking rule).</p>
<p>Among pro-capitalist supporters (which leftists call liberals, an umbrella term that includes both American liberals, conservatives, libertarians, and social democrats), there are those who support free market economics and those who support state regulations and state-provided services such as public schooling and universal healthcare. The latter is NOT socialism. Both are forms of capitalism. Capitalism is not synonymous with free markets, it just means private ownership of property by some class of people. Scandinavian countries are capitalist. America is capitalist. India is capitalist. China is capitalist. Ethiopia is capitalist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the answers here already are wrong.</p>
<p>Capitalism means you have private ownership of capital. The factory is owned by one person, say, and they can earn money off the factory simply as a result of said ownership - they have other people to do the actual work. </p>
<p>Socialism means you have democratic ownership. The factory is jointly owned by the workers, and managers are elected. Alternatively, the factory is state owned, but the state is itself democratic. Socialism comes in many different varieties. </p>
<p>Communism is a stateless, post-scarcity society in which things like money are no longer relevant because everyone's wants and needs can be trivially provided as a result of advances in the means of production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/HephaestusClangBang is using a tired spammed facebook meme.<br />
It's bullshit.</p>
<p>/u/aloofball is spitting out misconceptions American liberals have.<br />
It's bullshit.</p>
<p>/u/Fiveos2 is regurgitating Cold War propaganda.<br />
It's bullshit.</p>
<p>/u/artificiallyselected never heard of anarchism and is also vomiting propaganda.<br />
It's bullshit.</p>
<p>The only people here who actually gave a correct explanation were /u/Mjolnir2000 and /u/MemeMeUpFamilia. And I know they are correct because I am a socialist myself.</p>
<p>So OP. Don't listen to those people, because they are wrong.</p>
<p>Capitalism is private ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p>Socialism is collective worker ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p>Communism is the hypothesized next stage of society that is moneyless, classless, and stateless. Socialism is viewed as a stepping stone to communism itself.</p>
<p>Anarchists are also socialists and they've existed before Marxist-Leninism was a thing (the ideology of the USSR and most socialist states in the 20th century). Don't let anyone fool you into believing that socialist == state ownership.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
