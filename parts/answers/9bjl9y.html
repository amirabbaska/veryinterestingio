		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ISS is in orbit, but it's closer to Earth than you probably think. There's still a tiny bit of air resistance from the upper atmosphere at that altitude, so anything without rockets (which the ISS has) will gradually slow down and fall back down to Earth. So any air that escapes the ISS will simply &quot;fall&quot; back down again. It will take a while, but eventually it'll just mix with the rest of the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ISS is still within the atmosphere of Earth, just that it's extremely thin at that altitude, so yes, it returns to Earth's atmosphere. Will it go down all the way to the ground, most likely not, but if it never reached the escape velocity, aside from the tiny portion blown away by the sun's radiation, it will stay around Earth, gradually slow down and homogenize with the very low density top part of the atmosphere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Disperse&quot; isn't quite the right way to think about it as the word disperse probably evokes thoughts of a cloud of vapor slowly mingling with the air. The air molecules escaping the ISS will pick a direction (whatever way they bounce out) and book it like crazy (\~500 m/s average) it until they hit something.</p>
<p>â€‹</p>
<p>We can get an estimate of how far they get from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path" target="_blank">Mean Free Path</a> for the atmospheric conditions of the ISS. While on earth an air molecule would only get about 68nm before changing direction, each individual molecule escaping the ISS will travel 100,000 km average uninterrupted in this level of vacuum. The most likely outcome is that it crashes down to earth and interacts with the atmosphere. It's like millions of individual orbits that are 500 m/s off a proper circular orbit in unknown directions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average speed of molecules in a gas is on the same order as the speed of sound in that gas. That corresponds to a few hundred m/s on Earth. The ISS is pressurized to 1 atm. Most gaseous molecules in the ISS aren't really going very fast relative to the Earth, and even when they're squirted through a hole by 1 atm of pressure they won't reach escape velocity.</p>
<p>Hydrogen and helium can, but thankfully we don't breathe those things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
