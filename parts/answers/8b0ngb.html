Raising one does not change the other or vice versa medically. There are various ion channels and other transports by which these electrolytes pass in and out of cells.</p>
<p>To clarify: They oppose each other in terms of electrochemical gradient BUT sodium or potassium intake do not affect/antagonize each other significantly on a clinical basis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In what systems does it act as a counter agent? </p>
<p>With regard to neuronal employment of sodium and potassium, both these ions need to be kept at very specific concentrations (both in intracellular and extracellular environments) for proper signalling function. In which case, simply substituting one for the other could lead to serious problems. Beyond that, I'm not familiar with any counter-function of these ions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the original question has a bit of a false premise. Sodium and Potassium don't &quot;counter-act&quot; each other, really. </p>
<p>The first point to understand is that in the inside of our cells (the so intracellular volume) are a lot proteins that are negatively charged. These proteins are things like enzymes, for example. If the inside of the cell is negatively charged, this will cause positive ions to flood in, and so they do. Now if the process was allowed to continue unchecked, there would be way too much sodium INSIDE the cells. This is a problem why? Because wherever Na goes, H20 follows, and unchecked Na into the cell would eventually cause it to burst from too much water following. That won't do, so the cell membrane, has a Na-K pump, kicking the Na to outside of the cell into the &quot;extra-cellular space&quot; where it belongs, and allowing the negatively charged proteins to be balanced by K ions only. So in our cells, the negative charge from the proteins is ultimately almost perfectly balance by K ions. </p>
<p>So while Na and K are at opposite ends of the cell membrane, this is at a cellular level, they aren't exactly &quot;counter-agents&quot; to each other. One is allowed to enter (K) and the other is told to stay out (Na) to that water content inside cells can be preserved. As some others have stated as well, there is also an interplay between Na and K to generate the so-called membrane potential, but you don't even need to go there to explain OP's question. </p>
<p>So even if our food was completely loaded with K instead of Na for the &quot;saltiness&quot; taste, this Na-K interplay across the cell membrane wouldn't change at all. </p>
<p>But the most important reason our food isn't full of K-salts as opposed to Na-salts is because our body is actually pretty sensitive to overconsumption of K. When you take in too much K, you risk messing with those &quot;membrane potentials&quot; across the cell membrane. Some here have pointed out that this slight residual difference in charge b/w the outside and inside of the cells is exploited to produce &quot;nerve impulses&quot; aka &quot;action potentials&quot; that are used in nerves, and without getting into too much detail, Na and K levels are manipulated to accomplish this. </p>
<p>An organ that also uses these action potentials is the heart, and it's the effect of K overdosing on the heart that makes it dangerous. When K levels gets too high, its disrupts the intrinsic rhythm (which relies on the mechanism of membrane potentials) of the heart to the point of potentially causing cardiac arrest. Accidental overdoses of K to patients in hospitals is probably trope in medical shows at this point (rare in real life). The lethal injection used to kill death-row prisoners involves giving massive doses of K to stop the heart. When patients come in with crush injuries (causing the cells to release their K loads into the extra-cellular space), we fear high-K levels and work to address it aggressively. A normal K level in the serum (the extra-cellular space) is about 4. When the level is about 7, doctors get very nervous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question is too general. K does not reduce the quantity of Na in the body. In some biological applications, increased K can improve the mobility of Na but that doesn't immediately take it out of circulation. The question is more why don't we just add K instead of Na to food? They are fairly analogous salts so you'll have another imbalance with a different set of problems.</p>
<p>Can't solve a salt problem with more salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
