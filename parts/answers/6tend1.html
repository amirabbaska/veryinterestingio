		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Larsen ice shelf that broke off was sea ice, not land ice, and was floating when it broke off. That shelf itself will not raise the sea level at all when it melts, it didn't raise the sea level when it broke, nor did it alleviate any pressure on the continental land mass.</p>
<p>When the continental ice sheet melts, there will be some isostatic rebound, but that will happen over thousands upon thousands of years and will likely be in the millimeters per year range. The ice on the continent will take lifetimes to melt even during the worst case climate change scenario and will have little effect on the volcanoes underneath. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3659701/Huybers_FeedbackDeglaciation.pdf?sequence=1&amp;origin=publication_detail" target="_blank">Huybers and Langmuir (2009)</a> describe and discuss a positive feedback scenario wherein increased volcanism due to the isostatic rebound of recently deglaciated crust inputs enough CO2 into the atmosphere to cause more deglaciation to occur. </p>
<p>When glaciers are removed from the surface, decompression of the underlying mantle can induce melting and volcanism. This process has been thought to have occurred <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2001GC000282/full" target="_blank">in Iceland (Maclennan et al., 2002, a classic paper in this area of study)</a>, on Prince of Wales Island (personal communication with US Forest Service geologist Jim Baichtal), and is critically examined in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825213000664" target="_blank">Watt et al. (2013)</a> where the authors acknowledge that CO2 contributions from volcanism post deglaciation are elevated but still do not play a dominant role in controlling atmospheric CO2 levels. This last paper featured a study of deglaciation-derived volcanics in the Andes. </p>
<p>The take home is that yes, unloading glaciers from the crust can induce volcanism. </p>
<p>Edit: Updated the links to full papers where available. I'm sorry I couldn't find one for Watt et al. 2013</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
