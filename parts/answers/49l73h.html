		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that this does not solve your question, but this might help you imagine the kinds of scales we're talking about. </p>
<p>Your body is largely made of water, so let's look at the scale of 100 billion using water molecules. It sounds like a lot, but let's figure out how much that would weigh. (100 billion water molecules) <em> (18 grams/mole) / (6.02*10^23 molecules/mole) = ~ 3</em>10^-9 grams. That means a HUNDRED BILLION MOLECULES of water is only 0.000003 milligrams. So we can see that a hundred billion, on a molecular scale, isn't all that much stuff. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>That example serves mostly to illustrate what a hundred billion means at the scale of a molecule -- and a neutrino hitting one atom in one molecule is not terribly likely to make a big difference. Now let's consider a hydrogen atom, since it's an atom that's abundant in our water-heavy body. Hydrogen atoms are about 99.9999999999996% empty space according to google -- meaning the vast majority of the 5*10^-11 meters between their proton and their electron is empty. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So where does the neutrino fit in? That length, 5*10^-11 meters, is about the length of one <em>billion</em> neutrinos stacked end to end -- and that's just the radius! If atoms were just straight lines, only 1 in a billion neutrinos is likely to hit anything (based on your rate, that's about 100 interactions a second -- still quite a lot!). But atoms ARE NOT lines -- they're spherical ^<em>ish!</em> . The volume of a sphere with that radius is about <em>10^27 times</em> the volume of the actual neutrino. I know scientific notation is not so good at being readable, but neither is this: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.</p>
<p>Considering that 99.9999999999996% is empty space, there's room for about  999,999,999,999,996,000,000,000,000 neutrinos within the space of a single hydrogen atom. </p>
<p>999 octillion. </p>
<p>That's a lot.</p>
<p>Thinking of this number, 100 billion per second, we can look at our very big number and consider how likely it is, each second, that a neutrino passing through one of our hydrogen atoms hits it. If we take enough space for 10^27 neutrinos and hit it with 100 billion neutrinos a second, we should get a hit for every 10,000,000,000,000,000 (ten quadrillion) seconds. That's about 3 million lifetimes, provided you live for 100 years! </p>
<p>Now, this whole hypothetical situation is set up around hydrogen atoms, which are very small and very empty. However, the realm of the order of magnitude of the results is what's important.  The chances that a neutrino hits any part of an atom in your body is seriously low. Even when they do, one collision will affect one atom, potentially changing the reactivity of a single molecule -- which will affect such an unbelievably small amount of a reaction that it will not have any significant impact on a function that your body performs.</p>
<p>Hope that was a decent way to look at the scales involved in things like neutrinos!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>EDIT: This math was based on a lot of loose conjectures using very imprecise numbers - Google and Wikipedia's first results, to be precise. I should have done a cross section of a hydrogen atom instead of volume; the radius given for a hydrogen atom is its <em>most probable</em> radius, not the radius of every hydrogen in the universe at every moment; and who even really understands the size of a neutrino - most of the time they're acting more wave-like than particulate. SO, please don't cite this shoddy work as the universal truth on this subject. However, errors and approximations aside, it's still pretty unlikely the neutrinos are doing anything to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is in the question: the neutrinos are passing through, and not interacting.  When they do interact it is a rare event.  The reason there are so many neutrinos making it all to way to you (and not first interacting with the stuff in-between you and them) is the same reason it's rare that it will interact with particles within you.</p>
<p>It's simply a very low incidence rate for neutrinos to actually &quot;hit&quot; upon a neutron, and they can be said to <em>pass through</em> instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The big issue is that almost all contact and interaction that we experience is electro-magnetic.  When you touch something with your finger, you're not actually touching it.  Instead the electrical field on your skin is interacting with the electrical field of the thing, pushing the skin of your finger, making you feel as though you touched something.  </p>
<p>Neutrinos have no charge, and they're tiny.  Which means that for them to interact with something, they have to actually hit either an electron or a proton exactly.  To give you an idea of &quot;how unlikely&quot; this is, if you were to shoot a neutrino through a brick of lead (very dense stuff) that was 1 light-year thick, there would be about a 50% chance that the neutrino would make it through without touching anything.</p>
<p>In the center of a star, there's lots of fun interaction going on, with hydrogen getting crushed together, making helium and a lot of energy.  It takes about a million years for the photons released in this hydrogen-crushing furnace to reach the surface of the star and begin their journey to us.  Neutrinos generated in the center of the star take a fraction of a second to make it to the surface because they just don't interact with anything. </p>
<p>Matter as you and I know it is almost completely empty space controlled almost entirely by electromagnetical forces.  Once you have something that doesn't interact with that electro-magnetical field, it punches through everything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos only interact using the weak force, which interacts vey very rarely.  For example, a solar neutrino can go through a light year of lead with a 50/50 chance of interacting with something.  Why is this?</p>
<p>The mediators of the weak force are the Z and W bosons, which are very massive compared to other force carriers.  This large mass means large energy must be created to transmit the force (E=mc^2) -&gt; large energy means that the W/Z boson doesn't live long (Heisenberg uncertainty principle) -&gt; the boson can't travel far (small time=small distance traveled) -&gt; it is very unlikely that it finds another particle to interact with (which is how to turns neutrons into protons).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
