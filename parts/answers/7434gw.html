		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1. You are literally stretching your muscles and tendons. Imagine a rubber band; as you pull it it stretches and wants to return back to the original state. The more you play around with it, the weaker that force and the more you can pull it apart. Same exact thing happens with muscles.</p>
<p>This is the biggest factor and will be the main way most people increase flexibility. The two points below are also a factor but generally don't make much difference unless you're double jointed or a gymnast </p>
<p>2. You have special cells that tell your muscles to contract when they are stretched out. This prevents your muscles from being pulled too far and ripping. As you stretch, those cells are trained to allow more give, allowing more flexibility. </p>
<p>3. Your joints are surrounded by cartilage and all other sorts of tissue which limit the freedom of movement for the joint. When you stretch these tissues become more elastic, allowing more range of motion for the joint  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
