		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's bribery when there's a direct quid-pro-quo (exchange of one thing for another thing) and where the causation is such that the payment triggered the official action.</p>
<p>That's what makes regulation difficult, conceptually and practically. If the Koch Brothers donate millions of dollars to the Tea Party, is that bribery because the politicians will, if elected, enact pro-coal and pro-business laws, or did the Koch Brothers simply donate to those politicians who, as a &quot;pure,&quot; unadulterated policy matter favor pro-coal and pro-business law independent of the donations? How do we know that the donations cause the action and the donaters aren't just choosing to donate only to those who agree with them?</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to prove bribery when you're talking about non-policy, ministerial actions, like approving building permits and granting contracts, than it is when you're talking about broad political actions that favor any one group. If Bernie Sanders were elected through the donations of $20 he received from tens of thousands of people, would those people have been &quot;bribing&quot; him when he lowered their relative tax burden by more heavily taxing the 1%?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: A surprisingly wide variety of things done for a politician could count as a &quot;bribe,&quot; but <em>only</em> if done with the intention for the politician to perform a surprisingly narrow set of acts. </p>
<p>According to recent Supreme Court precedent, to be a &quot;bribe&quot;, there <em>must</em> be what's called a &quot;quid pro quo&quot;, i.e., something done for a politician (doesn't have to be a payment directly to him!) to induce him to take some kind of <em>official</em> act. </p>
<p>Let's unpack that a bit, starting with the &quot;something done for a politician&quot; bit. The stereotypical bribe involves handing a politician an envelope full of cash. While that still <a href="http://www.phillymag.com/citified/2016/01/24/maria-quinones-sanchez-profile/" target="_blank">definitely happens</a>, particularly on the state and local level, it's so obvious as to be kind of, well. . . tacky, I guess. In the US anyway, a lot of what goes down in terms of bribery isn't direct payments to the politician as such, but nonetheless involves some kind of favor done for or on behalf of the politician. Possible examples: donations to a favored charity, pulling strings for the politician's kid, getting his wife a seat on some local non-profit board, etc. </p>
<p>What makes the above a <em>bribe</em>, instead of just a friendly favor (&quot;elite&quot; social circles involve <em>tons</em> of mutual back-scratching), is when it's done to induce the politician to take some specific &quot;official act,&quot; i.e., exercise some power specific to their office that only they can exercise. Could be almost anything, depending on the office in question, e.g., voting a certain way on a particular issue, approving an application, awarding a government contract, etc. </p>
<p>But it does have to be an <em>official</em> act. Just because something is a manifest conflict of interest, in an ethical sense, does not make it a &quot;bribe&quot;. There's a whole lot of what could fairly be described as &quot;influence peddling,&quot; corrupt as the day is long, which is still not technically &quot;bribery,&quot; pr even necessarily illegal, as it doesn't involve the official actually doing anything <em>as a function of their office</em>. Making introductions and endorsements? Making &quot;friendly&quot; phone calls to other officials over whom the subject official has no actual authority? Probably doesn't count. Certainly didn't for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/27/politics/bob-mcdonnell-supreme-court/" target="_blank">Bob McDonnell</a>, anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Donations are made to the candidates campaign or a supporting institution (their party, or a PAC or some other independent expenditure). A donation will never legally see a candidates bank account. Donations are regulated heavily and usually publicly disclosed (super PACs don't need to make disclosures). </p>
<p>Most donations are made because the donor agrees with the candidate politically or has a personal relationship with them. Rarely they are made in the hopes of influencing the candidate, but there's no quid pro quo so politicians can ignore or return the donation.</p>
<p>A bribe is given to a candidate or incumbent politician directly in return for some service or action they take while in office. They're illegal, so usually not disclosed.</p>
<p>Edit to further clarify: most states have restrictions on lobbyists making donations to candidates. In my state, they can't make donations to candidates who don't appear on their ballot on Election Day. I assume there are similar provisions made by the FEC for national and congressional candidates but I am not 100 percent sure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bribes are illegal, and campaign contributions are legal.  No, seriously, that's it.  In most countries what US calls &quot;campaign contributions&quot; would be called bribes and be illegal.  The only distinction is an arbitrary line.  In the US, that arbitrary line is that you can give someone money, you just can't tell them what it is you want them to do directly.  That's it.  If Exxon hands a Congressman a pile of cash and says, &quot;open up offshore drilling and we will give you more&quot;, that is bribery and illegal in the US.  If Exxon hands a Congressman a pile of cash and then 5 minutes an Exxon lobbyist walks in and says &quot;open up offshore drilling and we will be grateful&quot;, that is legal.</p>
<p>The simple fact of the matter is that in the US, bribery is legal.  There are limits on how you can bribe.  You have to be coy and not pretend like it is an exchange.  We have a bunch of dumb rituals you need to follow, and sometimes you need to document the bribe.  At the end of the day though, it's a bribe, and it's just how business is conducted in the US.  If you want your congress critter to do something for you, <del>bribe them</del> give them legal campaign contributions and then tell them what you want.</p>
<p>Seriously, there is no difference.  We just don't call campaign contributions bribery by custom.  Lots of other nations just call it bribery.  We could change the law and also call it bribery too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
