		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;All grains contain phytic acid (an organic acid in which phosphorous is bound) in the outer layer or bran. Untreated phytic acid can combine with calcium, magnesium, copper, iron especially zinc in the intestinal track and block their absorption. This is why a diet high in unfermented whole grains may lead to serious mineral deficiencies and bone loss. The modern misguided practice of consuming large amounts of unprocessed bran often improves colon transit time at first but may lead to irritable bowel syndrome and, in the long term, many other adverse effects. Soaking allows enzyme, lactobacilli and other helpful organisms to break down and neutralize phytic acid. As little as seven hours of soaking in warm acidulated water will neutralize a large portion of phytic acid in grains. The simple practice of soaking cracked or rolled cereal grains overnight will vastly improve their nutritional benefits.&quot;</p>

<p>Tl;dr, phytic acid  which is found in most grains can prevent minerals from absorbing, leading to a deficiency when consumed regularly. It can also cause irritable bowel syndrome. Soaking oats allows enzymes and bacteria to break down the phytic acid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What constitutes as &quot;raw&quot; oats, exactly? I've been having oats with milk for breakfast (oat flakes or porridge oats or haferflocken or however you want to call them) for the last 10+ years and haven't had any problems. I never soak them, they usually sit in milk for up to 5 minutes before I start eating them (usually mixed with whey as well).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mathieu Lalonde Phd. has videos about phytates and phytic acid in foods such as legumes, grains, nuts etc. Soaking them reduces the phytate content. Cooking can produce similar results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never heard of raw oats being &quot;unsafe&quot;. Are you referring to what some people believe about how you should soak grains  because it reduces the so called &quot;toxic&quot; phytates that are present in grains, nuts and legumes? If so, in my opinion this is more pseudo-science than real science. People that subscribe to this generally believe in following a diet like paleo and a whole bunch of other holistic crap. Are they right? Maybe, maybe not. But this is hardly an issue of raw oats being unsafe, as in eating raw chicken is unsafe. It's totally safe!!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
