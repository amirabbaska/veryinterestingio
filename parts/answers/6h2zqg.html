<p>Experimentally, as far as I am aware the record confinement is 309 anti-hydrogen atoms for 1,000 seconds (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1104.4982.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>). This <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v541/n7638/pdf/nature21040.pdf" target="_blank">recent paper</a> from ALPHA has some more info about the current methods using for generating anti hydrogen. </p>
<p>Basically, we can't make enough antihydrogen, confine it for long enough for two atoms to collide, form anti-H2, and for us to detect it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If I recall the explanation correctly, dilute hydrogen atoms in the gas phase will remain as atoms, rather than form H2 molecules, because any collision between two atoms will be elastic because there is no way to dissipate the energy released if a bond were to form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anti hydrogen is formed experimentally by combining trapped anti protons with positrons from a radioactive source which are slowed to a reasonable level. </p>
<p>The problem with this is it produced anti atoms in highly excited rydberg states which makes them hard to confine.  Hence we only end up with &lt;100 anti atoms.  At this density the probability of a three body collision (required to form a molecule generally because of energy and momentum conservation) is very low so almost no molecules form.  Edit: It seems we are up to 300 anti-atoms! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have we yet created any other &quot;anti&quot; element? </p>
<p>If so, how would these anti-elements react with each other?</p>
<p>Do/would they react violently, such as with their non-anti counterparts when two different &quot;anti-elements&quot; interact? (Example being two anti-hydrogen atoms combining with an anti-oxygen atom to make anti H^(2)O?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
