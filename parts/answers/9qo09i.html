		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suspect it's more social than anything. I don't think it's the case here in Eastern Canada. People do deny they fell asleep here, but it's not an angry response.</p>
<p>Why they deny it is a good question. Likely something to the effect of they're embarrassed they were caught drowsing off, or the implication whoever's company they were in was so boring they fell asleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I notice this in my children when they were trying to stay awake, such as for a movie.  I think it is much less about the sleeping as the potential that they are being accused of failing to reach their goal, while they have no memory of actually sleeping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was a simple social response.  You're supposed to be participating in something - be it a movie marathon, a board game, family night, guarding the North Gate against brigands, maintaining watch over a poorly infant, not burning the sunday roast, preventing a writer having an accident whilst visiting the consulate to handle some paperwork.</p>
<p>But you're asleep.  Obviously this wasn't important to you!!   </p>
<p>At some point in our evolutionary past we must have evolved the importance of fulfilling roles and duties and the consequences of neglecting them.   Aww man, cavedad! The fire has been forgotten and has gone out, wolves have eaten Simon, Chrissy and Sally... again...  This is your fault!  We will shun you, feed you only the rotten parts of mammoth foot, and refuse to let you come to the cinema with us on Fridays.</p>
<p>So maybe the natural defensive (rather than angry?) response is to ensure that your clan don't think that you were derelict in your duties?  </p>
<p>Look I've responded quickly, with wit and maybe a little aggression, if I were asleep could I do that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Might have something to do with the way it's presented as well. Accusations?
If it was a simple and empathetic, &quot;oh, you seem tired, would you like a pillow?&quot;, I'm sure you wouldn't get an angry response</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
