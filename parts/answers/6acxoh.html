		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is some evidence suggesting that galactic development is both spurred and controlled by the formation of black holes.</p>
<p>In the following quote, the 'bulges' being referred to are the bulges present at the center of spiral galaxies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each bulge contains a central black hole, whose mass is proportional to the bulge stellar mass 1–5, M BH ≈ 0.001M bulge. Black holes and bulges also formed at about the same epoch in the lifetime of the Universe 6,7 . These observations imply that the formation of black holes and the formation of bulges are closely linked. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1608" target="_blank">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It kind of makes sense, really.  According to the big-bang theory, the early universe is was very dense and early stars were universally large and short-lived -- the perfect progenitors of super-massive black holes.  Those early black holes would coalesce and concentrate the field of matter around them, leading to galaxies.</p>
<p>Their presence also serves to limit the growth of galaxies, as they feed on matter they heat up the surrounding gas -- making it both hotter and less dense, and that limits star formation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The full answer is not known, but we do know that they form together and influence each other's development. We also know that supermassive black holes do not form the same way as regular ones do. No star can be large enough to create one, and it's not possible for an existing one to consume enough mass fast enough to explain how they can be so large even in the early universe (radiation pressure puts a hard upper limit on how fast a black hole can consume matter). As such, this remains one of the big mysteries of astrophysics. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Supermassive black holes and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protogalaxy" target="_blank">protogalaxies</a> in which they formed both formed together out of the same gas. Exactly when you call a bunch of gas a galaxy, or exactly when you call a large black hole &quot;supermassive&quot; is not particularly important. What is important is that we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole#Formation" target="_blank">still have only a very limited understanding of how supermassive black holes actually formed</a>. The problem is that we know from studies of very distant (and therefore very early) quasars that supermassive black holes billions of times the mass of the Sun formed within the first billion years of the universe's history. This is a major problem, because it is very difficult to take a &quot;normal&quot; black hole (one that formed at the end stage of a massive star) and grow it to that mass in that time frame (because the material around a growing black hole heats up and emits an enormous amount of radiation that tends to blow away other material, leading to a theoretical limit for how fast a black hole of a certain mass can grow).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer from a bit of info and some logic would be that stars come first.</p>
<p>Galaxies are generally formed from accretion disks of relatively diffuse matter. Once that matter gets to a certain mass and density it inevitably undergoes fusion and becomes a star. Way, waaaay further along than that, when the mass and density are much greater, you can get a black hole. So we can plot a continuum of mass/density, and as we travel along it, we hit 'star' much before we hit black hole. Hence generally speaking, stars will pre-date (supermassive) black holes. </p>
<p>There <em>may</em> be types of galaxy formation where a supermassive black hole forms before the bulk of the galaxy has coalesced or been captured. However even in those cases, the matter that initially formed the black hole would have undergone fusion before it became an SMBH, and given the definition of an SMBH's as hundreds of thousands of solar masses or more, would likely have been at least a significant conglomeration of stars.</p>
<p>EDIT: there are actually (uncommon) modes of black hole formation that allow for a collapse without fusion</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During their formation, galaxies were indeed attracted to some preexisting objects, but that objects were not supermassive black holes, but haloes of the dark matter. The reason for that is because in the early Universe the temperature was high enough for regular (barionic) matter to be ionised and hence opaque to the light. In this conditions the barionic matter just cannot cool  down by radiating photons and settle to form a galaxy. The dark matter does not interact with the light and free to form dense regions -- haloes right away. So there was some period in the early Universe, when the regular matter was (almost) uniformly spread, but the dark matter was already in form of haloes (one can regard them as &quot;dark proto galaxies&quot;).</p>
<p>When the Universe cooled enough for matter to recombine, it became transparent to the light (this moment is called the recombination). After this moment, the barionic matter was free to cool down via radiation and to fall into already formed massive dark haloes to form visible galaxies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
