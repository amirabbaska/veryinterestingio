<p>You are supposed to put tea into boiling water all at once, not slowly heat it up with the water.  It does taste different that way.</p>
<p>EDIT:  To be clear, you don't put tea in water while it is still boiling, you bring the water to a boil, let it cool a bit, then put it in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oy vey. I can't believe so many people are talking about the staples. You can walk over to your microwave right now and prove that wrong. </p>
<p>It is how the tea steeps: the volatile flavor compounds in the tea come out from the leaves at different rates depending on the water temperature -- some of them are good, some of them are bad. </p>
<p>It's impossible to control the water temperature in a microwave, so you end up with a strange mix of good and bad flavors, in all the wrong proportions. </p>
<p>The manufacturers put &quot;do not microwave&quot; because they don't want someone tasting their product, having it taste like crap, and never buying that brand again.</p>
<p>[Edit: I've microwaved tea (in times of dire necessity) hundreds of times, and never once seen any evidence of arcing or fire risk. But, to be fair to the folks who have commented, some people have reported that they have seen that.]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you microwave water, such as in a ceramic coffee mug, it doesn't boil normally at 212 degrees F / 100 C (no bubbles). Because of this, the water can actually reach temperatures <em>above</em> the boiling point.</p>
<p>With super-heated water, introducing turbulence with a teabag, or hot chocolate mix, will cause the water to explosively boil.</p>
<p>Check out videos of microwaved water for hot chocolate to see what I mean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
