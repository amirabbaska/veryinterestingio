		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've got the same thing. And some of mine have pathologically weak segments that like to tear back and split. It sucks.</p>
<p>It is pathological variations in the block of cells that actually produce the fingernail. If some are injured or die off, or if you get some scaring deep in there, then those &quot;more sparse&quot; segments produce less fingernail-stuff. That then looks like the thinner segments.</p>
<p>There isn't anything much to be done about it. I chased various theories about nutrition or moisture, but it's probably more like scar tiisue and fingerprints. You've got what you got.</p>
<p>The times where you get the little interruptions in a particular ridge are times when the ample cells just didn't produce as much as normal. <em>That</em> can be a question of nutrition or exposure to environmental factors, but meh, again nothing much to do about it.</p>
<p>Now I don't think it has anthing to do with age, but it definitely has something to do with wear and tear.</p>
<p>I had one nail that was so problematic that I eventually dug it out. I just went after it with the scizors and plyers from my swiss army knife. Yeha, it hurt, and it was a pathological thing to do. When it started growing out oddly I did it again. Once I finally got all the nail out, it grew back better than it ever was. Still not great, but greatly improved.</p>
<p>I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THAT. It was circumstantially necessary and a doctor might have done it, or done it better than I did myself. But at the time it was the best solution for an odd set of reasons. And to pull it off you have to be willing to endure a good bit of pain and, frankly, digging debris out of a deep wound type self control. I was sort of desperate because the nail kept splitting back to the quick and then snagging on things. So the repeated short surprising pain for years just finally pissed me off.</p>
<p>Yech.</p>
<p>But anyway, the condition is quite common. So much so that people, particularly women, will use a buffing stone or emery board to smooth away the ridges. And that procedure is so common that every cosmetic counter in the modern world sells that buffing tool.</p>
<p>Bodies are just imperfect and if your nails are strong enough to survive a little smoothing you can hide this imperfection at will.</p>
<p>Very few people <em>don't</em> have these ridges naturally. They are not a sign of illness or anything. They just aren't pretty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's from a dry nail bed. Most people over the age of 25 have them simply from washing their hands a lot throughout the day, which removes oils. Once the ridges are there the next bit of nail tends to grow with the same ridge pattern, so they don't really go away once you have them.</p>
<p>They aren't Beau's Lines. which are horizontal depressions in the nail that might be caused by infection or injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure it's genetic, I've had nails like that all my life. My dad has them too, and my grandad. My mum has beautiful smooth nails, but sadly those are not the ones I got :(  I don't know why the ridges vary though with gaps etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have that too and I thought maybe I was missing some nutrient.  But, just to be safe, I asked my doctor and I got that &quot;it's old age related&quot;answer. I do think that's the standard answer for when they have no idea. So, I started taking a multiple vitamin every day and that hasn't helped either. So, maybe the doc was right. I've have read that eating gelatin will make your nails stronger, but won't help with the ridges. A light buff on them will make them less apparent though if they bother you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm. I only have them on my thumbs. Right thumb has a deep horizontal valley, left thumb has vertical ridges. Regular nails are smooth. Never notices the difference until now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
