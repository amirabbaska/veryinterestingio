		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every time we had lice inspection at school when I was a kid, I always looked forward to it. I had no idea why, but feeling the doctor's hands run through my scalp with a tiny comb felt absurdly good. i never had lice, never caught it. but i always looked forward to those inspections. now my wife does it for me. back scratches are good, but nothing beats a head scratch. get in there deep, hun. make sure you take bits of me with you under your fingernails. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your skin has receptors that send information through some nerve fibers to centres in your spinal cord and hence your brain. Activation of these centers help releasing endogenous morphine (as endorphin, enkephalin, ...) which make you feel happy. That's why acupuncture works as they aim to specifically stimulate these fibers to relieve the pain. That's also why when a child hit his/her hand their mom trying to relieve the pain by touching that area smoothly which stops him from crying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>This is a good article aimed at layman.  To tealdeer it, scratching is an evolutionary response to wound detection and cleaning, allowing us to make sure that wounds and other small itches are clear of bugs or other matter.</p>
<p>Because we are social animals, we grew up grooming each other, which means that someone else taking care of your needs is highly appreciated, and also shows socialization, care, and love.  So, when you scratch my back, I scratch yours, we're essentially showing care through physical touch, and making sure that we are bound more solidly together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes the pain from scratching makes your body release the pain-fighting chemical serotonin.</p>
<p>That’s why the more you scratch, the more you itch. The more you itch, the more you scratch. </p>
<p>I think serotonin is the answer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
