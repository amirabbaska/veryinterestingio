		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Wes,</p>
<p>Fellow Canadian here doing cancer immunology research abroad. Thanks for being here today!</p>
<p>We've seen that durable patient responses to immunotherapies targeting T cells is dependent on a variety of factors, from the number of T cells infiltrating the tumor to even the gut <a href="https://www.nature.com/nrc/journal/v17/n5/full/nrc.2017.13.html" target="_blank">microbiome</a>. Do you know of any biomarkers predictive of response to the adjunct therapies that you are researching? What do you think are the biggest problems preventing adjunct therapies from being more common in the clinic?</p>
<p>Also, I think it's great that you have a <a href="http://mostlyscience.com/" target="_blank">website</a> directed at translating science to non-scientists: what more do you think us scientists can do to improve our relationship with the public and make our discoveries better understood?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
