		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The layer of skin below our eyes (eye lids) is thinner than most of our skin anywhere else - so it is prone to show more blood vessels.  In general blood vessels seem blue because the skin tissue only allow the blue/violet wavelengths of light to pass through it which are reflected back.  Veins often won't appear blue if a person has darker or lighter skin. Rather, the veins tend to appear green or brown. On the other hand, people with extremely light skin, such as albinos, will typically have veins that show up as dark purple or dark red, more closely resembling the actual color of the blood running through the veins.  So, those dark bluish circles are (usually) just the result of light being reflected back off of the blood vessels sitting just below the surface of that incredibly thin patch of skin. </p>
<p>Additionally, as we age, our skin loses elasticity and becomes thinner.  Some people are genetically disposed to have thinner skin than others.  There is also a condition (mostly within dark skinned people such as those from India) that results in more melanin (dark brown or black pigments or skin color) being produced by the skin below the eyes, resulting in it appearing to be a darker color. </p>
<p>There are also some conditions that can make the appearance worse, such as: 1) blood vessels around the eyes being damaged, 2) fluid buildup below the eyes, either due to illness, allergies or simply excessive salt consumption which can result in the body retaining more fluid than usual, 3) when the body is tired, production of the chemical cortisol is dramatically increased to help give you the energy you need to stay awake. Among many other things, cortisol actually increases the volume of the blood in your body, which causes the blood vessels (including the ones below your eyes) to engorge to accommodate it, 4) medication that causes blood vessels to dilate, 5) scratching or rubbing your eyes excessively, such as during allergy season, 6) regularly sleeping on your stomach, and 7) a similar light diffusion process is happening when we see people who are suffocating and have purple lips and fingertips. In this case, the blood is so oxygen deprived that it turns an extremely dark shade of red. When the light diffuses through the skin of the lips or through your fingernails, it then often ends up looking dark blue or purple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it can be somewhat genetic too. Since I was young I've had them as a pale blue purple. Sometimes they get worse after drinking and lack of sleep, but since I was 11 or 12 I've always had them. Once was asked, &quot;were you in a fight or something?&quot;. Sometimes I'm guilty of some of the causes another poster mentioned, but usually can cover them up with one of those cheap dark circles make up sticks - I'm a dude and no one notices so y'all should feel comfortable to use them too men of reddit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have like permenant blue circles under my eyes but I'm also one that has fair skin and can't tan,I burn. I looked into it and with fair skin the circles are more noticeable but the main thing is the connection to allergies. I have bad allergies to Cypress trees and grass, so in relation to my allergies that it causes the blue circles.
I read that the swelling of sinuses causes the inflammation of the vessels under the eyes because the sinuses are pressing on them. Because my sinuses are so bad it made sense for me. If you Google dark circles and allergies it gives you a lot more than what I remember.
All I know I eventually need sinus surgery to correct my deviated spectrum and I hope the circles lessen when I get it done. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
