		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scarcity of silicon is simply a non-issue when it comes to commercializing solar cells. In fact, silicon is one of the most abundant elements in the Earth's crust, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Elemental_abundances.svg/1280px-Elemental_abundances.svg.png" target="_blank">as shown in this chart</a>. The harder part historically has been scaling up the purification of silicon to create big crystalline and polycrystalline chunks. But as far as the raw materials go, we're more than good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is the main component of sand, which includes most (not coral nor black sand) beaches of the world as well as the sand found in sandy deserts. That's a LOT of silicon, assuming that it can be separated out. The chart that's already been posted shows that silicon is second only to oxygen in abundance, and sand is part of the reason why. Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right now, we use about 1.5 million metric tons of silicon a year for electronics and similar things.</p>
<p>There is just under a quintillion tons of silicon in the Earth, so we have about 600 billion years at the current rate. </p>
<p>For comparison, there is enough hydrogen left in the sun for about 5 billion more years.</p>
<p>So I'm not worried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have answered about silicon; a more pressing concern is the abundance of the more obscure elements used in various devices. Indium, in particular, is crucial for making indium tin oxide, a transparent conductive coating. It only comprises 0.21ppm of the Earth's crust, it's mainly produced as a by-product of zinc purification, and we only have <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-much-is-left/" target="_blank">14 years of it left.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the third most abundant element both in the Earth's crust and bulk. It makes up 28% of the crust and 16% of the bulk. Even if we mine the whole earth to build a Dyson sphere, there will be plenty of silicon to go around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
