		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Obligatorily, pi is not infinite. In fact, it is between 3 and 4 and so it is definitely finite. </p>
<p>But, the decimal expansion of pi is infinitely long. Another number with an infinitely long decimal expansion is 1/3=0.33333... and 1/7=0.142857142857142857..., so it's not a particularly rare property. In fact, the only numbers that have a decimal expansion that ends are fractions whose denominator looks like 2^(n)5^(m), like 7/25=0.28 (25=2^(0)5^(2)) or 9/50 = 0.18 (50=2^(1)5^(2)) etc. So it's a pretty rare thing for a number to <em>not</em> have an infinitely long expansion since only this very small selection of numbers satisfies this criteria.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the decimal expansion for pi is infinitely long and doesn't end up eventually repeating the same pattern over and over again. For instance, 1/7 repeats 142857 endlessly, and 5/28=0.17857142857142857142857142..., which starts off with a 17 but eventually just repeats 857142 endlessly. Even 7/25=0.2800000000... eventually repeats 0 forever. There is no finite pattern that pi eventually repeats endlessly. We know this because the only numbers that eventually repeat a patter are rational numbers, which are fractions of the form A/B where A and B are integers. Though, the important thing about rational numbers is that they are fractions of two integers, not necessarily that their decimal expansion eventually repeats itself, <a href="http://www.skidmore.edu/~adean/MC2151401/Handouts/RationalRepeatingDecimals.pdf" target="_blank">you must <em>prove</em> that a number is rational if and only if its decimal expansion eventually repeats itself</a>.</p>
<p>Numbers that are not rational are called irrational. So a number is irrational if and only if its decimal expansion doesn't eventually repeat itself. This isn't a great way to figure out  if a number is rational or not, though, because we will always only be able to compute finitely many decimal places and so there's always a chance that we just haven't gotten to the part where it eventually repeats. On the other hand, it's not a very good way to check if a number is rational, since even though it may seem to repeat the same pattern over and over, there's no guarantee that it will continue to repeat it past where we can compute.</p>
<p>So, as you noted, we can't compute pi to know that it has this property, we'd never know anything about it if we did that. We must <em>prove</em> it with rigorous math. And there is a relatively <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1947-53-06/S0002-9904-1947-08821-2/S0002-9904-1947-08821-2.pdf" target="_blank">simple proof</a> of it that just requires a bit of calculus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a direct answer, but you might enjoy reading the brief book, &quot;A history of Pi&quot; by Beckman.  It's full of some pretty interesting lay stuff (which is why I enjoyed it) and typical of the genre of books that address key mathematical entities, like pi, e and infinity. David Foster Wallace wrote a short book on infinity, &quot;Everything and More&quot;, which is also a fun read and a good tour of relevant concepts.  Math, logic, philosophy are so tightly bound that it's always a reliable source of mystery to me to ponder math concepts... a peculiar form of engineering meditation, as it were.  It helps actually to have an appreciation of these things as they inform a lot of what makes humans human... our observation, invention, visualization, and creativity, expression and communication.  It's also humbling to know that some truths are so basic that they are still taught with examples and proofs that date from thousands of years ago and which were divined by people without the benefits of zero, positional notation, graphical representations (i.e., like the graph of a function, not a drawing of a triangle), etc.   The same brains as ours, working the same problems, 3000 years ago.   Euclid's Elements were the foundational textbooks of geometry and proof until well into the 1900's in classrooms worldwide.   Kind of amazing.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think everyone here covered the answer to your question really well.</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend a youtube channel by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A" target="_blank">Numberphile</a> as it covers interesting math-related concepts such as this one.</p>
<p>edit: also a related channel you should visit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sixtysymbols" target="_blank">Sixty Symbols</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was proven irrational as early as the 18th century. Before that, people suspected it but we didn't know for sure.
There are many other numbers which we aren't sure are rational or not. In general, it is difficult to determine if a number is irrational.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One slight expansion that I didn't see anywhere: not only is pi irrational, it is also transcendental. A number is transcendental if it cannot be expressed algebraically. The square root of 2 is irrational but it is not transcendental; it can be expressed as the solution to the equation  X^2 +2 =0. No such equation exists for pi nor for <em>e</em>, he base of natural logarithms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
