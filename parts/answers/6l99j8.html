		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the technology at the MRF or material recovery facility. At a typical single stream meaning you put all recycling in one bin there are a variety of &quot;screens&quot; material passes through that separate out 2d from 3d things so paper from other material. Screens that separate glass. Eddy currents to pull out aluminum. Optical sorters that can be used to separate plastic types #1 - 7 or glass or different types of paper. However there is always something called residual in the end commodity. Residential would be like plastic straws or caps in a ton of glass sold on the market. Residual in glass has increased significantly since many MRFs have moved toward single stream. Additionally glass ends up being broken in small pieces in single stream recycling and has lower market value.  Add increased residual to the situation and glass recycling is a money loss for MRFs. </p>
<p>TLDR yes all economically reasonable attempts to pull out non recyclable commodity items and separate commodities for market are made but not everything that shouldn't be there is pulled out and what isn't is residual shit in a commodity kinda like the ends pieces on a loaf of bread </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
