		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't have coins with a melt value that exceeds their face value. They stopped making pennies out of copper for this reason. I believe this has to do with price fixing and inflation. For most of the 20th century the price of gold was fixed at $35 an ounce. My parents spent 20 bucks on their solid gold wedding rings. Crazy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 1934, the United States tried to make itself stronger by hoarding silver. This cause the value of silver to raise to the point of other countries not being able to export (inflation). Countries started to abandon silver as a monetary system and the United States got stuck with a stock pile of under valued silver. In the 1960s silver started to have industrial use and the United States sold their silver and stopped minting silver coins because they would lose money on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
