		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of practice.</p>
<p>It's a process of training:
Increasing lunch capacity
Increasing efficiency of using available oxygen
Producing less C02 per cycle
Better controlling exhalation to keep &quot;clean&quot; air with available oxygen,  while exhaling mostly waste gases </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, here's a Time article: <a href="http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1736834,00.html" target="_blank">http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1736834,00.html</a></p>
<p>tl;dr: Blaine 1) trained himself to ignore the instinctive pain impulses you get to try to save yourself from drowning, 2) Blaine practiced forcing extra air into his lungs by swallowing, and 3) Blaine used pure oxygen; the record for holding one's breath without pure oxygen is about 15 minutes (vs. 24 minutes for pure O2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
