		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your teeth do heal themselves. But as someone else stated, we get cavities when the healing process can't make up for the destruction caused by bacteria and their byproducts.</p>
<p>Now, the healing in our teeth is a bit different from other tissues in our body, meaning that once a cavity has formed, the teeth won't be able to regrow the lost parts, but may be able to stop the process going any further and form a 'scar-like' tissue.</p>
<p>There are three major factors that contribute to the development of cavities(Keyes triad): </p>
<ol>
<li>Diet. In the modern world, people consume food that has been processed( from which mostly carbohydrates are responsible for allowing the bacteria to develop) and has the ability to stay on the teeth surfaces longer, providing a 'good' environment for bacteria.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.Bacteria. Everyone has all sorts of bacteria in their mouths, but some people may have more of the pathogen bacteria involved in caries. Bacteria alone can't do any damage, but since almost always it's complemented by the other two factors, caries develop.</p>
<p>3.Host factor(tooth and saliva). There are many systems in our body to combat the negative actions done to our teeth, some present in our saliva, others in our teeth. So people that don't secrete enough saliva, or the one secreted is 'weak'(can't manage to stop the demineralization process going on) will be more likely to develop caries. The same goes for our teeth structure. Some people don't have strong enough enamel, due to something intervening in the development process.</p>
<p>So when these three factors are working togheter and the dental hygiene is also not so great, the body's ability to stop the caries can't make up for the damage done to the teeths. Once something changes in the Keyes triad or a better dental hygiene
is established, the body has the ability to stop the dental caries ( if the process isn't too advanced - meaning the bacteria reached the dental pulp, and from then on, the process is ireversible to the pulp, and without the dentists intervention an infection will continue to develop).</p>
<p>That's a short version of what's happening, but it can give you and idea. Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my primary language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tissues that can heal themselves need to be made of living cell that can divide and grow more cells from a small amount of living cells. Much of teeth is mineral that was deposited by living cells but after that initial process, teeth are mostly non-living very hard mineral or hard mostly non-cellular tissue. The cells that initially made all that mineralized hard stuff died and are no longer around to do it again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your teeth are built gradually inside your jaw by your body's cells, and are then pushed out.</p>
<p>Once it is outside of the gum, it is just dead mineral with no living cells and your body has no control over repairing it or growing it.</p>
<p>It's the same as hair and nails, they are built at the base (in the follicle or nail bed) and then pushed out.  Once pushed out, they are simply dead matter and your body has no control over them.</p>
<p>Your teeth can remineralize to some extent, by absorbing fluorine from things like mouthwash and water, but this is a chemical process, not a biological one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People clearly don't get what ELI5 means.
Let me spare you the excessively drudging physiology lecture. There are 4 main things which make up teeth. Most of them regenerate. One of them doesn't. It's enamel, the hardest, most mineralized structure in your body. I'm fact, it's so dense with minerals and complex that it can't be secreted by anything but cells called ameloblasts, and even then only before the tooth actually erupts (emerges) in your mouth. At which point the ameloblasts die and are not replaced. Thus no more enamel will be secreted on the tooth.  No more protective layer means the rest of the tooth will not be able to resist the ravages of caustic foods, mechanical wear and decay.</p>
<p>So, in short, when you're young and sheltered you have your family around you, supporting you, nurturing you, protecting you, helping you grow. As you start to venture away from home and get exposed to the evils of the world and time passes on, your family dies off until none of them are left to support, nurture, protect and help you grow. If you haven't taken care of yourself up to this point and learned to avoid bad things (smoking, soda, candy) and engage in good practices (flossing, brushing, etc.) then you're fucked. You will slowly be worn away by the evils of this world, having wasted the love and support to which your family devoted their entire existence. </p>
<p>Brush your goddamn teeth. Floss once in awhile. Your mother loved you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From talking with my dentist, as I understand it our teeth are constantly healing and strengthening themselves absorbing minerals through saliva/foods/toothpaste (aka fluoride) etc.</p>
<p>The issue is we as a species eat so much crap; grains, acidic foods and sweets etc that healing isn't 1:1 anymore.</p>
<p>This being said, you would never fill in a cavity, rebuild a chipped section or replace a whole tooth but simply &quot;weakened&quot; areas are supposed to &quot;restrengthen&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
