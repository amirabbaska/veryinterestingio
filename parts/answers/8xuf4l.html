		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work on the space station and can answer this! The space station cooling system (Thermal Control System, TCS) is quite interesting! Externally (ETCS), there are many massive radiators. These radiators reject heat that is carried from the rest of the space station through liquid ammonia in pipes! Like water cooling your computer, but with ammonia.</p>
<p>BUT! Ammonia is very dangerous! We don't want it inside the space station near the astronauts! So inside (ITCS) we use water! </p>
<p>The water sucks up heat in large air conditioners (quite a few air conditioners inside) and flows to certain places in where the walls of the space station are extra thin. Here, where the walls are thin, water passes heat through the wall to the ammonia, which passes heat to te radiators! These places where the walls are thin we call &quot;Interface heat exchangers&quot; (IFHX) because the heat is exchanged from water to ammonia.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, do ask! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We use an amonia based cooling system on the ISS to dump heat from both humans and our electronics as a normal system would not work due to what you posted about space being a vacume.  Once the amonia warms up and cools down the air and electronics, it goes through a refrigerator sized condensing/compression unit that readies it for another go.  Much like your home A/C, it is a closed loop system, though the amonia is still huge threat to health,  more so than freon, which is why we ran the loops on the outside of the ISS in case of a leak.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The coils make a loop that goes both inside the space station (where it’s warm), and outside the space station (where it’s very cold). Fluid is pumped around and around through the coils, so there’s always freshly-chilled fluid coming back inside after cooling off outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
