<p>moving a strong magnetic field through the brain or body can stimulate neurons. you have [TMS] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation</a>) which is used for research purposes to stimulate the brain, and [MRI] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging</a>) which is used for imaging, but which can also cause nerve stimulation (<a href="http://www.mrisafety.com/SafetyInfov.asp?SafetyInfoID=250" target="_blank">http://www.mrisafety.com/SafetyInfov.asp?SafetyInfoID=250</a>).</p>
<p>if an EMP has the right stuff in it (especially if there's a very strong field change), it can certainly affect what's happening in the brain. if it's strong enough to do that, i'm guessing it will kill you outright---</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Depends on what you're trying to affect with the EMP.  As a weapon, the pulse generates large currents in electrical conductors (wires, coils, antennas, etc.) which can burn out other electrical components.</p>
<p>People have been exposed to nuclear explosions (Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and during peacetime testing), which produces a strong EMP.  The people din't appear to be adversely affected by the EMP itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
