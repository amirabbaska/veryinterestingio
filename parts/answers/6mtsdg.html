		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, horses have eight different blood types, and each type can exist in a variety of forms, and they can also have a type from each of the other types.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://equusmagazine.com/diseases/blood-12901" target="_blank">Equine Blood Transfusions</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Horses have eight major blood types---A, C, D, K, P, Q, U and T (the first seven of which are internationally recognized)---with more than 30 different factors for which they can be positive or negative. These can combine in a number of different ways, designated by an upper-case letter for the type, combined with a lower-case letter for the factor, such as A (a,b,c,f,g), Ca, D (a,g,k), Ka, P (a,b), Q (a,b,c), etc. All of these possibilities create about a 1-in-400,000 chance of finding a 100 percent perfect match between two horses. The two most important and problematic antigens we consider when selecting equine blood donors are Qa and Aa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to what makes humans different, only humans and some related primates have the gene for ABO blood types. Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3494955/" target="_blank">The ABO blood group is a trans-species polymorphism in primates</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ABO histo-blood group, the critical determinant of transfusion incompatibility, was the first genetic polymorphism discovered in humans. Remarkably, ABO antigens are also polymorphic in many other primates, with the same two amino acid changes responsible for A and B specificity in all species sequenced to date. Whether this recurrence of A and B antigens is the result of an ancient polymorphism maintained across species or due to numerous, more recent instances of convergent evolution has been debated for decades, with a current consensus in support of convergent evolution. We show instead that genetic variation data in humans and gibbons as well as in Old World monkeys are inconsistent with a model of convergent evolution and support the hypothesis of an ancient, multiallelic polymorphism of which some alleles are shared by descent among species. These results demonstrate that the A and B blood groups result from a trans-species polymorphism among distantly related species and has remained under balancing selection for tens of millions of years—to date, the only such example in hominoids and Old World monkeys outside of the major histocompatibility complex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arguably the best studied case of apparent convergent evolution is the ABO blood group (A, B, AB, O) (1, 8), the first molecular polymorphism to be characterized in humans. ABO blood groups are defined by the presence or absence of specific antigens that circulate in body fluids and are attached to lipids at the surface of various epithelial and endothelial cell types (notably in the gastrointestinal tract, but also, in hominoids only, on red blood cells) (9, 10). These antigens are associated with complementary immune antibodies produced in the gut after contact with bacteria and viruses carrying A-like and B-like antigens (11). Whereas the biological significance of ABO outside of its role in transfusion is unclear (12), histo-blood antigens in general are known to act as cellular receptors by which pathogens can initiate infections (13–15). Furthermore, variation in ABO has been associated with susceptibility to a number of infectious diseases (reviewed in ref. 16), pointing to a role of ABO in immune response.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is yes, as you can see.
I want to address the broader question here that many commenters are sort of missing. How is blood in itself different between species.
Most of the issues when you think about &quot;typing&quot; is a consequence of learning about the antibodies present on red blood cells. About every cell in your body has two little towers, MHC complexes. These function to let your immune system function, part of their job though involves with the cell nucleus, which rbc do not have. Blood does NOT have these complexes either! Instead there are a variety of very complex &quot;factors&quot; and other functional proteins, carbohydrates and such. This is really important because it is those factors that lead to coagulation upon transmission into a new individual. They clump to other blood cells and clog our veins/arteries interestingly enough for dogs and cats (maybe others I am not sure), most can get a transfusion the first time and be fine. Now this is certainly not best practice but it goes to show the difference in the coagulation cascade between mammals.<br />
Other animals have an incredible amount of diversity for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bovines have 80 blood factors and 11 groups</li>
<li>Porcines have 16 groups</li>
<li>Sheep have 22 factors and 7 groups</li>
<li>Equines have 34 factors and 7 groups</li>
</ol>
<p>In humans you really would not have a scenario were say an individual mates with another one and their baby dies, but in some animals this can happen and it is called neonatal isoerythrolysis and probably a result of domestication and inbreeding. It is more complicated than simple &quot;typing&quot; and has alot to do with the antigens present such as Mik antigen in cats, and unfortunately the prevalence for this is unknown. This is why vets should ALWAYS CROSSMATCH, because typing alone does not really tell the whole story. Unfortunately, most clinicians have limited experience or technical capabilities to do this and opt to type or Ive seen many times no typing be done and infusions given if that is the animals first one.   </p>
<p>Further than that it is important to remember we are talking about mammals. Avian and reptile species have nucleated blood cells which is another whole game. Mammals decided a long time ago to shoot out our nucleus and have increased oxygen carrying as a benefit. bird and reptile haematology is incredibly complicated and honestly I am not sure I have really heard of transfusions being common. Ejection of the nucleus is the rate limiting step for pre rbcs to become erythrocytes (rbcs) and this is not needed in reptiles and birds. So to an extent they have a faster maturation time for blood. Therefore, it has been less common to try transfusions and little research has been done.  We really do not know a lot about other (exotic) species in general and hematology is a complex field to study. Most of the work is going to happen in a zoo, university, or the field. Whereas the common pet/livestock species are more likely candidates  for this research. For every 100 research project at a school I'd say maybe 10 are exotic focused, but this depends upon the school. </p>
<p>Edit: I shouldn't talk about humans I suppose, it is possible for humans to have a similar condition with their offspring but different mechanisms are involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cat breeder here and experienced with non domestic species. Cats have blood groups A, B and more rarely AB. This is very important information for breeders as blood type B cats produce anti A antibodies in colostrum. This means that a blood type B queen (female) bred to a blood type A stud can result in roughly a 50 / 50 split in A and B blood types in the litter. If allowed to suckle in the first 18 to 25 hours of birth the blood type A kittens can lose toes, tips of the tail and eventually die. While some breeds such as the oriental are almost always A, other breeds like the British Shorthair have a very high number of B blood type cats. So testing all breeding cats for blood type is essential. Occasionally breeders may decide the mating of an A stud to B girl is worthwhile, however the breeder must hand rear the kittens for the first 24 hours to prevent ingestion of the high antibody colostrum. A type A queen can nurse both A and B kittens. Blood type AB is separate from the other groups entirely and can nurse either however it is the rarest blood group. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
