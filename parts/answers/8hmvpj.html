		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This subject is controversial. Companies are being sued over RAM pricing... they’re accused of either mis-representing the amount available or intentionally failing to produce as much as people want, to keep prices high.</p>
<p>NAND supply could be affected by similar factors, or it could be technical and market factors. There’s continuing/growing demand for cheap, power efficient storage but the newest 3D NAND tech has been tricky to produce. Meanwhile, phones are being sold with a larger amount of NAND storage. At the same time, desktop/laptop computers are moving away from spinning HDDs for storage, increasing NAND flash use for those devices. This holds true even when storage sizes aren’t increasing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two popular technologies for NAND flash memory.  The price of 2D NAND has been pushed so low that almost nobody can make money manufacturing the parts. Try to buy a 512MB SD card and Amazon will offer you a 2GB one that's cheaper.  Higher densities of 3D NAND make that technology more profitable, and it keeps 2D NAND manufacturers from raising prices.  So, everybody did what seemed like the right thing for them, they closed their 2D plant and invested money in a 3D plant.  Alas, 3D is much harder to make and many 3D plants have low yield rates.  There is simply not enough capacity.  Nobody wants to open up their old 2D plant, because that's not very profitable either.  Everybody is mad because they have suppliers that promised them xGB parts for $y and now can only deliver 1/2 of what you order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have been pretty heavily invested in Micron for the past 18 months and it has be very profitable. I will do my best to explain the current situation with memory.  </p>
<p>A few years ago there were about 10-15 memory makers producing DRAM and NAND.  Micron, Samsung, and Skhynix are pretty much the only companies that make BOTH types of memory.  </p>
<p>The memory producers, in the past, simply over produced memory chips leading to cannibalization of profit margins. The weaker companies could not survive and were simply bought by what is now the big three.  Micron, Samsung, and Skhynix.  Toshiba, Nanya, and Western Digital still make NAND.  Furthermore, in the past, DRAM and FLASH were almost exclusively limited to PC and Phones.  </p>
<p>The past 3 years have seen an unprecedented demand for memory in data centers.  Compounding the memory &quot;tightness&quot;  is demand from Smartphones, AI applications, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, etc.  The remaining companies no longer wish to completely decimate profit margins from over production and are, what appears to be, implementing a much more disciplined approach to production.  Even FURTHER compounding this shortage is the fact that entry into this industry is INSANELY costly.  New memory fabs cost about 5 BILLION dollars and the memory makers can't simply switch over production overnight.  They have to carefully consider where to allocate capital and production.    Making these highly specialized chips is also VERY hard and any problems in the process leads to the complete ruin of the chips.  Micron has had a few problems with this recently and this only makes the supply that much more limited.  </p>
<p>TLDR:  Supply and Demand with the suppliers not wanting to gut their profit margins and making further memory yields very difficult. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>NAND has not been in short supply since mid 2017. NAND prices falling. DRAM holding pricing or rising. DRAM most definitely has been in short supply and demand driven  (increased use in data center, gaming, mobile, SSD). </p>
<p>Currently, NAND pricing expected to fall about 30+% in 2018 (no supply problems), however NAND manufacturers simultaneously lowering their manufacturing costs per bits sold faster, so still making lots of $$.  Why? They are shrinking node sizes and offering more bits of memory on same size wafers through 3D NAND layering and stacking. Costs of Gb or gb much lower as a result and you will soon see greater transition away from Hard Disk Drives as SSD now cost competitive with HDD. The problem with this though is with each new level of stacking, space in the FAB's is lost for more machines and clean space needed</p>
<p>DRAM another story. Only 3 manufacturers (of any real magnitude) left in the biz and they are reaching point where shrinking more bits into same die no longer reaping cost benefits. </p>
<p>Finally, the big 3 (Samsung, Hynix and Micron) are hesitant to spend huge amounts of cash (5+ $billion for a FAB and 2 yrs to bring it on line) only to shoot themselves in foot by flooding market with too much supply, lowers average selling prices and lose money....like past cycless)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As 3D NAND margin is just too good to pass away, companies tend to risk developing it rather than building supply on 2D NAND. But 2D NAND transition to 3D NAND leads to more complex and longer processing time to create. This leads to lower supply, with higher demand from Data Center and Consumer SSDs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
