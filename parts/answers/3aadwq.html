		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Onions form the vegetal foundation in cooking. Cooked onions are rarely noticed directly, but they provide a platform for other flavors to stand on. Without them, most other vegetal flavors would come off as insipid or weak. You can certainly cook without them, but it would be akin to making a soup with water instead of stock.</p>
<p>As far as what type of onions you use, it comes down to the task at hand. If your use is for raw, as in a salad, salsa, or on tacos, you want bright and crisp. For this we use white or red onions. Yellow onions can come off as acrid when raw. When cooking, white onions can come off as weak when paired with much stronger flavors (where yellow would sit happily underneath), and red can provide unwanted color changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what others have said, onions are also flavor sinks.  They will absorb the salt and seasonings when sauteed.  So when they are in a dish and you bite into a sauteed onion you'll get a slightly more concentrated blend of the seasonings that were in there when it was sauteed on top of a bit of sweetness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Professional Chef here: I can't exactly explain the science behind each onion to you a la Alton Brown but I can give you some ideas about how they are used generally. </p>
<p>First, Red onions: In nicer restaurants you will rarely experience these cooked. They tend to have a muddy and or sulfuric flavor once heat is applied to them. They really only have the potential to be sweet when raw so more often than not you will experience them shaved or pickled.</p>
<p>Tip: shave them and soak them in ice water for a few minutes then drain. This will create a crisper, sweeter and milder flavor as to not overpower other foods or your breath. (Great in salads or dressed in vinegar as garnish)</p>
<p>Yellow onions: the work-horse of the kitchen. You will find these in most soups, stews, braises, stir-frys etc. They caramelize nicely without creating &quot;off&quot; flavors and they are the back bone to most stocks and sauces. In my opinion they have the greatest potential to be sweet (when cooked). However, this can very greatly by the variety, size and state of growth.</p>
<p>Tip: If you've never experienced a Vidalia onion in season do yourself a favor and do so! Maui Sweets are pretty good too. These are best used in dishes where onions are going to be at the forefront of a dish. Like french onion soup, an onion tart or when caramelizing onions for things like burgers or sausages.</p>
<p>White Onions: I think these are very underused. At some point people decided that these were too harsh or not sweet enough compared to yellow onions. In my opinion if your making a fresh dish that requires clean and straight forward flavors these are the tool for the job. </p>
<p>Tip: If you find yourself making a dish where the protein is meant to be consumed raw, then chances are a white onion is what you want. ie ceviche, tuna or steak tartare, Mexican seafood cocktail, Hawaiian poke etc.</p>
<p>Tip: Cocktail sauce
1/2 a white onion (fine dice)
1 C Ketchup
2 tbs prepared horse radish
2 tbs Tabasco (or you're favorite brand hot sauce)
2 tsp Worcestershire
zest and juice of one lemon</p>
<p>Green onions: There are some variety of onions that will not form a large bulb and put most of it's growth into a green stalk. Other times, you can buy red or yellow onions that are young (sometimes called spring onions) these tend to have a mild flavor great for grilling. And the green tops (regardless of source) are a great garnish for salads, noodles, stir-frys, casseroles, tacos and soups.</p>
<p>TIP: Save the white and stems of green onions if you're only using the tops for garnish. These bits are traditionally used to flavor Ramen at the last minute and the technique can be applied to any broth based soup. You'll notice a big boost of flavor from something you might otherwise throw away. </p>
<p>That's what I got!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Onions are interesting because they have two competing tastes: bitter/astringent, and sweet. A raw onion is very bitter; as you cook it, it loses its astringency and the sweet flavor comes through. And you can cook it more, so the sweet takes a turn as the sugars caramelize. Slice a few pounds of onions and saute them very low and slow with some salt, and you’ll end up a remarkably small pot of onion jam. If you used yellow onions, especially sweet yellow onions, it’ll be pretty sweet on its own. If you started with red onions, it’ll be more flavorful but will benefit from some honey or the like if it’s for a sandwich. Or instead, make a soup from it.</p>
<p>Red onions are <em>not</em> sweet. Red onions are the most bitter, the most oniony. Whites are little less astringent, and yellow are generally the least astringent. Sweet onions like the Vidalia or the Maui are the sweetest of the yellow onions.</p>
<p>Raw onions can be overwhelming. Raw red onions are a powerful flavor to add to a hot dog or chili or a burger, but there should be other strong spices and flavors lest it taste only like red onion. You can soak onion in water to make it less astringent. Soaking it in vinegar is nice, too. Thinly sliced red onion pickled in vinegar packs a lot of flavor.</p>
<p>Onions are also used as a flavor base. In French cooking, many recipes start with a mirepoix, which is a saute of onions, carrots, and celery. In some long braises, these vegetables all but disappear from being cooked down to nothing. The onion adds a depth to the flavor, the carrots a sweet earthiness, and the celery a bit of green vegetal flavor. In Italian cooking it’s called a soffritto. I’d say the onion is the most important of the three ingredients there. In Cajun cooking, recipes often start with the Holy Trinity -- a saute of onion, bell pepper, and celery (and often garlic and sometimes parsley, and yet it’s still called the Trinity.) In that case I’d say the bell pepper is the most important.</p>
<p>Onion powder used in a spice mix adds depth. Mix paprika and garlic powder, and it’s tasty but not terribly interesting. Add some onion powder and it just tastes richer, not oniony but deeper somehow.</p>
<p>Some people don’t like onions, but does that mean they don’t like raw onions? Red onions? Overcooked onions? If you don’t like onions, leave them out. If you’re not sure, try using a sweeter onion, or cooking it longer, or soaking it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
