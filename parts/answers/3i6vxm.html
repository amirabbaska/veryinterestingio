		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normal correction. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/business/dealbook/chinese-stocks-still-look-overvalued.html?_r=0" target="_blank">It's been wildly overvalued for a while.</a> China's been red-lining their economy for a while, trying to get ahead of their demographic issues, so it's not really a surprise.</p>
<p>Now, what does it <em>mean</em>? Well, a lot of money just went poof, and part of their bubble was driven by margin lending (stocks bought with borrowed money), so that's double poof.</p>
<p>The good news is, most Chinese don't invest heavily in the markets, so it doesn't really hit the average citizen the way the big crash here hit us. Still, a lot of money coming out of the economy will have some ripples. It's going to impact the countries that export to China, somewhat. Probably going to slow the growth of their industry a bit.</p>
<p>Edit: I am aware that the Chinese markets are invested in heavily by individuals. My point is that the vast majority of individuals in China do not invest at all. So the money lost is not spread broadly across the country.</p>
<p><strong>ELI5 EDIT</strong>:</p>
<p>People are telling me this is too complicated. Here it is simple.</p>
<p>Q: WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN CHINA!??!?! A: China's stock market has gone INSANE in the last year, more than doubling. Lot of that was driven by people buying stocks with loaned money (on margin). The US stopped doing this after it kicked off the Great Depression. China is now learning the same lesson. Their market is still up more than 50% from this time last year, even though it's almost lost half it's value this month. They're also showing a lot of crappy economic indicators. This is way scarier than the stock thing, but will play out slowly.</p>
<p>Q: Then why is the US market also tanking? A: The US stock market has been steadily increasing for a LONG time. Too long. It's been overdue for what is known as a &quot;correction&quot;, which is a drop of between 10% and 20% of the market value. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/04/investing/stock-market-correction-overdue/" target="_blank">People have been expecting a correction for a while.</a> </p>
<p>Q: Are we going to die? A: Yes. But not from this. Probably from a heart attack. Totally the most common. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I did this lengthy writeup in [the other ELI5 asked about this] (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3i76wa/eli5_why_are_the_worlds_stock_markets_crashing/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3i76wa/eli5_why_are_the_worlds_stock_markets_crashing/</a>), so I'll put the link there, but in a nutshell China's stock market has been decoupled from reality. The Shanghai Index is owned by ~98% of Chinese nationals and and ~2% of Foreign interests. The market has also been fueld by a debt bubble, which has not helped anything here. Many of the investments (such as the Chinese Trusts) are levered and use all sorts of means to help with borrowing to gain leverage. Now, when margin calls start coming in, people start to sell and the herd follows. That's the way it goes. So what happens is that a great deal of the Chinese investors are going to lose alot of money. This is coupled with the fact that Chinese Manufacturing has it a 77 Month low and has been on the decline since the start of 2H2014. That has had more of a concern because if manufacturing decreases, then it costs more to make stuff, import stuff and and that Chinese consumers are buying less stuff internationally. The market drop is only a signal of the bigger problem (manufacturing decline), since more countries deal with China as a trade partner. The market decline and manufacturing drop will cause markets to drop, and should see a flight to quality through the purchase of government bonds, making it more costly to import things from China. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is the short Mantra,</p>
<p>Definition: Dollar Strength: The amount of dollars it takes to buy another countries currency in an Exchange Market. A strong dollar means that 1 US Dollar buys more foreign currency, a weak dollar buys Less foreign Currency on the Currency exchange Market.</p>
<p>In The United States as well as other countries with their own Currency</p>
<p>A strong dollar/national currency is good for goods being imported into that country, it means less Money from the home country is needed to buy those goods. so imports become cheaper. But on The export side it is bad as it takes more foreign currency to buy products from a country with a stronger currency.</p>
<p>So what this means to the US and other Countries.
With China's propped up economy an economic downturn at high levels like we are seeing now is making the Yuan very weak which means that all countries that showed a strong currency to China's Yuan is now going to reap less profits from Exports to China the second largest world economy.</p>
<p>Depending on how you look at it it is good/bad but it is also sudden which makes the market overreact.</p>
<p>For the US the near future means that Chinese imports are going to get cheaper but that does not mean that savings will be passed to the consumer. It also means that exports to China will slow down. Both have an impact on job growth in the United States, negatively.</p>
<p>Job Growth is real important right now coming  out of a recession and an emerging Market out of recession does not react well to declining Job Growth.</p>
<p>If you want to see what the Yuan is doing and how abrupt it is goto this <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&amp;to=CNY" target="_blank">Chart</a>, On the right side you can change the date range. Change it to 1M for 1 month by clicking on it and see how the US dollar spiked on Aug 10th.</p>
<p>China is bursting their bubble and being the second largest economy it will have impact on other economies.</p>
<p>The US is also at a critical time of an upcoming election where the party in charge after the election will have major impact on how the US reacts to this. This uncertainty is also adding to the mix.</p>
<p>Now for my opinion is that the US needs to heavily address income inequality in our society to lessen world impacts like what China is doing. We are at a critical juncture and we have too much corporate influence in our politics. The US People have a chance to vote right in the upcoming elections and those candidates that talk about the economy and address it are the better candidates to consider. Those that are working off of more emotional issues like, Gay Rights, Abortion and to an extent immigration and Racial inequality are dangerous, They are playing to a voters emotions while ignoring economic factors that if the government can take a strong stand on the economics then the emotional issues will be easier to solve. Especially the racial inequality to move forward we have to concentrate on economics because anything else is a bandage and will not solve the problem in the long and even short run. All it will do is get the wrong person elected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, just a selfish question about how this will effect me.</p>
<p>I'm 25, no investments what-so-ever, about to close on a foreclosed house that I got for a sweet deal (86k, valued at 128 prior to foreclosure).  How worried should I be and should I reconsider getting said house?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the responses all.  You've (mostly) convinced me that everything is 'ok' at the moment.  Appreciate it!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
