<p>The &quot;slipperiness&quot; of ice is actually a variation on hydroplaning. Essentially, you melt the outermost layer of ice, and your shoe/skate slides around on that now-fluid water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>all the &quot;pressure melts a thin layer of water&quot; comments are wrong.</p>
<p><em>It used to be thought ... that the reason skaters can glide gracefully across the ice is because the pressure they exert on the sharp blades creates a thin layer of liquid on top of the ice... More recent research has shown, though, that this property isn't why skaters can slide on the ice... It turns out that at the very surface of the ice, water molecules exist in a state somewhere between a pure liquid and a pure solid. It's not exactly water -- but it's like water. The atoms in this layer are 100,000 times more mobile than the atoms [deeper] in the ice, but they're still 25 times less mobile than atoms in water. So it's like proto-water, and that's what we're really skimming on.</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see much misinformation here.</p>
<p>Many cite regelation as cause for the slippery nature of ice. Regelation is the phenomenon that the melting point of ice rises with pressure. Many people believe this is what melts the water under ice skates or even under a shoe when stepping on ice. Doing the calculations will show that the effect even slim ice skates have on the melting point is negligible.</p>
<p>Ice is slippery due to a layer of liquid water on the surface. This liquid layer may be better described as loosely bound water molecules. In an ice crystal water molecules inhabit fixed spots. They form a structure in which every molecule is surrounded by a number of other molecules. The interaction between the molecules keeps them in place. The molecules that happen to be on the surface however are only surrounded by half as many molecules than the molecules in the bulk. Thus they are just loosely bound to the surface and in a quasi liquid state.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually something we believe to be one of the first ways we and our ancestors hunted game. We have a huge advantage over almost all other animals: Skin surface area. This makes us the most capable of venting our body than literally every other animal. Not only that, but our bipedal locomotion makes us extremely efficient at moving. Compared to a chimpanzee, we use less than 1/3 the calories that the chimp does to move from point A to B, even if they are walking on two feet.
Due to these adaptation, we and our ancestors were able to literally chase a gazelle, antelope, etc for 4, 6, even 8 hours. The animal's only way to effectively cool itself down is by resting in shade. When they try, the hunter scares the animal out. They chase the animal until it literally cannot continue, after which they simply walk up and kill it. This is known as persistence hunting. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting</a>
There are actually even tribes in Africa that still practice this method of hunting today! It's quite interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
