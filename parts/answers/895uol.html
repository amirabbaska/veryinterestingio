		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you ignore the metaphysical (spirit, soul, etc.) and assume that the brain is a biological machine, then there are basically two arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The human brain is (in some ways, at least) much more powerful than the computers we can build and/or it runs much better image-recognition software than we can write.</p>
</li>
<li>When you learn to recognize a new object, you aren't really starting from scratch - you're building on your past experience of learning to recognize many different things and then actually recognizing them many times.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because a human isn't really seeing a new object once: they've been doing the relevant training since birth. The theory of neural networks essentially involves training the computer like a baby is &quot;trained&quot; by its environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you show a 1 month old infant an image, that child will not, necessarily, be able to identify what it is or pick out similar objects. That child has received thousands of images. It takes millions and millions of images and really good software in the brain to do this.</p>
<p>If you are a 20 year old person, and you've been awake 75% of the time and using your vision constantly while awake, and you are capturing 30 fps for that entire time, you've processed over 470 billion images.</p>
<p>Oh and it's taken at least half a million years to write the software that processes those images. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that I'm not seeing in the other responses is that we, as humans, have context. We already have a general understanding of everything else we see, so if I show you a picture with a fancy new gizmo on a table in a room with a couch and some pictures, I already have context for what each of those things are and can rationalize that the 'pixels' that make up the new object are what makes up the new object. When training a computer, we start from basically scratch, so with only that singular image the computer would have no way of knowing what pixels are relevant and what ones aren't.</p>
<p>Building on this, human brains are great at <em>understanding</em>. We can see a 2D picture and imagine what the 3D object would look like, and thus guess what it would look like at any angle. Computers, on the other hand, are just taught to look for patterns. Take, for example, a coffee cup. If you put it in front of a human so that the handle is sideways, and then put it in front so that the handle points up, that human has enough context and worldly knowledge to understand that you have rotated it. A computer would just see a particular pattern of pixels, and then a different pattern of pixels (bear in mind we might not teach it directly about rotation or anything because those are hard concepts to quantify mathematically when talking about pixels). Over enough images it might understand that, say, a block of white pixels with a half-ring next to it is the pattern it is looking for, but it essentially has to guess that with no prior knowledge of anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
