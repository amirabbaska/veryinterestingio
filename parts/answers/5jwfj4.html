		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inbreeding is just as much of a problem for animals. So much so that many species have evolved methods of avoiding it, such as males leaving the areas where they were born while their sisters stay closer to home. In endangered species, where populations may be very small, you often see signs of &quot;inbreeding depression&quot; - lowered survival and reproductive ability due to a lack of genetic diversity.</p>
<p>Inbreeding is also a huge concern for zoos, with their small captive populations. Zoos keep pedigrees for lot of species bred in captivity, so they can avoid breeding related individuals with each other.</p>
<p>You can see the consequences in pets if you think of purebred dogs, for example. Many dog breeds are likely to get specific medical issues, such as hip dysplasia in golden retrievers, due to many generations of inbreeding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The chance for birth defects in inbreeding animals is exactly the same as with humans. It's simply that they do not show as much. Many inbreeding problems are associated with less intelligence or malformity. Now in an animal you seldom will know when one is a little bit less intelligent than another. Also body deformity does not always show so well in animals. There are goats herds in south america where the offspring isn't separated thus inbreeds. There are many goats with 4 horns instead of 2. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>Animal inbreeding is also bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The likelihood of defects from inbreeding is lower than people think. One generation of inbreeding only slightly increases the chances. Regular inbreeding over many generations is what really causes problems</p>
</li>
<li>Animals with birth defects are unlikely to survive and be observed, while most humans can be kept alive</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans, in general, are quite inbred due to some catastrophic event that occurred 75,000 years ago (toba eruption possibly).</p>
<p>If you compared the similarities between people within our own population, to similarities in other species  population, you would find we don't have near the same genetic diversity.</p>
<p>We know this because of mDNA, that is DNA that is only passed down to you by your mother. We can calculate the average rate of genetic mutation (in mDNA) and infer from this that every human on earth has descended from as few as 10000 humans that survived this event. </p>
<p>There's even a mitochondrial &quot;eve&quot; so to speak.</p>
<p>TLDR: Humans are pretty inbred, compared to other species. Inbreeding leads to loss of genetic variation. Loss of genetic variation leads to unbenificial mutations in our DNA propogating. Which is why inbreeding in humans is not the same as in animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is because nature clears out those with major defects pretty quick. Though in Boulder, CO there was a group of deer near the outskirts that was interbreeding for awhile and they started getting goofy, like running into traffic, and also had defects, like one sided antlers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
