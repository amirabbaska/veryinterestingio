		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another factor not mentioned in the comments is that some music is different and dissonant on purpose, not fitting into the rhythm or the harmony of the normal music, making you feel a sense of unease. They feel different and wrong, like it doesn't belong there. This appears in classical music as well, but it's usually used as a passage, with complementary notes played straight after. Meanwhile, using such notes gets you ready for complementary notes that are not going to come, if that makes any sense. It's the heart and soul of horror: suspense. It the same as when in a horror movie a protag explores a dark and creepy place and you expect a jumpscare and never get one, anticipating it more and more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think i read an evolutional theory about this a long time ago. Something about sounds outside of normal background noise, especially high pitched ones, indicating a nearby predator. Sound from the predator itself or from other prey animals fleeing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans love patterns. When the Sayo-Nara scene happens, your mind is primed for the pattern of the song that's been playing for hours up to that point. But instead, the song breaks the &quot;rules&quot; for nice-sounding music that just about every song follows, such as sticking to a key, keeping a consistent timing, and playing in tune. This creates an unsettling effect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
