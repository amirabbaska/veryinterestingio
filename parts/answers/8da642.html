		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ionizing radiation when it comes to photons refers to the ionization of an atom by Compton scattering or the photoelectric effect. These both are the effect of a single photon interacting with an electron and transferring enough kinetic energy to knock the electron out of its atom's potential well. By conservation of energy, this cannot be done by a photon with less kinetic energy than the ionization energy of the atom. The kinetic energy of a photon is only determined by its wavelength, and microwave photons all have energies much less than 1 eV, while ionization energies are on the order of several eV or higher.</p>
<p>Plasma discharge in a microwave oven is different. While plasma is ionized gas, the plasma discharge is not due to single photons ionizing gas atoms, but a high enough electric field causing an arc to form. This is easier to understand in the case of metal in a microwave, the changing electric field causes different parts of the metal to be at different voltages and when that difference is enough the air between them breaks down and arcs, allowing current to flow. Something similar happens with the cut grape, I don't know exactly why but something about the separated halves and the small connection between them allows the two halves to build up a potential difference which results in a discharge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer your secondary question: No. Non-ionizing radiation might be able to break very, very weak bonds, but is called non-ionizing because for most organic compounds, things we actually care about, it can't. What it can do, however, is generate electrical flow, due to Photons being electromagnetic carrier particles, and the cumulative electrical flow caused by non-ionizing radiation in a system can result in secondary ionization by another mechanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
