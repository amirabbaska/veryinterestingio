		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why don't kids like to transition from one thing to anything is what you mean, 1) Kids don't want to get in shower 2) kids don't want to get out of shower 3) Kids don't want to go to sleep 4) Kids don't want to wake up.</p>
<p>It's all never ending, try to enjoy what you think you dislike now because you will surely miss it all once it's over.</p>
<p>I really think you need to be a grand parent to get the most enjoyment out of kids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way.</p>
<p>Humans are programmed to survive and though we do like to experience new things, showers are both loud and wet. Neither of which are something people want to experience.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you started your kids out in the bath? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recall this from my days as a kid.  Showers made a lot of noise and I hated the showerhead because I  have trypophobia (fear of holes).   Plus I was really tiny then, so the showerhead looked like it was looming over me like some monster.  </p>
<p>As to why I didn't want to leave?  Well, once I was inside, I wanted to play with the water and not do my homework.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to my 10 year old, who hates showers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before getting in the shower he's all nice, warm, clothed, and happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stripping this clothes off makes him cold, and embarrassed so he hates doing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once he's in the shower he warms back up again due to the warm water and it feels nice.</p>
</li>
<li>However once he's all warm and nice in the shower, turning the water off makes him EVEN COLDER and he hates that the most.</li>
