		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>911 gets special consideration by the carriers due to FCC regulations.  This means a couple of unique things for 911 calls.  </p>
<p>First, even if the phone does not have a service plan attached to it, it can still call 911.  No service/no bill, doesn't matter, your phone is still allowed to make 911 calls.  Keep in mind though, that since your no-service phone doesn't have a phone number attached to it, if you get disconnected the 911 operator cannot call you back. </p>
<p>Second, no bars doesn't necessarily mean you can't call 911.  For most numbers your phone has a minimum threshold of signal required for it to even attempt to make a call.  If the signal is less than what would represent 1 bar on the phone's display, the phone won't try a call because it knows that it's likely to fail/cause a bad experience for you.  For 911 though that rule does not apply.  Your phone could have 1 of 10th of 1 bar worth of signal, and it will still try and call 911. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the carrier is like a bouncer at a club. they could let you through, but they wont unless you paid or have a contract and an according sim card. you dont NEED the sim card to make a call or get internet. but in our current system, the carriers stop you from using calls/internet without one.
the hardware required to make calls/get internet is already in the phone. the sim card is just the pay card to access that.</p>
<p>now the 911 call will just skip all that and directly connect to the services. afaik every carrier has to agree to let 911 calls through from anyone without charging or authentication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A completely deactivated phone still has the antenna and parts inside it necessary to talk to a cell tower.  When the phone talks to the cell tower, it provides its credentials, and the tower authenticates that your phone should be allowed to make calls.  This is checked when you try to make a phone call.</p>
<p>When you call 911, the tower sees that you are trying to call 911, so it skips the part where you have to authenticate your phone and are just let through to the 911 system. (or, rather, allows the call to happen, but it will still grab what information it can to identify you- which could become relevant they needed to trace you back- say if the call disconnected, or if you were making a prank call)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A phone with no SIM card can still connect to any compatible network's tower, but the tower will deny any communication.   However, 911 calls are privileged: they will be connected through any available compatible tower, without authentication, and may have priority over other traffic on the network.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only thing preventing a deactivated phone from making a call is software, either on your end inside the phone or on the carrier's end in the network servers. The hardware is always there. Even actions like turning off the Wi-Fi radio or mobile data on an active device are all software commands that either tell the various hardware pieces to power down and not send data to the processor, or tell the processor to ignore whatever data is being sent to it from said hardware. Samsung forced a software update that locked out and bricked the Note 7s that people didn't want to turn in, preventing them from being used.</p>
<p>The always-on 911 feature is just software. If certain conditions are met, e.g. the phone is locked but you perform the correct sequence of actions to place a 911 call from the lock screen, the software will unlock and open whatever hardware has been deemed necessary to complete that call. This includes communicating back to the carrier's servers that the lock-screen-911 feature has been activated and the call must be allowed to pass through. The server will then make the necessary changes and connect the call.</p>
<p>If the signal is weak, it may be possible to reallocate power to certain hardware and/or software resources to try and internally boost that signal so the call can still be made. Since this extra power boost would drain the battery faster and is not necessary for the vast majority of regular calls made, it would not be made available outside of the 911-call-on-a-locked-phone scenario. But this would only work if there was a signal to boost in the first place. No signal means no call.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
