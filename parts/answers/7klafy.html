		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not all just solely melatonin and nothing else. As a second example, adenosine builds up in the brain that also causes sleepiness. Interestingly, this is the neurotransmitter that Caffeine mimics in the brain, binding to adenosine receptors in place of the adenosine. However the caffeine doesn’t cause the same slowing of the nervous system that adenosine does, hence its stimulant properties and keeping people from feeling the tiredness affects. Many other vitamins and minerals such as Iron and B vitamins also have a role in the feelings of tiredness. Melatonin may be the stand-out, but it’s not the only factor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Melatonin in your body breaks down throughout the day while exposed to light and stops breaking down when not exposed to light anymore, thus making you tired. This is why screens can mess with your circadian rhythm (they emit light)
If you often feel tired throughout the day, you could be lacking iron which is one of the components for the metalloprotein Haemoglobin which transports oxygen throughout your body</p>
<p>Edit: I know that alot of many other factors are involved in sleep (adonosine, tempreature etc etc) but melatonin plays one of the more major roles. Obviously this is simplied but I'm no professor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of misinformation on this thread. </p>
<p>Sleepiness at night is a synergistic combination of four factors: (1) buildup of adenosine, which rises throughout the day and dissipates as slow wave sleep is obtained; (2) reduction in circadian alerting signals, which peak hours before bedtime and back off substantially throughout the night; (3) melatonin, which builds in concentration 60-120 minutes prior to typical bedtime and exerts a <em>mild</em> sleep-inducing (hypnotic) effect; and (4) temperature, which falls around bedtime and is thought by some to 'gate' entry into sleep (think about how hard it is to fall asleep with cold feet -- research shows the relationship between our core and distal (extremity) temperature maps closely onto sleepiness. </p>
<p>And please look into evidence-based interventions like CBT-I instead of relying on Vitamin D or melatonin to treat insomnia. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short version: Melatonin increases during the day. The more it builds up, the sleepier you get. Melatonin production is also influenced by sunlight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
