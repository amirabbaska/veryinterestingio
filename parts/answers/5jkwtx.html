		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is there such a disparity of antimatter and matter in our observable universe?</p>
<p>I realize this is difficult to answer with our current knowledge, so allow me to inspire other indirect answers. Is it a problem with our observation? Are the properties of a purely anti-matter systems different than purely matter systems? Do we know of any places in the universe that may resemble our matter-composed systems but in anti-matter systems, considering that annihilation would wipe out any somewhat homoginous regions?</p>
<p>Also, big thanks to the mods for this thread. This news is really eye-opening to me, as I had traditionally thought of anti-matter as particularly exotic in occurrence and behavior. Seems the latter isn't so true.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
