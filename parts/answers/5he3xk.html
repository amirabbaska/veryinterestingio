		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IANABiologist, but from what I understand there are two kinds of muscles. </p>
<p>Slow twitch muscle is what we have a lot of.</p>
<p>And fast twitch muscle is what, like, chimps and gorillas are made out of.</p>
<p>And pound for pound fast twitch muscle is a <em>hell</em> of a lot stronger than slow twitch. </p>
<p>But slow twitch is capable of far, far more fine control. It's the reason we can type and write and manipulate small objects with a lot of precision. A Chimp can tear your arm off because his fast twitch muscles have a lot of power, but he struggles to manipulate small fine objects. You, on the other hand, can type like nobodies business but you would have to lawyer up, hit the gym, and delete face book for a long time before you could tear anything off of anyone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you're talking about other primates such as chimpanzees and Gorillas its a matter of motor control. Essentially in primates their muscles are generally all or nothing responses allowing all muscle fibres to be activated at once. In humans we instead lost the ability to use all muscle fibres at once and instead replaced it with fine control. This means we're much better at delicate things such as making tools and performing intricate tasks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being strong enough to do one-arm pull-ups is really great if you do a lot of climbing. But humans went from climbing in trees to long-distance running and carring all those climbing muscles around was a bit of a waste so we ditched them. Many animals are stronger than humans but no animal can outrun us for long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The attachment points of muscles and the lengths of bones play a big role.</p>
<p>Short bones with muscular insertions farther from the joint = amplified muscular force.</p>
<p>Greater quantities of fast twitch fibers can play a role. Fast twitch = big power output in short amount of time.</p>
<p>Greater cross-sectional area (girth) of the actual muscle is another factor which can contribute</p>
<p>Average female Neanderthals would beat pro arm wrestlers due to factors like these.</p>
<p>Shortish bones with girthy fast twitch muscles pulling a bit farther from the joint = strong af</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic answer is because we (and they) evolved that way.  Remember the evolution starts as something random.</p>
<p>Take a bird.  One day a bird is born with a longer beak.  This longer beak allows the bird to reach deeper into the ground for food.  Over time that bird has kids and they have a longer beak.  Then their kids have a long beak.  Eventually there is a drought and there are no worm to be found near the surface of the ground.  Only birds with long beaks can get food.  So the short beaked birds die and the long beaked birds survive.</p>
<p>Something similar happened with humans a long time ago.  Instead of evolving to be stronger or hairier we evolved to be smarter.  Being smarter meant we don't need brute strength to survive.  Instead of being strong or fast or having claws we learned how to make spears.  Instead of growing longer hair or fur we learned to make clothes.  So strength, agility, or other features weren't necessary.</p>
<p>Other animals didn't evolve to be smarter.  They evolved in a different way to survive.  Dogs evolved for speed and agility.  They also evolved to have fangs, claws, and fur.  This allows them to survive in the cold and hunt prey.</p>
<p>Apes and monkeys took a different path than us.  They didn't evolve to be very smart.  They evolved to have more strength and less brains.  This allowed them to survive challenges that they faced.</p>
<p>Very few animals that are smaller than humans are actually stronger.  Some are, such as apes or monkeys.  Physically this can be explained by their physiology, or how their body is made up.  They contain a different ratio of kinds of muscles that allow them to &quot;burst&quot; strength better (but at the cost of being able to be strong for long).  Their muscles also attach to their bones differently, giving them more strength at the cost of fine muscle control.  Other animals, such as dogs, are not stronger than humans.  They can appear that way as when they're trying to do something that they're good at.  Consider how much a human can carry compared to the animal in question.  Humans can carry over their body weight, if properly attached to themselves, for quite a long time.  Other animals will struggle.</p>
<p>TLDR: Humans evolved for intelligence rather than raw physical capabilities.  We also evolved for fine muscle control and stamina over brute strength.  Very few smaller animals are stronger than humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
