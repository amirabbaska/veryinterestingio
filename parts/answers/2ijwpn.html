		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gallium nitride (GaN), which is the material used to create blue LEDs, is hard to grow. In order to make an LED you need to make a P-N junction, meaning a layer of p-type material (positively doped) on top of n-type material (negatively-doped). &quot;Doping&quot; a material is the process of changing the carrier concentration (number of electrons or holes) and this can be done by adding other elements with a different charge state, such as silicon (adds an electron) or magnesium (takes an electron). Unfortunately, adding these &quot;dopants&quot; introduces defects into the host material. Defects are bad and GaN is very sensitive to certain types of defects. Nakamura and others won the Nobel for figuring out how to grown GaN and effectively dope it p and n-type such that the material was still highly-crystalline and thus had excellent optical properties.</p>
<p>tl,dr: crystals are good for LEDs. blue LED crystals were hard to grow since they are more sensitive to defects in the material.</p>

<p>&quot;Inside an LED, current is applied to a sandwich of semiconductor materials, which emit a particular wavelength of light depending on the chemical make-up of those materials.</p>
<p>Gallium nitride was the key ingredient used by the Nobel laureates in their ground-breaking blue LEDs. Growing big enough crystals of this compound was the stumbling block that stopped many other researchers - but Profs Akasaki and Amano, working at Nagoya University in Japan, managed to grow them in 1986 on a specially-designed scaffold made partly from sapphire.</p>
<p>Four years later Prof Nakamura made a similar breakthrough, while he was working at the chemical company Nichia. Instead of a special substrate, he used a clever manipulation of temperature to boost the growth of the all-important crystals.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light given off by a solid state device is individual photons that correspond to an energy gap. The energy gap is the 'height' that the electron falls into a hole in the emmissive layer of an LED.  </p>
<p>Blue photons have a higher energy than red or green photons. This means that you have to have a large hole for an electron to drop into. The problem lies with designing a material that the electron will drop the energy difference in a single move, rather than 2 smaller drops (which might make 2 * red photons for example).   </p>
<p>To get a pure colour, you also must reliably get the same energy difference consistently.  </p>
<p>Caveat: I don't know the fine details of this beyond this point, and I haven't formally studied condensed matter,  so a lot of this is educated speculation based on what I do understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing in this thread so far has addressed the real issues that were holding back blue LED development. I study metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) which is the technique used to grow the crystal films for LED devices. The early red and yellow LEDs were made from gallium arsenide and indium phosphide and other related alloys. For these materials, the precursors used to grow the crystals decompose at around 600 degrees Celsius, so the reactors were developed for this growth regime. To make blue light, you need a material with a wider bandgap. While gallium nitride was known to be promising for blue and violet emission, it was not possible to grow gallium nitride films in the existing reactors because ammonia (the nitrogen precursor for GaN) decomposes at significantly higher temperatures (around 900-1200C) so devices needed to be grown closer to those temperatures. It turns out, you can't just crank the old reactors up because the design was such that there would be significant detrimental reactions in the chamber at these temps that lead to poor quality films (or none at all). Dr. Nakamura developed a novel reactor design that got around these problems and was able to grow good quality films in around 1993. </p>
<p>The second problem with the nitride system in the early days was finding a suitable acceptor dopant. LEDs need electrons and holes available to recombine to produce light, and holes are made available by adding some dopant that has less electrons than gallium. For a long time, researchers found that while they could get some dopant atoms into the film, holes were not made available for some reason... It was later discovered that hydrogen present in the growth system passivates the Mg acceptor atoms, and the films must be annealed in a hydrogen-free environment to remove the hydrogen and make the holes available.</p>
<p>TLDR: The reactor design had to be modified significantly to grow gallium nitride, and it took a long time to figure out how to effectively p-dope the material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If memory serves (IANAPhysicist), the biggest issue in creating blue LEDs was finding a way to grow large enough gallium nitride crystals that were high enough purity, then finding a method to successfully create a p-type layer. Early efforts to grow GaN required growth on a sapphire, followed by the displacement of hydrogen using a laser. Eventually, more efficient methods were discovered for growing the GaN crystals, which led to mass production of blue LEDs.</p>
<p>Ah, looks like the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2014/popular-physicsprize2014.pdf" target="_blank">info</a>(PDF) released by the NobelPrize.org backs me up.</p>
<p>Fun experiment time: To help grasp bandgaps and LED color, I highly recommend looking into <a href="http://ap.smu.ca/demos/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=181&amp;Itemid=78" target="_blank">this experiment</a>, involving the shifting of LED colors using temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
