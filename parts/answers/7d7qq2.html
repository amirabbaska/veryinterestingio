		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The interactions among Helium atoms are too weak, at atmospheric pressure, to condense Helium to a solid even at absolute zero. Note that, at absolute zero, the atoms still possess a positive amount of kinetic energy. (I.e. they do not slow down to zero speed at zero Kelvin.) An increase in pressure is required to freeze Helium.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Helium does solidify at 0 K, just not at atmospheric pressure. All other gases does solidify at 0 K in atmospheric pressure though, but the interatomic forces between helium atoms are weaker than between other gas atoms.</p>
<p>If you look at <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/8725/phase_diagram.png?revision=1&amp;size=bestfit&amp;width=691&amp;height=451" target="_blank">this phase diagram</a> as an example. For all gases exakt helium the sublimation line would cross the pressure axis below 1 atm, while heliums sublimation line cross the pressure axis above 1 atm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually quite a complicated question which requires a strong knowledge of quantum mechanics to understand. </p>
<p>Typically the answer of why anything hasn't frozen by a certain temperature,  is the entropy drop in the system from becoming solid is not balanced by the entropy increase to the surroundings due to the enthalpy  (energy from interactions between the atoms in the new configuration) of the transition. </p>
<p>With helium it comes down to the energy cost of being localised to a position in quantum mechanics.   In liquid helium near 0k the wavefunction of each helium atom are larger than the spacing between the atoms,  giving a lower energy state. While being in a solid phase could slightly increase the interactions out would force more localisation and actually be a higher energy state. Eventually with enough pressure this stops being the case and freezing is possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
