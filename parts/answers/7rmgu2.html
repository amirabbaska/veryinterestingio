		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has some advantages over solid fuel rod designs. Like, you can make the reactor almost instantly stop by diverting the fluid flow to a holding tank, It allows continuous reprocessing of the fuel while in operation, You have a ready made coolant/heat transfer system. There are others. But being molten salt, presents some engineering challenges. There were similar designs for uranium, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_homogeneous_reactor" target="_blank">solution reactors</a>.</p>
<p>Thorium is being looked at because of a few reasons. One, thorium is much more plentiful than uranium. Two, you don't have to enrich the fuel. Three, the thorium cycle is less amiable to diversion for nuclear weapons and would be more obvious if it was diverted. Four, it can be used as a &quot;garbage disposal&quot; for left over plutonium from decommissioned nuclear weapons. One down side with thorium is that they are not self starting. You need a source of neutrons to start them. That is where the disposal of plutonium comes in. You can use plutonium to &quot;jump start&quot; the reactor. Once started, they can continue on just thorium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that the three separate ideas of using molten salt as a coolant, of using liquid fuel, and of using thorium instead of uranium are distinct.</p>
<p>Each of the ideas can be taken separately e.g. you could advocate a thorium, solid fuel, water-cooled reactor which would be an improvement on existing Gen 3 designs in terms of nuclear proliferation. </p>
<p>The reason why MSRs are so synonymous with being liquid fuelled and with thorium is that that particular set of three ideas leads to a design that nuclear energy proponents can put forward as a gold-plated nuclear plant design that has minimal drawbacks. It is certainly easier than having three separate nuclear proponent groups: a &quot;liquid fuel&quot; group, a &quot;thorium&quot; group, and a &quot;molten metal/salt coolant&quot; group, and their opponents will find it harder to find drawbacks to the whole idea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
