		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The energy comes from nuclear fusion in the core, primarily the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton%E2%80%93proton_chain_reaction" target="_blank">proton-proton chain reaction</a>. If you look at the first figure, you'll see the overall reaction is six protons (hydrogen nuclei) producing a helium nucleus, two output protons (that go back into the p-p chain), some positrons and neutrinos (for the proton-&gt;neutron conversion), and some gamma rays (energy/light). Some amount of mass energy is released in the other products while some amount is released from the difference in the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html" target="_blank">binding energy</a> of the more complex nuclei.</p>
<p>Phil Plait of <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/07/14/solar_wind_versus_fusion_how_does_the_sun_lose_mass.html" target="_blank">Bad Astronomy</a> already worked out the calculation for whether the solar wind or nuclear fusion causes more mass loss in the Sun. Apparently fusion wins out &quot;by about a factor of two or three&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This has nothing to do with the weight (mass) of electrons, batteries simply move them from anode to cathode and back again.

<p>In fusion reactions such as occur in stellar cores, the mass-energy of the newly-created nuclei is some amount smaller than the total mass-energy of the nuclei that went into its creation.  The energy released by the fusion reaction, that is &quot;lost&quot; by the resulting heavier nuclei, creates outward pressure that balances the inward force of gravity and maintains the stability of the star.</p>
<p>Once a given photon released in a fusion event reaches the surface (or &quot;photosphere&quot;) of the star - which can take ages due to how dense the stellar interior is - it will proceed straightly out as a ray of light (electromagnetic wave).</p>
<p>Unless mass is being dumped into them in early life by a protoplanetary disk or in later life by a stellar companion, stars are constantly losing net mass-energy due to nucleosynthesis in their cores and subsequent photon emission.  However, that doesn't mean they're shrinking.</p>
<p>Stars will tend to bloat and expand as their inner cores fill with denser nuclei, forcing the domain in which lighter elements are fused further from the center and heating up larger and larger radii of the star.  This makes the star less dense and cooler on the surface, and is how most stars will experience old age before dying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bit late to the party, but I'll add my answer to this question from an earlier time this question was asked:</p>
<p>The Sun is a big ball of plasma, within it's core hydrogen is fused into helium. This process releases a small amount of energy, approximately 0.7% of the original mass of the hydrogen is converted to energy.</p>
<p>In the Sun 620 million tons of hydrogen is fused every second.</p>
<p>0.7% of 620 million tons is 4.34 million tons.</p>
<p>So every second, the Sun is losing 4.34 million tons of mass.</p>
<p>That is a lot, approximately one Khafre pyramid every second (Khafre is the second largest pyramid in Giza, after Khufus).</p>
<p>Compared to the Suns mass though, it is nothing. The Suns mass equates to about 2 octillion tons, or 2 billion billion billion tons.</p>
<p>4.34 million tons / 2 octillion tons = 0.0000000000000000002% of the Suns mass each second or 0.0000000127% since year 0.</p>
<p>To put this into perspective. There has been 63,557,006,400 seconds since year 0.</p>
<p>Khafres pyramid is 215 meters on its side, which equates to 46,225 m^2.</p>
<p>Earth has a land area of 1.491*10^14 m^2.</p>
<p>46,225 m^2 <em> 63,557,006,400 = 2.983 </em> 10^15 m^2</p>
<p>2.983 <em> 10^15 m^2 / 1.491</em>10^14 m^2 = 20.01</p>
<p>So thats 20 layers of pyramids on all the land mass on Earth.. Still only 0.0000000127% of the Suns mass.</p>
<p>NOTE: I know there is no year 0, i did not think of this when I wrote the post originally. I'm sorry or whatevs. Peace.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
