		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're taking your calculus test when suddenly and inexplicably, you're covered in spiders.  They're crawling into your sleeves, they're in your hair, they're brushing against your eyelashes, there's a leg in your mouth. You can feel a thousand little legs working their way across your skin.</p>
<p>But you have to focus on your test.  You're expected to do just as well as the people who were not covered in spiders.</p>
<p>Imagine if every time you leave the house, there's a wasp there waiting for you.  As soon as you step outside he starts to harass you.  He buzzes around your head.  You cannot escape it.  You run but it just follows you, landing on the side of your neck or on your cheek every now and again.  You're expected to ignore this wasp and carry about your business as if it isn't there.  Maybe you'd be better off just staying inside where the wasp doesn't bother you.</p>
<p>Spiders and wasps induce anxiety in perfectly normal people.  For some people, the exact same feelings are induced by harmless things or even nothing at all. It's distracting.  It's stressful. It's exhausting.  And it absolutely will have an impact on your ability to focus and succeed.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Woo hoo! I've been gilded! Thank you!  I hope I've helped someone get a little more insight into what someone they love is dealing with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety affects everyone differently, but for me it's a plague of the what if's. My biggest fear is looking out of place in society or being unprepared for something. So say, for example, I need to drive to the store. What if I forget my wallet? What if I lock my keys in the car? What if I get the wrong items? What if I get in a car accident on the way? What if I forgot my phone? What if my car broke down on the side of the road? What if I'm mugged? All the bad things that could happen, no matter how plausible, pile up and start to look like reality, until going to the store seems like a massive challenge. At night, I can't sleep because I'm running over everything I said or did during the day and thinking about all the bad things that could result from them. It becomes easier to isolate yourself, and avoid any situation that could cause consequences, including work. Not to mention the panic attacks- that fear that can grip you at any time and make you unable to breathe, make your heart rate go up. A full-blown panic attack is comparable to the terror of leaning over the edge of a cliff. When you get one it's hard to do anything but curl up on the floor and wait for it to pass. Anxiety is a debilitating illness. Please be kind and understanding to anyone struggling with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the most frustrating things about having anxiety is that we fully recognize how illogical it is to be afraid to go to the store to buy some milk, or meet a friend for coffee, or call and make a doctor's appointment, etc. But despite knowing that logically things will most likely be fine, it doesn't stop us from going into fight or flight mode. So performing everyday tasks can be like having to walk through a lion's den full of very hungry lions while trying to convince yourself that the lion's aren't going to eat you. Some days you can do it, and some days the lion's scare you away and you can't leave your house, or your bedroom. </p>
<p>Anytime I'm on the subway and the lights flicker for a second, or the train stops momentarily in the tunnel, I immediately start to panic thinking &quot;THIS IS GOING TO TURN INTO THE MOVIE 'DAYLIGHT' STARRING SYLVESTER STALLONE!!&quot; </p>
<p>Also anxiety is usually comorbid with other mental illnesses like depression, ADD/ADHD, and OCD. So it's likely that someone with anxiety is dealing with more than just anxiety (which on it's own makes life very difficult). I promise you it's a package deal that is WAY worse than any of your cable provider's bundle plans. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anxiety is a little like your body's immune system.</p>
<p>When you have an allergy it's sort of like your immune system has decided something boring (dust, cat spit, Mitch McConnell's face) is actually a dangerous invading force and responds as such.</p>
<p>Anxiety is your brain's normal response to dangerous situations. Sometimes, though, your brain has decided something boring (driving, social interaction, Mitch McConnell's face) is actually something dangerous and responds with a wonderful cascade of stress hormones.</p>
<p>Just like with allergies, different people's anxieties can be more or less severe. While I can usually muddle my way through a stressful social encounter without freaking out too much, some people will literally hyperventilate at the thought of talking to another person. No fun!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>my anxiety leans more towards the physical effects. When it gets bad I have a weird out of body feeling, I get light-headed and very dizzy, my vision becomes blurred and I'm hyper-aware of my heartbeat. My throat feels like it swells up and I have a hard time swallowing. Its very bad when it happens when I'm driving, idk if its over stimulation or what, but sometimes I have to pull over and gather myself. Just the other day I was sitting on the couch just fine, and out of nowhere a rush of adrenaline surged through my body and my heart began pumping very hard and fast as I fixated more and more on the weird sensations going through me. I have been living with this since I was a kid, and can control it farely well, but at times it gets out of control and I have to remove myself from the room at times. This can be very hard to live with at times because for me it happens randomly out of the blue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
