		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that when fabric dries slowly and without being disturbed, the fibers that make it up can slowly arrange into large ordered domains. These domains in turn will make the fabric more rigid locally, which in turn will make it feel coarser and stiffer. This effect can be made worse if the water is hard since the minerals in the water can strengthen the arrangement of the fibers. </p>

<p>If you want a more detailed answer you have to go back to the microscopic structure of the fabric. In this case let's look at cotton. Cotton is mostly made up of a messy array of cellulose fibers that look <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Yp1qM24.jpg" target="_blank">something like this</a>. These fibers can relatively slip past each other to some extent, which is why initially the fabric can feel soft. But when you immerse the fabric in water these chains will swell. The water will tend to break up the hydrogen bonds between the fibers, allowing them to move even more freely. In more technical term we say that water acts as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticizer" target="_blank">plasticizer.</a> It's largely for this reason, for example that you want to add water when ironing clothes. </p>
<p>Now as the water dries the polymer fibers will relax again by forming hydrogen bonds to each other. But now because they can move so freely when wet they can order themselves in larger domains. These ordered domains in turn make it harder to deform the fabric locally. As a result the material will feel rough on the surface and it will be stiffer as well. As I mentioned earlier this effect can be exacerbated if the water if very rich in minerals (hard) as the inorganic species can stabilize these local domains even more. </p>
<p>Of course these changes also occur to some degree when you dry clothes in a dryer. However if the dryer makes the clothes tumble as they dry, it reduces the chance for larger ordered domains to form, so the effect is usually not quite as bad. On the other hand on a clothesline you allow the water to dry more slowly and the fabric stays still, which greatly helps the fibers arrange thesmselves locally. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
