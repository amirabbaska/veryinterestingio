		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the time between firing and arriving the moon has moved on the order of a few arc seconds. Even in good 'Still&quot; air that about the size of atmospheric effects on the beam. Given all this the odds are better you win the power ball than a given photon makes the round trip. But hey we got quitillions of photons</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
