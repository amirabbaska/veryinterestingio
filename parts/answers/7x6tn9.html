		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CG is not required even today to do that. The effect can be achieved entirely via VFX techniques.</p>
<p>FYI: VFX these days typically involve a computer but just because something uses a computer does not mean it is &quot;CGI&quot;. &quot;CG&quot; is just one tool in creating modern VFX.</p>
<p>The effect can be achieved this way (how I'd do it on a low budget in comparison with doing it in the 80s) explained in a way that hopefully the average person can understand:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Shoot the scene normally with the Predator/actor in the shot (limit camera movement or make sure the camera is static to make things easier).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shoot the exact same shot but without the actor so you have footage of the background behind it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rotoscope the actor (essentially &quot;trace&quot; and create a selection of the character for the entire shot. OR chroma key the actor (basically a less manual method of creating a selection) if they wore a colored suit. This will create what is known as a &quot;matte&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>In the editing or VFX software use the matte as a stencil so that everything inside it is footage of the background behind the actor. Actor is gone. To get that repeating edge effect you could just nudge the edges of a duplicate of the footage multiple times with each duplicate offset by a certain number of pixels. You can then arrange that however you want and however many times you want. I would probably do it for the left, right, top, and bottom to give a more dimensional (3D) look. This entire effect will be contained within the shape of the matte, which is basically the shape of the actor so it looks like it is &quot;invisible&quot; or using the &quot;optic camo&quot; or whatever you wanna call it.</li>
