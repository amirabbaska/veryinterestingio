		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is the perception of a single take (which had already been explained as several cuts put together cleverly). Another part is that it appears that frames have been removed from the scene, making things appear much more frantic. </p>
<p>The biggest thing, however, is that the scene is shot in a way that makes you feel like you're Harry. The camera focuses on Harry, only showing you threats as they become relevant to Harry. </p>
<p>At least, that's the best way I can describe it. Hopefully this helps/actually makes sense.</p>
<p>EDIT: Your &gt; You're. Words are hard :c</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is my understanding and opinion that it has to do with it looking like a single take. In most movies when the fighting happens they tend to cut at or before the attack hits and switch to a different angle to make the attack looks like it hit but it actually didn't in real life. But because of the single cut tricks the fight feels more real and that the attacks actually do hurt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look closely there's a lot of hidden cuts that make it seem like it's all one take. The cuts are hidden by zooming or people, blocking the camera and a lot of editing tricks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
