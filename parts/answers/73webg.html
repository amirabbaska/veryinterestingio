<p>Per Stanford study:<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~clint/Run_Walk2004a.rtf" target="_blank"> Running elicited a significantly greater total energy expenditure than walking on both the treadmill and the track (P &lt; 0.001) for both genders (Fig. 1a). On the treadmill, the males expended 520.6 ± 27.6 kJ for 1600 m; this was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than the energy expenditure by the females (441.1 ± 25.6 kJ). For the walk, the males expended 370.4 ± 17.7 kJ, and the females expended 309.6 ± 17.2 kJ for 1600 m (P &lt; 0.05 between genders). When energy expenditure was adjusted for fat-free mass, the gender effect disappeared, but running exercise still required more energy than walking (P &lt; 0.01; Fig. 1b).</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a u-shaped sort of curve for walking. It's more biomechanically efficient at slower speeds (becoming less efficient at very low speeds as basal metabolism becomes significant given the amount of time). <a href="http://fellrnr.com/wiki/Calories_burned_running_and_walking" target="_blank">This</a> has a whole bunch of info, and takes slope into account. Pretty cool. According to their data, a 14 min/mile is roughly the crossover point where running starts to be more efficient, but that depends on the person a bit (different sized legs).</p>
<p>Any running motion is pretty much steady-state as far as energy expenditure/distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I wish a couple physicists had chimed in on this... fundamentally, It takes the same amount of energy to move an object of given mass and volume a known distance through a constant medium, irrespective of time. However, running and walking are biomechanically different. Your mechanical efficiency is lower with running and therefore you'll 'burn' slightly more calories. Running is basically controlled, rhythmic, leaps forward thus more vertical work is being done to move the known object (you) forward. In addition, the higher heart rate will also increase your caloric consumption since the heart is a muscle and it needs energy too; I do not know if it is detectable by current measurement techniques within 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Where I think this question  arises as I've  received it in the past: Not all treadmills are created equal and the estimation equation for calorie consumption per distance/incline travelled may not account for differences between the mechanical efficiency of running or walking. </p>
<p>TL,DR: run the distance, yields less time and increased calories consumed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without commenting on the exact science of things coz that's clearly being debated elsewhere in this thread, I've wondered about this topic before - typically in the context of doing a workout.</p>
<p>My own conclusion was that even IF a 10 minute run burned the same amount of calories as a 20 minute walk, it still leaves me 10 more minutes of other <em>potential</em> exercise during my time allocated to working out - which is where I determined that the potential is there to burn more calories regardless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
