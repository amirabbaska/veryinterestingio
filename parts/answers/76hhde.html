		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ice cream is frozen while churned which adds air to the mixture.  This is called overrun.   </p>
<p>Premium ice creams - those little containers that cost as much as the big containers - have less than 50% overrun, as little as 30%.  </p>
<p>Those big cheap containers have lots and lots of air added, 90% sometimes.<br />
If you take a cup of each and let them melt and air escape you can see a rough idea of how much product they started with before churning.  </p>
<p>It’s a fun experiment and you’ll be surprised.  But this is a huge factor in your refrozen consistency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ice cream isn't just frozen. It's frozen while being churned. This gives it a fluffier consistency, filed with air pockets.  You'd have to refreeze the ice cream while keeping it moving. While at rest, it freezes solid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because of the size of the ice crystals. When ice cream is first made it is stirred while being chilled, creating many small crystals. When it melts and refreezes, the melted portion freezes back into larger crystals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is correct so far: it's both the air and the crystal size. There is no air churned into your ice cream when it remelts, so it doesn't have that nice mouthfeel, and it melts in your mouth much more quickly. Additionally, the ice cream was originally churned in such a way that it froze very quickly, creating lots of small crystals rather than a few large ones. Your ice cream probably refroze much slower, creating just a few larger ice crystals. This affects the texture by making it much more icy instead of that smooth creamy texture it originally had.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ice cream has air in it that makes it fluffy. When it melts the water in it clumps up becoming ice. It's like bread that got squished. No one likes squished bread :(</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
