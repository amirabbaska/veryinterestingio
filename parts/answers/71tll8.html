		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live on more or less the other side of the world from where I grew up, so I don't find much of my native food here. But I visit an aunt who lives in the same country about once a year.</p>
<p>I've come close to crying (happily) many times when I eat her food. Waiting so long for home-made food everytime. And she's a really good cook too.</p>
<p>I think one of the other comments makes sense- repetition dulls out the excitement. I don't get enough of the food I love- makes me impatient and excited every single time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They are complletely content to walk around the house naked. Later, as their brain begins to understand more abstract concepts is when they start changing their ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toddlers have a lot of energy that drives them to fidget and do things involving locomotion. It's a way of making sure they use &amp; exercise their musculoskeletal system, which requires it for nerve pathing, muscle memory, etc. Any simple stimulus is enough to trigger a desire for a movement. Fear, happiness, boredom, etc. They need to learn their bodies and grow them. Constant movement is helpful for that. </p>
<p>When you're older you don't have this energy. Presumably you need it to accomplish your work or tasks of the day. Dancing and singing as an adult is also disruptive and obstructive to most eating areas and activities of daily living. Flailing arms and jumping around when you're 6 ft tall is pretty hazardous. Your body is grown and your body doesn't need to develop nerve pathways or muscle memory anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
