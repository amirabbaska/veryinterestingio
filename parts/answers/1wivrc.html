<ul>
<li>Open the Start menu. (Windows key does this, if you don't know how.)</li>
<li>Type msconfig into the search box in the lower-left and hit enter. (You could instead type msconfig.exe into the command prompt.)</li>
<li>You should get a <a href="http://imgur.com/5B1gNDD" target="_blank">window that looks something like this</a>.</li>
<li>In the 'General' tab (should be open already) select the 'Selective startup' option, if it isn't already.</li>
<li>Go to the 'Services' tab.</li>
<li><strong>Check the 'Hide all Microsoft services' checkbox.</strong></li>
<li>You'll be presented with a list of programs that your computer runs on start-up that are part of other programs you have installed. None of these are needed for your computer to work, and many of them keep running long after startup (thus slowing it down.) Disabling them may cause other programs you have installed to load more slowly when you start them, or to break entirely, but Windows will keep working, and you can always come back here to re-enable things.</li>
<li>Un-check the boxes of any programs you don't need. If you don't know what it is, un-check it. </li>
<li>Go to the 'Startup' tab.</li>
<li>Un-check the boxes of any programs you don't need. If you don't know what it is, un-check it.</li>
<li>Click the 'Apply' button or the 'Ok' button at the bottom of the window, and close the window if it doesn't do it automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy your new, faster PC.^*</p>
<p>^* May require a restart to take effect, it probably will not prompt you to restart.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: People are asking about other versions of Windows. Try Win+R then type msconfig.exe and hit enter. Then continue from step 3 above. This should work in a few more versions of Windows. Worst case scenario, this will do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: /u/objober has <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1wivrc/eli5_why_even_though_i_take_excellent_care_of_my/cf2u3mq" target="_blank">similar advice for a mac</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: Wow, still getting messages about this a month later! So, most of you are writing me about things breaking afterward. Yes, that's something you disabled. No, I don't know what it is. Many of you seem to have forgotten to check the 'Hide all Microsoft services' checkbox. That hides like 98% of the stuff that causes problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, at least part of the problem is that developers are always under the assumption that your computer is getting better every year. Your computer is going to seem a little worse every month, unless you avoid software that's ever updated. The main part of your sluggishness is from programs running without notifying you. Things like steam, always-on music players, and general stuff tend to have things for your computer to do, even if the program itself isn't &quot;running&quot;. Manually deleting excess programs is the best way of keeping your speed up. You'll mostly  see the difference in your boot speed, but also a bit during general use. Occasionally, just as computers need to be turned off and back on, they need to have their OS reinstalled. All you need to do this is a CD of your OS (vanilla, please. If you got your PC in a store, fully assembled, you probably have a bloated version of your operating system.) and enough external memory to back up all the personal stuff you want to keep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IT optimization guy here... a lot of these answers are colossal BS. Here are the 5 big things that slow a computer down. You may have one, some, or all of these things.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Too many things running in process (unnecessary software)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too much software for your hardware specs (things you need, but may not have the RAM/processing power/hard drive space to run properly)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A virus. The majority of users have at least a few &quot;viruses&quot; (or bloatware, spyware, adware, etc) on their computers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A clogged registry</p>
</li>
<li>The &quot;wrong&quot; programs for doing your everyday things.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix the first one, go to msconfig as the top commenter said, and once you disable services, go into the startup tab and uncheck <em>anything</em> that says updater, apple, google, adobe, spotify, java, AIM, etc. The <em>only</em> things you need to start the second your computer turns on (when it's doing a lot of work anyway) is your antivirus and maybe something like dropbox.</p>
<p>For the second issue, a RAM upgrade might be necessary (and cheap/easy to install), but wait until you finish the first step before diving into that.</p>
<p>To handle the virus problem, download, update and run <a href="http://downloads.malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank">malwarebytes anti-malware</a>. Love this software. Opt out of the free trial BS and run it anytime you suspect that you have a virus. Always update first.</p>
<p>To fix the registry issue, download and run <a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download/standard" target="_blank">CCleaner</a>. You can run the file cleaner as well if you need hard drive space, but their reg cleaner is top notch.</p>
<p>Lastly, to explain the &quot;wrong programs&quot; part... an older computer with fewer resources to spare is going to have trouble running software that updates all the time, because those developers spec their current versions for newer machines. So, instead of running resource-intensive software like adobe PDF reader or IE/firefox, you may want to consider Foxit PDF reader, switching to chrome if you haven't already, and moving away from itunes/zune/windows media player.</p>
<p>Last but not least, if you insist on defragmenting, run a repeutable/effective defrag which will put your most-used data at the front of your disk, making it seek faster <em>and</em> in the correct order. The app I use is <a href="http://www.auslogics.com/en/software/disk-defrag/after-download/" target="_blank">auslogics disk defrag</a></p>
<p>edit since this blew up: DO NOT DEFRAG AN SSD EVER EVER like f'real. <a href="http://blog.tune-up.com/tips-and-tricks/four-steps-to-optimize-your-ssd/" target="_blank">Read this article</a> and make sure TRIM is configured correctly.</p>
<p><strong>DOUBLE EDIT:</strong> I will not debate browser preference with people. Download both, see which one runs faster. Just don't use IE and we can be friends.</p>
<p>Also, some people are calling BS on the registry fix. Maybe its confirmation bias, or the fact that I optimize the reg with everything else, but on my 10,000+ clients with slow PCs, I include it as a step, it takes only a few seconds, and has never harmed a computer. So even if it does <em>nothing,</em> what have you lost?</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people are telling you how to fix it, but let me break down the overarching issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your computer is not actually slowing down unless something is wrong, e.g. your hard drive is dying.  If your computer suddenly becomes very slow and makes a grinding/clicking noise, the problem may be in the hardware.  But if the hardware isn't failing, then your computer itself isn't slowing down.</li>
<li>Some of it may be the software you're running.  The brand new 2014 edition of [Application X] may be demanding more system resources than then 2005 version of the same application did.  This is because lots of people have speedy new hardware, and the developers of [Application X] want to take advantage of that speed to offer better features.  Or they got lazy and their new version is bloated.  It's hard to say unless we talk about a specific application instead of the generic &quot;Application X&quot;.</li>
<li>Many people will tell you that you may have a virus, which is true.  You might.  On the other hand, sometimes the problem is bloated and overly-aggressive antivirus software.  Find an AV solution that doesn't do too much or use too many system resources.</li>
<li>Your hard drive may be running out of space.  When you get below 15-20% free space on your system drive, you may start to see performance problems.  As you get closer to 0% free space, performance will get much worse.</li>
<li>Your system may be poorly optimized (e.g. fragmented files, fragmented page file, too many services running, etc).  The best way to take care of all of these kinds of problems is to back up all of your data, reformat your hard drive, and reinstall your OS.  If you do that, make sure you have your data backed up, you have the installers for any applications you want to install, any product licensing keys, and drivers for all of your hardware.  When you reinstall, only install what you really need.  When you install drivers, only install the drivers.  Do not install the full software suite that came with your printer, for example, unless you really want it.</li>
<li>If you don't want to reformat and reinstall, then do maintenance.  Uninstall any applications that you don't use.  Make sure you have at least 20% free space on your system drive.  Defragment your hard drive, defragment your page file, find a reputable application to clean up your registry, look for applications/services that are starting at startup that you don't need, and disable them.  Make sure you do a thorough scan for viruses and malware.</li>
<li>To some extent, it's psychological.  Even if your computer from 2005 is running no more slowly than it was in 2005, it will seem slower when you've gotten used to using newer, faster computers.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Defrag is usually done by default on windows 7. Frequent running oh maybe about 2x a month of </p>
<p>CCleaner by piriform (free) will fix darn near anything, </p>
<p>JRT Junkware removal tool (also free) from bleepingcomputer.com will pick up stuff left behind mostly .pup files from </p>
<p>Malwarebytes scans will pick up most if not all intrusive activity or suspicious visitor and deposit them in the recycle bin.</p>
<p>And FINALLY ...  TDSS killer by (kaspersky) also a free download Will fry any unwanted worm activity. </p>
<p>start --&gt; run---&gt; MSCONFIG    under startup can be tweaked for faster more efficient service configuration. Example you DONT need Spotify, Steam, Itunes etc to immediately try to load itself on boot. These processes gobble up memory usually before you get to the desktop.</p>
<p>Keep all drivers, and patches current. Always always do a system backup, save and backup everything you cant afford to lose. </p>
<p>Some good antivirus's (free ones)
Microsoft security essentials ( i use this personally never have had a problem) </p>
<p>Avast (easy to use interface, recommend disabling the voice notification, about vaulted out of bed when in the dead of nite it announced that it had just UPDATED)</p>
<p>Pick only one antivirus, multiple anti virus's can result in false positives, they will report infections, but basically they are detecting each other.</p>
<p>You can increase your paging file to increase system performance but this option is more relative to how much RAM and free HDD space you have, and isnt recommended for a novice to adjust. Its located in a nice little submenu that if any other thing is changed you can toss a proverbial monkey wrench into the inner workings of your pc. </p>
<p>A ram upgrade never hurt anyone, Ram is relatively affordable and can be found at a decent price around the net. I would only recommend this option if you have 2 gigs or less or are currently wanting to do some high end gaming, graphic design, or are running music editing software. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
