		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was the result of the best ratio of diameter of the cartridges in use at the time to the acceptable fatness and also expense of the gun.</p>
<p>The cartridges can only be placed around the perimeter or the cylinder, so you have to make it dramatically larger, heavier, and most importantly, more expensive and use more materials to make it hold more shots. There must be enough metal between each hole/chamber in the cylinder to contain the pressure of the powder going off so the gun doesn't blow up in your face. So adding more shots is a case of diminishing returns. There is nothing technically preventing anyone from doing it, and there wasn't even at the time. It's just impractical.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that not all revolvers were or are six shooters, either. Five is/was also common. Earlier &quot;pepperbox&quot; guns, the arguable precursor to revolvers, commonly held four. There were some small caliber revolvers at the time that held <em>more</em> shots as well, since the smaller diameter cartridges took up less space along the circumference of the cylinder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Educated guess for a 5yo reddit child: I believe that the chosen caliber drives the design. Let's take a look at the boundary (extream) conditions and use between 20 &amp; 2 bullets. Okay, grab your grapes and we will do this together.</p>
<p>Not those grapes, the grapes in your lunchbox. Place 20 bullets (grapes) in a ring. Now place one grape in the middle for the central pivot. There is a lot of room in the middle! Much more than is needed.</p>
<p>Now place two grapes side by side with one grape in between for the pivot. Now there is a lot of room around the ring. </p>
<p>How much room is on that ring? Room for 4 more bullets for a total of 6. </p>
<p>Could there be 5 or 7, sure but from a machinists perspective, striking three equally spaced lines through a center point is much easier than 5 or 7 equally spaced lines. Durring the time of the iconic six shooter, machining was more difficult so anything that would save time/math was favorable. This leads us to a little history.</p>
<p>HEY, pay attention you little shit!</p>
<p>Samuel Colt was on the forefront of mass production, up to that point a firearm was made by a single worker/artisan start to finish. Due to advances in tolerancing, Colt could mass produce parts knowing that they would be a relatively close fit. This allowed for assembly by less skilled workers lowering costs and pushed revolvers into more hands.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the design. In addition to holding the bullets, the cylinder is also the chamber where the ammunition fires so a certain amount of material is needed to contain the explosion.</p>
<p>Also, gearing is proportional to number of bullets and would be a thin ring about 1/4 bullet diameter which is why I chose a full grape rather than a raisin for the central pivot. And as I stated at the beginning, this is all reative to the caliber of the bullet as it can be scaled up or down.  </p>
<p>Now eat your grapes.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you kind stranger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't use a base 10 system for measuring movement on a circle though.  Revolvers are kind of clockwork devices. They require a precision in their design that is less complicated than the clocks I'm using as an analogy or the mechanisms of their more modern autoloader counterparts. Even the simplest of revolvers requires a gear calibrated to allow a cylinder to rotate enough to move the next round in between the barrel and the firing pin or &quot;hammer.&quot; You can see the complicated design of Samuel Colt's first revolving rifle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Paterson" target="_blank">here.</a> Other design concerns include the width of the round, the rod the cylinder moves around, and the amount of material needed to make sure the rod, cylinder, and frame can withstand multiple firings. All of that needs to fit onto a handle that will fit securely in the palm of your hand.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ease of design, mostly. If you stack 7 circles in as close a shape possible, you get an hexagon with 2 on top, 3 in the middle, and 2 at the bottom. Use the centre as a rotating part, and you get 6 holes in a symmetrical way, without having to do weird complicated math.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly convention based on experimentation.  Designers tried all kinds of crazy things in the early 1800's until the sweet spot of 5 or 6 rounds was found. Theres a great youtube channel called &quot;forgotten weapons&quot; that chronicles some those very interesting ealry designs. </p>
<p>In general, more shots means a bigger cylinder, higher bore axis, and an overall heavier gun.  There comes a point where people have trouble using it because of the size, weight and recoil characteristics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
