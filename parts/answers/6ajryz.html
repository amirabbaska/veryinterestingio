		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Who says it's less painful? Posture issues aren't just due to not feeling like standing up straight. Your muscles work together and against each other to hold your body in certain positions. Poor posture habits tend to cause a muscle at one end of a joint to be overly tight, while a muscle on the other end to be overly relaxed. In trying to correct that imbalance by simply standing up straight, you're forcing the muscle that's so used to being relaxed to try to counteract the muscle that has been straining, which leads to pain and discomfort, so the person will go back to whatever poor posture position they were in that isn't uncomfortable. Over time, it starts becoming unbearable to just stand up straight, and requires a significant concentrated effort and constantly reminding oneself to manually fix their posture, because their muscles will force them into the poor posture position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also requires more effort. The &quot;better and less painful&quot; is in the future, but slouching means using fewer muscles right now.</p>
<p>But &quot;all the time&quot;, even when not tired, probably means either they never learned about posture or they developed a habit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physiotherapy student here, there is no &quot;perfect posture&quot;, everyone is different. Some people have sway back, some have increased lordosis or kyphosis, some people use their hips more than their back moving from sitting to standing. As long as there is no pain and no impact on your activities/function, you are fine. </p>
<p>If you are experiencing back pain, a postural disorder MAY be to blame. You could see a physio, who will complete a subjective and objective examination, then either offer a diagnosis with treatment and management options, or refer you onwards. They will refer if your source of symptoms is unclear/ you have red flags/ physio is not indicated for your diagnosis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Standing up perfectly straight is actually not good for you. Standing with a slight curve forwards and back is better but it's something that many people naturally fight as they don't want to feel like their stomach is sticking out.  I had back problems for ages until I did some research and realized it wasn't that I was &quot;pulling it out&quot; every now and then it's that I had horrible posture while standing and sitting.</p>
<p>After some research I found the best piece of advice was to pretend you have a tail like a monkey, when you are standing or sitting you want the tail to be going back and up, not down. This forces you to tilt your hips forward and puts the rest of the spine in the correct position. </p>
<p>It was uncomfortable for a few days but once I got used to it the difference was amazing, I feel and look taller, I haven't had major back pain in years and the uncomfortable strain I'd get from sitting so long was gone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I slouched as a young teen because my breasts were growing, felt too big  and made me self-conscious. I rolled my shoulders forward and upper chest back to hide them. The posture became a set-in habit that I can't seem to break even well into my 30's.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
