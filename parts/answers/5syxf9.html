		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't have a good explanation for the masses of particles.  We know the proton mass is governed by the scale of the strong force, but why the scale of the strong force should be around 2000 times the mass of the electron is something we have no explanation for.</p>
<p>As for their charges, there is a technical property called <em>anomaly cancellation</em> that implies that the charges of the fundamental particles have ratios that can be written as the ratios of whole numbers.  (Note: Not just any whole number ratios will do.)  The electron having charge -1, the up quark having charge +2/3, and the down quark having charge -1/3  works to satisfy the anomaly cancellation constraint.  And with those quark charges, the proton winds up with charge +1, exactly the opposite of the charge of the electron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
