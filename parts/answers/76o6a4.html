		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A process called triangulation.</p>
<p>After measuring the position (including height) of two points (A, B) you can stand at and see Everest (C) from, you then use a protractor and telescope (a theodolite) and measure: &quot;I'm at A - the angle CAB is 55 degrees.&quot; (meaning if you point a telescope at B and a second one at C the angle between the telescopes' axes is 55 degrees.&quot;  If you then trudge 20 miles to B and repeat the measurements, you'd get the angle CBA &quot;75 degrees&quot;.</p>
<p>Since you know the distance AB and angles CBA and CAB, you can then take a sheet of paper (&quot;20 miles is too big for our paper.  We'll scale it to 20 inches and draw AB 20 inches long.&quot;) and then draw rays AC and BC (55 degrees and 75 degrees).  Where they cross is C.</p>
<p>Then superimpose a grid and you know the xy coordinates of C. </p>
<p>(In reality it'd be more than just that, you'd have used a trig table and stuff.)</p>
<p>Now you know &quot;Ok, it's 30.5 miles away from A, on a bearing NNW (335.6 degrees).</p>
<p>Now you know the xy coordinates of the peak C.  Now measure the angle C is above the horizon using a telescope, protractor, and plumb line. &quot;21 degrees&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok, it's 30.5 miles away and 21 degrees above the horizon.&quot;</p>
<p>tan (theta) = opposite distance / adjacent distance.</p>
<p>Tan (21 degrees) = height  / 30.5 miles</p>
<p>height =  30.5 miles * tan (21 degrees) =  8,848 metres (29,029 ft).</p>
<p>&quot;Ok, now we know its height.&quot;</p>
<p>(Note: numbers like 21 degrees, 30.5 miles are completely fake. I don't know where the survey points are and am just bullshitting here.  Also, the seven! survey points are on the map in the first link below.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of an old joke... a group of students is taking a trigonometry test. The last question on the exam is &quot;You have a barometer. You are standing next to a tall apartment building. How do you measure the height of the building?&quot;</p>
<p>One of the students gets to the last question, and stops writing, deep in thought. Time runs out on the exam. The rest of the class leaves, and the student begs for time to finish. Begrudgingly, the professor allowed an extra five minutes, and the student began writing furiously. The student finished exactly at the end of the allotted time.</p>
<p>1) Measure the barometric pressure at the bottom of the building and the top. Barometric pressure varies with altitude, so you can calculate the height of the building from the differences in pressure.</p>
<p>2) Measure the length of the shadow of the building in barometer lengths. Measure the length of the shadow of the barometer using the gradiations on the barometer itself. Since the base of both triangles are right angles, and the angle of the shadow is the same, the triangles will be similar, and the height of the building will be in the same proportion as the shadow of the building to the shadow of the barometer (since this was a trigonometry test, this was the accepted answer).</p>
<p>3) Go to the top of the building. Drop the barometer and count the seconds. Calculate height based on drop time.</p>
<p>4) Take the barometer down to the basement. Find the super. Tell him &quot;I will give you this very nice barometer if you tell me how high your building is&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK. Triangulation. Now, how big is impact of the form of the mountain? Usually, when climbing, there are many false tops - you keep climbing and climbing just to discover that what you assumed was a top, was actually just a bump.</p>
<p>And what is height exactly? It's said above sea level, but it probably means accumulating lots of errors? The definition would be more clear if the Earth was an ideal spherical ocean, with mountain peaks sticking out of it, but even the ocean isn't spherical. Wouldn't that mean that heights would be different if we started going from different shores? What about tides? They probably mandate starting the measurement at a specific time, when the tide is low/high/middle?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At a very basic level, a mountain can be considered as a huge triangle. If you draw a line from the top of the mountain to the midpoint of the base, you get two right triangles.</p>
<p>Basic trigonometry states that the height of a right triangle is equal to the base (adjacent) times the tangent of the angle.</p>
<p>So, measuring the base and the angle you get a nice estimate of the height. Taking into account the curvature of the Earth and other factors, the measurement gets more and more accurate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
