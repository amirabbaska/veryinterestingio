		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually if you didn’t have that slight salt in your tears, your corneal epithelium would become too wet and wrinkly and would slough off. This is a condition that ophthalmologists have to treat. You remove the damaged epithelium by scraping with a cotton swab, place a dried placental membrane over the area that sticks in place to the exposed cornea, add some saline drops, and cover with a contact lens for a few weeks. The patient is prescribed extra salty tears to keep the surface a little more dry so the new epithelium can adhere. You come back and take the contact out and continue to use the drops until everything is back to normal. This is all done in the office and not the OR. Probably one of the coolest office procedures for the eye I’ve seen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are all solutions with salt in them the same? There’s a little bit of salt in the water of a “freshwater lake”. It probably doesn’t sting your eyes the way the salt in the ocean sometimes does. The salt in the Great Salt Lake or the Dead Sea would probably sting a lot worse. The amount of dissolved salt also affects the osmolarity, and if that is too high or too low, that affects comfort.</p>
<p>Tears, sweat, and blood (or Blood, Sweat, and Tears, - great group; you should listen to one of their albums- but I digress) all have salt(s) in them, but they have different concentrations of salt, and different concentrations of different salts (compounds like potassium chloride, calcium salts, magnesium salts, etc). Sweat and tears can have different pH (acidity or alkalinity). And they contain different lipids (oils).</p>
<p>The surface or the eye is built to be healthiest and most comfortable with the salinity, pH, lipids, and other components of our tears. If you change any of those parameters too much, and put that different solution in the eye, the cells on the surface of the eye can tell the difference. And they may tell you they don’t much care for it. By stinging, burning, and YES, by tearing, to restore the normal surface fluids on the eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a thread about tears couple of days ago. Someone there explained that there are 3 different types of tears, each have different chemical structure or something like that. Maybe that will explain your question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
