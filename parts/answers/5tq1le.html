		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't notice it when you're not sick, but your nostril actually do this all the time. It's just exaggerated when you're sick. It's called the nasal cycle. At any given time, one of your nostrils is doing most of the work and is clear, while the other one is &quot;resting&quot; and is more congested. It's managed by your autonomic nervous system so you can't control it and most of the time don't notice it. There are two reasons for this. The first is that it gives the cilia and mucous membranes a chance to rest so they can better filter and humidify when they're doing the work. The second is that it helps you smell better. Some smells are better detected in fast-moving air, and some are better detected in slow moving air. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people have a so called &quot;nasal cycle&quot; where the amount of air going through each nostril fluctuates. At any given time even without a cold if you put your hand under your nose, you may be able to feel that more air is coming out of one side than the other. This helps us smell better by giving each nostril a break once in a while. So when you are congested the nasal cycle continues and the side that is getting more air flow will be less stuffed up than the side that is taking a break. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens if you don't have a nasal cycle? I had multiple sinus surgeries as a child by a not so great ENT (literally cauterized my sinuses with too little local anesthetic) and I don't experience this. If I'm lying down, congestion will switch sides if I change position, but only then. I also have a terrible sense of smell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about the congested part (because personal experience is different), but generally one of your nostrils is always (partly) blocked while the other does the breathing, and they switch periodically. One hypothesis is that this forces a human to change sides when sleeping, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1urizz/why_do_we_change_positions_during_sleep/" target="_blank">which prevents stalling of circulation in the body parts under pressure</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe all the other commentors are correct, but let me say that it feels amazing being able to breath through two nostrils for a minute or two when you're <em>that</em> sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
