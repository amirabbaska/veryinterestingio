		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some actually tried this.  However, under the Nuremberg laws, if you had a grandparent who was Jewish, regardless of whether you even looked the part, you were classified as Jewish.  Interestingly enough though, and forgive me if this is going off on a tangent, there was a sure fire way to stay out of the camps.  Namely, any jewish man who served with the kriegsmarine, was off limits to arrest.  If a jewish man, serving for the kriegsmarine, could get a &quot;German Blood Certificate&quot; (which is basically saying you were born in Germany), then service with the kriegsmarine was not only possible, but common.  Vice Admiral Bernhard Rogge was Jewish, just for example.  Erich Raeder devotes an entire chapter to this in his memoirs, where he basically spells out why the Jewish sailors were off limits.  It basically boiled down to the head of the kreigsmarine (before Doenitz) essentially telling Hitler, that if the gestapo started arresting his sailors, then not a single ship, nor submarine would ever leave port.  Hitler backed down, and while Doenitz never pressed the issue himself, he did seem to support the prior decision.</p>
<p>edit:  Minor note here, but I believe the protection of the sailor extended to his immediate family, ie his wife and children.  However I am not one hundred percent certain on this.  However, it's worth noting that of the entire kriegsmarine, something like five percent of the sailors could claim jewish ancestry.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was not a religious persecution, it was an ethnic purging. You cannot just renounce Judaism because it is your ethnicity, and by Nazi definitions if you had a single Grandparent that was Jewish you were Jewish. To &quot;renounce&quot; that you would not only have to give up your religion but you would have to forge birth records, church baptismal and communion records, etc. A few were able to do this complicated thing, but it was not something available to the general Jewish populace as you seem to think. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You couldn't really denounce Judaism, as you are Jewish by Birth, meaning when your mother was a Jew so were you. The Nazis went to all extremes so you had to prove (with birth certificates and copies from other registries such as the Catholic church's) that you were in fact not Jewish by blood. Whether or not you were practicing the religion didn't matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because &quot;Jews don't get to decide if they are Jewish.&quot; The Nazis were doing the defining, and their definition had to do with family lineage, and not synagogue attendance. I don't have a link, but there's a story of a catholic nun being rounded up and executed as a &quot;Jew&quot; because one of her grandparents were Jewish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
