		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for all your questions and the interesting discussion! </p>
<p>I've seen lots of questions based around a similar theme of: what can we do as individuals; do we make a difference; is this a regional or global problem; what should corporations be doing; what should governments be doing? So I thought I’d try to kill many birds (Kurzgesagt birds, of course) with one stone and gather some collective thoughts which tackle them all.</p>
<p>I’m a researcher on the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/" target="_blank">Our World in Data</a> team – there we publish interactive data visualisations and research on how the world is changing over a long-term perspective across a wide range of social, economic, environmental dimensions. Therefore I try to use data to inform my choices on how to tackle problems and what makes sense. The data visualisations linked to below might be helpful for you.</p>
<p>These interactive maps are based on data published a 2015 <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768/" target="_blank">paper in Science</a> (the only global quantification of plastic reaching the oceans by country that I’ve seen). The data is for 2010 so not ideal, but I suspect this does not strongly affect the overall balance.</p>
<p>Let’s work through this in steps:</p>
<p>- Per person, the amount of plastic waste we generate is mixed across the world, but typically higher in richer countries. Explore the map <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-plastic-waste-generation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>- But, plastic waste across the world is not managed in the same way and therefore does not have the same probability of ending up in the ocean. Most of the waste that is collected and formally managed in proper landfills does not reach the ocean. We can define ‘mismanaged waste’ as waste that is littered or not formally managed and includes disposal in dumps or open, uncontrolled landfills, where it is not fully contained. The authors note that this is the plastic waste which could enter waterways and move into the ocean. Per person, the global map changes significantly; richer countries tend to have much better waste management methods and therefore very low levels of ‘mismanaged waste’. Explore the map <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mismanaged-plastic-waste-per-person" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>- Of course, in terms of plastic which could reach the ocean, we’re interested in the total (not the per capita) plastic waste. This is how <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mismanaged-plastic-waste" target="_blank">that map looks</a>. Here we see that the largest quantities of mismanaged plastic waste are regionally focused in Asia and across North Africa. As noted in the video, it tends to be in countries which have industrialized very quickly in recent decades and have large coastal populations. If we <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-mismanaged-plastic-waste-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank">plot mismanaged plastic waste against GDP per capita</a>, it tends to be highest at middle incomes. </p>
<p>So, what is the most effective way of addressing this?</p>
<p>It’s true that the quantity of mismanaged plastic waste (that could enter the ocean) across rich countries is in balance, relatively small at the global scale. Europe as a whole, for example, probably sums to the order of 100s of thousands of tonnes per year (maybe up to a million). This compares to some countries in South-East Asia, in contrast, which produce the in the order of millions of tonnes in a single country.</p>
<p>What can we do as <strong>individuals</strong>? There is the obvious at-home or local practices we can do: recycle as much as you can, don’t take plastic you don’t need, be conscious of how much you’re using and where you can reduce (but before of unintended consequences such as food waste). </p>
<p>But these practices alone are not close to enough. Sure, we should still do them, but only if they are additional to broader, more impactful action that higher-income countries take. They should not be a substitute, or a “we’ve banned plastic straws, so we’ve done our bit for the planet” campaign. If rich countries (and their populations) are as concerned and committed to this problem as they say they are then one of the most effective actions is to invest in waste management infrastructure across lower-to-middle income countries. Countries which have industrialized quickly have been left with insufficient waste management systems. If these are systems are not implemented and upscaled, then we will be unable to address this global problem. We could end plastic waste across Europe and North America and we would still have a major global problem.</p>
<p>Note that this is not a finger-pointing blame game. This has been a consequence of economic growth, industrialization and globalisation which we all share responsibility for. It needs to be a collaborative effort to find the interventions which have the largest impact.</p>
<p>So, governments should be investing in waste management infrastructure. Companies and industry should be taking responsibility for the redesign of new products which mimimise wastage. And as individuals we should be pressuring both into take these steps. Do your bit locally, but attempt to push for the high-impact global solutions too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another aggregate answer on the topic of biodegradable plastics, since this question is appearing a lot.</p>
<p>People always get excited about the prospect of biodegradable plastics – hey, we can get the benefits of what plastic would give us, then then once we’re done we just compost it and it disappears. Sounds great! But it’s a bit more complicated than that, and industry has really jumped on the bandwagon of our excitement. </p>
<p>Part of the problem relates to our definition of ‘biodegradable’. We say standard plastics do not degrade, but actually this is not strictly true. Over long timescales they do break down, they just don’t in the timeframes we’re used to talking about. So there has unfortunately been a trend of labelling products as ‘biodegradable’ simply because they break down <em>faster</em> than our standard plastics. </p>
<p>One example of this was so-called ‘oxo-degradable plastics’ which were promoted as biodegradable. But these are actually just standard plastics (such as polyethylene) with additives to accelerate the oxidation process (causing them to break down faster). All this does is break the plastics down into microplastics. Still, it gets classified as biodegradable. I think I’d rather have the conventional plastic than been fooled into thinking it’s better for the environment.</p>
<p>This has been the case with several so-called biodegradable plastics: they are proven to break down faster under specific environmental conditions (which may not actually reflect the normal environment) and can make this claim. As consumers we are then bombarded with labels of biodegradable, bio-based, compostable, and can’t make sense of what this actually means. I think it’s a real problem. At least with conventional plastic you know where you stand.</p>
<p>The final challenge of biodegradable plastics (the ones which could be genuine) is that they tend to need particular waste management methods which are not always widely available. They usually need to be separated from the traditional recycling stream (which can be difficult and expensive), and have to go to specific compostable facilities. This doesn’t mean this is completely unfeasible, but could be additional economic cost, and would take significant work in terms of infrastructure redesign/reshuffling.</p>
<p>Overall: be cautious as to what biodegradable actually means. I don’t think the real solutions are there yet, but could come in the future. It would have to be scalable and cheap if it was to make a significant contribution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
