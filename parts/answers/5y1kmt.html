		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine an extremely hot and humid day. Once you step outside, you'll be drenched in your own sweat immediately.</p>
<p>Being in a hot shower/bath/pool is almost the same environment. You're still sweating large amounts but you don't feel it because the sweat is washed away immediately.</p>
<p>Since you are losing water through sweat during the shower, you feel dried out. This can be dangerous if you stay too long in the shower/pool because being in water reduces your sense of thirst and you can get dehydrated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
