		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toward the end of the 19th century, something called “trading stamps” took the American retail world by storm. Like frequent flyer miles, the stamps were a virtual currency which consumers earned as a reward for spending money. Earn enough trading stamps and you could cash them out for various other goods, such as cookware and household appliances relevant to that age. But unlike frequent flyer miles, you didn’t get trading stamps from your credit card company (which didn’t exist yet anyway). Instead, you obtained them from shopping at participating retailers — merchants would hand you a physical stamp to paste into a collection booklet. For the retailers, the trading stamps were a great way to build customer loyalty — if a consumer were ten stamps away from a Dutch oven, he or she would likely patronize businesses which issued the right type of trading stamps to collect those last few.</p>
<p>So how did retailers get the trading stamps? They bought them from the redemption company. The retailers, therefore, incorporated those costs into their business operations. In some cases, merchants offering trading stamps bumped up prices a bit to account for the cost of acquiring the stamps. However, as the Straight Dope observed (and sorry if that link auto-plays a video), various state legislatures weren’t a fan of this practice. Some states wanted customers to be able to get that cash back in the form of cash, not cookware, so legislatures started passing laws requiring trading stamps issues to redeem booklets full of stamps for cash. According to Mental Floss, New York took the lead: “by 1904, [state] had enacted laws that forced stamp makers to put a cash face value on each stamp that would enable consumers to bypass catalog redemptions and get money back for their stamps.” Over time, many other states passed similar laws.</p>
<p>Of course, the trading stamp companies didn’t want to be in the business of sending cash back, so they simply priced the stamps in a way to limit the work. A typical trading stamps collection booklet had room for 1,000 stamps — it therefore made sense to offer one dollar for a filled book. Do some quick math and each stamp was given a cash value of one-tenth of one cent, or 0.1¢. Even though a booklet of stamps could be easily redeemed for products worth a multiple of that, it’s likely that state governments were okay with this pricing — round numbers tend to make sense to us, even when they shouldn’t.</p>
<p>The popularity of trading stamps persisted through the first half of the 20th century and into the 1970s, and along the way, retailers and manufacturers came up with another way to incentivize consumers. That method, of course, is coupons, which work very differently than trading stamps ever did. But often, when lawmakers are met with a new product that they think needs to regulation, they turn to apparently similar products and try and replicate the law. State legislatures often employ strange analogies which lead to even stranger results, and coupons are a victim of such shenanigans. A handful of states believed that coupons would create the same economic cost-reshuffling that trading stamps did, and those states required that coupons, like trading stamps, also be redeemable for a very tiny bit of cash.</p>
<p>Some of those laws have since been repealed, but a few still remain. Because it doesn’t really make all that much sense to issue two sets of coupons to comply with various state laws, we’re stuck with some cash value — very, very little cash value — on our coupons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I vaguely remember Co-Op Green Shield stamps. My parents were queuing up, looking to redeem them, and there were cabinets of items to be redeemed on display. I was around 7 y/o, I saw some adjustable roller skates, thought to myself, &quot;Huh. I bet me and my sis don't get those.&quot; After waiting approximately 3 eternities, my parents did come back - amazingly with 2 pairs of roller skates, one for each of us kids. I was thrilled! Much fun and many skinned knees occurred that day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question(s):</p>
<p>If a coupon has a cash value, does that value expire, as does that coupon's intended effect? What I'm trying to get at is: should I stop throwing away expired fast food coupons in order to save up for a shiny new penny or would it be for naught? And if they do expire, then would it even be possible to ever redeem them for the cash value? Can I redeem, say, an individual coupon worth 1/100 of a cent before it expires and get a check or something? Or do you have to redeem them in 1 cent multiples?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
