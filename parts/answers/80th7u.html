		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You start with a guess as to what the square root actually is, and then you check. Then you improve your guess over time.</p>
<p>So let's say the number is 55, and I guess 10. 55 / 10 is 5.5, which isn't equal to 10. The answer has to be between  5.5 and 10. My next guess will be the average between them: (5.5 + 10) / 2 = 7.75.</p>
<p>Let's plug that in. 55 / 7.75 is 7.096 and change, so again, the true answer is somewhere in between. Our next guess is 7.423.</p>
<p>Repeat that same thing again, and we get 7.416. 55 / 7.416 is...well, it's about .00039 off from 7.416, but we're only looking at the first three digits after the decimal place, so that's good enough.</p>
<p>If we needed more accuracy, we could repeat this process as much as we want. Each time around, we get about twice as many correct digits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Square roots are, surprisingly, relatively easy to find on calculators, compared to things like trigonometric and logarithmic functions. Most calculators use the Taylor Series, Newton's Method, or some other mathematical formula to find the answer. </p>
<p>First though, the calculator has to do something called &quot;bounds checking,&quot; which makes sure that it cannot try to compute the square root of something like -1, for example. With trigonometric functions, they go even further to reduce the argument to a certain range, such as zero to pi. However, we cannot do this with square roots. </p>
<p>Second, some (but not all) calculators decide the best method to use. The reason is that some algorithms require calculators to raise numbers to the fifteenth power (or higher), and they're going to lose a lot of precision if they try to do that. If the number is large, for example, they're going to try one with lots of division. </p>
<p>In the end, the calculator wants to break the complex square root algorithm into a series of adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides. The reason why we let calculators compute our square roots is because the numbers involved are massive and are a pain to deal with. </p>
<p>Two algorithms that calculators use are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method" target="_blank">Newton's Method</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Taylor_series" target="_blank">Taylor Series</a>. Both of them are <em>iterative</em>, meaning that they run multiple times, with each run making the result even more precise. The Taylor Series, in addition, is also used to calculate things like sine, cosine, and tangent, in addition to things like decimal powers and logarithms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm not sure which one a personal calculator would use and it could even vary from one manufacturer to another.</p>
<p>It certainly doesn't begin with &quot;take a guess&quot;. Calculators can't do that, they would need a very specific series of steps to follow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(Sorry, I cannot explain like you are five—the details are too much for me to simplify—but I want to correct the wrong answers.)</p>
<p>Calculators may use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC" target="_blank">CORDIC</a>, which stands for COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer. CORDIC was initially a method for computing trigonometric functions. But, according to that Wikipedia article, John Stephen Walker generalized it to include square root, and it was used in the HP-35 calculator in 1972, and CORDIC was widely used in other calculators.</p>
<p>Some of the methods mentioned in other answers do have their places. In high-performance software, sometimes a fast approximation is used instead of a slower hardware square-root instruction. This approximation starts with an estimate that comes from a table (sometimes provided by the hardware) and then refines it using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots" target="_blank">Newton’s Method</a>. Often, instead of computing the square root directly, the reciprocal of the square root is computed instead, and the final step multiplies it by the number to get the square root.</p>
<p>While the Taylor series might not be ideal for computing square roots, many functions, such as sine and logarithm, are computed with a series. However, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax_approximation_algorithm" target="_blank">minimax polynomial</a> may be used instead. In these, a polynomial is designed to closely approximate a function, and it is easy for a calculator to evaluate a polynomial because it only requires multiplying and adding. Minimax polynomials can be calculated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remez_algorithm" target="_blank">Remez algorithm</a>. A Taylor series can be used to provide the needed values for a function when the minimax polynomial is being calculated. (Even though a Taylor series may be too slow for general use, it is okay to be a bit slow during the design phase, since it only needs to be done once.)</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/squareRoot.html" target="_blank">calculate a square root manually</a>, using a method like long-hand division.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
