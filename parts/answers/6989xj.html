		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At birth the left side of my skull was crushed by the delivering doctor, and now i perceive the colour red very slightly differently depending on which eye I am using.</p>
<p>But as I have learned that a certain range of frequencies is what everyone else calls red, I refer to those colours as red even though in my head they are slightly different. </p>
<p>The only time I see colours differently to other people is where the colours blue and green meet due to a mild case of tritanomaly (a type of colour sensitivity issue). There are a whole range of colors that I cannot distinguish but the majority of the rest of the world's population can. From that I infer that other people are seeing those colours differently from me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an unfalsifiable question and therefore not worth asking besides for a fun thought experiment. Really, the question of qualia (which is the technical term for what you're asking) is only one step removed from the question of solipsism, which is the belief that you are the only consciousness in the universe and everyone else is a mere unconscious automaton (to put it in one more tangible version of the theory).</p>
<p>Another fun thought experiment in the same vein is whether a rock is actually hard or whether it is soft until the moment you touch it, when it instantaneously becomes hard (alternatively, maybe the rock is the shiniest object in the world until light hits it, when it becomes matte). Both of these thought experiments are unfalsifiable because regardless of whether either statement is true or not it has no practical effect on the world: the world and its function are identical in a universe where either possibility is true.</p>
<p>To put it back into the realm of qualia: so long as we both agree that the big red button is red, it is irrelevant whether your red is the same as my red.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can measure the emissions spectrum of different objects, and see if people agree on the same color to call them.</p>
<p>As to what we subjectively perceive, we don't know. However, artists and visual designers seem to often agree on things which look good or bad together, which implies some common perceptual ability. Human factors engineering has identified some colors (bright orange) as being easy to spot for use as a hazard warning.</p>
<p>So we don't know at all, but behaviorally, we don't have strong reason to think we see totally differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why stop with colors. We cannot be sure if things taste or smell the same to other people. But we have pretty good reason to believe that they probably do, because our perception and opinion of, and reaction to the world around us seem to be very similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
