		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can calculate things like gravity and energy density of the universe base on how the galaxies behave on a cosmic scale.  We can also calculate how much stuff is out there by direct observation.  When we look at the cosmos and look at how the galaxies behave, there is not enough material to generate the gravity (even when accounting for all the gas and dust that may obscuring it).  So there's some matter that doesn't emit light but still generates that gravity we see.  We call it dark matter, because that's what it is: dark.</p>
<p>There's also an expansion to the universe that suggests that the energy density is not what we can directly measure.  There's a bunch of stuff out there causing the universe to expand at an accelerated rate.  We call it dark energy, because, hey, we have dark matter already--why not call it &quot;Dark Energy&quot;; that way it sounds cool.</p>
<p>So there's like 5 times as much matter as what we can see, and like 3 times as much energy density as what can be explained by that matter.  So that's where the percentages come from: just add up all the stuff we know about that makes up the universe even if we don't yet know what that stuff is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In layman's terms: dark matter is <em>something that generates gravity that we can't see</em>.</p>
<p>We can calculate the gravitational forces that impact everything we can see - stars, planets, black holes, dust, etc. We can calculate how much gravity the things we observe is generating. The problem is, they don't add up. There's way more gravity affecting everything than what is being generated. All of that unexplained gravity is just generalized as dark matter until a better explanation comes along. Same kinda deal with dark energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For dark matter and ordinary matter, we basically measure the <em>total</em> matter first (since it all gravitates the same), then differentiate between the two using a second effect. </p>
<p>The total matter (23%+5%=28%) is roughly given by the ratio of heights of the first and third peaks in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#/media/File:PowerSpectrumExt.svg" target="_blank">Cosmic Microwave Background angular powerspectrum</a> because the third peak mostly evolved (by gravity) when the matter content of the universe was negligible, and the first peak mostly evolved when the universe was matter dominated. So the third peak is kind of a calibrator letting the first peak tells you how much matter there is.</p>
<p>To differentiate just the &quot;ordinary matter&quot; part, you can get that from the CMB too, but an even cooler way is by measuring how much of various atomic elements there are in the universe in little pockets that appear to have been pristinely left from the Big Bang. In these pockets, you see that something like 24% of the atoms are Helium-4. The amount of Helium-4 formed by the Big Bang depends really sensitively on how much ordinary matter there was, i.e. the ordinary atoms that are the building blocks of Helium. Run the math and that 24% number tells you about 5% of the universe is normal matter. Then 28%-5% and you get the part which is &quot;missing&quot;, i.e. dark matter. </p>
<p>As for dark energy, well we've just measured how much matter there is (I actually cheated a bit above, those things tells you the total amount of matter, not the percentage relative to everything), so we can calculate how much all that matter gravitating in on itself should slow the expansion of the universe. Then you go and measure the expansion and find, lo-and-behold, not only is the expansion not slowing, its accelerating! Using supernovae as beacons to precisely measure the acceleration rate, you work out how much dark energy there is, giving you that 72% number.</p>
<p>There's probably like 10 other ways to measure these things than what I just described, cosmologists are constantly looking for new ways to do so and comparing the answers against each other, in hope to find a crack in the model pointing to some new things we don't understand!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually wrote about this during the last bit of my degree in physics. I would link it to you but a) it’s a bit complicated for non physicists and b) it’s in spanish. So let me explain it as clear as I can:</p>
<p>As you may or may not know we use General Relativity to study cosmology. The usual model uses the FLRW solution to Einstein’s field equations(EFE). This solution is used for a homogeneous and isotropic space-time (that basically means the contento of matter/energy is the same everywhere and in all directions). So the equations that stem from the EFE using this solution do not t fully describe the behavior of space-time, we need something else: A content inside this universe. For this the simplest model to use is a fluid (a perfect fluid, a fluid which has some properties that make it easier to use than a more real fluid). When you look at galaxies in a sufficiently big scale, they can be modeled using a perfect fluid. Now we can work using the EFE and the equation for the fluid to have a description of the evolution of the universe. </p>
<p>So suppose we have the usual stuff that we know: matter and light (yes, light can be modeled as a fluid). We do a study using these two fluids and... we arrive at the conclusion that the universe is expanding but it is expanding slower every time. But then we have a problem, we observe the universe and we find that the prediction of the model is wrong and the expansion of the universe is accelerating. We need more matter/energy in the universe for this to happen so we take another usual model called: ΛCDM (a model with Cosmological Constant (or Dark Energy) and Cold Dark Matter) and we test it and we see that it makes a much better adjustment to the equations. From this we infer that we have around 30% of CDM and 70% of Λ.</p>
<p>You might still be wondering how we arrive at these numbers, I haven’t explained that yet. So now I’ll do it.</p>
<p>To perform the studies I roughly mentioned above we use data from a particular type of supernovae: supernovae type Ia. This kind of supernovae emit a pretty standardized amount of light and energy. So the data used is something called “distance modulus” it’s some kind of comparison between absolute and apparent magnitudes (the apparent measures the brightness of the object how we perceive it and the other measures how bright it would be at 10 parcecs away from us). This quantity is linked with the distance by a little equation. And the other data needed is the reshift of the object (basically how far away it would be, or how “red” it’s light appears to be due to its relative motion from us because of the expanding universe). We have this observational data captured from huge supernovae samplings. And we have the equations that give us a theoretical expression (an expression that has Dark Energy, CDM and redshift as parameters) for the distance modulus. </p>
<p>Now for getting those numbers we need to make a statistical study if said data. We “compare” the data with the theoretical input and try to minimize the difference with the observational data of the distance modulus of the supernovae. What we do is we sample a lot of values for Dark Energy and CDM and obtain a range of values using a Markov Chain in the Metropolis-Hastings method (at least that’s what I did), obviously we use a computer for this. We input some arbitrary values for DE and CDM we make a comparison between the calculated distance modulus using these values and the observational data then we put some conditions that make the program make the decision if that value is useful or not and if it is it keeps it and if it’s not it “walks a new step” (that is it defines a new value for DE and CDM) and once again the program tests if these new values for DE and CDM are useful or not and so on until the program finishes the amount of steps we want it to take. We end up with a bunch of chains made of different values for DE and CDM. We plot some histograms and take the averages and what would you know, the averages are the 30% and 70% you know about. Does that mean that’s what the universe is made of? No. In this case the averages are also the values of DE and CDM that are most likely in our universe. </p>
<p>I hope this helps you understand a bit more on what is actually done in this type of research and I really hope you read my comment because it took me like half an hour or more to write. If you have any questions you can ask me and I’ll gladly try to answer them.</p>
<p>Edit: I messed up a bit (not counting all the typos) where I said you need a content for the EFE to be useful. That’s not entirely true, once you have the perfect fluid (in this case) there’s still something missing for the equations to be useful, we need more information about the fluid: the Equation of State. It’s a relation between several thermodynamical properties but in the case of a simple fluid used in cosmology we only need an equation that relates the pressure of the fluid p and it’s energy density ρ (for example, for light I think it’s p=1/3 ρ).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several answers giving our estimate for dark matter within a galaxy using rotation curves, which is true.  But overall in the universe, our estimate comes from the scale of the fluctuations of energy density in the early universe.  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is radiation left over from the period in the universe when the temperature finally fell just enough for electrons to join with nucleons to become atoms, and with no more free charged particles, photons became free to travel in the universe.  What we can do is look at the CMB radiation and map the scale of energy fluctuations over very large scales in the early universe.  There were several forces at play determining the shape of these fluctuations.  Gravitation tried to pull things together, whereas radiation pressure pushed things apart, and the curvature of the universe played a role.  If you plot the angular power spectrum of the CMB, as a functino of the multipole moment, you get a multi humped shape, and these humps gives us information about the shape of the universe (essentially flat, which gives us information about dark energy) and the ratio of matter not experiencing pressure (dark matter) to regular matter.  This is really where we get the estimates in percentages of dark matter, dark energy, and regular matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
