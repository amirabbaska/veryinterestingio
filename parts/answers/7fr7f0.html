		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yup, in fact this can sometimes be a lab hazard. </p>
<p>For example if you are trying to dissolve something that has a strong exothermic reaction with water (acids and bases being good examples of this) you can inadvertently heat up the water too fast causing it to boil and splatter all over the place.  Which of course if you are splattering acid solution all over the place it could injure you if you aren't careful. </p>
<p>Exothermic reactions in general tend to be dangerous to do because of the fact if too much heat is released too quickly it can even cause explosions.  Most lab accidents I've seen are usually because someone performed the mortal sin of chemistry by scaling up an exothermic reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The flameless ration heater, used in the military for its Meals, Ready-to-Eat, uses an exothermic reaction to boil water.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flameless_ration_heater" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flameless_ration_heater</a></p>
<p>The MRE heater contains magnesium metal, iron, and table salt. Upon addition of water, the magnesium is oxidized exothermically. Because of the presence of iron and table salt, the reaction occurs quickly enough to produce boiling water.</p>
<p>An instant cold pack is an example of an endothermic reaction. Some solids, such as ammonium nitrate, dissolve in water endothermically. In an instant cold pack, the middle section containing the solid is broken to allow it to mix with the surrounding water. The resulting endothermic reaction draws heat from the surroundings. The water in the instant cold pack does not freeze, though, and the temperature will generally be slightly above freezing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! It can be a hazard in the lab or even with something like making homemade soap!  Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or more commonly, lye, is a an important ingredient in homemade soap along with various oils. Mixing the NaOH into water to make an aqueous solution can be so exothermic that the water has the potential to boil!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is also a big problem for the chemical industry too. You have to be careful on the large reaction scale that the solvent you use doesn't boil during the desired reaction or you end up blowing up your vessel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
