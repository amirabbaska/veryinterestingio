		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anything that is sent to Mars is thoroughly inspected, cleaned, and sanitized {<a href="https://marsmobile.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/insituexploration/planetaryprotection/" target="_blank">marsmobile.jpl.nasa.gov</a>}. There are some microorganisms that can still survive a trip to Mars, such as a well-known <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade" target="_blank">Tardigrade (Wiki)</a>. That's the main reason rovers avoid parts of the planet that contain water or ice - they can still carry Earth's life and contaminate it {<a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-nasa-s-mars-rovers-are-banned-from-investigating-that-liquid-water" target="_blank">sciencealert.com</a>}.</p>
<p>So far all life-detecting tests done by rovers are interpreted as negative. If we find a sign of life on Mars, we will make sure it's not brought by us from Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Answering a few questions that keep repeating.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Why do we refrain from contaminating Mars? Wouldn't that be an interesting experiment?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be, but before we do that, we want to make sure there is no native life on Mars that we might accidentally destroy (as we often do).  If we find micro-organisms there, it would be nice to study them without our own organisms getting in the way wherever we go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wouldn't a manned mission contaminate Mars?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will. Before we can send humans to Mars we will have to modify the rules of the Outer Space Treaty. Hopefully we can find life there before we send humans. If not, hopefully the first humans will find life. If we don't, it's pretty clear there is no life there. But we will not be colonizing and terraforming Mars until this question is answered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Shouldn't we search for life in water-rich zones, instead of the opposite?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, ideally we should, but because our rovers are not 100% clean, letting invasive life forms flourish in Mars's potentially already living waters, before we have a chance to at least send a few of them back to us, is just not worth it. On top of that, we don't need to check water contents to determine if Mars has life - the atmosphere and soil can give us enough clues to answer that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Don't we have the technology to sterilize things to 100%? Or are we that neglectful?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We do have the technology, and we can use it with ease. The problem is that if you want to sterilize a circuit board, you end up frying it. One proposed idea is to build a rover on Mars with 3D printers, and sterilize all the necessary materials separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually wrote my thesis along these lines
I was studying Antarctic yeast species, which live in cold, dry environments and are exposed to incredible amounts of uv radiation. In other words, very similar conditions to space.  Numerous studies have found that they in fact can survive in space, so it's entirely possible that other microbes could survive the trip to Mars. The yeast I studied ate rocks, do they may even be able to reproduce on Mars as well.  We try to sanitize most stuff that gets sent to space, because on the off chance there is native alien life ( bacteria and what not) we don't want to accidently kill it off with an invasive species</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>When the mars rover went to mars were they able to remove all bacteria and small life from it?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, no. It is almost impossible to remove every single cell/spore from rovers.</p>
<p>Rovers are assembled in clean rooms (where the air is filtered), human contact is limited, surfaces are cleaned with alcohol and other harsh chemicals. Heat tolerant parts are heated to 110C (230F) and electronics are sealed. Surfaces are also regularly tested to determine bioburden levels <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/insituexploration/planetaryprotection/" target="_blank">(1)</a><a href="https://www.space.com/6136-mars-mission-contamination-big-concern.html" target="_blank">(2)</a>. Despite all the protocols, clean rooms are filthy (biologically speaking) and contain their own unique microbiological communities<a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2007/070903/full/news070903-5.html" target="_blank">(3)</a><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/nasa-clean-room-contaminated-fungus" target="_blank">(4)</a>. </p>
<p>Earth life is pretty tough. Its for this reason that Martian rovers are not allowed to explore certain regions, why Cassini had to plunge into Saturn (To protect Enceladus and Titan), and why Juno has to plunge into Jupiter at the end of its mission (To protect Europa). There is always a risk that contamination may reach these planets</p>
<p>This idea forms the guiding principle of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_protection" target="_blank">Planetary Protection Protocols</a> . This is the idea that any interplanetary missions should do everything possible to prevent contamination. Scientists spend a <strong>long</strong> time calculating risk of contamination into excruciating detail. NASA set a minimum risk of contamination below 0.001&#37; and missions have to plan for 50 years after a mission ends.</p>
<p>The more we learn about microbes the crazier things gets and there is a lot of ongoing research into extremophiles. Microbes are really good at <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultraviolet-light-could-be-what-protects-alien-life-from-earth-bacteria" target="_blank">stowing away</a> on space craft. When microbes are stressed they can produce endospores**,** that allow them to survive the extreme conditions of space (massive temperature fluxes, low pressure, low nutrients, high radiation).  We also know microbes survive on the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/living-bacteria-from-outer-space-found-clinging-to-iss-alien-life" target="_blank">outside</a> of the space station. Also, microbes from Earth have been deliberately left on the outside and have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11039206" target="_blank">survived for up to 553 days !</a>. So space isn't as deadly as we imagine it to be, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_microorganisms_tested_in_outer_space#cite_note-:0-1" target="_blank">at least for microbes.</a></p>
<p>For the most recent Mars arrival, the Mars Trace Gas Orbiter (And Schiaparelli lander), there's a lot of info on how they minimised contamination <a href="http://exploration.esa.int/mars/57581-planetary-protection/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>So yes, it is possible that cells may reach these planets</p>
<p><strong>If not could any of the bacteria be able to live in the harsh conditions of mars?</strong></p>
<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Mars_habitability" target="_blank">here</a> for modern Martian habitability. This is one of the fundamental questions of Astrobiological research.</p>
<p>There isn't an obvious answer to this one as there are many factors.</p>
<p>Your question is referring to <strong>Forward Contamination</strong>, meaning the risk of missions taking Earth Microbes to Mars.  Despite the super strict cleaning protocols and rigorous mission design, there is still a risk that a microbe may reach the surface of Mars. However, once its there its problems have only just begun. Conditions on Mars are pretty tough. The main problem for microbes is the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/uv-light-could-easily-kill-microbial-stowaways-mars" target="_blank">UV radiation</a>. Simulation studies have shown that 99.9&#37; of populations would be inactivated within a few seconds on Mars, and that within 1 day surfaces will be completely sterile(<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103503002008" target="_blank">6</a>,<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00924210" target="_blank">7</a>).</p>
<p>Having said that, we know microbes are tough and there is always a risk that we don't know enough about the survivability of microbes to be sure we wont contaminate Mars. If microbes were to enter the soil, it is likely that they may be preserved from the sterilising UV radiation, (below the top few mm), and many simulation studies show microbes may survive within the soil  (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063312002334" target="_blank">7</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103563900241" target="_blank">8</a>, <a href="http://aem.asm.org/content/12/3/215.short" target="_blank">9</a>).</p>
<p>Potentially habitable regions of Mars are called <strong>Special regions</strong> and missions are currently prohibited from going near these regions. These regions include environments where liquid water exists and may have existed within the last 500 years <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2016.1472" target="_blank">(10)</a>.</p>
<p>If microbes piggy backed on a rover to Mars, it is likely that the contamination would be localised to the rover and the rover would be sterilised pretty soon after landing.  Sending microbes to Mars, in itself, isn't a bad thing. We just need to be sure they dont make it to the areas we know are habitable.</p>
<p>Some may survive, but to actually be active they require habitable conditions and need to be removed from the harsh radiation environment.</p>
<p><strong>And how do they obtain soil samples looking for bacteria if it could possibly be from the rover itself?</strong></p>
<p>So this is why its vitally important we do not forward contaminate Mars. An important thing to note is the majority of science is aimed at looking at evidence for past life. We know Mars was wet, warmer and had an atmosphere in its past and its much easier to identify biosignatures (whifs of life) than it is to identify something that is living, at least if we are doing it remotely.</p>
<p>The real question (as you have highlighted) would be is it definitely <strong>not</strong> Earth life. This is much harder and requires a rigorous methodology.</p>
<p>One way would be to identify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopic_signature" target="_blank">isotopic signatures</a> (different 'versions' of the same element) that we find in preserved material or in potentially living materials. For example, say that we have a bunch of cells, we could see what the isotopic signature of the biomass was. This biomass would be built of either Martian elements or Earth elements - which each have different isotopic signatures. However, to be accurate, we would need to analyse it on Earth.</p>
<p>In my mind, the simplest way would be to get genetic info on the microbe. If we managed to get genetic info on the Martian microbe, it would be pretty easy to tell whether it was related to Earth life or not. However there are complications. It is probable that Earth life may be quite similar to Martian life as Earth and Mars have exchanged material over their histories'(<a href="https://www.astrobio.net/mars/earth-and-mars-may-have-shared-seeds-of-life/" target="_blank">11</a>).</p>
<p>Ultimately all the questions you are asking are the questions that hundreds of scientists are asking themselves daily, and ultimately there is more that we <strong>don't know</strong> than we know. So we need to be careful. Answering the most fundamental question of 'are we alone?' requires a rigorous methodology so that we can be sure of the answer and this means preventing any form of contamination.</p>
