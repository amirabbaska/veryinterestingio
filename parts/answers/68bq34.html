		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you build a spherical shell around the sun, just bigger than the sun itself, and that the shell is absorbing all the incident radiation. Each square-meter of this shell would be receiving a very large amount of power from the sun. Then imagine you double the radius of that shell. Now, because its surface area is four times the size but it's still receiving the total output of the sun, each square meter receives one-fourth that which it was receiving when the shell was smaller. Now imagine you expand the shell even more, so that it has the same radius as Earth's orbit. Now the total output of the sun is divided among a <em>very</em> large area, so each individual area is not receiving nearly as much energy. So the light isn't losing energy, it's just getting more spread out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a visual aid to what others have already described. Here's a crappy <a href="http://i.imgur.com/bB7CgLP.jpg" target="_blank">photoshop image</a> of a sun. It's shining out 32 photons in equal directions (white lines). The brown planet is very close and you can see it gets hit by 3 photons from the sun. By contrast, the blue planet, even though it's larger, is only struck by one photon. This is an absurdly simplified example of how the light energy gets weaker as you get further from the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some great answer already pointing out that the attenuation is due to the geometry of 'spherical spreading'</p>
<p>I'd also like to just throw out there, that if for whatever reason, instead of having a sun (which is like a point source), we had an infinite plane of sun-like light sources, distance from this infinite plane would not affect how much light reaches any point in space. Its constant!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>How does 'empty' space diminish this energy? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is simply due to distance. The same happens with a light source on Earth: the light from a light bulb diminishes with distance because as distance from the light source increases, the light gets spread out over a larger area so that light intensity per unit of surface area (m^2) decreases.  For every doubling of the distance, the intensity decreases with factor 4. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplest explanation is just to look at the formula for the surface area of a sphere: A = 4*pi*r^2.  The power radiated by a star is evenly distributed over that surface.  In order to find the power per unit area you simply divide the by the total area in question which in this case contains an r^2 term.  So as you move farther out, the power received at any point gets divided by the square of the distance, commonly known as the inverse square law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
