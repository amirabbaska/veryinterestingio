		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was just the straw that broke the camel's back. The fire killed 32 people and injured over 100 in a club that had no authorization from the city hall or the firefighters unit. The owners were conducting business &quot;covered&quot; by a declaration that they are responsible for conducting business in this old communist factory. This could have been done if they had bribed the local authorities. Romania's bureaucracy is very, very intricate and there is a strong propensity to evade the laws and regulations by bribing several officials. Romanians have had enough with bribing, corruption and abuse of power by the local and state officials. Now they finally realized that corruption kills. Previously to this gruesome accident, the  Romanian PM was involved in an aggressive borderline illegal govt take-over - 2012, a plagiarism scandal - 2012, a slew of outright lies, and a formal corruption accusation - 2014, 2015. Both local and central govts are accused constantly for decades now that they hire relatives and close friends, and keep the corruption circle going. On a side note, the mayor general of Bucharest was arrested last month while caught taking a 5000 euros bribe. The Romanian anti-corruption department - DNA - is decimating the corrupt political class. The Romanian citizens see that every day, every week, on and on, and want a whole new political class. Let me know if you'd like more. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm just gonna bring another slightly different perspective, but it's mostly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3rkqgy/eli5_why_has_the_nightclub_fire_in_bucharest_led/cwoy58a" target="_blank">what /u/mountaintop said</a>.</p>
<p>The tragedy is extremely relatable for everyone, because basically all the nightclubs are like that - small, usually underground, with no safe exit, no sprinklers, no safety checks etc. It could have been any of us.</p>
<p>The thing is, we naturally want to blame someone for this, but you don't know who. The guy that planned the fireworks inside has a part of the blame, as do the guys who allowed them to do so, as do the owners who didn't buy fire-proof material (and probably bribed a few guys to get the club running), as do the guys who probably took the bribe to allow the club to function, as do the local officials who don't do anything about a thousand other clubs in the same condition. </p>
<p>People want to blame someone, but the entire system is corrupt, so we blame the system. The local mayor came out and his first reaction after this was &quot;It's not my fault, all my papers are in order&quot;. There's a general sense of confusion, everyone is saying different things and wants different things, but basically, people are scared, they are motivated, and they want things to change. Not exactly sure how, but not like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the place was not up to code. That building should not have been allowed to operate at the capacities it constantly did. But it was allowed, and as a result almost 100 people died, and almost 200 more are seriously injured.</p>
<p>This isn't a new thing. This isn't a once in a while thing. There may have been quite a few more deaths than usual. But this type of shit happens all the time. &quot;How can such blatant disregard for safety standards be permitted?&quot; You might ask. And that's a question that these people want answers to. And the simple answer is that it's cheaper for businesses to bribe officials rather than actually keep shit up to codes. So a lot of shit isn't kept to code. And a lot of the public suffers as a result. And it's all because the officials are so damn cheap to bribe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not directly related, but adding to what others have already said. It seems like an another case of a straw that broke the camel's back. </p>
<p>It actually draws many parallel lines with the sinking of Sewol ferry in South Korea which killed 295 people (mostly secondary school students). It resulted in a massive public uproar and protests, resulting in resignation of many government officials. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_MV_Sewol" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_MV_Sewol</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a straw that broke the camel's back type deal. The protests are against large amounts of corruption in the Romanian government. The nightclub fire acted as a catalyst for the protests because part of why it was so bad was that the nightclub didn't meet basic safety standards like having more than one exit, likely because safety officials were bribed to look the other way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
