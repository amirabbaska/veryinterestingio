		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the chemicals in your brain (neurotransmitters) that normally make you feel happy are tied to your body's natural internal clock (circadian rhythm). Aside from your body producing less of those when you are tired/usually sleeping, this is also the time when your body repairs itself. </p>
<p>If you force yourself to stay awake for a long period, all of the &quot;unnecessary&quot; functions usually managed by a healthy, well-maintained brain not required for immediate survival are partitioned away or outright shut off. This sort of process occurs for almost every system of the body - digestive, energy production, brain chemistry, etc.</p>
<p>You becomes dull, your reaction time slows down, critical thinking goes out the window, emotional sensitivity disappears, and your body gradually starts to wear down faster. This is why people can - eventually - die from a lack of sleep. It impacts everything down to the folding of protean strands in your DNA and cellular water retention. </p>
<p>I can ELI10 for more detailed stuff on stages of sleep and situation awareness if asked, but that's only tertiarily related to the main question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As Ghostfreax pointed out already, when you’re tired, your dopamine levels drop and thus you’re “less happy”. Also - and that’s just a non-scientific wide guess by myself - people tend to appear friendly because they try to and push aside things that annoy and aggravate them. When you are tired, you mostly are not motivated to “put up with other people”. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can thank your adenosine for that. Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that builds up in your system throughout the day, more so if you are really active. As you get more adenosine built up, your body gets more exhausted and your brain responds to that by telling you to take care of yourself and go to sleep, getting increasingly insistent.
Additionally, caffeine looks like adenosine to your receptors, effectively blocking your uptake of adenosine and fighting off the message to get some rest. That's why coffee can give you what feels like a boost, however it is actually just a short reprieve. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So you got your scientific explanations below, but I always find analogies more helpful for understanding the WHY of questions like this.  Which comes down to evolution of course.  In this case, the evolution of allocating resources and managing bodily processes.  </p>
<p>As it turns out, nature figured out the same thing most businesses learn, which is that you have to account for your limits and focus your resources.  Say you run a business.  Doesn't matter what kind, but say it involves customers in your property and lots of equipment too.  You may discovery that when customers are on your property, it's very difficult to do certain tasks, like moving lots of inventory around without running someone over, or making major repairs during business hours, or remodeling the building as needed, etc.  So you establish business hours of course.  </p>
<p>Your business hours are scheduled to accommodate your customers.  Customers are where your money comes from and money determines how many employees and work hours you get and how much you have to spend on equipment and expenses.  You want to be open as much as possible when they would be shopping, while leaving enough off hours to get everything done that's necessary behind the scenes to keep the business working.  If customers come in and you're out of stock, or your equipment doesn't work, or your building is falling apart, your entire business is at risk.  Serving your customers during the day is vital, but so is keeping your business functional.  </p>
<p>At night you also save resources by shutting off your phones, dimming the lights, and turning off much of the equipment.  The employees who run that equipment go home, but others come in for stuff like repairs and stocking inventory.</p>
<p>Now at start and the end of the work day your business is not at peak performance.  In the morning you've got night crew cleaning up and putting their stuff away, and their workers still making their way out and getting in the way.  Same goes for the day crew closing up shop impeding night functions.  Peak performance is instead scheduled to coincide with peak business, i.e. when customer volume is highest or when all operations have ramped up and reach peak production.  In fact, that's when the vast majority of business is done in a relatively small window.  The rest of the time is prep and gearing up for the rush.   Your peak hours depend on your business.  Maybe it's noon, maybe it's dinner time, maybe there's multiple rushes.</p>
<p>So that's your body: it's designed to function best at evolutionary peak hours, when you need to go out and obtain food without messing up and dying.  Waking up and falling asleep are your transition times, and nothing works right in these periods, including controlling your mood.  Sometimes these transitions are automated (circadian rhythms/operations that automatically turn off) other times they are manually implemented (adrenaline from fear of a predator/overtime work to deal with special demand).  But the transitions can be rocky periods where things don't function optimally.  There's a lag between waking up and reaching peak performance, and between peak performance and readiness for sleep.  </p>
<p>The WHY then, is because it's an efficient use of resources that works with the established bodily processes.  It maximizes performance at peak hours but assigns off-hours for rest and repair.  The transition between them is rough because of the limits of starting and stopping the bodily processes, and this affects many aspects of your biology including your mood.  </p>
<p>You may ask, why not just start at full blast, with everything at peak performance right away?  Firstly it's a waste of energy, because it simply isn't possible for all your processes to be ready at one precise moment.  Instead it takes awhile to get some things going, so your body tries to start everything at its own pace and slowly work toward getting everything in sync at peak.  In other words, if your workers come in amped up on Mountain Dew ready to go at 5am, but the equipment takes two hours to start, you've got workers worn out by the time everything is in place to start.  OR you start the equipment early, but now you're spending more on electric and getting in the way of the other shift that needs things shut off.  </p>
<p>Instead, the body tries to manage a dynamic change-over where both day and night functions can operate during transition, but slowly you are working toward peak day or night function.  You don't want the body sprinting toward sleep and you pass out while hunting prey or being chased by a predator, nor do you want to start straight up from sleep and expend all your energy before you've even left the cave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
