		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lava that comes out of a volcano is full of minerals containing phosphorus, potassium, etc. The things that plants need to grow.</p>
<p>As the lava rock gets broken down and mixed with organic material, it creates a nutritious soil for plants.</p>
<p>Over time, nutrients get washed or blown away by rain and wind, returning nutrients to the sea or other areas. The soil becomes less fertile as the nutrients are lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many nutrients for plants are used in form of ions. Soils typically can hold either positively charged ions or negativelly (depending on soil composition). Volcanic soil can retain both ion types (+ and - charged), making it a really fertile matrix. At least that is what I kept from edaphology classes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
