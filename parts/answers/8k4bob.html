		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Polarization. Simply put: Sunglasses with polarized lenses align the light in one direction. The tint is an imperfect film that has certain polarizing effects on light as well. When you have the shades on, you’re able to see the alignment of the tinted application. </p>
<p>Try this with cheap shades. You won’t see anything. Any sunglasses with polarized lenses will show off other polarized items. Even the aftermarket screen protectors on some phones are polarized, you’ll see the pattern as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spots on glass are caused by the glass in that spot being under direct contact from a cooling fan and the glass cooling quicker in that spot. Thus altering how the light waves pass through those spots, which is noticeable through polarized glasses. Not related to the tint. </p>
<p>This is only the case on tempered automotive glass (anything that isn’t a windshield) due to the manufacturing process. This is why people associate the “spots” or “grid” with tint, since people don’t normally tint windshields and only tint the tempered glass. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The grid is caused by the tempered glass. The tempering process places a grid pattern of stress in the glass itself. Those regions of stress cause light to twist as it passes through. Your polarizer lets you see those patterns of twists. If you go to Google Images and search for &quot;polarized light stress analysis&quot;, you'll see some beautiful images of this effect.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/273439/grid-pattern-on-a-car-window-when-viewed-through-polarized-sunglasses" target="_blank">stack exchange article</a> has a photo of this effect that probably closely matches what you're seeing.</p>
<p>I don't know what window tinting has to do with it unless it served to darken the glass enough to let the grid pattern be obvious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light travels as a squiggly line, going up and down, side to side or in any other diagonal direction. A polarization filter is basically something with very tiny slits in it that only lets light pass if it squiggles in a certain way, blocking all other light.</p>
<p>Now if two filters are behind each other, it depends on how the slits are angled to each other. If they are nearly the same, lots of light pass through both. If they're different, less or even no light at all passes through them both.</p>
<p>Now, glass is made in a way that polarizes light, which changes throughout the pane. If you see light polarized through glass through another polarizing filter, like a good pair of sunglasses, the different angles make that pattern visible because different amounts of light pass through. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Polarization. </p>
<p>Because you are wearing polarized sunglasses and the car window has partial spotty accidental polarization. A second polarization filter further reduces the visible light creating the effect you describe. So it has nothing to do with the “tint” of the film used for making your car windows look fly. </p>
<p>Further explanation:</p>
<p>The tint is like a volume knob on your TV. Overall light is reduced after passing through the “tint” filter. </p>
<p>Keeping the same analogy, polarization is more of like a specific or fine tuning of the bass or treble knob. </p>
<p>Light is made up of unpolarized waves that go up and down. You can thinking of a uniform squiggly line that a 5yo might use to represent the ocean in a drawing. </p>
<p>A polarization filter is like a white picket fence. You could pass the drawing through the picket fence on its side but the paper would not pass through the picket fence if it were “flat” like it would be sitting on a desk. </p>
<p>This means that the polarized filter only lets certain waves of light through to your eyes or effectively reduces the amount of light you see. </p>
<p>So when looking at the ocean with polarized glasses, some of the light you would generally see without a filter that makes up blinding glare is eliminated. Net result is you can see the surface of the water and what might be directly below the surface better. Like a fish. </p>
<p>Or when driving into the sun, the glare coming off the road is reduced. </p>
<p>Polarized sunglasses work great for reducing the glare when fishing or driving but things can get funky when you have more than one polarizing filter. For example, a lot of LCD displays use a polarizing filter - to reduce glare on your GPS while driving. So when you look at your phone or the dashboard display with polarized glasses on... too much light is getting filtered and you get a weird visual effect. </p>
<p>Now for automobile glass that has been “bent” or “curved” to match the contour of a vehicle, like the windshield or especially the rear window... the “stressing” of the glass can create a second “accidental” polarized filter. This further reduces the amount of light you see and creates the “grid” effect. </p>
<p>Get two pairs of polarized sun glasses and line them up so you can look through both lenses at a light source like a lamp or outside. The visual effect will be similar to looking through a single lens - only darker. But if you turn one pair of sunglasses on it’s side. You’ll see almost a complete filtration of all the light. You can imagine trying to pass the 5yo wave drawing through a single picket fence. Or even two single picket fences but if one fence is turned on it’s side - you ain’t passing that drawing through the fence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
