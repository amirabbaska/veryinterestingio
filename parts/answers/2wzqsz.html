		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several major reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Animals in the wild rarely die natural deaths. Nature is cruel, and most animals meet their end inside the stomach of a bigger predator, which means there is no distinguishable body to be found. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scavengers. NYC is full of them. Rats, ants, roaches, flies. You name it. A group of scavengers can pick a pigeon clean in less than a few hours, so the few bodies that do actually hit the ground are being devoured fairly quickly. </p>
</li>
<li>If an animal does die of natural causes (old age or disease) it doesn't just drop dead mid flight. They know when they are dying, and will go to some place secluded. The concrete jungle that is NYC is absolutely full of places for them to hide. Roof tops and subway systems just being two of the major areas where a pigeon could fly to and stay in  a secluded area if it knows it's dying. Of course, this wraps back around to the first point, that if an elderly pigeon is weak and dying, it's just easy prey for anything that wants to eat it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very few wild animals die of natural causes like old age or whatever. As they get older and weaker a predator like a hawk (and there are now lots of hawks in most major cities) or even a stray cat picks them off.</p>
<p>The ones that do age into infirmity tend to huddle themselves up in a crevice or under a bridge or something before passing away.</p>
<p>And if the pigeon were to die in a place you might see it, it would be accessible to rats, so it's probably already long gone.</p>
<p>It's the circle of life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals usually don't normally just drop dead while going about their daily business, they will go somewhere secluded if they are weak and dying. For a similar reason, you're also pretty unlikely to ever see a pigeon's eggs or babies, they keep them in places that are higher up and inaccessible. I am sure spiderman has seen a ton of dead pigeons, if he is real.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well I don't know about New York, but in Chicago there are volunteers for the Field Museum of Natural History who walk around very early in the morning picking up dead birds that have flown into windows and such. They put them in plastic bags and write down the date/time and location and bring it to the museum for the specimen collections. On average they probably get about 100 birds a day. These will go into the freezer until someone (usually a volunteer) has time to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/oXCevPs.jpg" target="_blank">stuff</a> them. Or the carcasses will go to the beetle room where the bones get picked and cleaned. Because, you know... science. There are hundreds of thousands of specimens just sitting in drawers. It's a fantastic resource for scientists and artists.  Also, there are predators. A few falcons are intentionally released and tracked downtown for population control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
