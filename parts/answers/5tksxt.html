		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bricking generally means making completely unusable at the hardware level.  The reason that computers rarely get bricked is that we RARELY do any manipulation of the computer at the hardware level.  To brick a computer, you would need to break the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) which pretty much no one non-techy messes with.  If you break windows, you can still reinstall windows. If you break the BIOS, you can hose things pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The other aspect is that even with the BIOS, I can't think of ANYONE who would be messing around with the BIOS without using the official manufacturer's files.  Most of the time you're messing with phones, you are doing so with custom firmware/ROM's, which means something made by someone other than the manufacturer.  If you're flashing your BIOS, you're almost always going to be doing it with something provided (and quality controlled, tested, etc) by the company who made the product.</p>
<p>So it comes down to two factors: </p>
<p>1) for computers, you generally don't tinker at such a deep level that you're going to risk bricking it</p>
<p>2) Even if you are messing at that level, you're not doing anything that is not officially approved of by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The final aspect is the fact that it's relatively easy to replace a computer (especially a desktop) part.  If something in your phone breaks, 90% of us are just going to give up because it's so hard to replace.  Most of the stuff that's likely to go bad is also easily replaced/substituted.  I fried my sound card on one of my desktops a few months back, and for $10 I just plugged in a new sound card.  If I killed the speaker on my phone, I'd say fuck it and just buy a new phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PCs are built with openness in mind. Meaning on a PC you can install different OSs, boot from different media, install different hardware and so on. It's all under the users control and if you screw things up, you just boot from a USB stick or DVD and recover easily. PCs are meant to be tinkered with and handle accidents well. Even for accidents in the mids of a BIOS upgrade many mainboards have ways to recover from that.</p>
<p>Phones, tablets and game consoles are the complete opposite, they are locked down so that the user has little to no control about what is going on. Meaning a lot of tinkering has to happen in areas that the manufacturer didn't intent to be tinkered with or actively tried to prevent tinkering in. This means the tinkerer is walking a minefield and any error might put the device into an unrecoverable state.</p>
<p>All of this is not an accident, but by design. If manufacturers wanted to, they could make phones as easy to recover as a PC by letting the user boot from SDcard or access the internal flash storage via USB. Case in point, many bricked PSP could be recovered after people found out that booting from the memory card was possible via a modified battery. The feature was there all along, but not documented by Sony to prevent hacking.</p>
<p>Another issue is that even if the device allows you to recover, you would still need the data to put on the device to recover it. On a PC you have Windows install discs, Linux distributions and all that readily available to reinstall on a blank device. Getting the OS image for your phone might not be that easy.</p>
<p>To make things further more complicated, the ecosystem around those devices is not standardized and discoverable, which makes it hard to create software that works across different devices. A Linux distribution will work on essentially any PC, but you can't make a Linux distribution that will work as easily on every phone as all the hardware around ARM varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually can brick a computer if you manage to turn it off during a bios update for example. Android has something similiar to computers bios, called OEM bootloader. It is being run before the operating system, just like bios in computer. The thing is, if you want to replace the operating system in your computer, you do not need to replace or do anything at all with your bios. Bios by default allows you to boot from usb or cd/dvd and so you can judt install the OS freely. This is not true for android, most android  phones are OEM locked, and their modloader often also disables ability to access recovery mode, which allows you to flash custom OS, just like booting in your computer. Here is the key part, you as an user, have by default full access to your computer as an administrator (you can install whatever program you want, do whatever you want with your pc, you can even overclock your processor), but for your phone you do not have administrator rights , so you are limited to the OS ans settings set to you by the company . To bypass this and gain full control of your phone, you need to do something called rooting a phone. Rooting can be dangerous as it most of the time takes replacing the bootloader. If you fail to replace the bootloader properly, you brick your phone, as it is unable to start even the loading process before OS. This is a hard brick. Soft brick is when the OS you flashed (installed) is broken and the bootloader can not load it, you can still just flash another. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned you can brick a motherboard if you try hard enough. When I was a kid, I flashed a BIOS upgrade onto my dads machine, except I accidentally flashed the file for almost the same version (think XXXXX+ vs XXXXX Pro or similar) - and it totally let it flash, and upon rebooting, the machine was dead.</p>
<p>So I panicked, because like, it's my dads PC right and he's not going to understand what I was trying to do, he's just going to be mad. And I can't afford to buy a device to reflash the chip, nor did I have any idea how to make one, at the time.</p>
<p>But then I remembered my machine had the exact same motherboard, and took a look and, yay, the chip was removable. So I ask a bunch of random people on IRC if it would be sane/possible to boot my machine, get it all ready to flash the correct firmware, then while the machine is on, pull out the BIOS chip and replace it with the dead one, and flash it from the system that's already booted. This seemed to make sense to me, but they all told me it was stupid and would break the other one. (I've since found out that, obviously, I did not invent this idea, but hey I was really young, when you're young you came up with everything first)</p>
<p>Desperate kids will do anything an adult tells them not too, though, so I did it anyway and it worked. Didn't get hit with a belt that day! :&gt;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>phones have good reasons to mess around with the hardware code - since they put in stupid things that prevent you from doing things that you want and that the device is capable of, and its pretty much a requirement to fiddle around with the OS</p>
<p>computers there just isnt a good reason to. you dont need to do anything to the bios in order to install different OS versions and there are no real benefits that i can think of even as a techy. ive flashed a bios once and it was with software the company provided me. years of tech experience and it only required it once... but ive flashed every phone i had. </p>
<p>i really dont think its that easy to brick a phone. ive never bricked one and every problem i ran into while flashing it was fixable. i think alot of the time its people just getting confused and throwing in the towel rather than them actually bricking it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
