<p>It really depends on what types of traits you mean.  H.M. (Henry Molaison) is the best studied case of amnesia, though he had both retrograde amnesia (memory loss), and complete anterograde amnesia (cannot make new memories).</p>
<p>After a surgery, he lost certain memories of his past, and most of the last few years before the surgery.  More noticeable was his inability to remember anything past short term working memory.
He was kept in an institution until he passed, where he would take part in experiments and studies.</p>
<p>H.M. Would not remember you if you walked into his room, introduced yourself, left for 15 minutes, and return.  If you played chess with him, he did not improve day to day.  If you taught him history or writing, he would not learn.  However, a skill game like darts he could improve on.  He would excuse his skill as beginners luck.  As per personality or more long term changes, he got very sad and spend several days going to church after being told his mother had passed away the first time, not knowing why.  He still got sad when he has to be told this, but it was less intense, and less impactful.  I'm not 100% sure, but I think I remember him having a similar response to his own reflection, where repeated experiences dulled the emotional response.</p>
<p>This is for one person, who had a specific surgery, so theres no way to say this is the case for other patients.  However, the takeaways I picked up were that: </p>
<ol>
<li>His condition specifically focused on the formation of episodic and declarative memories. </li>
<li>
<p>His emotional structures were intact.  I think this because he was able to have a persistent emotional reaction over several days, including sleep where he was unconscious, and unable to hold onto the event.</p>
</li>
<li>His muscle control and cerebellar timing can still learn, and is unaffected by the memory loss.</li>
</ol>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amnesia is a common trope in film, but is a rare and more complicated condition in reality.  People don't just get hit in the head with a coconut, can't remember their name or who their friends are, AND can still function normally.  </p>
<p>Most conditions which render a person unable to remember things are combined with the inability to function normally in other ways.  Dementia, stroke.  Bedridden and don't know what day it is- they can't just get dressed, walk out, and get lunch and make new friends.</p>
<p>Of that, the &quot;fugue state&quot; is the most uniquely interesting condition, as a person can function normally and appear more or less normal to others, but have truly forgotten who they are and yet mostly unaware of that hole in their life story.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
