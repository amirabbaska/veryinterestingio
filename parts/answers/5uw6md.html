		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Warfarin and other drugs are metabolized (broken down) into active or inactive compounds by enzymes in your liver. Grapefruit and other foods contain substances that can inhibit the activity of these enzymes, stopping the metabolism of these drugs. It can either lead to dangerously high levels of the drugs remaining in your system, or in the case of drugs that need to be broken down before they're active, dangerously low levels as the pro-drug you've taken isn't getting metabolized properly.
Also, it can result in other enzymes acting on drugs that aren't usually active or sufficiently active, resulting in the wrong kind of metabolite forming, which can be harmful as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical Student.   </p>
<p>Many drugs are metabolized by a certain enzyme called CYP P450 (or other enzymes that are also within the CYP family). Warfarin is one of these drugs. CYP P450 is basically what is breaking down warfarin in your body.  </p>
<p>So, anything that changes how CYP P450 does its job of breaking down warfarin will impact how warfarin works. Different drugs and other things (grapefruit juice, St. John's wort) either make CYP work better or inhibit CYP.   </p>
<p>If CYP is made to work better, for instance by St John's wort (commonly used for over the counter mild depression), then CYP will be breaking down warfarin super fast. The warfarin can be broken down so fast that it does not reach the level needed to actually thin the persons blood. To say again, by inducing CYP to breakdown warfarin better, warfarin cannot reach therapeutic levels.   </p>
<p>Another example is the CYP inhibitor cimetidine, which is commonly found in over the counter stomach medication (it's an antacid). Cimetidine is a CYP inhibitor, meaning CYP is not breaking down warfarin as well as usually. So, since warfarin is not being broken down, it causes warfarin to reach possibly toxic levels. Patients are at increased risk of bleeding.   </p>
<p>Overall, warfarin is not that great of drug, partially because it is dependent on CYP for breakdown and for a variety of other reasons. It also requires constant monitoring because it can be difficult to maintain within therapeutic range. Look up the list of things warfarin interacts with, and you'll be surprised that it's the most commonly prescribed drug thinner in the U.S.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The enzymes in the liver that metabolizes drugs are specifically called cytochrome P450. Grapefruit juice will inhibit an isoform of P450, specifically CYP3A4, in your liver. If warfarin level in bloodstream is not being metabolized, it stays in your blood and your concentration may become toxic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grapefruits contain furanocoumarins, which mess with a particular enzyme that decomposes a lot of drugs.  On the one hand, that means if you eat a grapefruit, the drug can stick around in your system, and next time you take a pill you've actually got a double dose.  On the other hand, some drugs are actually precursors of the active chemical, so no enzyme = no active drug.</p>
<p>The cranberry interaction is contested, and I'm not aware of any study that's shown how it actually interferes with drugs.</p>
<p>And of course, vitamin K is the antidote to Warfarin, so you'd want to keep your dietary levels of that steady.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question has been answered pretty well, but I thought I'd chime in... I've been on warfarin for almost 5 years. I have a genetic clotting disorder; about 1/3 of my extended family has the same thing. Which is all awful!</p>
<p>But I think others in the thread have made warfarin sound worse than it is. I barely even think about it anymore. Every day I have the same amount of vitamin K by measuring out some broccoli on a food scale. This is second nature to me now and takes no extra time. (It's also helpful for counting calories w/ other foods.) I know (roughly) the translation of that amount of broccoli to other common vitamin K greens like lettuce, and I know the foods to completely avoid (kale is ridiculously high in K).</p>
<p>Blood draws are also not an issue. I have a home testing machine that involves just pricking your finger. You barely feel it and you get the results near-instantaneously. My levels have been A-OK for the last 5 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
