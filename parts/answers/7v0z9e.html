		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Yes and no. There is no direct connection between having and education and then getting more education as a result. However, education leads to more money and more money leads to more opportunities for education and more success in obtaining education, both for an individual and for that individual's children. It would be perfectly correct to say that the Wealth Gap has created an Education Gap because the American education system is so dependent upon local economies.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sociology professor here.</p>
<p>It can be stated as a scientific fact that <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=FpkMaxCWUsMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=america+wealth+disparity&amp;ots=mfq68ureXx&amp;sig=3pdwpch0YiMTgCa2g2QS8eoRVJU#v=onepage&amp;q=america%20wealth%20disparity&amp;f=false" target="_blank">wealth inequality exists in America.</a>. It can also be stated as a scientific fact that <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-EiLBQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=america+wealth+disparity&amp;ots=UUSV9oWRtc&amp;sig=uN3VqNhDi4H_TaB14KEdeIzlRXI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">wealthy individuals are more likely to graduate high school, graduate college, and obtain advanced degrees</a>. Therefore, the wider the inequality in wealth the wider the inequality in education.</p>
<p>However, there is a worse problem that's hidden in that statement. Education attainment is not a perfect indicator of how educated a person is. That's sort of counter intuitive, so here is an example:</p>
<p>Group A) A poor section of town has low property values which means less taxes that fund schools. This then means that the school cannot hire the best teachers because it cannot pay very well. This means that the education being received by students is delivered by average or below average teachers, that textbooks and campus facilities are more likely to be outdated, and that after-school activities and extra curriculars are more likely to utilize sub-par equipment.</p>
<p>Group B) A wealthy neighborhood has high property values which means plenty of funding for schools. They can afford high salaries, so many teachers apply to work here, meaning the school can select the best of the best. They also have money to keep their facilities and extra curricular activities up to date.</p>
<p>Now if both Group A and Group B have a perfect 100% graduation rate, can we say that the students that graduate have the same education? Yes and no. They passed 12th grade, but in one situation the academics were more rigorous and the education included more than just the bare minimum. So on one hand we can point to statistics that say America's graduation rates are increasing, so we must be smarter. On the other hand, our schools are getting less funding and in some neighborhoods the curriculum are more lax, therefore the graduation rates increasing may be showing that our schools are getting easier to pass.</p>
<p>Some studies have shown that <a href="http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/sites/default/files/articles/WQ_VOL11_W_1987_Research.pdf" target="_blank">private schools emphasize critical thought and leadership, while public schools are more likely to emphasize discipline, cooperation, and obedience</a>. Is this a disparity? In a way. Leadership and critical thought are skills needed in management and entrepreneurial jobs, while cooperation and obedience are more useful in menial labor. This isn't specifically tied to school funding, but it is worth noting that education quality will affect job prospects and success.</p>
<p>Lawmakers and policy makers are well aware of these trends. To correct for this, America has the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; law which forces all public schools to meet at least a minimum standard of education. The problem is that some schools barely meet it, while other (well funded) schools exceed it by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>Some states also have a &quot;Robinhood&quot; law which takes excess money from wealthy neighborhoods and redistributes it to poor neighborhoods to keep schools from becoming too polarized. These are effective, but not perfect, and I'm not an expert on this area so I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>However, all of this just says that the wealth gap creates an education gap. So the next question is, does higher education create more education?</p>
<p>For an individual, no. Most people seek a particular degree, and then stop seeking education. If education snowballed like the OP implies that then we'd have individuals who obtain dozens of Ph.D's, and that's pretty rare.</p>
<p>It is common, though, that <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2005-06518-016" target="_blank">educated parents are more likely to raise educated children</a> (pay wall). There's a lot of different factors here, mostly having to do with parent's higher education meaning more income and more free time. At the same time, this social fact is why colleges have programs set aside to specifically help first generation college students. People who go to college when their parent's hadn't gone to college are <a href="https://education.cu-portland.edu/blog/classroom-resources/first-generation-college-students-graduation-rates/" target="_blank">half as likely to graduate</a> as students whose parents do have a degree.</p>
<p>In summary, the answer is a soft yes. There is an education gap in america and it is growing, but it has more to do with the wealth gap and school funding than with education specifically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.</p>
<p>To be clear, overall education rates have gone way up - more people are getting bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and PhDs now than were historically. This is not such a good thing for bachelor's degrees - only about a third of jobs require such, but about 2/3rds of young people go to college, and about half of them are getting degrees. This is resulting in the value of college degrees dropping and inflation in what degrees people are asking for for jobs - there are lots of jobs that ask for bachelor's degrees now which really don't need to, but can because there's an excess of them.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, in recent years, college attendance has leveled off a bit as a result of this.</p>
<p>We've seen a modest decline in overall college attendance in the last few years, but <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/11/25/study-finds-drop-percentage-low-income-students-enrolling-college" target="_blank">we've been seeing the largest drop in low-income people going to college,</a> and low-income people were less likely to go to college to begin with.</p>
<p>But you asked about education. This, too, is so; children of more educated families are more likely to go to college.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many people might expect, this is not an American trend; in Norway, we've seen the same thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://hechingerreport.org/in-norway-where-college-is-free-children-of-uneducated-parents-still-dont-go/" target="_blank">And what happens is that — even though it’s essentially free — only 14 percent of children from the least-educated families in Norway go to college, compared to 58 percent of children from the most-educated families, according to an analysis by a Norwegian education researcher, Elisabeth Hovdhaugen.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, this bottom-end rate is indistinguishable from the bottom-end rate in the United States (13%), suggesting that it is primarily cultural factors, not economic ones, which control college attendance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/648165/HEIPR_PUBLICATION_2015-16.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a recently published compilation of official statistics from the UK that shows that the percentage of people in higher education in the UK has gone up from 42% in 2006 to 49% in 2016. Obviously, this means that there is an overall higher attainment in education in the general population, but if I understand correctly, this wasn't the point of your question. What I think you're asking is whether there is a bigger <em>gap</em> between those in that are high attainers in education and those that are not. And the answer seems to be yes! </p>
<p>For instance, have a look at the gap in gender attainment. This has actually increased since 2006 - females are now 11.9 percentage points more likely to be in higher education than men. And this is just using one particular variable - gender. Once you factor in social class, parental involvement, income brackets, cultural differences, etc etc, it begins to show a much clearer view of the gap in attainment. <a href="https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/rsu/sites/lambeth.gov.uk.rsu/files/The_Educational_Attainment_of_White_Working_Class_Pupils_-_Empirical_Evidence_2014.pdf" target="_blank">Race and class background</a> are also major variables that account for differences in attainment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
