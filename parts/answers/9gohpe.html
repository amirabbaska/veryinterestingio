		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Frozen yogurt needs to be stirred as it freezes, so that air bubbles get trapped inside. That's how you get the light texture.</p>
<p>If you have a home ice cream maker, you can make your own frozen yogurt with nothing other than store-bought yogurt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A frozen yogurt machine is constantly stirring as it is freezing (same with ice cream). So if you put yogurt in the freezer, you will get a hard ice chunk. However, the stirring in a frozen yogurt/ice cream machine causes the solids (frozen yogurt/ice cream) to separate into many tiny particles, therefore making it soft.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to stir constantly to get the proper texture, and you have to add a lot of sugar. This is because cold deadens flavor compounds and so you have to make all the flavor profiles stronger if you want them to be noticeable when frozen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because froyo is not that different than ice cream. Tons of sugar and flavoring. It's the same reason you can't just freeze milk and get ice cream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
