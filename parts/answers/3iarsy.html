		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>My father worked in various divisions of Tropicana for nearly 40 years, going from factory work and into corporate.  He has more knowledge about the industry than nearly anyone in the world, though he retired several years ago.<br><br>Here's what he has to say:<br><br>A standard box of oranges (as bought from a grower in Florida) weighs 90 lbs. That box when extracted by a processor will generate 5.5 to 6.0 gallons of orange juice. A typical box of oranges will supply 180 to 220 oranges ... depending on the maturity and the variety of orange. That means that it takes about 34.8 oranges to produce a gallon of OJ.<br><br>Re cost .... the economics of &quot;table fruit&quot; that you buy to eat is different than the economics of field run processed fruit. Table run fruit is sorted for appearance, boxed, and sold at a premium. Some varieties of table fruit are also processed but mostly used as table fruit and sell at a significant premium to processed fruit. Valencia, Parson Brown, &quot;Pineapple&quot; oranges and Hamlins are the main varieties of oranges used in Florida to make OJ in processing plants. Extractor do not &quot;grind up the fruit&quot;. There are 2 types of extractors .... one &quot;reems&quot; the fruit like you do at home and the objective of the reem is to get all of the juice, pulp and inside of the orange without impacting the white interior of the fruit (albedo) which is very bitter. The peels and waste material are then sent to a feed mill where they are pressed to reduce liquid content and dried to make cattle feed. The pressed liquid is run through an evaporator to turn it into molasses and added back to the cattle feed to sweeten it up.<br><br>A comment in the string says &quot;don't let them tell you they don't add water because they do&quot;. They don't add water to not from  concentrate Orange Juice .... it is against the law and no reputable brand would do this.<br>The cost of the oranges is so different because when you buy table fruit it is at most a bag .... processors sign contracts to buy whole groves of oranges .... sometimes buying millions of 90 lb boxes at a time. If you look in the commodity exchange ... you will see &quot;Orange Juice Concentrate Futures&quot;. This is the price a processor is expecting to pay for a standard pound solid (about one gallon of single strength orange juice) in the future. That cost typically runs from $1.25 to $2.00 ..... for about 35 processing oranges. (See math at the top of this note)<br><br>Nuf said ...  </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>They use machinery that grinds the orange down to more or less nothing, and can extract every tiniest little drop of juice from it. The machinery pretty much grinds up the oranges whole, skin and all, and then extracts every drop of juice from the ground-up mess. So they get more juice per orange than we can by hand, or even really with a countertop juicer. Multiply this by the scale at which they work - truckloads of oranges at a time - and that's how it works.<br><br>Did some IT consulting at the Tropicana factory in Bradenton, FL for a while. I learned some pretty interesting things about orange juice while I was there. Also had to wash my hair 2-3 times when I came home on Fridays or I'd smell like oranges all weekend.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>It is because you are using commercial oranges. They have been picked, culled, shipped, and profits are made every step of the way. They have to be free of blemishes and &quot;perfect.&quot;<br>The oranges the commercial juice makers use are plain old oranges, mechanically picked, imperfect, and sometimes pretty horrible looking. They use huge presses to get the juice out--hundreds or thousands at a time.<br>In short, you are using the finished product to make more finished product. They are using raw materials to make their finished product.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A lot of folks are pointing out that the oranges themselves are different, and that fancy equipment can get more juice out of the oranges. All that is true, but it doesn't explain how OJ is economically viable. <br><br>If one orange tree can produce X bottles of juice, and maintaining the tree + harvesting + land + all the other costs ends up being Y dollars per tree, then all you have to do is do a little math to figure out how much you can sell bottles for and come out ahead.<br><br>I think what you're really asking is how can orange juice be so cheap compared to the cost of the oranges it would take you to produce the same amount. Here you have to remember that orange growers aren't charging for oranges based on their expenses but based on <em>how much you'll pay for them.</em> If you'll pay 50 cents for an orange then they charge that. You might not want to pay a dollar. They're going to sell an amount of oranges that maximizes value. Better 1,000 oranges at 50 cents than 200 oranges at a dollar.<br><br>If we assume that selling oranges in their natural form is the most profitable way for growers to sell them, then they would sell all of them this way if possible. If they flood the market with oranges though the price will go down. At a certain point it would become cost-prohibitive. If oranges were selling for a penny a piece then everyone would go out of business (probably). So if orange growers only sell 10% of their oranges this way before it becomes inefficient, they can use the other 90% to make juice.<br><br>Making juice might only yield a profit of 1 penny per orange, while selling oranges straight up yields a nickel per orange. But it's better to make that 1 penny than flood the market with oranges and go out of business. <br><br>TL;DR it's all about meeting demand at efficient levels for each portion of the market. Gotta do something (profitable) with all them oranges.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">
