		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kitchen sinks. </p>
<p>The metal ones, that seem to be made out of a single piece of metal that just happens to be the shape of a sink? That is most likely a single piece of metal which was squeezed into shape by a hydraulic press. The drain gets cut out at the same time. The drain cover can even be cut at the same time. </p>
<p>Of course the same principle can be applied to any number of other objects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Squishing things</p>
<p>It can be used for shaping sheet metal into stuff like kitchen sinks(mentioned below), car body panels, or any other thin metal shape.</p>
<p>They're also used for &quot;reshaping&quot; cars and garbage in car crushers and trash compactors.</p>
<p>They can be used for punching holes out of thick material to make a metal grate</p>
<p>They can also be used to squeeze metal through a die to shape it.  Kids will squeeze play-doh through shapes to create things, aluminum extrusions are made the same way except with hot aluminum instead of play-doh and with a &gt;2,500 ton hydraulic press instead of a thumb.</p>
<p>Anything where you need a squishing force, a hydraulic press can help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

On a large scale, almost all the body panels on a car are pressed into shape.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
