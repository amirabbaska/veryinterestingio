		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off you need to aquire LOTS of samples from populations all over the world, tens of thousands at least.  The more the better.  You begin to compare all of this data from the genomes you collected with known migration patterns of ancient peoples and indigenous populations.  Then you use computers to crunch all this data and find patterns in DNA that are unique to certain people and only that group.  If your genome presents the same pattern that group 9A (whatever group that is) has you can be certain you have an ancestor from that area of the world somewhere in your family tree.</p>
<p>Truth is this kind of DNA work is hard to do, but getting better and more accurate the more people science samples.  Dr. Spencer Wells is a famous scientist traveling the world to gather samples, but there are many people working on this project.</p>
<p>Here is a great video that explains what you are asking much better than I just did.  It's well produced and you will enjoy it:</p>
