which tested 46 subjects for contrast sensitivity using a Pelli-Robson contrast chart, and concluded:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eye black grease reduces glare and improves contrast sensitivity in conditions of sunlight exposure compared with the control and antiglare stickers in binocular testing.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The details of the paper can be debated, but other studies have reached similar conclusions. There's also evidence of this trait evolving in the animal kingdom.  </p>
<p>I wrote this in response to a highly-upvoted comment that rested solely on vague anecdotal evidence and subtle anti-Americanism, but was thankfully removed. Nevertheless, I'll add that perhaps the rest of the world <em>should</em> follow American sports' lead on this, given the scientific evidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eye black helps to reduce veiling glare (lens flare) which, in turn, boosts your ability to differentiate between light and dark. Being able to see that contrast helps players judge an object's speed as it travels towards them. So a receiver in football being able to judge when and where the ball will land while it's in the air. Or a batter in baseball judging the speed and type of throw.</p>
<p><em>But</em> some sort of visor is basically necessary for any noticable difference. Just the eye black on it's own is negligible. But a hat and eye black helps to alleviate more glare than wearing just a hat.</p>
<p>Edit: it's fairly effective as long as you also wear a visor of some sort. When you reduce glare to your eye, you also reduce the amount of light your eye takes in. This means your eye will take in more light from things you're directly looking at and allow better focus and contrast. Eye black maybe also helps keep sweat from clinging to your cheeks and creating more glare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think if you want to see an exaggerated version of the same principle, you can take a photo with a dslr, and then take another photo with a lens hood on the same camera.</p>
<p>The lens hood (and black stripes) prevents non-parallel light from going into the eye/lens. Non-parallel light reduces contrast. It essentially just washes the photo out a little bit. The reason the effect is more noticeable in a photo is that automatic settings dont account for non-parallel light, so the camera guesses an exposure level, usually pretty accurately, but in the case of non-parallel light, it guesses over and creates a washed out low contrast image (darks become too light).</p>
<p>The eye black is meant to reduce light glare from light that bounces off your face then into your eyes. That light comes in non-parallel.</p>
<p>The thing with your eyes, different than the camera, is it usually can quickly adjust and adjust a lot better than a camera, so its really not as noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
