		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for Mobil Lubricants as a field engineer in the industrial sector.  A lot of the answers here are pretty good, but leave out a few details here and there.  The main reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>Engine oil has 3 primary functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Obviously lubricates your engine.  There are a number of different parts it lubricates (piston rings, crank shaft bearings, piston rod bearings, camshaft bearing, etc.) and it does this by splashing oil around the entire engine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It cleans your engine.  Combustion produces soot and soot can create carbon deposits that can wreak havoc on the engine (cause piston rings to stick, accumulate in bearings, plug filters) and a good engine oil is formulated with additives to dissolve and absorb soot and carbon preventing these issues</p>
</li>
<li>Cools your engine.  An engine functions through combustion and of course a by product of that is that it gets hot.  There are some parts that get hotter than others (namely the piston crown), but ultimately the oil is designed to keep the entire thing cool in relative terms</li>
</ol>
<p>What would condemn an oil would be something that eliminates or severely reduces its capacity to do any of the three things above.</p>
<p>Like anything, oil oxidizes (molecular chains break down in the presence of oxygen) and heat accelerates this process.  Because an engine is so hot engine oil breaks down a lot faster than oil in other parts of your car, like your transmission or differential.  When it breaks down it produces sludge.  Sludge is basically a carbon precipitate that falls out of the oil solution.  Because the oil is designed to clean your engine it pulls these solids into solution.  This increases the viscosity of the oil.  Because the oil is thicker the engine has to work harder to churn through it and it creates more internal friction within the oil, making it hotter and accelerating the oxidation process.  Because the oil also becomes hotter, it loses its capacity to cool the engine as well.  Sludge is also not a very effective lubricant so the more that the oil consumes, the less effective the lubricant and the more wear the engine components will suffer.  The reason you can’t just continuously top up is that you will be constantly accumulating sludge in your engine until the thing is jut an absolute gunky disaster and it’s a viscous cycle in the sense that the more sludge you start with, the less time the oil you’re adding will last.</p>
<p>Synthetic lubricants are manufactured in a way that significant increases their resistance to oxidation.  That’s why you’re seeing a lot of new oils coming out boasting 24,000 km lifetimes, but typically need to be paired with a better filter that I’ll discuss later.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, engine oil is designed to clean your engine by absorbing soot/carbon deposits/sludge.  Well just like every other material, oil has a saturation limit or a point where it can no longer absorb any more material.  Once this point is reached, soot will start accumulating and creating carbon deposits in places that can cause components in your engine to fail.  Continuously topping up, again just dilutes the saturated oil you already have and may not even be an option if your sump is already full of soot saturated oil.</p>
<p>Finally the last thing that can condemn an oil is dirt.  Dirt/dust is everywhere and there is no way to keep it out completely.  Most oils lubricate components on a film that is thinner than a human hair so it doesn’t take a very large particle to start causing abrasive wear.  Oil in your engine is continuously passed through an oil filter designed to remove as many of these contaminants as possible, but the more dirt that accumulates in that filter, the harder it is for oil to pass through it.  Eventually, the pressure drop across that filter is so large that to prevent it from collapsing it is sent through a bypass instead.  At that point you’re not cleaning the oil and dirt is just accumulating in the oil and ruining the engine.  That’s why every oil change should be paired with a filter change as well.</p>
<p>That’s basically the gist of it.  There are a few other thing that should trigger an oil change, but you don’t see them very often in passenger vehicles.  Hope I convinced you to get your oil changed regularly!</p>
<p>Edit - one thing I forgot to mention is viscosity improver shear-down.  It’s widely known that viscosity decreases with temperature.  Unfortunately this is the opposite of what you want in an engine.  When it’s cold, you want the oil to flow quickly and “splash” to the places that it’s supposed to lubricate.  This makes starting your engine in -40C weather easier.  However when the engine heats up, you want the oil to be thicker so that it lubricates more effectively.  This is accomplished with a polymer additive called viscosity improver.  Think of it like a claw.  When it’s cold, the claw closes into a fist and just floats around in the spaces between the lubricant molecules.  When it heats up, it starts to excite the Viscosity improver molecules and they push away from each other.  The claw expands and grabs the molecules in the lubricant, effectively tying them together and thickening the lubricant.  This makes it so that the lubricant behaves like a light viscosity grade at low temperature and a high viscosity grade at high temperature.  It’s very common in engine oils (think 0W20, 5W30, 15W40, etc). For example, a 5W30 is actually an SAE 5 weight at low temperature, formulated with viscosity improver to make it behave like an SAE 30 Weight at high temperature.  </p>
<p>Well over time these viscosity improvers oxidize or break down just like the lubricant molecules and become less effective at tying the lubricant molecules together.  The result of this is that your engine oil will continuously become lighter until it is just a 5W again and you don’t want to lubricate your engine with a 5 weight oil!</p>
<p>Edit 2 - Wow thanks for popping my gold cherry!  A lot of you are asking about good filter brands and I’ll admit automotive filters aren’t something my knowledge is super up to date.  Mobil actually does make an advanced synthetic fibre filter designed for extended service (it’s the one I use), but I’ve heard good things about K&amp;N and Bosch as well.</p>
<p>I will try to answer all your questions, but I also have to work today.  If I can’t answer try checking out this website.  The articles are written by industry experts and is well received throughout the lubrication community.  I use it all the time</p>

<p>Edit 3 - Wow guys thank you for your interest!  You have been asking some really great questions and it has been fun for me to answer as many I can.  A couple things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A lot of you have pointed out that the engine doesn’t “splash” oil around the engine.  You are absolutely correct and perhaps I generalized a little too much.  The engine has an oil pump that passes the oil through the filter and through injectors at high pressure in critical areas of the engine.</p>
</li>
<li>I highly recommend you not add aftermarket additives to your oil!  Oils are specifically formulated to be balanced and when you add new ones, you can impede or completely eliminate other additives in the formulation.  Oil manufacturers spend millions of dollars to get oil approved by API and OEMs, as soon as you put a new additive in the oil, you’re basically using a completely new and unproven/untested product.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mechanic here. The whole 3000 miles / every three months is now a myth used to sell more oil. Back when cars didn't have oil filters you had to change it every 500 to 1000 miles, later filters became a standard feature on engines, but because the motor oil of those days was... simple (read shit), you had to change it frequently. Modern oil has advanced leaps and bounds over the early days of motoring, and you can say it's high tech. Conventional motor oil can easily last 7500 miles or longer and synthetic oils can easily cover 10000 to 15000 miles or more. Not just that but a quality filter can withstand at least 10000 miles if not 20000, safely too. </p>
<p>I also see a lot of people saying that the sole job of oil is to lubricate. That's simply not true. The oil in your engine lubricates, yes, but it also regulates temperature, cleans the motor, seals the motor, and provides corrosion protection. </p>
<p>Bonus fun fact: Old synthetic oil used to leak because the molecules are much smaller in synthetic oils and unlike regular oil, it didn't saturate the seals, letting them dry up, and break/crack causing the leaks further. Modern synthetic oils contain seal conditioning additives so it simply isn't an issue any more. You can also go from synthetic to conventional and back, or mix and match with no issue - that is unless your car requires synthetic oil, in which case DO NOT put regular oil in it.  </p>
<p>EDIT 2 - u/logicblocks pointed out that I didn't explain what happens to the oil. That's my bad. </p>
<p>SO, what happens to the oil when it reaches its life expectancy, be it 3K or 30K Well it's not the oil that goes bad, it's the additives. The additives break down faster than the actual oil. The tricky part is that it is the additives that extend the life of the oil. The additives break down, they no longer keep the oil viscous and 'slippery.' The lubricant part is simple enough. The oil stops being an effective lubricant. The viscosity is a bit more complicated. As the oil gets 'used up' it no longer maintains the viscosity required by the engine. Most engines have a range of use, such as summer and winter oil. As it breaks down, oil thins out, meaning it no longer moves through the engine at the required pressure to ensure proper lubrication. If the oil is not used up, but old, it thickens up and effectively becomes grease, which your oil pump would struggle to push said clumped up oil, burns out, no oil anywhere, good bye engine. If your oil pump is an absolute badass and pushes the thickened up oil into the valve train, shit goes south in a hurry, too. To sum up, you want your oil to be flowing at a specific rate to ensure that it goes everywhere. Too thin, it moves too fast, it doesn't stick to surfaces and it doesn't do much - you might as well be running water. Too thick and you add unnecessary stress to the engine, ruining the fine tolerances of the motor. </p>
<p>EDIT - Some people pointed out about burning oil and pre-existing leaks. One VERY important detail about going longer than your 'dealership' interval... CHECK YOUR OIL LEVEL!!! Especially with aging cars, it is NEVER a good idea to fire and forget. The one big advice I can give to anyone of any skill level. KEEP UP WITH YOUR MAINTAINANCE !!!! You can check your oil level, your tire pressure, and other minor things that will keep your car running for much longer.</p>
<p>I may make my living working on cars, but I care about cars more people at times, so it's not fun when I see car that hasn't seen the most basic of care.</p>
<p>Gold edit: Thank you for the gold! I like helping people with whatever knowledge I have, but the gold is nice. Thank you. </p>
<p>Also I now understand the RIP inbox thing. I'll try to reply as best as I can to questions and concerns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Engineer here! I’ve done quite a bit of oil analysis for onsite equipment. The main things we analyze are:</p>
<p>1) additives: the main additive in oil is a zinc phosphorus mix (ZDDP) that forms a protective film over any moving parts. There are or additives that are used too especially in motor oil that clean spot from the oil.
2) wear: the gears in the vehicle do wear and iron or other material will be left floating in the oil, which can become increasingly worse the longer you don’t change your oil
3) contaminants: older machines especially may have dirt or allow water into your oil which can cause damage.
The oil in your car does definitely last longer than the recommended time, but is important to change regularly to prevent a breakdown and replace the additive compounds.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answers here are right: it's a combination of getting dirty (which is also the reason you have and need to change an oil filter), and larger molecules in the oil breaking down over time due to the heat of operation. </p>
<p>3000 miles, however, is not necessarily when the oil needs to be changed. Your owner's manual will tell you how often to change it, usually with two different schedules: severe use and light use. If you do a lot of short trips on regular roads (not highways), then follow the severe schedule. My car has a 7500 mile recommend interval for severe use, but I tend to change every 5000 or 6 months.</p>
<p>Also, your car should not be consuming oil, so &quot;topping up&quot; theoretically should not be needed. If it is, there's at least a small leak somewhere. It's not always worth fixing these types of things, but that is the cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other answers here, engine oils become acidic over time due to heat and oxidation which is normal. This is described by a unit called TAN. Bad oil, while it is mainly less lubricating and more viscous, can also cause internal engine damage through oil acidification.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
