		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a really interesting question. I'm not sure if I know the ultimate answer, but I can make an educated guess.</p>
<p>When it comes to our senses, vision and, to a lesser extend, hearing are pretty dominant. What this means is that when we process the world around us, we rely much more on vision and hearing to know what's going on around us than, say, taste. This also means our mind's representations of the world is much more in terms of vision and sound and not so much in terms of taste.</p>
<p>However, our brains aren't passively registering the world, but are rather busy predicting what's going to happen next as well. What's even more remarkable is that they are able to represent, or imagine, things that aren't even there at the moment. Those predictions are the most useful if we make them in the same way we register the world and, as said above, we mainly register the world visually and auditory. (This is not entirely true, we are also really good in senses like proprioception that play a major role in our action control.)</p>
<p>This means that a big part of our brain is good at representing visual and auditory stuff and we have few parts that are very good at representing taste stuff. That's why it's harder to imagine taste or smell, because we just have fewer brain regions that are actually specialized in that.</p>
<p>Edit: You might also say vision and hearing are dominant because of all the extra processing power we have for it. Why it actually evolved this way is another topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As many others in this thread said, some people can do that with easy. Basically, some people are more visual, some people are more into sounds and melodies and rhythm, some about space and dimensions and some about smells and tastes.</p>
<p>Try to cook more, smell to things. Smell to spices before you add them to food, smell to food before you eat it. Try to identify various smells and tastes. In time, you would be able to combine tastes and predict which could be nice together, almost feel the combined taste.</p>
<p>Our world is quite visual. You are forced to remember images all the time. With music readily accessible everywhere, you might be well trained in music recognition and remember (and recreate from memory, such as whistling or humming) various patterns. But you are not forced to remember and recreate smells, if you are not working in food industry or you are not utilizing your smell in other way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about this, I seem to be able to recall smell and tastes very well. The difference in smell between green onion and yellow onion or the flavor difference in grass fed and corn fed beef. From when I was a child, I remember the smells of the various markets around Taipei and the pot stickers from a corner vendor as well as the smell of my grandmother's perfume and her chicken and dumplings from deep East Tx. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have answer to you, but I can't 'see' pictures in my head nor 'hear' sounds in my head unless I am dreaming.</p>
<p>When I 'think' of things, I don't picture anything, and I am unable to recall melodies but can instantly recognize a song when I hear it. </p>
<p>So, to me, I figured this was normal up until a few years ago, when I started to realize it wasn't. So, when it comes to tastes or smell, I treat them exactly the same as seeing/hearing something - which makes it really easy for me to diet because its like 'not watching' a movie or 'not listening' to music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
