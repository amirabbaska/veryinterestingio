		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you're talking about the people surrounding lady Gaga, and not the drones?</p>
<p>There is a company that makes DMX controlled wrist bands. Using some crazy RFID technology they can control the lights based on the position of the wrist band. Then a light operator just controls different areas, and the wrist band location determines what commands it receives.</p>
<p>Now the people at the halftime show weren't wearing wrist bands, but the technology works the same.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the company who makes this technology</p>
<p><a href="http://crowdsynctechnology.com/led-wristbands/" target="_blank">http://crowdsynctechnology.com/led-wristbands/</a></p>
<p>Not sure if they are the company that was responsible for the Super Bowl. But regardless it's the same technology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The drones use Intel's realsense technology combined with infrared LEDs, allowing the drones to know where each other are and form a sort of wireless mesh network.</p>
<p>Once the drones know where they are and where they are supposed to be, you can program them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an Intel drone program. It's a group of 500 drones synchronized via a single computer.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aOd4-T_p5fA" target="_blank">Here's a cool video on them</a></p>
<p>Edit: I now realize you where probably asking about all the lights in the crowd, not the lights in the sky. I was really excited to see the drones, so that's the first thing that popped in my head when reading your question lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the lights at the beginning were clearly drones and can be individually addressed, I'm going to cover those handheld lights for the people dancing around on the field instead.</p>
<p>There's a number of ways this could be done. Most likely, they set up an array of low power transmitters which send out a unique identifier or broadcasts a carrier on a unique frequency, something like that. The position of these transmitters are all known by each handheld light. The controller inside each handheld light knows, through radio triangulation, where it's own approximate location is, relative to the transmitters.</p>
<p>Next, there's a second transmitter which sends out commands which look like this: &quot;If you are within 3 feet of [x,y], set rgb color to [#ff0000]. If not, disregard.&quot;</p>
<p>I'd love to see a project like this on hackaday. It seems like something they could cobble together out of a bunch of Philips Hue bulbs, a Raspberry Pi, a 3d printer, and a bunch of Arduinos.</p>
<p>tl;dr: It's done with radio and magic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
