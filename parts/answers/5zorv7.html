		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An upper bound on the fastest a compact star can theoretically rotate is with a period of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9608179.pdf" target="_blank">about 0.28ms</a>. The fastest rotating observed compact object is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_J1748-2446ad" target="_blank">PSR J1748-2446ad</a>, which spins with a period of about 1.4ms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, does the size of a pulsar matter much when determining the break-apart speed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Less massive compact objects have a slower rotation limit, because they are physically larger. It doesn't make much sense to talk about a break-apart speed in this context, since in order for a stable compact object to break apart due to rotational forces, you'd need to put sufficient rotational energy into the star such that the outermost layer spins beyond its orbital velocity; I don't know of any mechanism that does this.</p>
<p>EDIT: Last sentence as originally phrased was incorrect; I neglected to mention accretion, which can cause a star to rotate faster, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5zorv7/psr_j17482446ad_is_the_fastest_know_pulsar_at_716/df1nchu/" target="_blank">but only up to surface speeds equal to the orbital velocity of the surface</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other good answers here but I wanted to add on. /u/bencbartlett gave the minimum period from causality, which comes from the fact that the internal adiabatic sound speed should not exceed the speed of light. The breakup period where the neutron star will tear itself apart is potentially a bit higher though. This can be calculated rather simply for any spinning object of uniform density, see <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/Pulsars.html" target="_blank">the equation before 6A1</a>. The idea behind this calculation is that you have a centrifugal acceleration pulling a particle from the surface while gravity is pulling it towards the center, and you care about when the pull away is greater than the pull towards. Of course, neutron stars don't have uniform density, and so you need to plug in the appropriate equation of state that describes how the density changes as a function of radius within the neutron star (you can imagine that the center is more dense than the outer shell because of gravity). In this simple model, you'll notice that the period does depend on the size of the object via the density (also go two equations up for this form). This is in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=x1TMSMpzD2UC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=neutron+star+break+up+period&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_tuAMAfXgl&amp;sig=dAOV88wRY_CHzd7jQgqDpde9-NU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiqkrrmmdvSAhUF7CYKHRynA_8Q6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=neutron%20star%20break%20up%20period&amp;f=false" target="_blank">0.5 millisecond range</a> though it really depends on how complicated you do the calculation and I've seen some that include full general relativity plus other effects. The numbers I've seen are usually around there though. Some theory papers suggest you can't get sub-millisecond neutron stars if you include more effects but I would say that's still not quite certain or observationally demonstrated yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It mostly depends on the size and mass of the neutron star. The limit is reached when the surface velocity becomes greater than the escape velocity, which would make the neutron star tear itself apart.</p>
<p>Some theories suggest that the highest reachable spin rate of typical pulsars is 1500 rotations per second, but that doesn't prevent a pulsar from spinning faster. However, a rate of 1000 rotations per second and higher would make the pulsar lose energy by gravitational radiation.</p>
<p>You must bear in mind that other astronomical objects can spin faster than pulsars, like black holes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
