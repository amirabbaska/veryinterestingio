		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grapefruit juice inhibits an enzyme (CYP3A4) that is very important in metabolizing many different medications. So when you drink it, the enzyme function is reduced, and less drug gets metabolized (and so it stays in the body longer than normally, which leads to it accumulating) and can result in toxicity of the drug. Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently doing research in the lab on this exact topic! Furanocoumarins, bergamottin and 6'7'-dihydroxybergamottin, are potent CYP3A inhibitors. Over 85 known drugs are affected including CYP3A4 metabolized drugs like opioids (fentanyl/oxycodone). My field is forensic chemistry so I'm more interested in it's effect with controlled substances. I heard that some people &quot;pre-load&quot; their doses with grapefruit extract or juice for a better effect and I suspect that some drug producers are adding furanocoumarins into their product to provide the same level of high for less controlled substance. If any of my medical or toxicology friends would like to talk, send me a PM!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also some medication has a slow release mechanism.  The enzymes in grapefruit affect this, rather than the drug itself, so the whole lot hits your bloodstream in one go.  This typically doesn’t change the medication effect, but makes side effects worse.  Felodipine is one example of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So yeah mostly. The issue is that the enzyme in question either breaks down or activates the medication. So for some medications, grapefruit juice DECREASES the concentration of medicine you’re actually getting, and for others it INCREASES it. </p>
<p>Also, this is drug specific. Like not all drugs in the same class are affected in the same way, or even at all. Take statins for example, very popular, very old, well-studied type of cholesterol lowering medication. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) and simvastatin are both affected by grapefruit juice. Rosuvastatin (Crestor) and pravastatin are not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a follow-up question, does the CYP3A4 enzyme contribute significantly to healthy body functions?<br />
As in, would there be a noticeable difference between people who regularly eat red citrus fruits vs. people who do not?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
