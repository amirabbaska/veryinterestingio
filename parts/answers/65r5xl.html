		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, when you're inside a building/room for a long time, and there's little/no air circulation, the air can become a little 'stale', per se, with dust or other things getting into the air. Stepping outside allows you to breathe in some fresher air with less pollutants in it. (hopefully)</p>
<p>In terms of nausea, I've found that breathing in cold air tends to slightly alleviate nausea, and on top of that, if you take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth, that also alleviates nausea, so both of those combined would certainly have a strong effect.</p>
<p>The placebo effect could also be working in there. You believe that the air outside is fresher, and that causes it to have a positive effect on you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Hope these help! These pages were really informative when I was researching plants to add to my office to improve air quality recently.
Basically comes down to indoor air doesn't cycle through with fresh air frequently enough and allows for the buildup of not-so-nice chemicals, mold spores, and other respiratory tract irritants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a wide range of indoor air quality problems that could be causing your headaches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DO you have a sore throat, runny nose or watery, itchy eyes? Are you sneezing, coughing or wheezing? Does your head ache? Feeling tired and irritable? You may have picked up a bug from a friend, family member or co-worker. Or you may have gotten sick from your house.</p>
<p>''People usually attribute these symptoms to a cold or a flu,'' said Andrew Port, director of indoor air quality for Environmental Waste Management Associates, a consulting company in Parsippany, N.J. ''But in a significant number of cases, these symptoms are indicative of either a problem with their heating, ventilation or air-conditioning system, or the presence of elevated concentrations of indoor air pollutants.''</p>

<p>You may want to keep some windows open to air out your house. During the winter, I always open up doors and windows for about 20 minutes a few times a week. During the summer, I like to keep the air flowing throughout the house all day and night because I am also sensitive to mold, dust, and fumes from things like furniture. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
