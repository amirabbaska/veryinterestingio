		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look into wolves in Yellowstone.<br />
Humans took them out.  (Think it had something to do with making Yellowstone a more human friendly place.). Decrease or predators lead to increase of prey.<br />
The prey eats up more of the environment.  And things start to change from there.<br />
Supposedly, reintroducing the wolves helped undo some of the damage, but I'm having a little bit of trouble finding sources to back that up.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
