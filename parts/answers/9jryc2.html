		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: intrinsic variable protostar is what you're looking for. Search it on google and you'd find that cycle is in days. I found it after i wrote answer.  </p>
<p>Original answer:</p>
<p>Get some astrophysicist down, we got a really great question.</p>
<p>I'll try to answer as well as I can. In stars, fusion is going on massive scale and it's not an on and off switch that gets tripped. To give an example, there must be a very tiny amount of fusion going on in earth at it's core just by sheer random chance. But, it does not qualify as star.</p>
<p>Suppose the oscillations are there for fusions, they would be damped oscillations most likely (meaning they have a factor which works towards slowing amplitude of oscillations) and it is very likely that they are overcritical oscillations i.e. damping factor is so high that they can not completely stop the fusion process.  If the oscillations are not overcritical we would actually see a star whose size also changes along with brightness and spectrum with a time period.</p>
<p>This problem is complex enough to take few hours to few weeks for an actual astrophysicist to solve and it involves absurdly high number of fields in physics even if we simply assume all hydrogen gas for that 'not yet a star'. <del>I know of no such papers or real life observations.</del></p>
<p>I can however tell you one definite instance of something resembling fusion oscillation, which is supernova. Supernova are typically stars that can no longer have hydrogen cycle or other cycle due to lack of 'fuel'. It can not start making heavier elements because the temperature and other conditions are not high enough, and it will take a collapse of the star to start them. (as added in comment below, fusion to make elements heavier than iron require more energy than it releases, hence we use heavier metal in fission reactors to produce electricity.) However, when those processes start and <del>emit energy</del> star collapses, the gravitational and kinetic energy from collapse is too much for gravitational force to hold the star together and it literally blows up. This is one example of the fusion rate oscillation which has huge amount of factors and is observed by us.</p>
<p>If star is massive enough it is followed by another such overcritical oscillation so to speak. The matter blown away from the supernova gets pulled back and the force is so strong that no amount of fusion can keep it from downsizing. It makes a neutron star which is practically everything getting fused into one giant 'atom'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting question to think about. A star can be described as being in an equilibrium between radiation pressure and gravity. If gravity is too strong it collapses to some limit, which can produce black holes in the extreme limit. If radiation pressure is too high the star can eject layers and tear itself apart, producing supernovae in a similar extreme limit. (I am generalizing and simplifying the complex physics that produces supernovae and black holes)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If a star were formed that just barely existed on the edge of fusion which is about .08 solar masses according to Carroll and Ostlie 2nd edition (Amazing introductory astrophysics text) barely meeting the density requirement fusion would occur, this would increases radiation pressure and upset the delicate balance between itself and gravity expanding the star. This lowers the density of the star. The question then becomes what is this increased radius and what is the freefall time scale to return to the &quot;Fusion Radius&quot;. Stellar classification schema would have this be a M8V or M9V depending on who you talk to. Lets assume the radius of a M9V brings us into the fusion category and the radius of a M8V brings us into the freefall category</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>R_M9V \~ .08 Solar Radii</p>
<p>R_M8V \~ .11 Solar Radii</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is a difference of  .03 Solar Radii the question then becomes what is the freefall time for this difference.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Tff \~ 66430s 1/ sqrt(Density) for a spherically symmetric infall (not a bad approximation for a star assuming its non-rotating)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Density equals Mass / Volume so for a sphere this is</p>
<p>p = (3M)/(4 * Pi * R\^3)</p>
<p>p_dif = ((3M)/(4 * Pi)) * (1/(.08\^3) - 1/(.11\^3)) If we do this calculation in terms of solar units then M can be a fraction of solar mass so M = .08 meaning</p>
<p>p_dif = 1.589e-5 psolar</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>plugging this into our freefall equation and assuming there is minimal radiation pressure during this collapse (there isn't)</p>
<p>Tff \~ .5 years would be our timescale for collapse. This doesn't include the time to expand or the timeframe to become revirialized. A timeframe of a year to a decade for this to happen could be expected given the <strong>Many</strong> assumptions I made in this calculation. Hopefully someone who is less sleepy can provide a more accurate answer. to your question</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Edit: I typed this up starting before other comments had been posted, I should also include my calculations assume the mass-loss of this system is negligible and it can remain right on the edge of initiating the fusion process.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The closest thing to what you are looking for is a Cepheid Variable star. <del>However, those only oscillate between 2 states of nuclear fusion as the balance between gravitational and fusion pressure forces are unstable, and not because fusion stops.</del></p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>No, the size increases because of the increased nuclear pressure, and when this happens the rate of nuclear fusion falls causing the pressure to decrease and gravity causes it to shrink. The shrinkage increases the physical pressure which increases the rate of nuclear reaction, and thus the nuclear pressure increases, restarting the cycle.</del></p>
</blockquote>
<p><del>These point where the size is maximum and minimum, are what i meant by the 2 states of nuclear fusion, as  in the state where the rate of nuclear fusion is minimum and maximum, respectively.</del></p>
<p>Nope, turns out I was wrong, its because the opacity of the outer layer changes, causing the temperature to rise or fall, as pointed out by u/BOBauthor, u/ErrorlessQuaak and u/Astromike23</p>
<p>But, at the same time there can be a few stars that could possibly have nuclear fusion that can momentarily spark up or stop but they wouldn't be predictable.</p>
<p>Edit: oscillation time periods for Cepheids range from less than 2 days to a few months, in general Also, while Cepheids are the most well know of the variable stars, there are many others like the Lyrae Variable, pulsating white dwarfs, protostars that erupt mass and so on. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable\_star" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable\_star</a></a> this would encompass all the types that you could even remotely be interested in</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No ones answered so i researched this for you.</p>
<p>The answer is no, it wont have an oscillating cycle. Why? For fusion to start, the star has to cross a mass threshold.  If the star sits right on this threshold as in your scenario, it would start fusion, its mass would drop under the threshold and the star would stop fusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
