		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll go ahead and preface this by saying that Extra History did a really quite good series on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZkP2b-4vo" target="_blank">history of paper money</a> that deals in a fair amount of depth with how early banking works, so you should definitely check that out if it's something you're interested in. The history of how banking works is intrinsically tied up in the history of paper money, so... you know. Hold on to your butts.</p>
<p>Originally, a bank was just a place where you stored your gold. So you didn't have to get your gold out and carry it around with you everywhere, banks started to issue their own promissory notes. Paper money, then, is really just a sort of shorthand that says 'Hey, if you bring this to a bank, they'll give you a certain amount of cash in exchange, no bamboozle'. Banks put out their own notes (which were really just receipts saying you had a certain amount of gold in their vault) and kept their own logs -- but that also brought with it a bigger problem. Say you live in Homesville, and your money is deposited at the Homesville Local Bank. You travel to Awaysburgh, with your Homesville paper money, and you try to buy something. The Awaysburgh shopkeeper takes your $100 Homesville note, looks at it, and says, 'No.'</p>
<p>Well, shit.</p>
<p>See, for him to get that $100 worth of gold, he has to travel all the way to Homesville to go to the Homesville Local Bank and withdraw that money himself -- which is a pain in the ass. Now sure, he can wait until he has more Homesville residents passing through and paying him in Homesville dollars to make the trip worthwhile, but maybe there just isn't all that much Homesville traffic in his little town. He might be waiting <em>months</em> until he has enough Holmesville currency to justify schlepping all the way to your podunk town to cash in your debt. Until he goes there (assuming there's no one else he can palm your Homesville dollars on), that money is worthless to him -- literally not worth the paper it's written on. That doesn't help you, of course, because you're now hundreds of miles from home and you've got paper money that works great in your local tavern, but here might as well be toilet paper. Maybe he'll agree to give you something in exchange for it, but to compensate him for his effort and the risk he's taking (after all, what if your bank collapses? What if he gets robbed during the long and arduous trip to cash in?)... maybe he'll just give you $50 worth of stuff instead, how does that sound?</p>
<p>So how did the banks get around this system? Well, Homesville Local Bank can set up a branch in Awaysburgh, with a store of gold in each branch. (After all, it doesn't matter <em>which</em> gold coins you get, exactly, only that they're of the same value.) Then, your Awaysburgh shopkeeper can easily take your notes to his loval Homesville branch, cash it in, and the two branches can shuttle money back and forth between each other to keep the coffers full. That explains how branches of banks form, and why they work better: two banks in separate cities sharing funds and customers are vastly more desirable than two banks that work entirely independently. This was helped somewhat by the creation of central banks and the notion of legal tender -- that the government would take over the printing of banknotes and ensure that there was (at least, in theory) a level of stability in the value of a currency, rather than it being at the whim of whether your particular bank just disappeared one morning -- but that's <a href="https://youtu.be/LrB9bS2VOLE?t=3m14s" target="_blank">a long and surprisingly convoluted story</a> that doesn't really play into the main question here.</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to transfer information -- which, really, is all bank notes are -- than it is to transfer gold itself. Over time, this transfer of information became easier (first by writing, then by phone and now by computers), but the basic principle is the same. As long as all branches have a way of checking just how much money is in a person's account, the actual <em>method</em> of checking only really changes how convenient and safe the system is. That's why now you can get your money pretty much instantly at any branch of your bank, even halfway around the world, but historically it might have taken some time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Even working in retail as recently as the late 90s, we would have to call and verify checks over $500.  Call up the customers bank, give the clients name and account number(from the check) and the bank would tell you if it would clear or not.  They wouldn't give you extraneous info like how much extra was in there, or how short it would be, but they would easily tell you that yes, as of that moment, the check would or would not clear.</p>
<p>Of course, this didn't account for things like someone going out and writing 10 different $500 checks in the same day when all they had was $600 in their bank account, so there was still a risk of checks not clearing even if you did get verbal confirmation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It depended on the state. In the 1970s, big banks in California had branches all up and down the state. In Illinois, branch banks were not permitted (or maybe 1 or 2? not sure). The idea was to protect small banks.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, all banks closed at 3 PM. The bank employees then processed all the money and paperwork until their workday was done.
If you had a savings account, you had an account book, about the size of a passport. When you added or took money out of savings, you handed the account book to a bank clerk, who put it in a machine. Then the clerk punched in the transaction, and the amount in/out, and the new balance was printed. Interest on savings accounts was calculated quarterly.  I was a little kid at the time, but I think my folks said that you had to walk into the bank to get your interest recorded, or you would miss it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't specifically answer your question, but the movie &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (Tom Hanks, Leonardo DiCaprio) <em>really</em> shows just how easy it was to abuse the length of time it took for one bank branch to communicate with another. People were able to get away with a great number of things that became extinct as soon as the Internet became the intermediary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To really answer your question you need to narrow down which time period before the internet. In the 80's for example, there were ISDN and T1 connections (1.5 Mbps link) between bank branches and the bank's central mainframe. The 70's had T1's but likely only between larger institutions. So these were times of 3 to 5 day transaction periods for personal checking but 24 hour turn arounds on larger institutions transactions (large business transactions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
