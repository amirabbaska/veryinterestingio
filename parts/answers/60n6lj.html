		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alpha particles traveling through matter tend to lose most of their energy through collisions with the electrons. The ~5 MeV of energy an alpha particle has undergoes a sequence of large number of small-angle collisions, imparting energy to the electrons (and a bit to to the nuclei) in the process, heating up the matter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The alpha particles aren't merely released, they're shot out of the plutonium atoms at high speed. The particles brake against the other atoms, and the kinetic energy becomes heat.</p>
<p>Heat naturally travels from hot to cold, and thermolelectric generators are able to extract perhaps 5% of that energy as electricity. The rate of electricity production (and the rate of heat flow) increases with the difference in temperature between the hot and cold sides, and the efficiency of the thermoelectric material decreases with temperature (this is inherent in semiconductor materials; photovoltaics have the same problem).</p>
<p>So, we want the outside / cold side to be as cold as possible, and we also need to get rid of 95% of the energy as waste heat; hence the big cooling fins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alpha particles dissipate their energy through a series of inelastic collisions with electrons.  Or the electron shells, if you will.  Because alphas are super-heavy compared to electrons, the electron gets excited to a higher energy state while the alpha is <em>almost</em> unaffected, just losing a little bit of energy in each collision.</p>
<p>The electron then decays back to it's lower energy state, either emitting a photon or a phonon, which is where the thermal energy comes from.</p>
<p>There's a funny pair of dependencies upon the alpha energy in this reaction:  The more energetic your alpha is the more energy is imparted to the electron it scatters off of, but the more energetic it is the less likely the alpha is to interact with any given electron.  I think the relationship ends up being E^1.5 but I could be wrong...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
