		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok im gonna try to explain this the best way possible. Your tears are made of water, mucin, lipids, lysozyme, lactoferrin, lipocalin, lacritin, immunoglobulins, glucose, urea, sodium, and potassium. The effect of the potassium are long term (thats why you can tell kids have been crying)  so it will usually make your eyelids swollen. This effects only last about 8-10 hours. It's different for everyone because of the amount of potassium the tears produce.</p>
<p>hope that helps!</p>
<p>Here is a link to an article, make sure you read the whole article it make more sense once you get the bigger picture.</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm gonna be honest with ya'll. I completely BS that answer. I just searched what tears are made of and pasted it and then I made up the rest. I'm telling you guys because you shouldn't believe everything you see online. Goes to show how easy it is to believe shit without doing your own research</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This used to happen to me every time I cried for 33 years, and I had no idea why.  After the birth of my second child I got a strange case of urticaria (constant and giant hives).   I went on a regimen of Alegra x 2, twice daily (under the care of an allergist) and it not only cured the hives, but it also cured the after crying swelling.  I was so shocked when I woke up one morning after having a new mom meltdown and my eyes were normal!  I think allergic response has something to do post-crying puffy eye-ness for some.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
