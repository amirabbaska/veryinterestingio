		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the food heats the water inside starts boiling, forming steam. So first the steam enters the oil and evaporates from the top.</p>
<p>Now a crust is formed, this makes it harder for the steam to leave the food. You'll often notice the food is a bit 'puffy': this is the steam pushing against the crust. This is when the food starts floating: the density of steam is very low. Once the average density of the food + steam is lower than the oil, it will start floating.</p>
<p>You'll notice with some foods that the content has shrunken. Either the crust collapses with it, or it leaves a crusty shell. That's the steam that becomes water again, and the density of water is a lot higher, so it shrinks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food that you usually fry, contains a quantity of water in it. Water is heavier than oil. When you fry something, you are basically boiling it from the inside. So it does became less heavier than oil because it looses many of its water content while frying. Have you ever asked yourself why if you fry at low temp with little oil, food cames out oily, and when you use high temp with much oil, food came out almost dry? This is mainly for ebullition speed. Oil has quite high specific heat, so at 175°C degrees is not that difficult to heat up water to 100°C quickly, and water begins to became water vapor. From now on, the evaporation speed strongly depends on the calories given to water by oil, so another important fact is to keep the temperature stable while frying. This will lend many vapor steams to exit from the food, keeping out oil. After a while food begins to float, for the loosen weight due to loosen water and that's it. Volume doesn't change so much, so this density change is more a weight change related phenomena
EDIT: also, this doesn't involve chemistry at all folks! It's a Physics related phenomena</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Density, but mostly because water turns to steam, displacing the water with a much lower density and reducing the overall density to that less than the oil.  It floats.</p>
<p>This is why overcrowding the fryer gives greasy food; if the water can’t escape as a constant flow of steam, the oil will ingress into the food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
