		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a variety of evidence that can be used to piece it together. It's not 100% guaranteed that we're right, but it's close. It helps a lot that there is a large written corpus of Latin over a long period of time, that it has several surviving descendants, and that it was an important language so people from other countries tried to learn it. Church Latin isn't really so helpful, except as another example of a living descendant.</p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Poetry. This gives us deep insight into the rhythm and meter of words, and seeing the rhyming and alliteration between different words is an aid.</li>
<li>Instruction manuals. Because Rome was a large expansive empire, Romans had to interact with people that spoke different languages. Sometimes you find a pronunciation guide or a language textbook from one language into another (either direction helps).</li>
<li>Patriotism. Believe it or not, some Roman poets and orators actually took the time to describe, in great detail, why Latin is sooo much better than what those smelly barbarians speak on the other side of the hills. These diatribes may include descriptions of phonetics.</li>
<li>Surviving descendants. Linguistic evolution actually follows certain predictable rules. Looking at the pronunciation of French, Spanish, Italian etc can give us some clues and constraints on how Latin was probably spoken.</li>
<li>Evolution over time. We have several hundred years of written Latin records, and we can see how the spelling of some words changed over time. If, for example, a word drops one of its vowels over the course of fifty years, that tells us that the vowel was probably weak or elided to begin with.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some caveats to the above: Most of the techniques are relative, not absolute. We can see how Latin compared to its neighbors, or when two words rhymed, but that doesn't exactly tell us how it was pronounced. Still, with enough evidence we can nail down a surprising amount of detail. </p>
<p>Also, quite a lot of the written evidence is for &quot;official&quot; or &quot;literary&quot; Latin (although we have quite a corpus of graffiti, including over 900 slang words for penis). Just like in English, literary writing is somewhat different than spoken every-day language, and poetry is possibly removed even further.</p>
<p>EDIT: Replying to some common comments.</p>
<p>Church Latin isn't as helpful as you might think. The pronunciation wasn't preserved. The grammar and vocab stayed roughly static, but the pronunciation ended up following the evolution of Italian. That's just kinda what happens when you try to preserve a language, but your technology can only transmit written samples, and not spoken. </p>
<p>Several people pointed out that another important source of data is typos. If a word is commonly misspelled, that gives you two hints: one, that the pronunciation of the word has changed over time. And two, that the &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; spellings represent similar phonetics. This sort of dovetails with my last point above, because very often changes in spelling are regarded as &quot;errors&quot; at first, and then become accepted as time passes.</p>
<p>And several other people also pointed out that another source of data is regional variations. Because Latin was so wide-spread, it had regional dialects. This helps in a couple of ways. For one thing, regional dialects would give different spellings for the same words. And like the &quot;Patriotism&quot; point above, some orators will describe at great lengths the proper pronunciation and elocution that noble, proper Romans have, in order to explain what's wrong with how those country bumpkins over the hill speak, and why that proves their mothers bumped uglies with the barbarians next door.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Electric Boogaloo</p>
<p>Thank you for the gold, kind stranger.</p>
<p>Some more replies pointed out another way that Latin interacted with other languages: Borrowed words, especially personal and place names. Seeing how one language renders another gives insight into both. The outsider's perspective, if you will.</p>
<p>I think it's clear already, but I think it's worth pointing out: This sort of analysis is easier for Latin than for other languages, because of the wealth of resources available. Because Rome was a fairly literate society, we have a broader source of texts available, including children's schoolwork and misspelled graffiti, which is surprisingly valuable. The breadth and political power of Rome also means that it interacted with a large number of people that spoke other languages, which provides another wealth of resources. With most languages, we don't have the same depth of knowledge available, and reconstructing pronunciation is therefore harder and less exact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, ignore everyone saying anything about how the Catholic Church preserved it by teaching Church Latin. Church Latin isn't pronounced like Classical Latin, it's Latin pronounced like (semi-)modern Italian. </p>
<p>Also ignore anyone saying how since the language is dead, it's pronunciation can't have changed. It's very likely that anyone who hasn't studied latin is completely butchering pronunciation, because the way we pronounce it (I.E. the way we think it was pronounced) HAS changed significantly from how it was actually pronounced. </p>
<hr />
<p>The thing to consider is that Latin didn't <em>die</em>, it simply became the various romance languages (French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Romanian, and countless other small ones depending on who you ask). </p>
<p>In the same way that we can reconstruct a common genetic ancestor for humanity by examining our genes, we can reconstruct a language by examining its descendants. The important thing about sound changes is that <strong>sound changes occur across-the-board</strong>. </p>
<p>This means that a sound change doesn't happen to a single word. Instead, changes happen at the level of individual sounds. These changes depend on the &quot;environment&quot; of the sound being changed. For example, a vowel at the end of a word might be lost, or a K between two vowels might become a G. </p>
<p>This doesn't mean that sound changes occur across a whole language, however. In fact, the reason we have dialects, or even more than one language at all, is because sound changes are limited in geographical range. </p>
<p>This is pretty intuitive, especially for the ancient world, where travel was difficult at best. People only interact with people relatively close to them, so individual sound changes tend to be constrained to a single community. </p>
<p>Over time, enough of these sound changes accumulate, and the words become unintelligible to people form other areas, who have also undergone their own set of different sound changes.</p>
<p>The other thing which makes sound changes a reliable tool is that they are semi-predictable. They;re not perfectly predictable, because that would mean that all people would undergo the same changes at the same time, and then we wouldn't have separate dialects or languages, but they're <em>fairly</em> predictable. </p>
<p>What I mean by that is that there are certain &quot;trajectories&quot; they tend to follow- so &quot;sound A&quot; may become &quot;sound B&quot; pretty regularly in various world languages, while it's pretty rare for B to become A. (This is a simplification but it illustrates the point).</p>
<p>The force driving sound changes is somewhat underwhelming: <strong>some words are kinda hard to say</strong>. People aren't perfect, and over time things that are hard to pronounce will be simplified. Big clumps of consonants tend to wear away to one or two, for example, and sounds which are relatively far apart from each other in the mouth will move closer if they frequently occur next to each other.</p>
<p>So essentially, we know how Latin was pronounced because we can work backward from the way all of its descendant languages are pronounced, following the rules and tendencies that we know sound changes follow.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL;DR- People take shortcuts (sound changes), but predictable ones, and because they're predictable, if we know where they ended up (modern languages), we can figure out the shortcuts (sound changes)they took, which can tell us where they came from (ancient languages).</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way we can learn how Latin was pronounced is spelling mistakes.  A good source are graffiti which in the case of Pompeii have survived to show us how people with a little education mis-spelled and from that pronounced words.  Imagine you were someone from the future who without any sound recording saw the word women written down.  You might pronounce it wo-men.  But if the same word was written in another context as wimmin then you'd learn the way it was said by the person who wrote the graffito.</p>
