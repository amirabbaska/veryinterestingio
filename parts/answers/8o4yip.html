		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air is made of little balls called molecules, which are made of smaller balls called atoms.</p>
<p>Now, light can interact with molecules (really the atoms) in 3 primary ways: reflection (like a mirror), refraction (like how light is bent when looking from air into water) and diffusion, aka scattering.</p>
<p>Diffusion is similar to reflection, but instead of reflecting the light in a single direction, it scatters it in every direction. It's the interaction we are most used to, nearly all materials scatter light. It's why a piece of paper is white, no matter what angle you look at it from. The light doesn't need to reflect into your eye, because the paper scatters the light in every direction.</p>
<p>Gasses can scatter light too, though! Both oxygen and nitrogen, which make up a lot of the air, are good at scattering blue light. The sun appears yellow (and not white) because some of the blue gets scattered as it passes through the air, and the yellows, reds, oranges, etc all keep travelling straight, until they hit your eye.</p>
<p>This blue scattering makes the rest of the sky is blue, and this causes the sky to be blue.</p>
<p>Now to answer your question: as the sun rises and sets, there aren't as many reds/yellows/oranges as the sun isn't shining as intensly down, it needs to travel through a LOT of air to get to you since it's coming in from an angle. This means that a lot more blue light gets to you and the surrounding area. And when there's snow on the ground, snow reflects every color (since it's white), and since there's not as much of the reds/yellows/oranges, it scatters even more blue.</p>
<p>EDITS: changed a couple &quot;diffusions&quot; into &quot;scattering&quot; to be consistent and understandable. Also changed a typo of &quot;matter&quot; to &quot;water&quot; (in refraction)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light diffuses (understand deviated) when propagating in the air. How much it diffuses depends on the wavelength (its color).</p>
<p>The sun emits a wide array or wavelength, and its &quot;blue rays&quot; are among the most disrupted by air. That is why the sky by day is blue. They are so much deviated that they look like coming from where the sun is not, giving the sky its opaque blue look. (Imagine air particles acting like tiny mirrors in random directions, reflecting only blue light)</p>
<p>Now imagine the sun being slightly beyond horizon. Rays that makes the light look &quot;white&quot; are for the most part not reaching you. Except blue ones.<br />
As they are redirected by diffraction, they reach places the other ones do not have a direct path yet/anymore. That is why before dawn/after dusk everything is blue-ish. (Snow only makes it more noticeable because it's white.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a herd of animals running through a really rocky field. These are special animals that come in all different colors and what color they are determines how far they can jump. The redder animals can jump really far while the bluer ones can only jump a little. So as they run through the field the red animals are able to jump over most of the rocks while the blue animals keep bumping into them and getting knocked off course. </p>
<p>The animals represent what are called photons. These are little bits of lights and like our herd of animals, the light is made up of photons of all different colors. The field is the air. While we can't see them with our eyes, the air is really made up of tiny little particles called atoms. These atoms are our rocks. Just like the animals, some photons are better at getting around them than others. Blue is not very good at getting around the rocks so they tend to cause blue photons to get bumped around and as a result we see more of it in certain cases. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It will depend not only on the elevation of the sun, but also on weather conditions, pollution, particles in suspension, etc.</p>
<p>It's an optical illusion. Just like the Green Flash on the Pacific Ocean in San Diego or the orange and purple sunsets of Arizona.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
