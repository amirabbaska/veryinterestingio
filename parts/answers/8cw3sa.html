People who have been infected once, often asymptomatically, will be immune from future infections (unless the virus mutates significantly). Check for example the [PAHO WHO] (<a href="http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11599&Itemid=41691&lang=en" target="_blank">http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11599&Itemid=41691&lang=en</a>).  My lab is involved in a number of Zika studies for which we rely on samples from infected patients, and those are now extremely hard to get. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Zika is still around, very much so. Caribbean, South America and South East Asia still have it. The World Health Organisation realised there's nothing we can do about it, they basically said its here to stay. If you're looking to have a baby you still are advised to avoid Zika areas for 9+ months prior to conceiving, for either men or women, and at any time during pregnancy. Cases are dropping compared to last year but its here to stay.
Apparently unto 80% of people who get it don't show signs of it, but you can get a specific Zika test done to check. Zika countries report: <a href="http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/situation-report/10-march-2017/en/" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/situation-report/10-march-2017/en/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I just made this account I do not have flair but I am a medical anthropology doctoral student having researched and published on the Zika virus.</p>
<p>Zika is most definitely still around but like most mosquito borne disease it is incredibly difficult to gain an accurate picture via epidemiology. As others have stated one of the main reasons we have not heard much about it lately in the US is due to there being limited cases, very often as a result of secondary travel at this point.</p>
<p>In Latin America where I conduct my fieldwork Zika raises multiple concerns including it is usually asymptomatic or mild, and it shares many parallels with other vector borne diseases such as dengue (which is generally perceived as a greater health concern). this necessitates clinical testing which is often not free, limiting further understandings of Zika's spread. </p>
<p>Despite this governments have still been declaring areas to be endemic sites of Zika transmission most often due to the prevalence of the primary mosquito vector Aedes aegypti.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Did the virus become less virulent? Was it not Zika that caused the birth defects? Did people build up a herd immunity? We're not sure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
