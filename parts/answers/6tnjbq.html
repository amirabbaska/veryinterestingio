		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They might not be turning for at least two reasons: 1) they have been commanded offline for maintenance, because the power isn't needed, ...; 2) the local wind sensor on the turbine doesn't detect the minimum wind needed to generate minimum power because or hills, wind currents, spoilage from other turbines, ... .</p>
<p>The wind turbine has a rotation rate that extracts the maximum energy, as a function of windspeed.  If all the turbines are made by the same company, and they are all in the same wind, then that optimization process is likely to have them turning at very similar rates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that this is a seperate question but (forgive my ignorance here) do the turbines start turning purely by wind power or is there some sort of starter motor? I only ask because of the size and obvious weight of blades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) trip alarm was engaged</p>
<p>2) energy curtailment</p>
<p>3) scheduled maintenance </p>
<p>4) little to no wind. They come in streams and some turbines will get it while others next to it will not. Sometimes. </p>
<p>And they're not entirely spinning at the same speed. It's just hard to tell from where you're at. If you were to look at the SCADA data, you'll see each one is spinning at a different rpm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blade pitch can be adjusted to keep the turbine spinning at the most efficient speed. Like mentioned elsewhere, if they are all the same model of turbine they will all spin at approximately the same speed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason they all turn the same speed is because the alternators are synchronized with the electrical grid frequency when they are generating. </p>
<p>In other words they turn at a constant rpm to generate at 50 or 60 hz and they will vary the blade pitch to extract the optimal energy from the wind. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
