<blockquote>
<p>The explanation for the phenomenon is that, in the cortex, verbal repetition repeatedly arouses a specific neural pattern that corresponds to the meaning of the word. Rapid repetition makes both the peripheral sensorimotor activity and central neural activation fire repeatedly. This is known to cause reactive inhibition, hence a reduction in the intensity of the activity with each repetition. Jakobovits James (1962) calls this conclusion the beginning of &quot;experimental neurosemantics&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In eli5 terms our brains can't keep interpreting the same stimulus at the same intensity because it gets tired. And that's when things get weird. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A word is just an arbitrary sound. Normally it has meaning because of context and perception, but if you just repeat the word over and over, then it has no context and nobody is perceiving any meaning from it, so you come back to the realization that you are really just repeating some random sound. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This phenomenon is called &quot;Jamais vu&quot; (like Deja vu and Presque vu). It's often seen in schizophrenia (as imposter syndrome) , epilepsy, amnesia etc, but this is the very famous (and harmless) mild version of it. </p>
<p>Basically they thing it's a kind of brain fatigue, which comes across as a variation on depersonalisation but for words instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
