		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue eyes are what are called Autosomal recessive (this isn't necessarily 100% true, but it is good enough we can work with it).</p>
<p>Autosomal recessive means that both alleles (meaning genes that you get from your parents) need to be recessive in order to be expressed in the offspring. </p>
<p>Now lets say that this blue eyed person's alleles are represented by  'rr'. A person needs two little 'r's, one from the father and one from the mother, to have blue eyes. Here's where it gets interesting. Father and Mother do not need to have blue eyes to necessarily have a blue eyed kid. If Mom has a Brown eyed allele and blue eyed allele, she will have brown eyes, but still carry a blue eyed gene, or what we would write as 'Rr'. If the father has the same 'Rr' pattern, then there is 1/4 chance of one of their kids getting 'rr' and having blue eyes. Also, they will have a 1/2 chance of getting a kid with 'Rr', meaning the gene is still present, even if it isn't being expressed. </p>
<p>A one more point before I wrap up with an answer. Since blue eyes do not necessarily put a person at risk of early death in the wild, they are not selected against in population. The lack of disadvantage means that the likelihood of someone with blue eyes living as long as someone with brown eyes is pretty good, and increases the chances of a blue eyed person mating with another blue eyed person, or a brown eyed person with an 'r' allele. You could even argue that blue eyes are selected for in modern populations, as some consider those with blue eyes more attractive and therefore increase that person's chances of mating (although the applicability of that could definitely be questioned).</p>
<p>In short</p>
<p>Because a gene can be carried without being expressed in a person, it can survive a surprising amount of time without ever showing up as a blue eyed person. All it takes to express that gene is one other person with that recessive allele to mate with them, and a blue eyed person can be born. And because blue eyes are not usually selected against in nature, when someone does appear with blue eyes they are just as likely to mate as any other member of the population, increasing the chances of persistence in population.</p>
<p>Edit: I should have probably made this a bit more clear, eye color is not 100% controlled by one gene, it is controlled by quite a few genes that give each eye a unique hue and pattern. Eye color as whole however does work pretty well in models for autosomal traits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, eye color is a complex trait resulting from the interaction of MANY genes, not just one gene as previously thought. It's not as simple as just being &quot;recessive&quot;. </p>
<p>As someone else posted, recessive genes are only expressed if a person has two copies of them, one from each parent. They are not &quot;weaker&quot; than dominant genes.  Often what makes a gene recessive is that the protein it codes for doesn't work or it has a different function than the dominant protein. In the case of eye color, blue eyed people don't make as much melanin, which is a brown-colored pigment (protein) that also makes your skin tan and fruit turn brown when exposed to air. </p>
<p>That being said, recessive traits in general can be very common in a population if they are associated with a reproductive advantage. For example, dwarfism is actually a dominant trait, but it's not very common because having two copies of the dwarfism gene causes a baby to be stillborn or die shortly after birth. So people with dwarfism typically have one dominant allele for dwarfism and one recessive allele for normal height. But the recessive gene for normal height is far more common in the population because babies with two recessive copies reproduce more frequently, thus passing on that gene more often. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you may have misunderstood how dominant and recessive genes work. <a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/basics/patterns/" target="_blank">This has a lot of good information on the topic</a>. Note that there are a lot of other genes that go into eye colour, so in reality it's much more complicated than what I'll try to explain here. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But if blue eyes are recessive then surely nobody would have blue eyes today?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do you think this? The children of that original blue eyed person wouldn't have had blue eyes, but they were carrying the blue eye gene that didn't get expresed. Over the thousands of years, they have some kids, those kids have more kids, and eventually some of these distantly related cousins get together. The ones who each carry a blue eye gene have a chance of having blue eyed kids. You get half your genes from each parent, and if both parents have one blue eye gene and one brown eye gene (meaning they have brown eyes) you will have blue eyes if the halves you get each contain the blue eye gene. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recessive genes are no less likely to be inherited than any other.
This means they get passed down to about 1/2 of a carrier's progeny.  Recessive means they are only expressed when someone has a copy form both parents.   Odds are every carrier who reproduces is going to have at least one carrier descendant.  Nothing ever weeds the carriers out of the genome, and it takes genetic testing (or having a blue eyed kid) to even tell the gene is there.  Nothing ever selectively culls them out.  </p>
<p>It is likely the blue eyes mutation has occurred more than once.  If it did, science might be unable to tell the difference unless the populations were widely separated to prevent their descendants form interbreeding.  There ARE very black Africans with startlingly blue eyes.  Google it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So here's the deal. Yes, blue eyes are recessive but imagine you were the first dude to have blue eyes. That guy had his way with every woman in the tribe. He was probably considered a god. Could have been a female but think about it. One guy and fifty females could make fifty kids in nine months. One female and fifty guys could only make one baby in nine months. So probably had to be a dude to spread the gene. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
