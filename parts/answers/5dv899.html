		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a fairly big question. It's a stable pattern that shows up in various countries and across time periods, though with a lot of exceptions. Possible answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Government intervention is more helpful in cities (which require active management to function, and collapse without rules) than in the country (where systems are set up to run independently, and regulations cause only headaches.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People self-select. Those who believe in collective action and change tend to move to the city, those that believe in self-reliance and tradition move to the country. Marginalized minority groups that would never form a large community in the country can form neighborhoods in a city. It's hard to say whether this is cause or effect sometimes, but it strengthens existing patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>Churches often play a much stronger social role in small towns than in cities, with religion supporting social conservatism.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would argue, having lived in both a rural setting and city setting that I have seen government work better in the city and the problems of the city were so large that only the government could solve them.</p>
<p>In my rural youth I never saw the government function well, the police were an hour away and the volunteer fire company would arrive after the fire was out. Zoning was whatever the locals felt like and environmental standards were bent to the will of the local farmer. Why would I want more government? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, this is not a new phenomenon.  It's been this way since the dawn of civilization.  There's an old (perhaps simplistic) slogan - &quot;Civilization happens at the crossroads of trade.&quot; Here we assume a civilization is one that lives in cities and has mastered writing.</p>
<p>Trade requires several things. A relatively educated workforce, access to writers (among the first written examples from Ancient Sumer is a customer complaint letter), relatively tolerant attitudes to new ideas and new peoples. Without it, your city will not prosper.  </p>
<p>This cocktail of people, ideas, goods, learning, and writing, creates a feedback loop. Accepting one group of strangers makes it easier to welcome the next. Writing allows cities to develop &quot;rules of the game&quot; (laws), so the players understand how to interact.  Different peoples accept them to trade efficiently; the laws also influence how they live. </p>
<p>In rural areas, people do not have this exposure. They don't meet many people from other cultures, their learning is limited to their immediate environment, they don't understand laws created by others. More importantly, strangers frequently loot them, stealing their crops and livestock or seek to take their land and enslave them. The only friendly strangers are mostly missionaries selling a religion that claims to control the elements. </p>
<p>All this makes rural communities much more &quot;set in their ways&quot; than urban areas. They don't like strangers much; they welcome religion so they can feel control over their lives. God and Guns are vital. Fast city folks seem to disrespect their God and make everyone vulnerable to His wrath. They don't understand the need for guns. </p>
<p>This explanation simplifies the issue. Let's make it more concrete. </p>
<p>If you lived on a remote farm and a stranger came calling, wouldn't you want to grab your gun?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rural people don't see the benefits of government spending and view themselves as more self reliant, where as urban city people need the government to get large projects accomplished and are more reliant on government action. Issues that people in larger populated areas like transgender bathrooms, public transportation...ect  seem silly and alien to them. Add in the fact that the population in rural areas is mostly older generations as the younger generations move away to the city for schooling or jobs, and older people are typically more conservative, hold the church in higher regard towards their political decision making. Also gun rights matter more to rural people's, hunting is often established as part of their upbringing, many have had guns since they were kids.</p>
<p>Having grown up and currently living in the rural Midwest this is what I'm basing my idea on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By the very nature of their beliefs it influences their decision of where to live. The very idea of conservatism is individualilism (freedom of the individual), while progressives core concept is socialism (or at least, belief in social programs). This doesn't mean that conservatives inherently want to isolate or that progressives want to integrate, but those things are more closely related to their code of ethics, ideas on individual rights, and economy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
