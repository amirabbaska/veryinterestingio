<p>Californium is used as a neutron source - one microgram (µg) of californium-252 emits 2.3 million neutrons per second.  </p>
<p>This is useful for starting up nuclear reactors.  </p>
<p>It's also useful for making portable &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_activation_analysis" target="_blank">spectroscopes</a>&quot; (We know what kind of radiation the radioactive isotopes of various elements give off.  So if you convert the atoms in a sample to radioactive isotopes, you can determine what elements are in it by the radiation it gives off.)</p>
<p>It's also used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_imaging#Neutron_radiography_.28film.29" target="_blank">Neutron Radiography</a>, which is kind of like an X-ray.  <del>Instead of the radiation passing through the subject, though, you're making the subject radioactive and then exposing film with the radiation it gives off.</del>(Thanks for the correction, /u/ComanderBubblz.) Because it interacts with the relatively tiny nucleus of atoms, rather than the much larger electron shells, it can penetrate deeply, even into into dense materials.  This is useful for analyzing things too dense to X-ray, like metal or rock.  It's often used for checking aerospace components for hidden flaws, for example.</p>
<p>Finally, it's sometimes used as a radiation source to kill cancer cells.</p>
<p>So why is it expensive?  Well, you have to start with Curium, which is processed out of spent nuclear fuel rods.  You get about 20 grams out of a ton of spent fuel.  Then, you take the curium, and put it in a special nuclear reactor designed to bombard it with neutrons.  After leaving it like that for a long time, you need to separate out the Californium 252 (the useful isotope) from the other 20 stable isotopes and other transplutonium elements. Only two places in the world even do this—Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia.  Oak Ridge is able to produce about half a gram annually.  And due to the half life of only 2.646 years (that's 2 and a half years, not two thousand six hundred), the world supply decreases very quickly.</p>
<p>Edit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a research scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) who just finished up a project on improving Californium-252 production.  I'm pretty jet-lagged right now, but I'll take a shot at answering this one.  Cf-252 is useful because it is a very strong source of neutrons, which it produces because of a reaction known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_fission" target="_blank">spontaneous fission</a>.  Spontaneous fission is one of my favorite nuclear science concepts, and it describes a phenomenon where some nuclei that should not be able to fission will suddenly fission without any apparent cause.  This is getting into ELI25 territory, but the reason why spontaneous fission can occur is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">quantum tunneling</a>, where the wave-like nature of particles sometimes allows them to bend the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Several users have already mentioned uses for Californium, which include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Killing cancer cells in some cancer drugs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A source of neutrons for starting up nuclear reactors (it's helpful for nuclear reactors to be able to start up at a predictable and steady rate);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A source of neutrons for neutron radiography (which is a lot like using X-rays to see through things, except that neutrons produce much higher resolution images);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oil well logging - petroleum engineers can use neutron sources to find oil deposits because the hydrogen in oil reflects neutrons more than solid rock;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nuclear security research and detector calibration - Cf-252 can be used to mimic the neutron signal produced by Plutonium-240 in spent nuclear fuel that someone might be trying to steal, so safeguards scientists use Cf-252 sources to calibrate their instruments and avoid the politics of procuring plutonium samples;</p>
</li>
<li>Heavy element production. Heavy isotopes like Californium, Berkelium, and Einsteinium are often used as targets to bombard with particles and create even heavier elements.  In fact, element 117 was recently named &quot;Tennessine&quot; in honor of the heavy elements supplied by ORNL in Tennessee.</li>
</ul>
<p>So why is Cf-252 so expensive?  Cf-252 costs a lot to make per gram both because the process for making it is expensive, but also because we can't make very much.</p>
<p>Producing Cf-252 is very difficult.  Our targets initially contain Curium isotopes, and they need to absorb between 6-8 neutrons to transmute into Cf-252.  Each interaction with neutrons has a chance to fission (and destroy) a nucleus, and as a result the majority (~99%) of the isotopes are destroyed before they can be transmuted into Cf-252.  These Curium isotopes are themselves rare and our supply of them is limited (we got our current feedstock from when the Savannah River Site was reprocessing reactor fuel, which they aren't doing anymore).</p>
<p>The facilities that are used to produce Cf-252 are also expensive.  Cf-252 is produced in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at ORNL, and the Cf-252 targets are incredibly radioactive when they come out of the reactor, so techs have to separate isotopes remotely using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_cell" target="_blank">hot cells</a>.  Working with hot cells is very slow and the techs are paid very well (and they deserve it too, I have the grace of a retarded puppy whenever I try using a hot cell - the techs are practically surgeons).  HFIR is also used for materials science experiments, and it costs us something like $300k per day to shut down, so anything that goes into the reactor must go through a thorough (and expensive) course of QA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've already been given good answers on the science side, so I thought I would talk about the economics. </p>
<p>This is like the diamonds-water paradox:  we need water to live but diamonds are mostly useless.  So why are diamonds more expensive than water?  </p>
<p>Well, it's because the market price depends upon both demand and supply -- particularly <em>on the margin</em>. </p>
<p>Where does demand for water come from?  You need at least a couple of glasses of water a week to survive, and you'd be willing to pay a lot for this.  After that, you'd want several more gallons per week for things like washing dishes or hygiene, and you'd be willing to pay a fair amount for that. And ultimately, you'd be willing to pay only a tiny bit for the 300th gallon in a week, which you use for the convenience of leaving your tap running while your  shave, or for water gun fights, or for washing your car, or whatever.  This is a demand curve -- you order the amount people are willing to pay, and you plot the amount they are willing to pay for each subsequent gallon of water.  </p>
<p>In the modern world, it's cheap to supply even a whole lot of water, and there's a lot of competition (in addition to regulated utilities).  So, sure, Culligan would love to charge you a fortune for that first glass of water, and you'd be willing to pay for it if Culligan were your  only source for water. But a ton of other sources can provide you with water, and they'll undercut each others' prices to pick up market share.  Ultimately, a producer will be be willing to sell his nth gallon of water for no less than what it costs him to deliver you the nth gallon of water.  This makes the supply curve -- usually it's cheaper to provide the first gallons than it is to provide the last gallons (because you need to utilize less convenient sources to provide more gallons -- exe., wells may provide a small amount of water a very low cost, but large quantities of water require building a dam). So the supply curve is generally upwards sloping.  With water, the curve is pretty flat and pretty low in most places.  </p>
<p>So the price comes on the margin, where the demand curve intersects the supply curve.  With water, the demand curve starts high but gets low fast.  It intersects the supply curve at a large number of gallons, where the willingness to pay is pretty low. </p>
<p>The demand curve for diamonds is not nearly as high, but not very many are sold.  So you are seeing the amount people are willing to pay for a very small number of diamonds.  </p>
<p>It's the same thing with Californium.  u/tsuuga points out several applications for Californium, but the truth is that Californium is not that important for society.  Many other elements are much more valuable to industry -- like copper and iron.  But Californium is rare and expensive to produce.  So the price you see is how much buyers are willing to pay for the first few ounces of this element, which is much more than other buyers are willing to pay for their gazillionth ton of copper.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Californium is expensive because it is difficult to create. It does not occur naturally in the Earth due to its short half-life (898 years for californium-251, 2.64 years for californium-252, the far more common isotope) and is only created inside nuclear reactors or particle accelerators when elements such as curium, americium and plutonium are irradiated with neutron radition over an extended period of time, which may produce just a few milli-grams of californium. </p>
<p>Only two sites in the world produce californium; the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S.  and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia, which produce 0.25 grams and 0.025 grams a year respectively.</p>
<p>Californium is highly radioactive; a microgram of californium can produce 139 Million neutrons per minute. As such it can be used to help start nuclear reactors, or for use in neutron spectroscopy. It can also be used as a neutron source in certain radiation therapies for specific kinds of cancer when other treatments fail.</p>
<p>So it's a combination of hard to make, plus only a limited amount made plus difficult storage and transportation (due to its high radioactivity) that make it expensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
