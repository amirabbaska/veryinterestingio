			<div class="markdown"><p>One small correction, the air doesnt actually move with sound. Its a pressure wave tha travels trough the air, thats a common misconception.<br />
To illustrate:
If there is a speaker 20 meters away from you, it doesnt &quot;shoot&quot; air at you, it presses the air in front of it together. This creates pressure in the air.<br />
As the air doesnt stay compressed without something to hold it, it expands again and in turn compresses the air in front of it and so on.<br />
This goes untill your ears, which can feel this pressure difference.  </p>
<p>This is how sound moves through air. For any kind of music, this happens rhythmically depending on how high the note is: high note means lots of changes  per second, low note means fewer changes.<br />
Also, in a medium all sound moves pretty much the same speed, the  rate of compression (how often its pushed and pulled per second) determines the pitch
TL:DR
Soundwaves work me pushing air together and apart (compressing and decompressing), NOT by pushing air to you.  </p>
<p>Didnt want to sound overly correct, its just a problem for a lot of people i teach, so i thought id explain. </p></div>		</li>
