			<div class="markdown"><p>If your bowel movements are enough to validate a permanent perforated tube in your rectum you should look into first slowly changing your diet.  A very small change can help a lot. Try isolating one food type for two weeks to see if it helps. (Ie try taking dairy out for 2 weeks, if no change then try removing high protein vegetable (beans etc...) then maybe red meat or gluten or fast food). </p>
<p>Sometimes it can be fairly easy to figure out, and relatively easy to fix, and it's not always to do with how healthy you eat. I had terrible gas as a vegetarian and I traced it back to quinoa.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work look into stool transplants, they have been shown to be fairly effective at getting your dietary fauna back in check permanently. </p>
<p>Edit: Bowel not bowl movements....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a problem called intestinal pseudo-obstruction where the colon basically stops contracting. As bacteria produce more and more gas the colon stretches. At a certain point the colon actually starts to cut off its own blood supply. Before it gets to that point we sometimes place a colonic decompression tube. It is a long flexible tube with a bunch of holes in it. We have to place it with a colonoscopy otherwise it isn't high enough. That is the problem with a rectal tube for gas. It doesn't help much if the gas is above the rectum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be in a &quot;fixed&quot; position, following the intestants attached to a side, with a little valve/escape at the scrotum. It would have some sort of filter too so ofcourse only gases would be able to leave through this tube.<br />
Very flexible and inert so it wouldn't interfere with the digestion itself.</p>
<p>Worst case might be a few drops of condensation with an unpleasant smell(which is maskable), which is far easier to control than farts which in some cases locks people indoors because of anxiety issues.</p>
<p>Problems: Setting a filter for gases only to escape the intestants, and making sure they don't get clotted with fluids.
Not interfering with the natural habitat of the digestion workings (bacteria).  </p>
<p>The goal is to continuously decompress the internal gases, so no buildup gaspockets which results in no more farts. Yet a continuous leak of gas, which would be so small it wouldn't even be noticeable.</p>
<p>*I always have this idea when I'm feeling bloated and really needed to type this down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could light the escaping gas, like they do at.. is it oilfields?</p>

<p>Or store it up and pipe it up to mouth level each time you need to light a cigarette. Quite useful.</p></div>		</li>
