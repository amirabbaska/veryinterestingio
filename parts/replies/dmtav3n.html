			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that for wind propelled debris and actual wind caused damage, concrete homes have been proven to be more reliable/safer. The University of Texas has carried out studies in the past that demonstrate that Tornado and hurricane wind projectiles cannot penetrate concrete homes with the ease in which they penetrate wood frame houses. There are several videos on the internet that demonstrate this fact. In addition, having lived in Puerto Rico's Hurricane alley, I can personally attest that damage to concrete buildings is slight. We build our homes out of concrete cinderblock, rebar and cement fillings. Our roofs are also formed cement slabs. The term bunker comes to mind. The walls are approximately 10 inches thick, so I do not understand where your &quot;4 foot thick walls&quot; example is coming from. There are actually som images on the Internet showing damage on Culebra (a small island north east of Puerto Rico) that was practically run over by Irma. They show several wooden frame houses demolished right next door to basically untouched cement home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concrete homes can be made to be safer. It requires steel reinforcement and has 3-4 foot thick walls. That is what was proven in the UT study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A well engineered, reinforced concrete storm shelter only needs to be 6 inches thick to withstand an EF-5 tornado. A structure with walls 3 to 4 feet thick would be a literal bomb shelter. That's according to FEMA guidelines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had trouble finding the UT study, but did run across a video from the Texas Tech University National Wind Institute. The concrete blocks, which I must believe are filled with cement, are less than a foot thick, and resisted the penetration of a wooden beam launched via an air cannon at 240mph. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its sad that your comment is the top comment. You are so wrong. I have seen a 10 lb stainless steel slab slam into 8 inches of concrete at mach .5 and blow out only 2 inches of concrete. No hurricane can do better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are wrong about hurricanes. Concrete is much better during those. Hurricane winds will demolish wooden houses but won't affect concrete ones. That's why you always see such devastation in the smaller Caribbean islands, but Puerto Rico fares so much better. Houses there are made of concrete, even the roof. My homeowner's insurance in PR was just $500. In Florida, for a similar house, but with a wooden roof I have to pay 4-6 times that amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  Same goes for the Dominican Republic.  Most structures (outside of shanty towns) are concrete, so there's not nearly as much permanent damage in the island as in the smaller Antilles.  You'll never get anywhere close to 90% of the buildings in the island destroyed, no matter how strong the hurricane.  Insurance is not only super cheap, most people simply don't bother because you'd never conceive of a hurricane destroying your house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>With tornadoes most damage is done by winds so strong that they dismantle concrete, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>-this is incorrect. concrete block construction consists of iron rebar meshed together and bound to provide reinforcing strength between the blocks and this cavity is then filled with poured concrete.</p>
<p>this is for either pre-cast or hollow block construction. hurricane winds would need to be carrying a wrecking ball in order to topple a wall made in this fashion.</p>
<p>the only other weak point really with concrete wall construction would be that the roof is metal or wood not concrete poured.  this is where the storm may pry the roof off or damaging the internal joinery work and thus causing damage to the concrete. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typhoons and tornadoes are not the same thing.  We call typhoons hurricanes in the US, just like the one that recently flooded Houston, Texas and is currently impacting Florida. The maximum winds in typhoons and hurricanes are usually 150-180 mph or 240-290 kph.  The maximum winds in a tornado can reach over 300 mph or 480 kph. </p>
<p>Hurricanes have a much larger geographic impact and usually are accompanied by much worse rain, but large tornadoes absolutely demolish anything they come in contact with.  Wood, concrete, steel, it doesn't matter.  Tornadoes can have wrecking balls because they can, quite literally, pick up your neighbors car or even their house and throw it at your house like it was nothing.  </p>
<p>OP said most hurricanes damage comes from flooding and that brick and blocks are just as prone to flooding and molding as wood.  If the ground washes out from underneath a structure, it doesn't matter how well-built it is, it will be structurally compromised and wood would be cheaper to rebuild.  I think that was the gist of what they were saying.  </p></div>		</li>
