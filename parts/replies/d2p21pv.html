			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs are also very visual. They respond very acutely to our body language and are easily trained by hand signals. Obviously, their ears are more sensitive to certain sounds as well.  I don't think you can really say dogs have a primary sense. If a person pictures the ocean, they probably use at least three senses to imagine it. Dogs are probably similar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They obviously have other functioning senses, but their sense of smell is predominantly how they navigate the world, and like the quote said, is wildly disproportionately strong compared to a human's, versus say their hearing, which may only be 10 or a 100 times as good (pulling that number out of the air, not an actual estimation). </p></div>		</li>
