			<div class="markdown"><p>6400 mils in a circle is an approximation used to make certain types of ranging math easier to do in your head.</p>
<p>There really are 6283.185307.... mils in a circle, because &quot;mils&quot; is short for &quot;milliradians,&quot; or thousandths of radians.</p>
<p>There are 2PI radians in a circle. There are 2000PI mils in a circle.</p>
<p>Also, the relationship you mention doesn't really have anything to do with meters at all. Being a thousandth of a radian, a mil subtends an arc 1/1000th the radius of the arc.</p>
<p>You gave the relationship of 1m at 1km (1000m), but it works for any units.</p>
<p>1 cm at 1000 cm. 1 foot at 1000 feet. 1 parsec at 1000 parsecs. All one mil. Units don't matter.</p></div>		</li>
