<p>Wildfires spread with the wind. If a fire really blows up, the first hour's burn pattern almost always looks like <a href="http://images.slideplayer.com/14/4188322/slides/slide_2.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>, at least until the wind shifts. That's just how explosive wildfires take off--they are fanned by winds, and they spread most rapidly upslope. </p>
<p>So you can start by looking for the &quot;heel&quot;, the tip of the wedge where the fire originated. It's not a big area--an engine crew almost always arrives on the scene before the fire is more than 200 yards on a side. (sometimes there's not much they can actually <em>do</em>--if the wind's blowing hard and the fire's crowning, a small crew won't be able to effectively fight the head face. But it's rare for the USFS to not know pretty close to exactly where the fire started.) </p>
<p>Often, the fire's heel is near the top of a ridge in the middle of nowhere, and a thunderstorm passed recently. Lightning strike. Case closed. </p>
<p>Other times, the heel will align with a campfire ring, or it will be right near a road (which means the fire was likely sparked by a dragging truck exhaust, or a tossed cigarette). In the wildland-urban interface, it's not uncommon for the heel to be near someone's patio.</p>
<p>From there, it takes a little police work to figure out what exactly happened. </p>
<p>EDIT: Obviously, the investigators use sophisticated forensic techniques, not just &quot;look for the heel&quot;. But they typically have <em>a lot</em> of good early observations to help the investigation. The first fire crew on the scene will send a lookout up to a vantage point to observe the fire and take a weather reading. </p>
<p>It's not like investigators are combing a 15,000 acre burn scar looking for the cinders of a cigarette butt.  </p></div>		</li>
