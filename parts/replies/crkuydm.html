			<p>Yes diet Dr Pepper is the closest.<br><br>You used to be able to get diet Faygo, and it was all the closest you could get.  Barely tell the diff.  Even diet Faygo Cola was good.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I don't understand how people think this.  I love Dr. Pepper but I can't stand diet Dr. Pepper.  I would rather drink most other diet drinks.<br><br>Dr. Pepper 10 on the other hand hits close enough to be worth the caloric savings most of the time.</p>		</li>

			<p>Could not agree more.<br><br>For me, the closest diet drinks are Diet Sunkist, Diet Barq's or A&amp;W Root Beer, and Diet A&amp;W Cream Soda.</p>		</li>

			<p>YEs.  A 2-liter bottle of DP10 has less calories than a 12 oz can of regular DP.  <br><br>2 liters of DR10 has ~60 calories (10 calories a serving x &quot;about 6&quot; servings in a 2-liter bottle of DP10).  12 oz can of regular DP has 150 calories.</p>		</li>

			<p>$.99 a 32 oz, Moon Mist is better than My Dew.  The Pineapple is ridiculous.  Red Pop is a staple, and od course Rock and Rye is every pre-ICP Faygo fans first love.  Sometimes, a summer day requires a glass full of ice and Rock and Rye.  Haven't seen the Diet in a while tho.</p>		</li>

			<p>It really is, no comparison.  Isn't there another one I like?  Not Jones or any of the trendy ones, there is another older one I thought but you're right Faygo Cream Soda is ridiculous, unlike any other pop at all really.  Forgot that one.</p>		</li>

			<p>Cream soda is essentially carbonated water and vanilla flavouring. Back in the day in good old Britain, we used to serve it with a spoonful of vanilla ice cream on the top.</p>		</li>
