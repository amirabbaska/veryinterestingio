<p>You used to be able to get diet Faygo, and it was all the closest you could get.  Barely tell the diff.  Even diet Faygo Cola was good.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Dr. Pepper 10 on the other hand hits close enough to be worth the caloric savings most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diet Coke tastes different to Coke and I personally prefer it. Coca Cola keep making it because it's popular. Coke tastes far too sugary to me. But Coke Zero tastes almost exactly the same as regular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, most people have very little experience actually tasting things like baby wipes, skunk spray and grass.  For the majority of us, all of our flavor experience just comes from the way it smells, meaning that the artificial flavors don't actually have to taste exactly like the real thing in order to give people the impression of eating it.</p>
<p>This also means that the belly beans that don't taste like something absolutely horrifying are more likely to taste different to us.  For example, the orange flavored beans don't taste like orange to me because I've eaten real oranges.  The baby wipe flavored beans might not taste like actual baby wipes either, but I wouldn't know since I've never eaten any.</p></div>		</li>

A couple years ago, I had the privilege of tasting Centipede at the Fairfield, CA factory.  It tasted like dirt, pencil shavings, and bug.  I have no idea how to describe bug, but it tasted exactly like bug.  It was also odor-neutral, so the whole thing kind of surprised me.<br />
Some also contain actual flavor ingredients/fruit juices/what have you, as well.  Hopefully not Centipede.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One problem with all the artificial sweeteners is also an advantage--their potency. Diet soda contains a far smaller mass of dissolved sweetener. As a result, diet soda lacks the viscosity and mouthfeel of soda with sugar.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's actually a positive for me.  If I drink a non-diet soda these days I can't even get halfway through the can before I have to stop and it feels like my tongue and teeth have a veneer of sugar on them that takes a while to go away.</p></div>		</li>
