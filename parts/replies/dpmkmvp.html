			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the burns are not just burns along the outside skin but are often through deep tissue. And cells that die due to electrical burns in deep tissue risk gangrene and necrosis. Sadly that's why the risk of amputation is high in high voltage electrical mishaps.</p></div>		</li>

So if the possible heart attack, fluid loss, severe shock doesn’t kill you, your kidneys probably will years down the line. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The human body is not a perfect conductor for electricity and when electricity encounters resistance it generates heat. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit more on this: the water in our body is a good conductor, yet our skin is a very bad conductor. Both factors (or rather, all kinds of tissues) weigh in on this.</p></div>		</li>
