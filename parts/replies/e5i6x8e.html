			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this, too, for a long time. Since I moved to the US, I could tell if it's going to rain up to 24 hours before it happens because I'm usually already feeling the pre-migraine feeling. When I stopped taking birth control, the migraines stopped. I mean I still get them when I'm on my period, but I don't get them every time it rains anymore.</p></div>		</li>
