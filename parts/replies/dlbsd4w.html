			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an explanation <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/leap-years.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, it is a way to reach the real length of an year (365.242375), not adding the extra day in years divisible by 100 unless divisible by 400. Without this, the year length would be always 365.25, a little bit far from the real value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skipping the extra days on the 3 centuries give an average of 365.2425 days per year, pretty close to the exact value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We say that a year is 365 and 1/4 days but its actually slightly less, so we skip every 25th leap year, that's years divisible by 100. But even that isnt quite perfect, so we skip every 4th skip, years divisible by 400.</p>
<p>The year 2000 was one such year. We skipped the skip and it was a seemingly normal leap year.</p>
<p>Also some holidays like easter are based on the lunar cycle, which doesn't sync up perfectly with the calendar so even if everything else is correct those will almost surely be off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you think about it, it's pretty cool to have lived in a year divisible by 100 that is a leap year, as it hasn't happened since the year 1600, which was, as far as I know, the first time this occurred, and I believe that was just in some parts of the world. The US and probably many other countries didn't adapt this calendar until after 1600, meaning year 2000 was the first time this ever happened. </p></div>		</li>
