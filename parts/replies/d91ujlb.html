			<p>Is it true that, in the Carboniferous Period, bacteria and fungi had not evolved the ability to break down cellulose yet, leaving all these dead trees just littering the ground?</p>		</li>

			<p>Lignin, not cellulose.  All plants have cellulose, but lignin makes trees possible.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, so there was an abundance of fuel piled up, as dead trees would litter the forest and new ones grew on top of them. </p>		</li>

			<p>He's actually not quite correct, it was lignin rather than cellulose that was not decomposed at the time. Cellulose is common in all plants, lignin is more specific to trees.</p>		</li>

			<p>The Carboniferous trees made extensive use of lignin. They had bark to wood ratios of 8 to 1, and even as high as 20 to 1. This compares to modern values less than 1 to 4.</p>		</li>

			<p>And the bark is where all the lignin is, right? So they had millions of years' worth of un-decomposed bark lying around for the forest fires to burn.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't think millions of years of trees got the chance to pile up. But there was a lot of trees to fuel wild fires, thus creating coal deposits.</p>		</li>

			<p>no. fire is a chemical reaction where various fuels rapidly oxidize, creating light and heat. plasma is a state of matter where electrons are not bound to nuclei, and is <em>created by</em> heat (at least that's one way to create it)</p>		</li>

			<p>To add to this, another way is pressure. This is the case with re-entry heating on space vehicles which is commonly and incorrectly thought to be friction heating.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;If something were to re-enter the atmosphere very slowly. Would they still experience heat?<br><br>i dont think so. the heat is because air cant move around the falling object fast enough, so it gets pressurized instead. if the object fell slowly enough (or was narrow enough) the air wouldnt get &quot;stuck&quot; under it and wouldnt pressurize. so it would experience the same thing skydivers experience: icy wind<br><br>&gt;Is there an actual feelable 'layer' around the earth?<br><br>no. you know how the air gets thinner as you climb a mountain? it just keeps doing that. that's why the &quot;edge of space&quot; is so hard to define. many say it's 100km, because the air there is so thin it might as well not exist (and because it's a nice round number), but others set it lower or higher</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks. I have followup questions. If I get annoying at some point feel free to tell me off.<br><br>What keeps air from just 'flying off' into space if there's no actual 'layer' that's feelable in any way. Is there something 'invisible' so to speak, or is it just gravity? </p>		</li>

			<p>some of it does escape into space despite gravity. we're also lucky to have a magnetosphere which deflects most solar wind, otherwise thatt would blast the atmosphere off (not instantly, it'd still take millions of years)</p>		</li>

			<p>It can also depend on which component of air you<code>re talking about. Most of our atmosphere is made up of nitrogen and oxygen gas, and a very small component is helium. Due to the warmth of the Sun and the low mass of Earth, helium has an average velocity and low enough mass to escape Earth</code>s gravitational pull. There`s more details on Wikipedia as well. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Less of a layer, more of a pressure gradient. The density of the outer atmosphere is very low, and it grows denser closer to the surface. Think about how submarines need to endure intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean - a common analogy is to think of our atmosphere as an &quot;ocean of air&quot;.<br><br><br>If you were to enter the atmosphere very slowly, the air in front of your spaceship would have time to move out of the way. No pressure would build up in front of you, and you wouldn't experience much frictional heating either. To extend our ocean analogy, compare slowly climbing into the water vs. diving in from a cliff.</p>		</li>

			<p>First question: Plasma is a phase, similar to solid/liquid/gas. It is usually hot as it is higher energy than gas. The plasma created by re-entry is hot. This is explained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyle%27s_law" target="_blank">Boyle's law</a>.<br><br>Second question: Depending on what &quot;really slowly&quot; is, no, it will not experience a re-entry heating effect. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Baumgartner" target="_blank">Felix Baumgartner</a> is famous for his skydive that showed this.<br><br>Third question: Atmospheric pressure increases as a function of &quot;depth&quot; where the line between the atmosphere and vacuum is the &quot;surface&quot; So the transition would be imperceptible to the human body. It'd be a gradual change. There is not an actual line, but the operational line is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line" target="_blank">Karman line</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Ok so admittedly I don't have the best understanding of the role that oxygen plays in fire (or perhaps any exothermic reaction). The extent of my understanding is that oxygen itself doesn't burn but merely facilitates burning. However isn't it true that oxygen tanks can explode?</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nvaus" target="_blank">nvaus</a>
			<p>Oxygen tanks can explode because they're filled to extremely high pressure. Occasionally it can also happen because someone contaminated the hoses/fittings with oil or some other source of fuel.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, but not do to fire. Heat can cause the gas in the tank to expand and explode. Once the oxygen escapes, it can mix with gasses in the air to cause combustion, but often does not. Take a look at the in-air explosion of the Space X rocket from last year. It exploded, but most of the oxygen just tuned to gas without combusting.</p>		</li>

			<p>Oxygen tanks can detonate, but only if their container is a viable fuel. Most oxygen tank failures are more mechanical in nature, e.g. highly pressurized with weak/failing seals.</p>		</li>

			<p>Oxygen participates in the chemical reaction with the fuel source that produces the heat. For that reaction to begin, you need a minimum starter temperature but then it sustains and spreads itself.</p>		</li>
