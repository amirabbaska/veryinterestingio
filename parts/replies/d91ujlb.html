			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, so there was an abundance of fuel piled up, as dead trees would litter the forest and new ones grew on top of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so admittedly I don't have the best understanding of the role that oxygen plays in fire (or perhaps any exothermic reaction). The extent of my understanding is that oxygen itself doesn't burn but merely facilitates burning. However isn't it true that oxygen tanks can explode?</p></div>		</li>
