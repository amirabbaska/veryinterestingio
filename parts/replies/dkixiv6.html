			<div class="markdown"><p>Great, thanks! In a similar vein - how is it some allergies are triggered via the allergen evaporating either passively or by cooking, for example peanut oils in the air affecting peanut allergy sufferers whereas others can be around their cooking/hot allergen with no issues? </p>
<p>My unscientific understanding would be that the proteins responsible don't vaporise like peanut oil does?</p></div>		</li>
