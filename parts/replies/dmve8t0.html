			<div class="markdown"><p>Pro tip. When using a thumper don't crouch down or even walk too close to where the fault is. It bloody hurts. </p>
<p>I did a 240mm2 low voltage xlpe joint today. Probably will cost around $12000 all up and took 3 days if you include concrete cutting, traffic control, excavator, multi person crew etc etc. If it was over head I would have put in a set of  95mm cu bridges. Takes 30 minutes and costs $150. </p>
<p>One thing no one has mentioned is cost of replacing switch gear/transformers/testing and inspection after it's being inundated by water from the storm surge.  I've worked on the network after flooding. It's horrible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy locates! I sell cable fault locating equipment and man the whole underground fault finding process sucks and can be dangerous but its the best we can do. TDR isn't even helpful most of the time because there are still so many factors. There was a guy i met in Georgia state who would take off his shoes so he could better &quot;feel&quot; the thump. I cant imagine OSHA would be happy with that...</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have my unfettered respect. I'm glad I get to do the paperwork and leave the real work to you guys.</p>
<p>Also fuck XLPE. Fuck it <em>forever</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fucking road crossings. </p>
<p>I deal with data, but a quick way to make our outside plant beancounters wince is to tell them the buried cable is on the wrong side of the road from the customer they want to install to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing you missed was that there is also heat to consider, underground lines cannot carry the same <del>voltage</del> current due to the inability to shed heat like an uninsulated overhead line. </p>

<p>Edit: voltage vs current yes I know. But when talking about cable ratings for construction purposes you use KV</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only thing you missed...</p>

<p>Another issue on a slightly different tack is that you can't really put long distance high voltage transmission underground, because of capacitive losses, as well as cost, reliability, getting rid of heat and that it is damned hard work.</p>
<p>Although AC electricity can be transported a fair distance overhead, that distance is not infinite, due to capacitive losses.  Some of the carried electricity just leaks to ground.  Go to YouTube and look for videos of fluorescent lights being illuminated under high voltage lines. The light up because this leaking power passes through them.</p>
<p>These losses are much greater for underground cables than they are for overhead cables, and are worse again for undersea.  Ultimately, on a long enough cable, undersea, underground or overhead, all the power carried will be lost and no usable power will emerge from the far end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I don't work in this field, I do know in my electrical engineering coursework a professor of mine always said that this was the main answer.  Because spacing between the lines is usually smaller when burying lines (due to costs) in the ground, the capacitance goes up.  As the capacitance goes up, you have extra losses. Over longer distances, the losses can become substantial.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I am a dry utility consultant, my partner and i design the systems. One of the biggest reasons no one wants to put transmission UG is because of the prohibitive cost of cooling. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, he also missed the higher insurance costs for the business and higher cost of labor as an incentive to counteract the hazards of accidentally calling a maker when using the thumper. I mean thumpers were made specifically for calling shai-hulud to carry the fremen from one place to another, using it for electric work is a headache OSHA doesn't need in addition to the costs mentioned above. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ExplainLikeImAnEstimator</p>
<p>Good summary. It is nice to see a fellow estimator give an accounting of underground and unforeseen conditions. We did civil work and had some jobs where the soils conditions added hundreds of thousands of additional cost from blasting ledge (too hard)  to replacing and stabilizing clay (too soft). </p>
<p>A lot of non construction folks don't get how costs can vary so widely for what they see as just dirt. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I really really hate T lines for that reason. How much risk can you stuff into one proposal? Well if it's 200 mi of 230kV, you can have all the risk! Every bit of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite part of the proposal - unit prices. Hit ledge? Unit price. Hit clay? Unit price. </p>
<p>I know all proposals don't allow this. But on one large distribution project (which was part of a massive statewide project) in the most NE state people made a fortune on matting unit prices. I had a sub and I marked him up 15%. We cleared more on that change order then the entire remaining contract. </p></div>		</li>
