			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think will happen to lithium as production of EV’s and other large battery storage systems ramps up? Will recovery of lithium increase rapidly enough to keep the price stable, or is there going to be a large run-up in lithium prices that makes it more difficult for manufacturers to acquire enough at cost-effective prices?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithium is the 25th most abundant element on earth. It's contained in the earths crust at concentrations of about 25mg per kg. i.e. There's <strong>lots</strong> of lithium around, it's just really spread out. We are not ever going to &quot;run out&quot; of lithium. What we're having trouble with is sources of highly concentrated, cheap to mine lithium. This is an engineering problem... how do we extract it cheaply? It's in sea water, it's in your front yard, it's everywhere... how do we get it out of all that stuff in a way that's cheap and not environmentally damaging? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to call up the well worn geologist joke: &quot;there's a trillion dollars worth of X in that formation, problem is it will cost a trillion dollars to extract it.&quot;</p>
<p>The thing is, if you can figure out how to reduce cost by 0.1%, you just moved 1 billion dollars onto the the profit side of the ledger. That is the history of extraction industries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that old batteries will be recycled since they are far more metal rich than ore. But of course new metal will need to be mined since the amount of batteries made is growing exponentially. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the important point. Lithium batteries are recycleable. </p>
<p>Also, since its water soluable and its density is so low, it tends to be everywhere and close to the surface. The more we extract and purify, the more we have to recycle and use. Unlike fossul fuels, which are better suited for making plastics, lubricants, and solvents which are also (slightly less) recyclable. </p>
<p>Burning oil is a waste for most applications. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some perspective in the form of actual percentage of lithium per battery would help. I can't give an exact percentage, I'm on  mobile right now.</p>
<p>I've seen the same worries for neodymium magnets.. Both types of products have names that mislead people about how much of the named elements they contain.</p>
<p>Both contain only a relatively small amount by weight and mass of the elements they're named after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent point. The run-up of EV’s may present significant problems, but access to lithium may eventually be a flow problem rather than a stock problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you work for Albamarle, FMC, or SQM. As you know, lithium is abundant.  New mines and expansions are being developed in South America that will catch up with lithium demand, but I think cobalt may be the thing that stunts growth in the EV market.  A large percentage of cobalt is mined in the Congo, and they are not known for their political stability.  The huge price increases in lithium and cobalt may temper the enthusiasm for electric vehicles too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cogent analysis.  Chinese lithium production is actually one of the most active sources right now.  Expect Chilean production to really ramp up in a few years and Bolivia / Argentina after that.</p>
<p>I don't expect battery price to have much effect on EV demand but it might temper some other power storage applications (residential, etc).</p></div>		</li>
