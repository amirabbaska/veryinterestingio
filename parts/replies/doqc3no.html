			<div class="markdown"><p>Bread doesn't actually go stale because it's losing moisture but rather because moisture is migrating out of the starches, causing them to crystalize. Bread will still go stale even in a very moist environment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that it matters for chips, but the reason why eating turned meat even if you really overcook it and destroy all the bacteria can hurt you, is that the waste byproducts those bacteria leave behind are essentially poisons and can cause you serious harm even if you aren't infected by say salmonella in the case of chicken.</p>
<p>Tl/dr if things go bad just killing the bacteria usually isnt enough to make it safe.</p></div>		</li>
