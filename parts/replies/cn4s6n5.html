			<div class="markdown"><p>While I am sure this is accurate for you, it is not the norm now. The first two years cram everything you talked about in, and the second two years are a sort of slave labor for the school. I'm in my third year of dental school and really all we have are patients... No classes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is totally untrue for most dental schools today. They are garbage, and most students stop learning via theory[instead of practice) after only two years. So many dumb/incompetent dentists being pumped out.</p></div>		</li>
