			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a gigantic leap to make from limited information.</p>
<p>First, we can't generalize from &quot;hurricanes&quot; to &quot;natural disasters&quot;. Hurricanes have exceptionally strong winds and low pressures and take days to approach. It's easy to imagine an animal with the right senses being able to detect that something is amiss. Earthquakes, on the other hand, give exactly zero warning before the arrival of the P waves. Many other natural disasters are somewhere in-between in the ability to sense it (such as volcanoes, that erupt with warning in the form of earthquakes and ground deformation, but whose warnings can be highly ambiguous).</p>
<p>Second, the study cited only mentioned a single animal (white-crowned sparrow) and it only found that decreasing atmospherinc pressure stimulated food intake. This may or may not mean that incoming storms also stimulate food intake, and it may or may not mean that the pressure sensitivity is an adaptation to deal with storms.</p>
<p>It's tempting to interpret things like this to support pre-conceived ideas like &quot;humans have lost our connection with nature so unlike everything else we aren't attuned to disasters&quot;. We need to consciously restrain ourselves from accepting such broad generalizations until the evidence supports it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And third: humans are quite sensitive to weather patterns. We can feel changes in barometric pressure and also changes in temperature. It doesn't take ultra modern radar to forcast immediate weather patterns....we just look at the sky. </p>
<p>Just because some other animals appear to be <em>more</em> sensitive doesn't make our own perceptions less valid. </p></div>		</li>
