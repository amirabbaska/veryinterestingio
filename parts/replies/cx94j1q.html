			<div class="markdown"><p>Chrondosarcoma, or bone cancer. I didn't &quot;beat&quot; it.  They cut it out. If it comes back somewhere else I'm screwed.  No amount of wishful thinking will matter. I had leukemia but stage 0, so doing nothing but scans. One of the cat scans discovered the bone cancer.  I recommend cat scans for everyone. They discover an amazing amount of defects that you never knew existed. Just be careful not to overreact to whatever they find. I have cysts that come and go, and several hernias that don't really cause any problems. But I wouldn't know about without the scans. One of them causes acid reflux so I'm careful about my diet now.  A good idea in any case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol I'd love to be able to get a cat scan and have a doctor study it for a while just because I'm curious. But I live in a country with public health care and that doesn't sound like a priority use of the system.</p></div>		</li>
