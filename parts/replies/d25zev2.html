			<div class="markdown"><p>You have molecules, and they want to form themselves up in easy and stable shapes. But you don't let them, you take them apart like unwinding a spring, and you put them in shapes that they only hold because they don't have the energy yet to go back into their oldshapes. </p>
<p>When you 'blow it up' all the bits and pieces come apart and rapidly re-form into the simpler, more stable, lower energy states. </p>
<p>Like take Oxygen and Carbon. They can chill with themselves. You might even have 2 Oxygens hanging out together and doing each others makeup, and 2 Carbons hanging out together watching football. But when Oxygen and Carbon go on a double date, whammo, things are about to get interesting because carbon and oxygen want to hook up together WAY more than oxygen and oxygen, or carbon and carbon. </p>
<p>Now they can split down the middle with each O getting a C (carbon monoxide), or one can get greedy and one C takes both O's home to get freaky (carbon dioxide) leaving one Carbon by itself (C blocked not cool bro). </p>
<p>In this tinder date, Oxygen is the oxidizer, and Carbon is the fuel. By themselves they just kind of hangout but what they really want is to find a better partner. One that can fill the empty void in their valence shells like having rabbits and a farm and living off the fat of the lam.  </p>
<p>Combine them, and the sexual energy is explosive leaving Carbon and Oxygen bound together, and a lot of energy released. Oh and explosions (in bed) </p></div>		</li>
