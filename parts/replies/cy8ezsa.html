			<div class="markdown"><p>Good post in general, but the comparison between the UK and the US is off.</p>
<p>Thatcher and her spiritual successors were anti-union in a similar way to the US establishment, but the labour movement in the UK has historically been much further into the mainstream, and had much wider acceptance, than in the US.</p>
<p>The Labour Party, for example, was created out of the union movement - as the name suggests. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK\)_affiliated_trade_union" target="_blank">Many unions</a> remain formally affiliated with the Labour Party, and are instrumental in choosing party leadership. Up until Tony Blair took it out in 1995, the Labour Party's constitution contained the famous Clause IV:</p>
<p><em>To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service</em></p>
<p>About 25% of the workforce in the UK is unionised, well above the OECD average, while in the US only about 11% of the workforce is unionised, well below OECD average. <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=UN_DEN" target="_blank">Source</a>.</p>
<p>The concepts of the welfare state and collective action, which a lot of Americans reject because of the association with socialism, are much more widely accepted in the UK.</p>
<p>So, while the Nordic countries have a brilliant system and are pretty exceptional in terms of effective unionism, it's a mistake to assume that attitudes towards unions are the same across the English speaking world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although the reasoning is a little flawed, I think the attitude of Unions as adversarial in their relationship with management is pretty correct in a general sense with many exceptions to the rule. That said, when unions have taken over in the UK the results have been very mixed or negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may not be an easy comparable, but there are examples of union violence in the UK.  The coal miners strike of '84, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to add that there are some jobs in the UK that you almost NEED to be part of a union in order to &quot;survive&quot;. The NUT (National Union of Teachers) is a good example as well as the NUS (National Union of Students). Of course there are probably plenty more, those are just two that I know well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point, but the difference between US &amp; GB here is smaller than the difference between GB &amp; EU, especially Benelux &amp; Nordic nations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't agree that a GB/EU distinction exists, I think it's much more granular. In fact the difference is greater between the Netherlands and Belgium than between the UK and Belgium. If you look at the link of OECD unionisation rates, you'll see the rate is substantially higher in the UK (25%) than Germany (17.7%), the Netherlands (17.6%) or France (7.7%). Also higher than Greece, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic and Poland, just to pick out a few other EU member states. It is lower than Luxembourg and Belgium, which have rates comparable to the Nordic countries, and also lower than Italy and Ireland. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like to say, in the UK the people are very happy to have unions, it's just there is lots of anti-trade union government legislation and businesses use underhand tactics to destroy unions, whereas in the US it seems even people who would benefit from unions think they are destructive. But still you make a very good point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unions in the US seemed confrontational and downright destructive to a company.</p>

<p>This is the direct result of the <em>backlash</em> against Unions and the long-term demonization of them, not a result of them in the first place. The <em>owners</em> got so adversarial that the Unions have had little choice but to make it us vs them. This isn't to say it hasn't been taken too far, but there are plenty of times where owners are essentially forcing people to work shit conditions for shit pay, and if they don't like it they can leave, but all that happens is someone else more desperate comes in, and eventually gets hurt or screwed. In a way, they're protecting those people, it's just hard to show how <em>potential</em> harm is being stopped in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>In particular, we have Unions to thank for much of our safety and labor law. Conditions and work situations have been particularly terrible numerous times in our history, and it's taken unions and strikes to fix it. They have a purpose, but they're being abused, just as the position of ownership has been all too often as well.</p>
<p>People that speak of unions making goods cost too much and sinking business aren't thinking of a Union SOCIETY, where everyone is unionized, meaning wages are universally higher for workers, meaning they can <em>afford</em> those raised costs as well. The business doesn't sink because people still buy the goods.</p>
<p>There's no easy answer, but without Unions, we've have rampant exploitation and death in our job sites, so I'd rather take 'em than leave 'em any day.</p></div>		</li>
