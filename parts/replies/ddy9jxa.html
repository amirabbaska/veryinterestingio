			<div class="markdown"><p>The effects of fluoride in drinking water are systemic. This means it is absorbed by the digestive tract and stored in your bone/teeth. Toothpaste and other forms of professional dental applications (also known as topical) do not have the same long term effect as the drinking water. It's more like putting a bandaid on the issue.  Fluoride itself, in a topical setting, interferes with bacteria known for causing cavities and helps provide fluoride ions for remineralization of teeth (making the atomic structure stronger). Brushing without fluoride or even without toothpaste is beneficial as long as you are physically removing the plaque. The other big push with non-fluoridated toothpaste right now is just a social move for the nutties that think it used by the government for mind control. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh. I'm pretty sure that they make it for babies and little kids (because they swallow toothpaste frequently) and people with a fluoride sensitivity (because swallowing even a tiny bit can make them nauseous all day and cause stomach aches)</p></div>		</li>
