<p>The water here is lovely, straight from the Brecon Beacons I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water is one of the few things I miss about living in East Cheshire, water from the reservoirs in the peaks tasted fantastic, could never understand why bottled water was even a thing until I made the mistake of trying Essex water. Makes shit tea too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cousin lives up in Leeds where the water is pretty soft. Whenever he comes down to Norfolk, he fills up as many bottles of water as he can to bring home because he prefers the taste. I think we take the taste for granted sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's a thing. I've lived with hard water my whole life and went to visit a friend in another state for a week. He was on a fresh water well in a very vegetative area (I come from a urban setting). Granted, the showers were great and I used little soap, the water felt so slimy and  was somewhat uncomfortable for the first few days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah trying to explain the concept of hard/soft water to people in QLD, Australia (where I now live) is impossible. They do not get it at all haha. I've probably scared them off from drinking tap water if they ever choose to visit England. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm from QLD and reading all these comments I felt like everyone had gone insane. Hard water, soft water?! Google'd it. Makes sense I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had the same problem when I went to basic training. A lot of people from a lot of different parts of the country. I said something along the lines of &quot;wow the water here is really hard&quot; and a lot of people from rural or lower income areas had no idea that there were different qualities of water and took me to being an idiot since it's pretty hard to explain the concept to people who don't get it. </p></div>		</li>
