<p>It's kinda boggling how interconnections weren't noticed until now. Got an ELI5 for how it was discovered?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a known tissue, but it’s filled with fluid. When we previously saw it under microscope, it was dehydrated. The structure was collapsed.</p>
<p>They examined live tissue with a fluorescent fluid to see all the details.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Later; originally it was discovered by endoscope. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still can’t understand, aren’t they just talking about the intersticial space (filled with intersticial fluid/filtered plasma)between every cell in our body?</p>
<p>If yes, everybody already knew the tissue was dehidratated in preparation for being looked at under the microscope...whats the big discovery?</p>
<p>If it is something surrounding every space left between cells it is trivial that it is connected...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My science teacher explained it to me perfectly like an eli5 </p>
<p>The tissue we usually see is dried out and usually stained to make it easier to see<br />
So these sacs full of fluid flatten like pancakes making them essentially unseeable
But looking at live tissue aka liquid filled sacs
Makes them much more noticeable </p>
<p>TLDR so far scientists had trouble keeping it moist</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because the organ is so microscopically tiny that ir dries up and collapses on itself when examined post mortem or during outside-of-body examination. We've seen it, but assumed it was just a tissuey part of the organ it surrounded.</p></div>		</li>
