			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably know already, but just in case, they're not quite the forces acting on the particle, but they can be. The field lines are the derivatives of the energy with respect to charge (Well, not quite charge, but the electric polarization, which describes the charge). So, it's more like a how the system wants to alter the charge at a given point in space. If that can be done by changing the charge of the particle (by changing the electric polarization), then that will happen, and if that can be done by moving the charge to a different place, then that will also happen. Same for magnetic field lines, which explains why magnetic field lines both move magnetic particles, and also line up the magnetization parallel with the line.</p>

<p>How are they derivatives of energy any more than they are forces, if they're only showing the direction of either with no magnitude? Since energy is a scalar, wouldn't dE/dq give you another scalar (and thus not a field line with direction)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm thinking specifically of magnetic field lines, since that's my field. It might not translate the way I'm thinking to electricity, and it's probably a bit pedantic and pointless. In that case, <code>B_i= dE/dm_i</code>. That, then, translates to a force as <code>F_i = dE/dx_i = dE/dm_j dm_j/dx_i</code> . In electricity, it may well be a spatial gradient of E.</p>
<p>Field lines are usually described as the direction a test particle will travel, but that's because charge is usually a constant. In my field, ferromagnetism, the magnetization of an electron in the x,y,z direction can change as long as |m| is constant, which is done by rotating the electron. Magnetic field lines then describe how mx,my and mz will try to vary at a given point. It can also describe the force an electron at a given point will feel, which will also vary the magnetization if it moves.</p></div>		</li>
