			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was recorded to tape (which most old songs were), then yes. The tape, as long as it hasn't degraded too much, will have the highest quality master of the song, which studios can then digitally restore and enhance making a much clearer version of the song than was available before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, anything that was recorded to tape has been backed up to digital audio to prevent loosing important masters.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People don't realize how good professional analog recordings from after WW2 are; they're used to hearing them on worn vinyl played on a cheap turntable/cartridge. As vayper says, the wide-gage master tapes from that era are amazing. Sound fidelity for popular music (as opposed to classical) peaked in the 50s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, record labels always have the highest quality recording available that is used at the “original master recording,” which they then ‘translate’ into various distributable media such as vinyl, CD, streamable digital audio files, etc., each of various qualities depending on the purpose. If the record label happened to be provided by the recording studio with the multitrack recording, they will then also have those separate audio tracks archived. Most consumers do not have access to the original master recording, and even fewer people have access to the multitrack recordings if there even is one at all. Movie studios often, however, are given access to these in exchange for royalties (a percentage of the movies’ profits). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obligatory plug for /r/songstems where we covet these master recordings. Especially with a lot of the older stuff when you listen to the individual tracks of the recordings you can hear things you never noticed before in a song. Then when you listen to the song again you can make it out buried in the mix. Gives you a new appreciation for the tiny details and artistry involved in making music.</p>
<p>For me, hearing a lot of the individual tracks from songs on Michael Jackson's &quot;Off The Wall&quot; album blew my mind. Like he's actually clinking coke bottles and stuff to create rhythm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why don’t they just remaster all old music so that it has the best quality sound </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Quality” sound is a fairly subjective term in this context. The original mix (which is by definition the highest “quality” - most authentic version) is typically what the artist intended to produce, and remastering it would subjectively compromise the original artists intent. </p>
<p>You may personally prefer the remixed sound of “My Way” in the Kingsman trailer, but others would probably prefer Sinatra’s original version. </p>
<p>Also, as I previously mentioned in another comment, record labels do not always have the multitrack recordings, and so not all songs can just “be remastered.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the kind of mix you want for a film is different from what you want to listen to.<br />
There might be sounds playing over the music, which you want to not drown out.<br />
Or you might want to change the 'accoustics' digitally in order to make it sound like it's in a bigger space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also as a technical side note, once audio is physically recorded by microphone onto an analog medium and/or converted to digital, it cannot be just “enhanced” to somehow extract more detail out of a sound that literally wasn’t recorded. Similar to how you can’t just “enhance” a digital image to see more detail that the pixels convey. The best you can do is guess at what is being represented by the pixelated image, and the same goes for audio. You could attempt to guess as to what the exact waveform of the singers voice was being produced in a given instant if the microphone was unable to accurately record it. but doing so would literally be guessing, not to mention extremely hard/time consuming to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there's not enough of a market for enhanced versions of old music for the companies to put time, effort, and money into doing it.</p>
<p>Sometimes you'll see something that has remained notably popular get a remastering, but it's relatively rare. People still buy back catalog albums by Pink Floyd and The Cure, for instance, in a way that they don't buy old Sinatra records.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's rare now but in the 80's it was a huge craze, tons of TV commercials selling us remastered albums.</p>
<p>I think the music business got addicted to all the money from selling us CDs of albums we already had, and now they needed a way to sell us a 3rd copy of all our albums.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to tag on to this. We also now have really great audio restoration software. We can do amazing things with noise reduction and spectral repair that weren't possible in the past. Izotope RX is an amazing software that does a lot of this stuff.</p>
<p>Source: sound editor that's taking a break to goof off on Reddit instead of using RX to clean up some audio at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I was a young buck, and didn't know any better, I'd overuse the shit out of Ozone to create some shitty, scooped, terrible sounding masters with a lot of exciter &quot;sparkle.&quot;</p>
