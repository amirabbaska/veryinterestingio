			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much every answer was different though, including the one in this thread. All of them giving a varied perspective on the issue. In one someone mentions decreased blood flow causes skin to be more rigid, in another someone mentions loss of feeling contributing to increased pain, in this thread it was explained by differences in neurotransmitters.  </p>
<p>All threads have some truth in them, but they all have different answers, which justifies all of their &quot;repeated&quot; existance. The question might be the same, but the content of the answers isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate &quot;use the search bar first&quot; rules on this website. The entire point of the voting system is to filter good from bad posts, wanted and interesting content from stuff that isn't needed. So when the OP asks a question and gets upvotes, there is clearly enough interest for this post to be validated. If OP hadn't asked this question, I along with some odd hundred people (as of when I type this) would be a little less informed. Telling users to use the search bar defeats the point of this website in a lot of situations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can block specific subs, but about the reposts idk. I've seen many reposts and just hit the back button without giving a shit. Other times I've clicked a comment thread and seen complaints about repost but it's the first time I've seen it. It really doesn't bug me much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there weren't reposts then reddit would just turn into a huge database of information with an awful search function. There is also a social aspect where new questions can arise and be asked because of participants are all attentive to the subject in real time, so conversation can happen and more information may be revealed for people like yourself to search through in the future.</p></div>		</li>
