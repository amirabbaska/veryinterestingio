			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely struggled with engraining the use of right rudder while getting my PPL. </p>
<p>It wasn't until my CFI showed me what happens when you execute maneuvers without sufficient right rudder input that I truly realized its importance. </p>
<p>Nothing like a spin to make you realize just how dangerous it can be to neglect.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most don't, because it's better for cost and maintenance if all of the engines and reduction gears are the same, and the torque can be handled the same way a single-engine aircraft would. The P-38 Lightning fighter is a notable exception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any gyroscopic forces from two separate engines would have separate centers of rotation. It doesn't have the cumulative effect that you're thinking of; it's actually less and decreases with the distance between the rotational centers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Counterrotatng props are common in twin engine airplanes, and offer signficant advantages over same rotating engines. </p>
<p>The asymmetric thrust created from same direction engines while the plane is climbing or flying slowly is significant enough to require a great deal of rudder to overcome. This also means that a larger vertical stabilizer and rudder is needed to maintain control during single engine operations at low airspeeds. The &quot;critical&quot; engine is the engine that, if it were to fail, would create the most impact on control and raise the single engine minimum control airspeed the greatest. </p>
<p>Counterrotating props eliminates this problem, saves structural weight, and improves low speed performance critical for engine failures on takeoffs, for example. </p></div>		</li>
