			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrons follow the Pauli Exclusion Principle just like electrons do, so the more neutrons there are, they will be in a higher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_shell_model" target="_blank">shell</a> in the nucleus. To lose energy they can decay into protons, but since protons also follow this principle, it means that either:</p>
<ul>
<li>In lighter nuclei, where the number of protons and peutrons tends to be similar, they're often at the same shell level already, so it's most energetically favorable either for an extra neutron to simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_emission" target="_blank">be ejected</a> (this happens for example with Helium-5, since the highest proton shell is filled) or the neutron <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay" target="_blank">will decay to a proton</a> if there is a free space in the shell, such as Lithium-8.</li>
<li>In heavier nuclei, where there are way more neutrons than protons and so they're in higher shells compared to the protons, the Coulomb interaction (and the nuclear force) affect their energy, so the mass of the valence neutron can end up being less than the proton, forbidding proton decay and only allowing stuff like alpha or beta decay.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The strong force falls off with distance much more quickly than the electromagnetic force does (the strong force is &quot;short range&quot; while the EM force is &quot;long range&quot;).  This means that as you make a nucleus bigger, protons very far from each other feel plenty of repulsion from the EM force, but almost no attraction due to the strong force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protons and neutrons have their own separate shell structures in a nucleus. If you fill either with too many particles, it will be favorable for the nucleus to beta decay and start filling the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, my answer was a bit brief on that point. The strong force takes place between quarks, and this force is always attractive, but considerably less so at smaller distances.</p>
<p>But in a nucleus this interaction between quarks results in a net force between various nucleons. This force is a combination of strong force interactions between the various pairs of quarks in the nucleons. This combined force is sometimes called the &quot;nuclear force&quot;. Calculating the precise strength and direction of the nuclear force is very complicated, which is why it is often modeled using certain assumptions. One such assumption is that the nuclear force is repulsive at very short distances and it turns out that implementing this assumption in models for the nuclear force, makes the outcome match the measurements much better, regardless of the model used. This suggests that this assumption could be correct, but there is no evidence for it, nor is it required.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Coulomb force plays a major part in keeping distance between protons, but in the absense of the Coulomb force, the nucleons would still most likely not come arbitrarily close to eachother as there are indications that some potential barrier exists. Which is what I was trying to say :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is sort of unrelated but got me thinking. I've never heard of a force that switches direction depending on distance but that's fascinating. Could that provide any kind of model for gravity acting over cosmic distances? I think I've heard somewhere that dark energy may be some unexplained aspect of gravity. Is it possible gravity becomes repulsive at some distance? I'm just talking out of my ass here, just wondering.</p></div>		</li>
