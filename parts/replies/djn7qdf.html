			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol inhaled as vapor will eventually be removed from the bloodstream by the liver. So I'm not sure the health differences are as great as you suggest. But it does remove a step of processing and physical travel before the bloodstream, <em>probably</em> getting more effect from less total alcohol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would this cause it to bypass the liver? </p>
<p>In addition, that would imply that intoxication from alcohol inhalation would be naturally irreversible since it is precisely in the liver where alcohol is broken down.  Unless I'm missing something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you suggesting that because it came in through the alveoli of the lungs that once the alcohol is in your bloodstream it can only be excreted back through the lungs?  Why would this be?  Once it's in the blood the liver has just as much access as had it been delivered through the digestive system.</p></div>		</li>
