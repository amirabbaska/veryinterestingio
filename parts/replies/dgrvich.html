			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen studies that show how much we focus on loss instead of gain.  Like you said we will gravitate towards negative thoughts.  This actually made me struggle with being happy, EVER.  I was getting into a state of anhedonia until a I decided to talk to a therapist and he pointed out I was falling into a trap of catastrophic thinking.  I would focus on all the possible negative outcomes of any activity instead of accepting the possibility of positive outcomes and what I would enjoy about them.  I was engaged in a false view of the world, no more realistic than if I was being a Pollyanna.  </p>
<p>Now when I catch myself doing that e.g. &quot;Oh, I don't want to take a vacation.  I have to plan everything, the cost, the effort to get there.  What if the weather stinks?...&quot; I tell myself to consider the positive aspects &quot;I'll see someplace new.  I'll enjoy it, it'll be exciting and fun.  The trip there could feel easy and interesting.  I already know about how much it'll cost and I can afford it....&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really struggle with the social nature of being human. I'm pretty socially capable and have some good friendships and a girlfriend, but most of the time I crave being by myself. Like I just can't get enough and it's the only time I feel truly myself. But I think that sort of behavior is actually really bad for me but at the same time, it's what I feel like I always need. I've been depressed the past few years but I can't figure out what's wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you; that explains a lot about the mental issues that I and people close to me experience - perhaps enough to help us manage them better.</p></div>		</li>
