<p>I'd also add light consistency. We bought a 50 a basic LG HD LED the equivalent of $500 USD.  My uncle bought an 50 in LG 4k smart LED for about double the price.  Even though there's not much 4k content, his display still looks better.  If you put both on a black screen, you can see certain hot and cold points on my TV where more light bleeds thru.  His is much more consistent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, IPS panels are often a huge improvement over TN panels, and OLED panels are often even better both in brightness and contrast. However, there are exceptions to each with high quality ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably tack on user controls, because those are changing fast in the digital age.  The standard used to be a series of simple buttons located on the set for each individual function.  This meant if you lost your remote, it was pretty self-explanatory to operate the television manually.  However, as TVs become more advanced and have many more functions built in, channel buttons, volume buttons, the power button, and the input button just aren't cutting it.</p>
<p>Samsung and LG are incorporating a single analog stick design which relies on software run by the chipboards that are in all TVs nowadays, but is a bit less intuitive than individual, labeled buttons.  Kind of a confusing catch-all, but it'll probably be the more resourceful solution as people become familiar with it.  Vizeo, however, has ditched the advanced functions even on their remotes and <em>requires</em> users to download their smartphone app to fully utilize their TV.  Of course, they then snoop and sell the user's advertising information to bring down the price of their product even further, but that's just the world we live in nowadays.</p></div>		</li>
