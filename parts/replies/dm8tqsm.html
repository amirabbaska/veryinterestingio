			<div class="markdown"><p>They occupy lots of niches. Some 60% of all described species are beetles.</p>
<p>Edit: 25%. Not sure where I got 60 from. Although part of me still thinks it's right. I'll need to do more research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget bacteria and fungi. Now that we're sequencing so many genomes, we keep finding previously undescribed genuses and moving organisms from one genus to an entirely new genus (looking at you, <em>Propionibacterium acnes</em>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't count singel cell organisms like bacteria into this. Since they they are quite numerous and can alter their genetic material quite a lot the estimated number of species of bacteria are 10^19, while the estimated number of insect species is 10^7 (we currently know about a million)</p></div>		</li>
