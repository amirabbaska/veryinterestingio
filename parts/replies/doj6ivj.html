			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV+ person here! And yeah, life's pretty good, all things considered. Much better than I expected it to be when I got the bomb dropped on me when I got my test done.</p>
<p>Medicines are still dreadfully expensive, but by the grace of whatever benevolent forces exist in the world, the Ryan White Program exists, as well as the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) and the Health Department (at least until the Republicans finally manage to defund it like they have been trying to for a time), and they help people that can't afford the (rather less invasive than I had expected) medical care and treatments needed.</p>
<p>Basically, I see my doctor every 3-6 months, and take one pill per day. That's it. No nasty side effects, no waking up feeling like I'm going to die, no real dangers of spreading it (because my viral levels are undetectable and have been such since around early 2015, and I have steady access to the medications I need, at least for now), and I'm as healthy as you'd expect a regular 31 year old to be! If anything, my immune system is stronger now than it was before I became positive, since in a sense, it's being supercharged by the stuff my doctor has me on. Genvoya, I think it's called.</p>
<p>It's &quot;very unlikely&quot; that I'd pass it on to someone, even in a worst case scenario of blood to blood contact, but &quot;very unlikely&quot; does not mean &quot;impossible. &quot; Every reasonable precaution should still be taken, and that's not really a huge sacrifice to begin with. Reasonably speaking, if I happened to have a sexual partner that was on PreP (typically Truvada) then even unprotected sex wouldn't be a risk unless doses were missed. Kind of like a slightly more extreme version of a birth control pill with higher stakes. :v</p>
<p>(Not like anybody is actually interested in me though, because nobody wants to date diseased trash, haha) /s</p>
<p>Edit: added the /s because I didn't think so many people were going to feel sad for me! ;w ; I'm doing okay! I do have someone I'm in a long distance relationship with. She knows about my disease and isn't scared of it like some of the other people that I've crossed paths with have been. I'm not sad and unloved, I'm just kinda lonely because I've never met her yet and it's been a really long time since I've had any physical intimacy. We are planning to spend Christmas together at least! :3</p>
<p>Edit2: So many responses! I'm gonna try to reply to every one, don't you worry! Feel free to ask anything you like, I'm open to talking about just about anything. :3</p></div>		</li>

<p>But thank you! I'm sure it'll all be fine from here! Unless Healthcare in this country somehow manages to get worse than it currently is, haha. :v</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also 31 and my situation is very similar to yours. I did found a girlfriend though a couple of months ago and she loves me unconditionally. </p>
<p>I'm undetectable and we have a healthy relationship and none of us worries too much about this virus anymore.</p>
<p>Honestly, I feel better nowadays. My life is improving drastically and I feel even better than I did before being diagnosed. </p>
<p>I just need my Cd4 count to increase because right now is very low (79). But I haven't been sick every since I started the treatment (a yer ago). </p>
<p>If anyone wants to talk to me or get some advice on how I learnt to deal with this, feel free to get in contact with me.</p>
<p>I'll soon start to tell all my friends and people who know me that I'm Hiv+. I want to make people aware of this virus. HIV+ people are indeed having happy lives, we are having children, we are enjoying love and sex, we make the best out of our lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's wonderful! I'm so happy for you! :D</p>
<p>In truth, I have to admit that life for me is better now than it was back when I was diagnosed. Not that the disease made it better or anything, but it certainly hasn't done anything to make it worse!</p>
<p>That's definitely a worryingly low CD4 count! I really hope it's on the upswing, but it's good that it isn't a cause of you being sick or anything!</p>
<p>Keep on keeping on, you're clearly doing great so far! I'm very sorry it hit you too, but the odds of there being a cure for it in our lifetime has never been better!</p>
<p>And congratulations on starting a family! I think? Kind of worded oddly so I'm not sure if you meant that you are or HIV+ folks in general are.</p>
<p>Either way, I wish you the best of luck with everything!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CD4 count of 70-ish is scary low. But you are able to achieve almost undetectable VL? Any backstory to this? Love to hear more. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But no, it's not that bad, I just use self depreciating humor as a coping mechanism. I probably should have put a /s at the end of it. ;w ;</p>
<p>And thank you for reading it and saying something nice. People like you (and so far, everyone else that's posted) are why I don't mind sharing my tale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here that used to work in HIV. People with HIV can indeed live normal lives but they do believe the virus causes some kind of chronic inflammation and other health effects on the body that are not well understood yet. For example having HIV alone is a risk factor for hypogonadism (low T) and there are some associations of the virus and earlier cardiovascular disease. </p>
<p>Regarding having an “undetectable viral load”, which is what I believe you are referring to, yes the risk of transmission is so low it’s non-existent. Prep is not 100% protective and needs to be used with other common sense measures such as making sure your partner has an undetectable viral load or condoms are used in addition to the PrEP. </p>
<p>It’s also important to keep in mind that people may carry different strains/mutations of the virus. Some people with HIV naively have unprotected sex with other people that have HIV without realizing they may be exposing themselves to a strain of the virus that is resistant to medication they are currently taking. In addition, this is part of the reason PrEP has a failure rate because it’s not a triple drug regimen that can affect overly prevent viral mutation but rather a dual drug regimen with people in the community resistant to that single drug. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CDC recently endorsed a statement (that had already been approved by other organizations) that if an HIV positive person under treatment with anti retrovirals has an undetectable viral load in their blood, then they are at no risk of transmitting the virus sexually.  In addition, there are prophylactic drugs an HIV negative partner can take to reduce the risk.  And HIV can be suppressed to that level.  It requires a cocktail of very expensive medications that have to be taken religiously every day, but it looks like science can now prevent HIV from progressing into AIDS, allowing HIV + people to live until something else kills them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! And because of the required, regular doctor's visits, HIV+ persons under treatment now tend have a longer life expectancy than the population average.</p>
<p>Nowadays, dying of HIV (in a devloped) country is nothing to fear. (which, in some cases, has it's potential drawbacks, but that's another discussion that could be about PrEP, or some &quot;pro&quot;-HIV subculture groups, etc...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the biggest risk that still revolves around HIV are the people who <em>unknowingly</em> spread it. If you don't know you are infected and have a high viral load, you are at much greater risk of spreading it to someone else. And the longer you go without therapy the more likely you are to progress to AIDS. Getting tested is key for high risk groups, though I'd argue everyone should get tested at least once in their lifetime, esp if they've had multiple partners over the years which most people have. Although the stigma of HIV has gone down a lot, there are still many, many people who don't get tested, sometimes out of embarrassment or just don't know they should bother to check. </p>
<p>Sharing needles remains the greatest risk for transferring HIV. Blood to blood contact is the easiest way to spread it and unfortunately that group is less likely to know their status than people who regularly get STD tests. Needle exchange programs can go a long way in preventing the spread of HIV (and hepatitis). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually some really interesting problems arising in the medical world as people who are HIV+ start to run into age related diseases and the medications interact in odd ways. It's a good problem to have , I suppose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV/AIDS was a disease that caused something else to kill a person, because the virus destroyed the immune system. Now, the meds keep the virus from destroying the immune system.</p></div>		</li>
