			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're right, in general the effect of sexual selection is important to factor in when discussing why phenotypes arise. Natural selection is not only to do with survival - it also requires survival <em>long enough to reproduce and pass on your genes</em>. Just think about animals that use sexual displays like peacocks. They have a huge 'eat me' attached to their tails, but they still survived long enough to pass on their ridiculous yet sexy phenotype.  </p></div>		</li>
