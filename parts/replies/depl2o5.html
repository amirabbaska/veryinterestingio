<p>They use the same general architecture as typical PCs</p>

<p>While many of the current &quot;supercomputers&quot; are Intel x64 architecture, many aren't.  For example, the current top computer uses Sunway SW26010 CPUs, which is completely different.  There are also PowerPC CPUs and SPARC CPUs, just in the top 10.</p>

<p>ECC actually <em>corrects</em> errors.  Parity memory only notices.</p>

<p>No, a datacenter is a facility that houses computers, usually lots of them, and provides the electrical and network infrastructure for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you dabble in 3d modelling, it would be good at rendering your scenes. It would also be a good match if you use several virtual PCs, and want to give each of them a handsome amount of cores.</p>
<p>For gaming, you'd be better off with a higher clocked, lower core CPU.
Unless of course, you want to put multiple video cards into it and literally play three instances of Crysis 3 at the same time (people have done this, there are videos).</p></div>		</li>

<p>For reference, the practical reason you would want to do this is to play couch multiplayer in games that don't support it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because you have more cores does not mean that you will always see an increase in performance.  Now a programmer could choose to multi thread a program to get more computing power but sometimes there is no increase in performance.  An example why is because if your program is divided between multiple threads and they are accessing the same variables we need to lock (called mutex) those variables to one thread so that no overwriting or false data is given to the other threads until the first thread is done.  Think of it as an unsaved word document, I access it from one location and start modifying it and if someone accesses it from another location before I save it then the file might be overwritten.  When a thread access a variable or function with mutex all other threads have to wait for that first thread to finish if they are at the line of code right before that variable or function.  This kind of defeats the purpose of multi threading if you are using a lot of locks so while it is useful the programmer has to have a good reason and good design to use multiple cores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. As others have pointed out also, this line of programmatic thinking can be more complex and often more difficult to implement correctly for certain tasks. So a lot of times it's about incentive as much as it is about complexity. Especially for game logic, (not speaking about your average GPU which indeed has multiple cores to render graphics, game physics, etc.) which still spends a lot of your CPU's clock time idling even if you say have a high APM (actions per minute) rate by human standards. This is why I doubt most games will ever be written to truly make use of multi-threading in a meaningful way unless optimization comes a long way.</p>
<p>Interesting side note, if you don't want to purchase a supercomputer a lot can be done cheaper by clustering GPUs to perform similar tasks not bound to graphics related only.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many tasks can't be made parallel, and of the tasks that can be made parallel not all are since it's a much more difficult way of programming. Furthermore, many tasks don't spend their time waiting on the CPU, so making the CPU faster isn't going to help you.</p>
<p>However, if you do happen to do work that is CPU bound and is written to use lots of cores then an 18 core CPU will do better than a 2-4 core consumer chip. </p>
<p>Be warned, though: if the task is CPU bound and is not written to use lots of cores then then 18 core CPU will likely be <em>slower</em> than a decent consumer chip. That 18 core chip only makes sense in a context where you care about total throughput across all cores. Having a crapload of slightly slower cores is thus better than having a few really fast cores. Consumer chips frequently have a significantly higher clock speed (with the same architecture) than a massive chip like that and will out perform it on single threaded applications. </p></div>		</li>
