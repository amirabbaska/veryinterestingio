			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird, and possibly stupid question here, so... fair warning. 580 miles seems pretty big, but... is it <em>really</em> that big considering the fact that we're talking about Jupiter?</p>
<p>Edit for clarity: I know the GRS is being reduced by that amount, as opposed to being that big, but... that's still a rather large reduction, isn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia, it's dimensions are: 24,000-40,000 km east-to-west and 12,000-14,000 km north-to south. Jupiter's mean radius is 69,911 km.</p>
<p>So using the largest east-to-west length, it's about 28% of Jupiter's diameter.</p>
<p>For comparison, 28.6078% of Earth's diameter is 2263.8 miles or 3643.2 km.</p>
<p>Edit: surface area.</p>
<p>Using the smallest estimates, you get 288,000,000*pi km^2. Using the largest you get 560,000,000*pi km^2</p>
<p>That's 1.4731011% and 2.8643632% of Jupiter's surface area, respectively.</p>
<p>On Earth, that's 7.5142887111 × 10^6 km^2 and 1.46111166832 × 10^7 km^2 </p>
<p>For comparison, the US has a surface area of 9.631×10^6 km^2</p></div>		</li>

I have always been attracted (pun not intended) to the GRS and even made an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMKQMdlDKI4" target="_blank">animation</a> a few months back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome Sci if plot idea.  When the red spot on Jupiter becomes a circle a local wormhole opens up and killer cats from another galaxy comes raoring out. Their mission? To fit into every single box on earth. Including your wife's.</p>
<p>*edit
Naturally my most upvoted comment is about cats from space and riddled with typos (which i will leave in as an homage to whoever gilded me) </p></div>		</li>
