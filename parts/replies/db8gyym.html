			<div class="markdown"><p>I load trucks at UPS every morning. Especially this time of year the drivers are heavily overloaded with packages. I've never seen a driver not attempt to deliver a package (I help deliver sometimes). But they do run up to the door, knock and ring and drop the package. If you live in an apartment building they will leave the package at your door the same way. (Assuming it's a secured building and someone buzzes them in.)</p>
<p>But if you live in an apartment community with duplex type homes or whatever then they will attempt and if there is no answer in a few seconds they'll write the attempt notification and if there's a residential office they'll leave it there. In your particular situation, it sounds like the driver is either lazy or untrained properly. </p>
<p>Call the UPS distribution center and tell them your location and situation. They should be able to find the route and the driver and fix this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at UPS for approx 7 months, including during peak season. I ran unload and small sort mainly. People hurt themselves, they expect some crazy numbers. It's all do able, but peak season you'll be literally up to your chest and neck in boxes trying to sort them.</p>
<p>Small sort got all the smaller type boxes and they all came from the warehouse I worked at on 2 belts. Half of the building each. You'd have 3 people (unless getting overwhelmed) on each side. Looking at a similar station of probably 5 by 7 open slots. Of up to X size, I don't recall that specific. It was a reach from side to side, let alone when stuff is being super dumped and your up to your chest in boxes. They'd have to shut down the warehouse from small sort more than anything. Just to bring giant bins on wheels and push boxes into as to unclog the belts.</p>
<p>As for the drivers end of it, they're paid and VERY regulated about their package amount and delivery time. On every single position (driver included) you're timed an average, on each and every box that passes through your hands. Hence the reason drivers are required to scan, verify, and sometimes get a signature for every single package.</p>
<p>Ontop of business deliveries which was always a good load, residential deliveries were the majority of what we had to deliver. We were given the route, and I assisted in dropping and helping haul with the driver.</p>
<p>Apartment complexes get super confusing. So many different types it's crazy, we went to many a day, sometimes similar ones each day, but it all really blends together after not too long. It always helps to note anything that may help the delivery when ordering, I know it's not always possible, but always appreciated trust me. </p>
<p>Also consider it may not be your normal driver. They do in fact run extra drivers and help of all sort in the peak season. Including seasonal workers in warehouse, and people just to assist drivers. There are plenty of difficulties, but overall they do the best they can in my eyes, with the sheer amount of work load assigned as one business. It's insanity. Haha. Hope you have better experience in the future, but know you can always call and they'll check the driver assigned to the route you're on. They keep everything very in check, but lots to manage and try to keep checks on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gotten to the point that if I know something's going to be shipped UPS, I have it sent to my parent's house. I live in a secure building with a call box next to the front door. For whatever reason, i'm at the tail end of their route (live not too far from the distro in town, so it's a quick stop and then they get to call it a night), so late night deliveries are common - which means there's no one in the front office to let in the driver. I've seen UPS InfoNotices stuck right next to the call box. Makes sense if no one answers, except they disappear quickly from wind/assholes. I had ordered something next day and was home all day on day of delivery. Phone didn't ring, so callbox wasn't used. Was understandably pissed when I saw &quot;first delivery attempted&quot; when tracking it. Went downstairs and saw the infonotice stuck to the window <em>right next to the callbox</em>.</p>
<p>Luckily was able to get them to hold the package for me at the distro instead of popping it on the truck to go to the secondary pickup location - which is basically across town from the distro - where I wouldn't be able to pick it up until the afternoon (due to that location's business hours) instead of first thing in the morning. Thankfully Amazon and the UPS people at the distro I talked to were very helpful and understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe this ... I work night shift so I am ALWAYS home during the day, especially when I know I have a package coming. I can't even tell you the amount of times the are 0 rings of the doorbell or knocks on the door but that night when I check the status of my package I see &quot;delivery attempt failed.&quot; It's super frustrating because I'll call, get told there's nothing they can do except try again the next day, and then when I say well I paid extra for delivery on a specific day they say they don't care. It's very poorly run business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who helps seasonally (both pre-load and delivery helper), this is exactly right. ESPECIALLY during peak/holiday season.</p>
<p>To put it into perspective it takes between 6 &amp; 8 hours to load each truck. Not because we are slow, but because that's how long it takes to make everything fit and put it in order. When the truck is loaded, there isn't even enough room to stand in the back
Not only that, but often not all packages fit in the truck. The driver will either need to go back to the sort facility or meet a &quot;runner&quot; to get what they left behind.</p>
<p>Yesterday my driver had 225 stops (about 450 packages), ~45 of which were for next-day-air. Our runner didn't even get to our town until 3:45, so forget delivering air by 4:30.
And for apartments, we honestly try our best. We have 18 seconds from when we park to when we need to be out of the truck package in hand. We need to have the package out of our hands and be back in the truck in less than a minute, so if you take more than 15sec to answer the door then we are just going to be late for the next stop.</p>
<p>And that is just what the customer sees. There is another entire world of issues at the sort facility and the distribution centers.</p>
<p>What it comes down to is money. It is cheaper for UPS to have stupidly large routes doing 12+ hours a day with a helper, than it is to hire more drivers.</p>
<p>All I can say is if your driver does a good job during non-peak season, please consider tipping him/her during peak. We will gladly accept booze and cookies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The previous comments about the DIAD pinging GPS are correct.  They would have to drive to your building, turn off their package car, scan your stuff then mark it no signature then keep it moving.  From the way you're describing your building, the driver would have had to mark first attempt for the whole building.</p>
<p>I'd bet that it was misloaded onto a nearby split route with a seasonal driver manning the route, delivery was attempted poorly and the guy was probably close enough to scan but didn't feel comfortable not knowing where or who to leave it with within a big complex (new drivers are perplexed by loading docks and receiving departments) ...  Bc he's gunning for that full time slot he played it safe and sheeted the package for reattempt.</p>
<p>EDIT: Was a Package Car Driver </p>
<p>EDIT: Receiving docks often have hard to find entrances and newer drivers are all trying to go fast to get that job so they say fuck it </p></div>		</li>
