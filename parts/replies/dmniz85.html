			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably different. The radiation from your microwave oven is contained in the appliance, and is at a totally different frequency (MHz, instead of GHz). I highly doubt radiation from the microwave would interfere with your WiFi. It's more likely a power situation. My microwave is on the same breaker as my bathroom, so when I'm heating something up, the light in the bathroom dims. Might be something similar.</p>
