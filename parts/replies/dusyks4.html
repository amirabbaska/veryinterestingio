			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there goes my argument! Seriously though, that's why I couched that point by saying &quot;in my experience.&quot; Many Ace stores, I believe, are independently owned and operated. To assume a singular shopping experience nationwide would be foolish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally dependent on the store. One hot topic in the area where I get an occasional t-shirt or collectible checks the back of the card, ask to see drivers license and compares signatures. A different hot topic next to where I work just runs it without checking anything. Guess it just depends how worried they are about fraud and/or people getting angry about waiting an extra 15 seconds. Honestly, I appreciate when a cashier checks and at least makes an effort to make sure everything looks appropriate.</p></div>		</li>
