<p>How big does that cloud need to be to collapse to form a black hole?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the question asked.  I am not aware of any confirmed gas clouds that grew big enough to turn into a black hole.  Clearly, anything can fall into an existing black hole.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. It would collapse into a black hole at 4.27*10^11 meters, or 2.858 au.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now that I think about it, structural support would be key.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once the Schwartzchild radius exceeds the actual radius it is a black hole. Space has warped to the point that the center lies not to the side of the edge, but to the future. You can't use structural support to keep it from collapsing anymore than you can use structural support to keep from going to the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there nothing that is light and strong enough to be infinitely large?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be infinitely large. The universe is believed to be infinitely large and have a roughly constant density. And if it is finite, it just curves around on itself instead of having a boundary. That keeps it from collapsing. But if you have something with a boundary, then if it's too big it will collapse into a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how can that be true? If there's some material that is very very light and very very strong, could it not hold itself up in some sort of lattice structure? If it's light and dense?</p>
<p>Wait, thinking about it more. If you keep adding material, then the gravitational forces on the center piece just keep increasing and increasing? So even though the strength of the force decays proportionally with the square of the distance, it still grows, even an imperceptible amount. So at some point where the mass is big enough then it would collapse. Huh. I think I get it. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cotton candy is actually seems pretty dense when you consider that stars are formed from hydrogen gas clouds. </p>
<p>In order for anything to become a black hole it mush have gravity that is strong enough to not let light escape. For to find this you just substitute the speed of light as the escape velocity in the escape velocity equation which is- v=sqrt (2GM/R). </p>
<p>So if you substitute the speed of light 'c' in place of 'v' you can find how heavy or big an object needs to be to become a black hole.</p>
<p>Btw the G is universal gravitational constant, the M is the mass of the object and the R is the radius of the object.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if the universe isn't infinite, then what's beyond it? And if it's expanding, then what is it expanding out into? Just &quot;nothingness&quot;? Isn't 'nothingness' <em>something</em> though (I mean, it's still existing empty space, right)? No matter how you look at it, whether you think the universe is finite or infinite, both seem equally impossible to be either true or untrue, if that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Nothing. Not empty space, nothing. It's hard (perhaps even impossible) for us to understand, but just nothing. It isn't black, it's nothing. It isn't cold, it is <em>nothing</em>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if it's expanding, then what is it expanding out into? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a common misconception that comes up a lot and stems from taking our general understanding of &quot;expansion&quot; and applying it to the entire universe. The universe is expanding because everything in it is getting farther and farther apart. The common example is to think of the surface of a balloon. As you blow up the balloon, all the points on the surface get farther away from each other, but the <em>surface</em> (not the balloon itself) isn't expanding into anything. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isn't 'nothingness' <em>something</em> though (I mean, it's still existing empty space, right)? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, like I said above, it isn't. Nothingness is not empty space. Nothingness is not something that exists (else it would be something rather than nothing).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to describe it is to say that the universe folds in on itself -- if you go far enough in one direction you will end up back where you started but coming from the other direction. By analogy, if you go far enough East you will come back to where you started from the West. And if somebody said &quot;the surface area of the earth is finite, so what happens if you go far enough east?  What is beyond the end of the east,&quot; the answer isn't so much that nothing is there so much as there is no such think as going beyond the east.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my question... I really can't wrap my head around the whole nothing concept. There is &quot;nothing&quot; in my coffee mug, but isn't it just empty space? In fact isn't outer space called &quot;space&quot; because it is the space in between stuff&quot;? It's not like our universe is encased in some &quot;thing&quot; (I don't think at least but I have taken exactly one astronomy class) so how do you determine where it begins and ends? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean the mass within the universe. I mean the very structure of spacetime. It curves around on itself. The surface of the earth is finite but there's no beyond it. the play area in a game of Asteroids is finite but there's no beyond it.</p>
<p>It's not expanding by moving further apart. It's spacetime that's changing. Distances are growing larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean. The universe is not arbitrarily sparse. The reason it doesn't collapse into a black hole is that there's no boundary. Something infinitely big doesn't collapse.</p></div>		</li>
