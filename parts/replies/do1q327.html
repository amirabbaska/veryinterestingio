			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a series called Rick and Morty that's pretty popular now. And one of the characters (Rick) refers to the Szechuan sauce as the best thing McDonalds had some years ago, and that they created the sauce just for promoting a Movies (I think it was Mulan).</p>
<p>I think that episode aired last years. But since then people want to try the sauce to see if it is that good.</p>
<p>EDIT: u/MrQuickLine said that the episode was aired on the first episode of this season (April 1). I watched it but I don't recall</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify some of the other responses, it was a sauce long before mcdonalds, based on the ethnic type of dish. You can buy it bottled in most food stores, including walmart. </p>
