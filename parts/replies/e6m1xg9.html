			<div class="markdown"><p>As a pchemist we just tend to call thick non-miscible liquids oils.  We also pretty much call anything that doesn't contain a heavy metal organic as well or ionicly bonded an organic as well (i.e. we would call NCl3 an organic).</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, when I google &quot;inorganic oils,&quot; all I get is a ton of completely unrelated results about &quot;abiogenic petroleum origin.&quot;</p>
<p>Do you have any reading suggestions?</p></div>		</li>
