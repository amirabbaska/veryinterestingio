			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been interested in a small home solution, but unfortunately I don't have airconditioning. Problem is I don't really want to aircon the entire house, I'd really just like to protect the one bedroom I'm using - as far as I can tell nothing really exists for this, which kinda sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in the food processing industry and we have a positive pressure ventilation heat recovery system
In our plant. We have various aspiration filters for machines that run through a â€œHaakon unit (heat recovery air exchange unit). In addition to keeping dust out of the plant it also helps reducing pest activity which is a big deal in a food grade plant. </p></div>		</li>
