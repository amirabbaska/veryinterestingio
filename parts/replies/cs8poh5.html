			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic book. Also should be noted that the title refers to a paradigm where you look at it as &quot;survival of the gene&quot; rather than &quot;survival of the individual&quot; and especially not &quot;survival of the species&quot;. I'm pretty sure most people would see the title and think it's about a gene that makes people inherently selfish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that while there are exceptions there is almost always some intricate reason for it. Social insects is the classical example, where the vast majority is sterile-female workers and only a small proportion consisting of queens and males reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, except it doesn't work for all eusocial insects. The termites don't have the same inheritance system that explains it bees and ants. We're still not sure why the termite workers don't 'cheat' and start reproducing to increase their own fitness. </p></div>		</li>

Imagine you're a naked mole rat. If you help your parents have lots of kids then those kids will have a lot of the genes that you have. That means that by supporting the colony but not breeding you're still helping to spread your genes. Then if the queen needs to be replaced, the new queen will be your sibling (or you) and have a lot of the same genes that you do.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's much more important than &quot;break[ing] things a little&quot;; these are the exception that <em>prove</em> the rule.</p>
<p>If you go look at Fisher's conjecture, you'll see that these exceptions break the guidelines he laid out. It's not just naked mole rats, but many other species as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, sex ratio at birth in naked mole rats is 1:1 (TIL).  But then, mole rats have both male and female workers, so maybe that's got something to do with it.</p>
