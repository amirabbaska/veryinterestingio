			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a whole little thread below (now removed for some reason) where people were asking about whether you can or can't say the above if you are a former government employee (as you claim). As someone who studies classification issues pretty intensely (it's my job), I'll just note for others that there <em>are</em> things that are, without a doubt, unclassified about US weapons design. </p>
<p><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html" target="_blank">This list created by the Department of Energy from 2001 spells out exactly what you can and can't say about weapons design if you've had a clearance</a> (with dates as to when they were declassified). Nothing in the above goes beyond the list that I can see (maybe the reference to tertiaries might make a classification officer briefly cringe but this is not anything unknown). </p>
<p>For example, here's what one is allowed to confirm about thermonuclear weapons as of 1972 and then 1979:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that in thermonuclear (TN) weapons, a fission &quot;primary&quot; is used to trigger a TN reaction in thermonuclear fuel referred to as a &quot;secondary&quot;. (72-11)</p>
<p>The fact that, in thermonuclear weapons, radiation from a fission explosive can be contained and used to transfer energy to compress and ignite a physically separate component containing thermonuclear fuel. (79-2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For speculative things not on the list, the official policy is &quot;refuse to confirm or deny&quot; (or just &quot;no comment&quot;). For things on the list, the government and its employees can speak freely as long as they don't stray beyond it. (And you can get this kind of info from going to government museums, reading their publications, etc. etc.) Don't let fear of secrecy over-mystify this topic! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Alex - Yes, I was deep into that world. Held a DOE-Q with all sigmas, SIOP-ESI (then NC2-ESI), TS/SCI, and a bunch of operational and intelligence SAPs. I spent close to 10 years working in the air room at USSTRATCOM as a technical advisor to SIOP (then OPLAN 8XXX) planners. I also had a billet at DIA JWS-4 analyzing the vulnerability of adversary facilities to kinetic and non-kinetic effects. I was also involved in developing the analytical framework for understanding the lethality of prompt global strike weapons such as the Conventional Trident Modification (CTM). Thanks for pulling up the DOE declassification list. That's a great resource. Perhaps the most controversial item on that list was declassifying the potential use of Np as a SNM. Since I hope you'll see this, can you a) please debug NUKEMAP such that the KML output matches the correct radii/etc. (should be easy), and b) fix the double counting of fatalities when using multiple detonations with LandScan. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>:-) </p>
<p>Item #2 on there is harder than it looks (it's a <em>nasty</em> SQL query) but I've almost got it working. </p>
<p>Nearly every item on the RDD lists has an interesting history as to why it is on there. I've gotten records from the DOE by FOIA into the classification discussions for some of them (notably the 1972 decision to declassify certain aspects of laser fusion, which is an interesting story). It's a very interesting list. The 1979 one on the H-bomb is of course a consequence of the Progressive case, and the 1950-1951 ones about implosion were done for use in the Rosenberg trial, just as two examples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really enjoyed the classification guide that applied to my work. Unfortunately the guide itself was classified, which makes it really hard to remember what things were entirely unclassified. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worst part of my current Army job is trying to remember what information is classified, what's confidential, and what's open knowledge.</p>
<p>Not to mention security managers that don't know the difference, and complain when you give out information that their own department publishes on the open web.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, yeah I knew some things you can say and some, even if they’re on the open source anyway, you can’t confirm. I usually just keep quiet because it’s safer than going to jail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for pointing out that nuclear weapons aren't chemical.  That was the part that had me scratching my head.  I couldn't for the life of me figure out what chemistry had to do with nuclear weapons yields.</p>
<p>With the engineering of the weapons, sure, but not the actual yield.</p></div>		</li>
