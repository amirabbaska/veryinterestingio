<p>If people suddenly stop spending as much, and save more, this will reduce GDP, because whatever they would have spent it on won't get made or sold. If spending falls enough, we might have a recession. But it shouldn't affect potential output. Eventually the economy should adjust (e.g. from a fall in prices) and we'll get back to potential, even at the higher level of savings.</p>

<p>This was the entire point of JM Keynes' prescriptions. Because prices are 'sticky downward' (i.e. it's harder to cut wages and prices than it is to raise them), The economy doesn't necessarily 'adjust', and we are stuck with an output gap as the economy reaches equilibrium at a lower level than full output. Keynes' plan was to have government spend money during downturns to boost the economy, and reduce money (by raising taxes/cutting spending) during boom periods. Unfortunately, politicians of all stripes discovered that spending at all times enhanced their re-election efforts, and we arrived at today's mess. </p></div>		</li>
