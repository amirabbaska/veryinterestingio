			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation, but just to add to it/correct a few things...</p>
<p>Iron has the highest binding energy of all elements, so fusing iron (or any elements heavier than iron, as binding energy slowly decreases from there) is unable to give you a net increase in energy. In other words, you put more energy into fusing heavier elements than you get out. This is how supernovae occur -- the star can no longer produce the energy needed to prevent its collapse.</p>
<p>So if the star is mostly iron, collapsing and fusing everything isn't going to make any energy. There are other ways for supernovae to occur, but in the case of core collapse, it's actually the gravitational potential energy that blows the star apart. The outer matter of the core has to fall so far inwards that it has huge amounts of kinetic energy, enough to fuse elements past iron and <em>still</em> blow the core apart.</p>
<p>To add to what you said about neutron stars, these actually do not do any active fusion. The heat they have is basically just what's leftover from fusion/supernova. The gravity and temperature is so high that electron capture can occur, creating neutrons, but the Pauli exclusion principle means the neutrons cannot occupy the same state. The neutrons become what's known as degenerate matter, and this creates a pressure that prevents further collapse of the star, known as neutron degeneracy pressure. But as said earlier, there's no active fusion at this point -- the star is no longer producing its own heat, and will slowly cool. It's just sort of there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually knew that binding energy per nucleon increase with as atom gets more nucleons and reaches peak at iron, followed by decrease. I guess I forgot about it while I wrote it. It's been a while and I don't remember exact process of supernova explosion, but I'll take your word for it.</p>
<p>Of course, you are correct when you say neutron star do not have fusion. I was taking about formation of it when I said fusion of elements and electron capture occurs which turns everything into just neutrons which as you said resist gravity by degeneracy pressure. I didn't want to go more into it because question was of oscillation in proto stars and it was also unlikely that I would be able to explain it for neutron star accurately enough and in simple terms when neutron degeneracy is one of the forces.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and adding to my answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok i was with you until the end part there. So do the escaping little energy dudes like neutrinos from the electron capture essentially mimic to a smaller degree the H fusion reactions that prevented the star from collapsing?
They bounce around making it hot and pressurized? </p>
<p>And in the case of stars large enough to become black holes, do they necessarily go through all these processes on the way (double explosion and neutron collapse)? i imagine they would fly right by the neutron star stage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos very very rarely interact with matter, so no, they wouldn't really contribute to the outward pressure. The neutrons themselves effectively resist being crushed together -- quantum physics doesn't allow them to occupy the same state. This produces degeneracy pressure.</p>
<p>There's a theoretical star called a quark star, which is between neutron star and black hole. The idea is that if the neutron degeneracy pressure isn't enough to prevent collapse, you get enough energy to break up the neutrons into quarks, and the star would be held up by quark degeneracy pressure. </p>
<p>And yes, for stellar deaths you do get the explosions. The explosion is caused by the collapse, and blasts material out into space that can become a nebula, and neutron stars/Black holes form from what's left of the collapsed core (what hasn't been ejected into space -- heavy elements on Earth such as Uranium come from some of the core being ejected). In the case of a black hole, as the core collapses the matter essentially just breaks down, so it'll go through all the electron capture and whatnot but just keeps going, theoretically forming a singularity in the end (though there are other theories about what happens inside black holes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos royally suck at providing anything like the hydrostatic pressure required to keep a star stable, since they're completely ignoring the strong and electromagnetic forces and only interacting via the weak. You could turn something as large as the sun into a giant ball of lead and most of them wouldn't even notice as they passed through. Well, until it collapsed anyway lol.</p>
<p>There's only one time neutrinos exert a large amount of pressure, and that's in a core collapse supernova, where it's not just an issue of all the infalling matter spontaneously fusing upon striking the core that blows the star back out - the massive release of neutrinos from protons and electrons fusing into neutrons and neutrinos can have a neutrino luminosity of 100 times that of the light luminosity of the supernova. This of thought you be one of the major drivers of the actual explosion, and about the only time sufficient neutrinos are created at once to exert any pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve read that free neutrons do decay and have a half-life. Do the neutrons composing this degenerate matter also decay, or are they protected in the same way neutrons in a nucleus that contains protons also are? If they do, then they would add a source of energy to neutron stars that isn’t fusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(Please bear in mind that I'm currently only an undergraduate physics student, so take my answer with a pinch of salt)</p>
<p>I mentioned neutron degeneracy pressure in my answer; electrons are also degenerate. Neutron stars are <em>mostly</em> neutrons, but there are still a few electrons in the mix. In order for the neutrons to decay back into protons and electrons, the electrons have to have a free state to go into (due to the Pauli exclusion principle. This is the same as the filling of electron shells in atoms. Since electrons have a property known as spin, only two electrons can occupy the same energy level, so long as they have different spin).</p>
<p>The electrons basically float around and fill up the available states, increasing the Fermi energy. Eventually it gets to a point where the maximum energy an electron can receive in beta decay is less than the Fermi energy, so there are no free states for the electrons to go into, so the beta decay more or less stops. The system reaches an equilibrium state, which makes it difficult for momentum and energy to be conserved, heavily suppressing the decay.</p>
<p>When the process does occur though, it allows neutrinos to be emitted, which carry off some of the kinetic (and therefore thermal) energy of the star. This is an Urca process, and is one of the primary cooling mechanisms for the star.</p>

<p>Sorry I took so long to write this answer. As I say, I'm an undergrad, so I had to do a bit of research to write this answer. Hopefully it's accurate, but if someone more knowledgeable than me knows otherwise I'd love to be corrected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering how banana is technically radioactive, I just meant to say that random fusion of insignificant amount of atoms can and does happen. I also wanted to emphasis that fusion in stars is not an on and off process like top comment at that time said. Because of how vast the number of atoms are, nuclear processes will happen all the time due to random collisions of high velocity atoms or particles. Neutron bombardment is not necessarilly the cause all the time, but it is one of the more common ways it can happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutron stars are very heavy and everything is pulled with extreme gravity, It is counter balanced by neutron degeneracy pressure, which is quite complex. But basically it is application of Pauli's principle in Quantum mechanics which says that only one particle can occupy a state and this keeps neutrons from collapsing further.  </p>
<p>Neutron star's gravity is so extreme that electrons collapse into nucleus and fuse with proton to make neutrons and thus gets the name. If gravity gets any stronger than neutron star it turns into black hole, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>how much gravity do you need to replace the strong force?</p>
<p>Considering gravity falls off at a cube of distance, I can only imagine when you pack that much mass into a single atom, that the gravity on the 'surface' of said atom would be... insane. </p></div>		</li>
