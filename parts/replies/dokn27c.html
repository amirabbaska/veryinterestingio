			<div class="markdown"><p>The act of compressing the chest does cause a  small amount of air transfer to/from the lungs. Whether CPR with or without rescue breaths is better can be debated, but CPR without rescue breaths is better than no CPR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh sorta but even if no air gets moved by rescue breaths (total choking, etc) there's still a good amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin that can be offloaded until the total choking is resolved. The amount of air moved by compressions is somewhat neglible, maybe 30ml ballparking? Not enough to overcome dead space itself, so it's not like you're breathing while doing compressions. </p>
<p>The whole reason they pulled rescue breaths away is because pulseless=ultimate badness. To hell with their breathing, fix the pulse. People would fiddle around with trying to breathe for them, and not actually compress. We see this in healthcare workers today, stopping compressions to intubate or still trying to pause compressions to ventilate with a supraglottic in place. Quite frankly, if there's no pulse, fuck every other thing, give them a pulse. Oxygenation of lung tissue is subsidiary to continuing cerebral perfusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually yes, which is why CPR guidelines for healthcare professionals with appropriate equipment do include ventilation. </p>
<p>However compressions themselves are theorised to cause some flow in and out of the lungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>would it be beneficial to do CPR with two people (if possible) while one does the actual CPR and without interrupting the other person does the breathing every so many seconds? i guess the timing had to be near perfect, so the body isnt compressed and can actually get air into the lungs...
or like do a very quick pause for a single breath by the second person?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Continuous CPR is done during ventilation if there's a device in place to ensure the air goes in the lungs (endotracheal tube, supraglottic such as a King, iGel, Combitube, etc) because it's pretty easy to blow the stomach up instead, especially when you're compressing. As a reference, it take somewhere around 27cmH2O pressure to open the gastric sphincter and pump air in the gut. Normal rescue breaths won't break this unless you blow like a cheap hooker, but normal breaths plus super forceful chest compression will. In theory, your idea works. The downside is the damn stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they were trained then yes. This is what happens in hospitals, two people perform CPR, however if someone untrained does the ventilation  breaths, it may not do any damage, but if they don't know what they're doing and fumble/take too much time with the ventilation breaths, then it's argued that just chest compressions are (possibly) more beneficial in this case.</p>
<p>If two people are performing CPR it's 30 chest compressions and then two breaths and repeat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually very beneficial to do CPR with at least 2 people for that exact reason. </p>
<p>One does compressions while the other ventilates. This reduces the time not compressing because person 1 does not need to move as long to do the ventilation. However you do stop while the ventilation takes place, as you want the oxygen into the lungs.</p>
<p>Current CPR rythm is 30:2 at 100 bpm. 30 compressions, 2 ventilations, repeat.</p></div>		</li>
