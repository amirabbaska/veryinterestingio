			<div class="markdown"><p>So a pupa is another stage of growth, where different biological organs continue functioning (hormones, respiration) right? A cocoon is entirely separate from the pupa? Or does it assist in maintaining biological functions through metamorphosis? Like i mean, where does the pupa end and coccoon begin ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cocoon is usually made by the larva itself before pupating. First, the larva spins the cocoon around itself and then inside the cocoon it pupates. They are two separate entities. The cocoon is not alive, and the main function is protection of the pupa against predators or abiotic stresses like dessication. Removing a cocoon carefully generally should not hurt the pupa directly. However, it's as if you would remove all your clothes and go outside while it's raining, you lose some protection against the environment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pupa actually is the insect itself, at a certain life stage.</p>
<p>It may have a hard shell, but pupa also refers to everything inside that shell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another question: how do so many survive through the pupa stage without getting eaten? They seem like they'd be super vulnerable throughout that process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, a lot of them don't. Mortality in the pupal stage is fairly high in a lot of species.</p>
<p>Many insects will burrow underground before pupating, or pupate in some other inaccessible place. Some will make a cocoon, and be protected that way (caterpillars with stinging hairs may shed and incorporate these hairs into the cocoon, so that the entire cocoon is awful to touch).</p>
<p>Of those that don't make cocoons, many pupae are either camouflaged ([the species I work with](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckled_wood_(butterfly" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckled_wood_(butterfly</a>) changes its pupal color to match the background it pupates on), or poisonous (and brightly colored to signal that they're not nice to eat).</p></div>		</li>
