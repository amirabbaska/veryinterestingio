			<div class="markdown"><p>Building onto what this guy said, the most basic way to determine genetic traits as taught in middle/high school is Punnett squares. Depending on whether the parents’ chromosomes are what combinations of dominant/recessive, the probability of the offspring’s trait can be determined. </p>
<p>However in reality it’s far more than just combinations of DD, Dd, or dd in real life. Many traits like hair color requires far more than a single set to determine. You might end up with something like DDdDddDD for the mom and dDdDDddD for the dad, which a simple Punnett square just cannot illustrate. </p>
<p>I do suggest you google Punnett squares though. I’m sure it’ll be able to give you a basic understanding. </p></div>		</li>
