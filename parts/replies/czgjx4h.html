			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not actually &quot;cost of living vs. income&quot;, though that is how most people observe what is happening. Really &quot;cost of living vs. income&quot; merely serves to point out the fact that income growth has been lacking, while cost-of-living growth has stayed mostly steady.</p>
<p>The <strong>SOURCE</strong> of the reduced income growth is simply: Since approximately 1972-73, companies have (basically) stopped proportionately passing on productivity gains to employees (whose work caused the productivity gain). </p>
<p>Perfect graph illustrating this fact in this very relevant article:

<p>A relevant quote that seems to have been forgotten by Nouveau-CEO's and The-Powers-That-Be:  </p>
<p>&quot;No one loses anything by raising wages as soon as he is able. It has always paid us. Low wages are the most costly any employer can pay. It is like using low-grade material--the waste makes it very expensive in the end. There is no economy in cheap labor or cheap material.&quot; -Henry Ford, 1934</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a really hard time swallowing that $27,000 is really the average wage in the US.  Although, apparently, according to some searches, that is correct.  Does this count people that don't work or work part time to supplement the family's income?  You couldn't make it on $27k where I'm at.  While I am in a major metro area, it is in the midwest, and lands very close to the average US cost of living.  $27k, if a full time job, is just shy of $13/hr.  Many unskilled labor jobs go for more than that around here.  What in the actual fuck?  Is the rest of the midwest and south working minimum wage jobs to counteract wages on the coast?</p>
<p>Edit: OK, this is starting to make more sense.  The cost of housing has skyrocketed around here since I bought my house 6 years ago, meaning this area is actually more expensive to live in than most of the country.</p>
<p>Edit again: this also seems to include everybody with a W2, so an average lumps all part timers and full timers together.  Things aren't as dire as they first seemed.  The actual average hourly wage in the US is closer to $17/hr, which would be doable in my area, even though the cost of living is above average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not hard to believe that 27k is an average income.  Most of America lives in suburbia,  which is much cheaper than living in a large city.  Many states have low minimum wages, even when the cost of living is getting higher. </p>
<p>Plus,  there are tons of people working those minimum wages jobs.  Customer service jobs,  retail, part-time, and even myself.  I work in construction and make 25k a year.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It blew me away when I first heard it and it still shocks me.  But that appears to be the average salary in his town.</p>
<p>the flip side is.... I asked him why and he told me he could have moved to a bigger city and made more but his wife wanted to say near his sisters and raise all the children together.  When I was younger, I thought it was incredibly dumb, but as I am older and now have children of my own, I can see his point.  Family is important.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some sense, the rise in cost of living is a reflection of rising incomes given that 70% of economic activity in the US is based on consumption. This is known as wage push inflation. When I state that a large part of cost of living increases are part because of rising incomes doesn't actually answer OP'S question and actually makes the whole thing make less sense. </p>
<p>The divergence is more granular than simple differences in productivity, thus dragging down incomes. (Although I must note the original question asked why in the past FORTY years this divergence has happened, flat REAL inflation adjusted incomes have only been relatively flat in the past TEN years).</p>
<p>I'll make a bold stated that says lower interest rates (declining since 1980 and now close to zero) has actually hurt the average &quot;work&quot; &quot;household&quot; or how ever you want to slice it. This is due to the fact that lower interest rates have increased total housing costs from 2x annual income to 10x annual income because lower interest rates lower the MONTHLY cost of housing, the expense from which housing (renting vs buying) decisions are made. For example, in 1980 a 100k house @ 10% mortgage rates might cost $850/mn. That same 850/mn payment in 2016 @ 4% interest rates buys a 160k house. In this example I held figures free from inflation to show that regardless of inflation the real TOTAL cost has risen substantially. This difference between these total costs (total REAL amount for a house between 1980 and 2016) grows exponentially as the house price increases at any level which explains the X2 to x10 of income costs. Since housing eats up 20% to 50% of a consumers budget (consumption is 70% of the US economy). A large portion of the increase in cost of living is due to a declining interest rate policy. It's a good policy if you owned a home 40 years ago and have seen your house appreciate solely due this economic/monetary phenomenon but overall a bad policy because it has had all these unclear adverse effects.</p>
<p>Aside from housing you could make an argument that says because we all are consumers that if we all consumer more (and productivity gains to labor income doesn't keep pace) the prices of things will rise. If markets are built to clear through the pricing mechanism then prices will rise and fall to clear the market. That is to say, things are more expensive BECAUSE of dual incomes not in spite of them. The US could have chugged along with single income households, limited it's consumption and provided a feedback to reign in a rise of prices. But because  households, marginally and slowly, wanted more stuff and/or the rights for women to do higher level work this created price pressures and pushed households that only wanted one income  to work more and employ two incomes. Don't mis-interpret this as a slam on women. Personally speaking, I was raised in a single female headed household. If the US had stuck to a single income household (male or female) the rise in prices, and subsequent need for dual incomes (both male and female) could have been mitigated. If anything, it was men and cultural constructs (formed both by men and women) that wouldn't let men leave the labor force in space of their better half.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not so sure. I think people's expectations have changed. The so-called golden years of America were in the 1950s and 1960s. That was when supposedly anyone could get a good paying factory job and one income could support your family. But look at the houses built during that time. In St. Louis where I live the houses built during that time are tiny compared to the houses they build now. 1000 ft.² or less was a typical building size. Nowadays most new houses built are over 1800 ft.² at least. Also people are more willing to spend more money to live in an area with a good school district. Back then you can just live wherever and that wasn't really as much as a consideration as today. People also went out to eat less didn't have cell phone bills cable bills or had one car. So modern life just has more costs than in the past but really those costs are not really needed. If people decided to live in a 1000 square-foot house in any neighborhood just have one car at no cable bill or cell phone bill they could easily afford to live on one income. The one difference where the past was superior to today was that people in the 50s and 60s had more job security. They also had a better expectation that if they lost the job they could easily find a new one. If people had that peace of mind they could afford to live on one income. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, most of those 'new costs' are more with keeping up with modernity, not some frivolous throw aways.  And good luck finding those tiny old houses, as they stopped building them.  And with modern construction techniques they've been easier to construct.</p>
<p>It's a simple matter of owners no longer passing on increased gains in efficiency down to their employees.  At some point a confluence of reasons causes the capitalists to realize they didn't need to pay their employees more.</p>
<p>Probably had a lot to do with women entering the workforce and virtually doubling the labor pool.  Probably had a lot to do with the idolization of greed and consumerism.  Probably had a lot to do with a bunch of stuff.  I dunno why I repeated that phrase, I do it sometimes, sorry.</p>
<p>Back to the point.  It's like when crusty old politicians say poor people aren't poor because they have microwaves and refridgerators.  We don't live in 1950 anymore, so certain things will be more ubiquitous than in 1950, it doesn't mean people are spending poorly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody says it's the citizen's fault. But you articulated the very fact that it is new expenses and expectations that are driving the cost of living up, not the artificial cutting of wages or disproportionate inflation. Of course, you can't just shun these expectations - it's the way our society works (although with the rise of social tolerance a whole lot of lifestyles that strip some of these expectations became acceptable). But you said it yourself: if you work, you need a car and a cell phone (and a thousand other things, including outsourced services and conveniences). If you want to pay for these things, you have to work. If you work...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you to an extent. However, its also the case that material conditions have influenced that change in expectations. For example, many neighborhoods used to be built with the assumption that people would be walking. That assumption governs all sorts of city planning needs like how many schools a neighborhood needs, where grocery stores should be allowed, etc. Neighborhoods now are much harder to get around without a vehicle which increases the need for owning multiple cars (even if someone doesn't have to go to work). Likewise jobs are harder to find without the internet, and the need to have two incomes to get by has influenced demand for takeout food. As a nation, we may have developed a taste for larger living spaces, but our cities and towns and job markets have changed to make some things, that were previously luxuries, necessities. There are a lot of factors that affect how much it costs to live somewhere, and not all of it can be explained by changing expectations (in fact, I'd wager if we ask why people want bigger houses, we'd find some material cause, like a bygone economic boom or an aggressive advertising campaign).</p></div>		</li>
