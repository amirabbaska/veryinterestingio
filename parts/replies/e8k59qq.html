			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, which is exactly what I meant about the fashion industry not being the whole problem. If you want to wear skinny jeans, front-hip pockets will be a problem for you no matter what.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at hiking clothes.  Hiking pants will have the side cargo pockets on women's pants and may have less obnoxiously small front pockets.  Check brands like L.L. Bean, REI, Eddie Bauer, Columbia, etc.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given how much skill sewing pants takes, I think you'd be spending the same amount as buying a new purse for each pair of pants if you were paying her a fair wage for her labor. As a society our perceptions of how much clothing should cost has been dramatically skewed by fast fashion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right... But the entire point is over your head apparently. They <em>don't want a purse.</em> So, depending on how long these pockets last, and how high end materials are used, it's not unfair to assume they're getting a decent return on their investment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My best pair of jeans is a real old pair from Cambodia that my mum picked up from an op shop for less than a dollar. The pockets are massive, they completely fit my Galaxy Note 8, which is a massive phone. They aren't tight pants, which I usually wear because my legs are too short for standard pants (and also aesthetic), but they've been tailored for someone who is coincidentally the exact same size and shape as me.</p>
<p>Absolute bliss. </p></div>		</li>
