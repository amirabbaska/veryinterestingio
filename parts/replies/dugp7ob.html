			<div class="markdown"><p>My roommate just bought a 40 or 50 pound bag. I think a serving size is a half cup, and the bag has over 400 servings in it. It was like $20 or $30. So much rice but also so damn cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for salt. I saw a documentary on salt refining and the image of a man walking barefoot through the drying ponds is etched in my brain. The workers get all sorts of infections because the salt damages their skin, but they still keep working and walking barefoot in the salt, which unfortunately, can't be washed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple. The low cost rice comes Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Not Asia. </p>
<p>You have probably heard of Basmati rice. Most of it is now grown in Texas and called Texmati. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of the world's rice is produced in India, Bangladesh, China, and continental and maritime Southeast Asia. </p>
