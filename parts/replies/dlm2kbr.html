			<div class="markdown"><p>I really liked the feeling in the hybrid, you could feel the engine get to where it makes power and just hang there under full load. I think it would be cool in a less economy-geared vehicle.</p>
<p>Unless CVTs are stupid cheap to maintain or something, I can't think of what the advantage is to putting one in a car only to simulate fixed shifts anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My only guess is fuel economy for the compromise in accelerantion. Hybrids are already efficient but carry around heavy batteries still so it makes sense how a different ignition cycle(Atkinson) in conjunction with boost from additional motors allow manufacturers to engineers to moderate the efficientcy more with hybrids than in a traditional I.C.E vehicles. </p>
<p>In other words simulated shifts are most likely not really for performance and more for the skeuomorphisim of using gears. That's not as expected in hybrids because they usually ask less from the I.C.E engines because of electric drive and so they need all the performance they can get. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CVT's can do several things that would damage or wear out a normal automatic transmission. The biggest one to me is the ability to floor it on the freeway to pass, or on a long incline (like going to a ski resort). The more you force an auto to shift, the more wear it puts on it. My dad used to get pissed at me when I would step on it on a road trip, when we would be cruising at a consistent rpm. &quot;Stop making it shift, you'll wear out my transmission&quot; he'd say. Same thing goes on a long hill. You don't have enough engine power to cruise up the hill at the desired speed without shifting down, but as soon as you step on it, you hit the speed and let off to stay within the speed limit. Most folks end up putting it on 3rd manually and cruise up at whatever speed they can maintain without shifting. Now in a CVT, you can fully floor it any time you want without hurting it. Whenever I go up skiing, I can rev it up to maintain speed and let off when I need to without damage. I usually just feather the gas and maintain speed on the hill just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a Forester XT with the CVT. It'll run continuous in standard and sport modes, and switch to emulating a 6-speed in Sport+. It was a bit odd at first, but now that I'm used to it, it would be hard to go back to a regular automatic. </p>
<p>It accelerates fastest without the shift emulation - stomp the pedal and it'll stay at peak torque until you let off. Take it easy and it keeps the RPMs (and engine noise) low at all reasonable speeds, and gets decent mileage as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fusion hybrid does not have a CVT. Ford licenses Toyotas hybrid synergy drive system which has two motors and the engine. Technically the gear ratio from the engine is fixed and never varies, thus technically not a variable transmission. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it’s not a true CVT... If you go on Ford’s site and spec one out, they call the transmission an “eCVT”. My experience driving one really felt like I was at the same engine speed despite changing ground speed while accelerating. I did not have a tachometer to verify, so it was a casual observation.</p>
<p>This was a brand new 2017 model. Maybe the older ones were different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they market it as an eCVT. It's different from the Nissan, Toyota, Honda, and other CVTs that use the metal push belt with the two facing cones. The eCVT should drive just like the Prius and all Toyota/Lexus hybrids. The engine rpm just holds while the car accelerates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive a 14 Maxima. It is continuous and smooth all the way up to 80.  There is no significant shift feeling at all.  It's kinda weird even.  I don't think it's ever above 3k rpms either.  </p></div>		</li>
