<p>How can an investor without a majority do either of these things?</p>
<p>How would they make money from selling assets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't need to own a majority if they can get a majority of the votes.  Remember, other investors are probably pretty disappointed with management if the price to book ratio is under 1.  </p>
<p>The company is selling for less than the value of the assets in question.  So all the shares might be selling for $300 million, but the company's headquarters building might have a market value of $500 million (it was built during better times).  Investors aren't willing to pay $500 million for the shares, because small investors don't believe they would ever be able to shift management, and don't trust management to ever give them the actual value of the headquarters building.  </p>
<p>So the raider buys enough to assure the angry small holders will vote with them, installs a new board, who directs management to sell the HQ building or seek new employment and once that's done gives shareholders $500 million.  The raider made money because he paid $60 million (for 20% of the company) and got $100 million back.  </p></div>		</li>

Corporate raids and hostile takeovers have sort of been his thing for decades. Read up on him, look into how he operates, and you'll likely have the answer to your question. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This kind of &quot;hostile takeover&quot; has largely disappeared. One reason is that publicly-traded companies have mostly adopted various legal devices that prevent the kind of tactics employed by corporate raiders. There are a variety of moves here, but the specifics aren't important. Suffice it to say that the management and boards of large companies have various ways of making corporate raids very difficult, and that most companies who perceive some risk that they might be the target of a hostile takeover have adopted a number of these tactics,</p>

<p>That bubble burst ten years ago. I offer no opinion as to whether those conditions still obtain. <em>Someone</em> has presumably done the legwork to figure out whether a bubble has formed since that one burst, but it sure as hell isn't <em>me</em>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Appreciate the explanation.  I've also heard talk of an impending stock market &quot;correction&quot; with shares expected to drop in value by about 5-10%.  I'm not well-versed in economics, but can you at all elaborate on what this &quot;correction&quot; is?</p></div>		</li>
