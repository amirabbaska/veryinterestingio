Since this would eliminate the need for the user to be aware that it's happening at all, improving their experience.</p>		</li>

			<p>The author is not talking about image-verifications where you type in the letters shown on the image. He is talking about those newer verifications where all you do is click on a check-box. His question is, if all you do is click on a check-box, why can't the check-box be combined with the submit button.</p>		</li>
