<p>They should have days where they get paid to work out and access to free counseling. </p>
<p>A cafeteria for cops wouldn't hurt either. </p>
<p>Not to mention shorter shifts and more days off. </p>
<p>They do a damn tough job, it's the least the government could do for them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think a cafeteria for cops would work, as they are usually all over the city...just like fast food restaurants.
Maybe sending them out with a days &quot;rations&quot; might not be such a crazy idea? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or have the &quot;off day&quot; guys bring out food to the on guys, via bicycle if you're in a big enough city. Solves multiple issues!</p>
<p>Nite: I know it wouldn't work, but I like the idea of making cities more bicycle friendly, and this seems a prime way to do it. All it takes is one cop getting clipped on his bike for them to be more vigilant about cars giving space, etc, etc. </p></div>		</li>

<p>free food</p>

<p>Reminds me of a Terry Pratchett quote, involving  <del>Bobbies</del> a fictional police force:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sammies, they were called, even in towns that had never heard of Sam Vimes. [Vimes] was just a little proud of that. “Sammies” meant watchmen who could think without their lips moving, <strong>who didn't take bribes—much, and then only at the level of beer and doughnuts, which even Vimes recognized as the grease that helps the wheels run smoothly</strong>—and were, on the whole, trustworthy. For a given value of “trust”, at least.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For context, City Watch commander Sam Vimes is... not a paladin by any means, but has very very strong opinions about &quot;big picture&quot; justice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well i just asked him and he said you have to pass defence and arrest tactics training. this training was performed every over month. They did live fighting in protective gear . He said its more padding then the mma training gear so you sweat your ass off. If you don't pass you dont work. </p>
<p>edit: adding more shit:
he also added that if you know your defence moves you can do better than the smaller guys who suck it. He also noted that yes he cant run long distances, but you only need to be fast on short distances. Even as a big guy hes never lost in a foot chase.</p></div>		</li>
