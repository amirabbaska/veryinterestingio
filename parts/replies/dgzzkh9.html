<p>The same factory produces both, just with different labels.</p>

<p>Sometimes the generic is identical, but fails the quality control testing of the main brand.  Any fruit loop that wasn't regulation size or ended up a hook/disk/ball might end up in the generic box just because it doesn't look good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say something similar. I worked for a not food related but huge company many people know and use every day. </p>
<p>Signed and NDA so can't say which, but our brand and a majority of &quot;off brands&quot; were made on the same line on the same day. We would just &quot;water it down&quot; in a way where it was effective just not as effective as our name brand, and would repackage it with 1-5 different labels/off brands. </p>
<p>So sometimes the &quot;off brand&quot; is actually the name brand product that wasn't in spec to be &quot;name brand&quot;</p></div>		</li>
