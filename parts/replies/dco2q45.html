			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate that you liked my small comment. I will list more pillars,sub-pillars and will draw a mindmap in a few hours.</p>
<p>Indulge me, there is a misunderstandig. I am not and never had been a member of any political party. I was a member of pro-opposition movenment and a protestor a few years ago(that got me a day in jail and 400 us dollars fine eventually).</p>
<p>I also was part of the green movenment against animal cruelty. Again, not a party, just the organised  movenment of people. </p>
<p>Was part of radical liberal anarchist group too, lol. Pretty much dodged a bullet by running away when SWAT showed up to take down our squat. </p>
<p>Again, not a member of political party. Now I go to every miting and protest, take some pics of situation, list major thesises of the leaders and send it to partimember. Pretty down on food-chain, huh. So let me assure you: im as far from being a big deal politician as possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does #1 work exactly? The whole point of the voting system in the country that I'm from is that nobody <em>including you yourself</em> are able to prove after the fact which way you voted. </p>
<p>The fact that you voted is recorded before you cast your ballot, but everything you write on your ballot is completely secret and then it's placed in the box with all the others. If you write anything except an X in one box on your paper it's declared invalid (because it could be used to identify you).</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned this is a fundamental pillar of democracy that elections work like this. If you can prove which way you voted, people will ask/force you to tell them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd actually be surprised to learn that secret voting wasn't implemented in the us until around turn of the century 1900</p>
<p>There aren't secret votes because Russia isn't a democracy. The only reason people in Russia are allowed to vote is so that Russia can put up a veil of democracy to the rest of the world. Same as China. The people &quot;vote&quot; for the one party available to them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, great, interesting, and informative answer.</p>
<p>Second, aside from minor typos that did not hinder comprehension this was well written (I make bigger mistakes regularly and it is my first and only language).</p>
<p>Third, I am definitely interested in the more minor reasons from the perspective of someone inside it like you.</p></div>		</li>
