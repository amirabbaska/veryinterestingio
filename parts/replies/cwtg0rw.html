			<div class="markdown"><p>Sponges, corals, etc are hard to really use as an example of &quot;oh well lots of animals are just like that!&quot; because I think most people have a harder time considering corals to be functioning animals than they do jellyfish.  At least jellyfish display free motion (sort of).  </p>
<p>Follow up question though - how do we differentiate between something like a jellyfish which is a single animal and a siphonophore which is a colony of different animals acting like a single animal?  Where's the division for that? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!  That makes me curious about what kind of percentage determines something as &quot;of the same organism, but a different functioning part&quot; and &quot;of a siphonophore made of distinct organisms rather than different parts&quot; - but I guess if I want to start digging that deep maybe I need to go and get a biology degree instead haha :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a lot of colonial animals do reproduce via cloning. But there are clear cutoffs- cell membranes are completely cut off in separate organisms, whereas cells are linked with various channel proteins and tons of other stuff in a single organism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really good (and almost philosophical) question to which I'm not sure I can completely answer.   </p>
<p>I think in the case of siphonophores, they are a bunch of animals, but they're so highly specialized that they couldn't actually survive on their own. For example, a Portuguese man o' war is actually made up of three types of polyps that have distinct roles: defense, feeding and reproduction. A defense polyp could not survive if it broke off from the rest of the gang, because it can only do that one function; it would starve to death and be unable to reproduce. I'm trying to think of a good analogy, but nothing's really 1-to-1. Perhaps like a plant with flowers, leaves and fruit. You break off a flower, the flower dies.   </p>
<p>For a more fun, grotesque yet morally inappropriate example, think of that human centipede movie. You have three people who are stitched together into one thing. But now only the first one can eat food. The middle one is for locomotion and the last person on the end can reproduce. The food eating one has to share nutrition with the other two because they can't eat. The middle one has to move them around because the others can't. The last one has to be in the reproductive role for similar reasons. This is sort of like how the polyps function: they have their specialized role and all other features degenerate until they're completely dependent on the other specialized polyps for survival.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For siphonophores, it starts off as one jellyfish (essentially), and then buds off new ones over time. They are for the most part genetically identical, contrary to what /u/GravityTheory said, but each one is structured like its own jellyfish.</p>
<p>It's like if you were born as a person without arms and legs, but eventually grew four long, thin people out of your shoulders and hips, that you then could use to walk and manipulate objects. If you ignore the grotesque body horror aspect of it....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelia_(genus\)" target="_blank">moon jellyfish</a>, in addition to the ocelli, the rhopalia region of also houses a mechanosensory organ called the statocyst, situated next to a touch plate. It is believed to function like our inner ear, giving balance and sensing gravity.</p>
<p>Jellyfish eyes are not as different to ours as one may think, some of the essential developmental genes that control development of our eyes (such as <em>sine oculis</em>) have been found in the moon jelly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may well be true. I have only read literature on it with regards to the moon jelly, so I felt it safer to state only what I know. It would not surprise me if other scyphozoans have statocysts too.</p></div>		</li>
