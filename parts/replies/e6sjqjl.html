			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently we’re mapping everyone’s measurements to what is known as the MGRS gridding system and using a 100 meter pixel size. The actual lat/long from a user is kept with the measurement so a scientist can pinpoint where the user was within that pixel (to the available phone accuracy) [Dave Overoye]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important question when making a map. We are having observers take pictures in each North, East, South, West direction but focused on the immediate 50m from your location. So someone will end up photographing 100meter x 100meter area. </p>
<p>Yes, we hope that observers will take photos from multiple locations within that 100m x 100m area because sometimes you can’t see through buildings or tall trees to see the full 50m.  Also, go back to a location because land cover changes with seasons and over years. - Peder Nelson</p></div>		</li>
