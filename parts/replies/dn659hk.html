			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is that now, for those of us who are in our 20s, 30s, and 40s - children of those baby boomers - those Christmas songs define <em>our</em> childhood Christmases as well. </p>
<p>In 200 years we'll still be playing these same Christmas songs...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, we've added <em>exactly one song</em> to the classics list. 200 years from now Mariah Carey's great granddaughter will probably still be getting royalty checks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The true question is whether or not All I Want For Christmas has the staying power of those other songs. I suspect it does, though I hope I'm wrong. That one gets old fast when the holidays get into full swing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus a time when there were many Americans serving overseas in the military, starting with White Christmas and I'll Be Home for Christmas and WW2 and then the Korean and Vietnam wars. This played a strong factor in the playing of wistful Christmas songs.

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I didn't know about until I grew up was that White Christmas came from a movie of the same name. It adds a <strong>shitload</strong> of context and is really fascinating because it's such a product of it's time: it's all about people coming home (or wanting to but worrying they can't), people missing the military, people not knowing what to do with themselves after getting out of the army... </p>
<p>Anyway what I'm saying is you're totally on point </p></div>		</li>
