			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually it follows the centerline of the river, or more precisely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalweg" target="_blank">thalweg</a>, the line of lowest elevation of the riverbottom.</p>
<p>However in some cases this gets awkward, because river beds move around over time.  Sometimes these border disputes between US states get argued in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/01/us/supreme-court-awards-island-to-mississippi.html" target="_blank">Supreme Court</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Line of lowest elevation is correct in most cases, I learned a new word today.</p>
<p>Islands are a toss up sometimes.</p>
<p>One instance I'm familiar with is reciprocity agreements. With fishing licences I can cross the Mississippi and fish from a neighboring states banks and vice versa, without having to get a license from that state.</p>
<p>I believe this is common practice, the official boundary may be a little further back (railroad tracks) to account for backwater areas. International waters are probably different, the great lakes areas address it differently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tell me about it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Pheasant Island] is a condominium established by the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, under joint sovereignty of Spain and France, and for alternating periods of six months is officially under the governance of the naval commanders of San Sebastián, Spain (1 February – 31 July) and of Bayonne, France (1 August – 31 January).</p>

<p>Also in Virginia, all rivers are public property for navigation and managed by the commonwealth for fisheries... unless you have a royal charter granting you that waterway, then its yours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the cases that I am familiar with, the river belongs entirely to one of the states.  In the odd sounding case, the Ohio river along the Ohio/Kentucky border belongs to Kentucky.  I don't know why, but I assume it is a matter of who had the earliest claim.</p>
<p>This does not appear to be the case with the Mississippi, where state borders are all over the place, but those may be where the river was on a certain date.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now that the 71/75 bridge needs replaced ODOT told Kentucky well it's YOUR river so you pay for the bridge over it and we'll do just the north approach.</p>
<p>They didn't take that well but it was funny.</p></div>		</li>
