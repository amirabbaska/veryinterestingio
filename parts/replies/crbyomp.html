			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that helps a lot, and is a really good answer. I was expecting a lot of different answers because I think it genuinely is a multifaceted issue, and I was hoping someone would be able to give me a socio-political perspective. </p>
<p>I guess what I'm wondering now is, why the xenophobia? Of course every culture has their own version of a terrible tourist - but it does appear that by and large people do make an effort to understand the culture they are visiting and try not to do or say things that would be offensive to the locals. It seems that this doesn't seem to happen as much with tourists and new immigrants from China? Is China being unfairly targeted here or is that true, I wonder. And if it is, I am curious as to how that could be addressed. As others have said, China is still developing in a lot of ways. I personally find the socio-cultural part of globalization really interesting but I haven't had the opportunity to learn much about it (my degree is in another area).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chinese xenophobia stands among others because we are seeing it today as opposed to Japan or British xenophobia that happened hundred of years ago.</p>
<p>Look at their history though, the Treaty of Nanking caused the Ming dynasty to collapse. If it weren't for the Europeans, maybe China will be different today. However, history is taught in China (maybe) to create a perspective that Westerners are evil (which they are historically). As a result, you raise a modern generation that hates white people who has a perspective from the 1800 that is being applied on 21st century. SO it's an outdated viewpoint which might be taught on China today. Japan's xenophobia had the same roots with Commodore Perry intervening in Japan's way of life.</p>
<p>Are they being unfairly targeted? I'd personally say no. They're targeted because those tourists' actions stands out among others and the media loves things that stands out. Some Indian people for example have a very foul body odor which is just unbearable but you don't see them on the news because it's not worthy of being reported.</p>
<p>How could that be solved? Information and education. I heard China's government hands out pamphlets to tourist on what to and not to do when travelling abroad. That just proves that education in China is very... unbalanced. Also, internet information in China is severely limited (can't use facebook or google) to prevent Western perspective from coming in which is not helping at all. So self-education isn't going to get them anywhere. I think one solution is have those young Chinese immigrants who had experienced Western lifestyle to go back to China and teach but that's wishful thinking. Otherewise, we can only hope that some government reform would change things for the better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Xenophobia was drilled into the Chinese during the Cultural Revolution. All things Western were declared evil, even what we would consider neutral or beautiful Western things such as music, literature or fashions. It is hard to un-learn such prejudice quickly, especially as the Chinese government is still communist and, as others have mentioned, untold numbers of intellectuals were wiped out of the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just NOPE.</p>
<p>It was the cold wars era, everyone hated everyone else. That's just that.</p>
<p>Xenophobia, the root of it is similar to Japan. It's about the feeling of cultural superiority. China can boost a continuous culture tracing back 5000 years, no other country on the planet can claim that (well maybe Japan, that's why China hates Japan haha I joke of course). Not even Egypt, the people living in Egypt now are not the ancient Egyptians. People living in Rome now are not the ancient Romans. People in Baghdad are not the ancient Babylonians. But the people living in Beijing now, can trace their ancestors back to the glorious Imperial age.</p>
<p>That's why Chinese people think they are culturally superior and sees others are barbarians. </p>
<p>Historically, if you go through modern history, China's pretty much being raped militarily and economically by pretty much everyone else on the planet (which also contribute to Japan's xenophobia, Japan's basically what China could be if China adopted western system in the 1800s). It's a deep grudge the Chinese people hold and many younger generation Chinese wish to pay back that raping when China rise again. Unbalanced demographics with milions of extra men compare to women, and a huge nationalistic grudge holding sentiment, and growing military spending and build up will not end well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can't agree with this: beijing, shanghai &amp; shenzhen are chock-full of western luxury-brand outlets.  outwardly western-style things are seen as desirable, and the government has to push to maintain interest in some kind of established chinese heritage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was going to be my answer. The Cultural Revoltion destroyed the previous Chinese culture. They lost the good parts of traditional Chinese culture and never got it back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have also lost the bad parts. Feudal bondage, conservative ideals, bad social norms to name a few. (if you think treating female is bad now, just imagine back then - you can argue how they treat girls now is a result of one child policy, but being a culture of ancestral worshipers passing down your ancestor's last name is seen as divine duty above all else. Being a girl sucks, but times are changing and more and more people follow their mother's last name.)</p>
<p>Many Chinese people would argue that even counting in the positive side of the revolution. It was not worth the complete annihilation of the old culture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most cultures were horrendous towards women until modern times, though. They tend to lose those bad features as the culture advances. China tried to do it all in one go instead of naturally letting progress happen because they needed desperately to catch up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still exists in many places, including among many of the older immigrants/expats, some of the &quot;old money&quot;, etc. My grandparents survived the Cultural Revolution for one reason or another, and I would like to believe they taught my parents well in the ways of the more traditional and positive aspects of Chinese culture, who went on to teach me. This, along with the fact that traditional sources of knowledge (e.g. books) still exist, leads me to believe that one day (as education levels rise), Chinese culture can be repaired and restored.</p></div>		</li>
