			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you determine what kind of allergens to administer? My husband is having weird rashes out of nowhere and he has tried to reduce/cut out caffeine, seafood, flour-based foods to some degree of success, however he still is still on medication. It confuses us as to what is he allergic to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We test for the most common environmental allergens in the area. Our battery includes molds, animals, weeds, grasses, and trees. Many of the allergens we test for are cross-reactive with others so while we test &lt;50 allergens, it can be very insightful. </p>
<p>The best example are grasses. We test for 4 different types; timothy, johnson, orchard, and bermuda. These grasses are in different family groups along with other types we don't test for. The rationale being if you react to one grass from say, the pooids, you are likely sensitive to all the grasses in that family. There's a good chart on page 4 of this link: <a href="https://www.aaapc.org/files/Cross-Reactivity-in-Immunotherapy.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.aaapc.org/files/Cross-Reactivity-in-Immunotherapy.pdf</a></p>
<p>Additionally, there is some pollen-food cross reactivity called &quot;Oral Allergy Syndrome.&quot; Latex and avocados have similar enough proteins people allergic to one are often allergic to the other! About halfway down this page is a chart showing some common pollen-food links: <a href="https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/library/allergy-library/outdoor-allergies-and-food-allergies-can-be-relate" target="_blank">https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/library/allergy-library/outdoor-allergies-and-food-allergies-can-be-relate</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I really miss raw cucumber, avocado, and melons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has your husband been to a doctor lately? It would be worth talking to a doctor about since it could be allergies, but there are a number of other conditions that lead to weird rashes. It also might be worth getting a referral to a dermatologist or allergist depending on what kind of rashes they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there. Yes, he has been to 2 different doctors, both  stated it could be seasonal. Early this year he dealt with them with some medication and it went away after a couple of months. Then it reappeared at the start of October. The previous meds did not work well anymore. So we went to the 2nd doctor who prescribed steroids for a week which worked well. Doctor then stopped steroid medication and prescribed a less stronger one. That did not work so well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can all allergies be treated this way? I developed a bee allergy in adulthood and damn near died. I now carry an epipen rescue injection. Which I have had to use once since discovering my allergy. Can bee allergies be treated with allergy shots to gradually reduce sensitivity?</p>
<p>I know Iâ€™m late to this post, but I would really appreciate your information. I would not go so far as to say my allergy ruined my life. But it has changed my life significantly in that a small fear exists inside me that colors how/when/where I travel and really anything that takes me outside into the natural world!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venom immunotherapy (VIT) does exist and some allergists may be willing to try an in-office shot schedule.  I'm not sure as my clinic utilizes an at-home protocol only, so severe allergies are referred to an allergist for management. </p>
<p>Rush immunotherapy is an option if you can find an allergist to approve it, but the vast majority of insurances don't cover it at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen anything to back that claim up. The issue with local honey is you have no control over what plants the bee visits, nor the levels of local pollen present in the honey. One batch of honey could have high levels of X pollen, but the next batch could have half the amount for example.</p></div>		</li>
