			<div class="markdown"><p>Right,</p>
<p>There IS real science behind neutrotransmitters- but it's more questions than answers.  The field is so wildly misrepresented to the public with 95% pseudoscience.  </p>
<p>Neutrotransmitters aren't &quot;levels&quot;, the term &quot;neurochemical imbalance&quot; is somewhat true only because it's so completely vague it doesn't have a specific meaning to prove or disprove.   They don't seem to have consistent functions and in any case aren't really characterized by &quot;levels&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree to some extent, but although 'levels' surely isn't a precise characterization, I think for neuromodulators a 'level' can be a sufficient model as they are often secreted in paracrine fashion and act over large timescales (for example, think about the small boutons of 5-HT neurons that basically innervate the entire forebrain). For short acting transmitters, 'levels' do not make sense at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the there's two logical issues I have:</p>
<p>One, a &quot;level&quot; tends to mean a presence of a mass of a chemical.  How it is utilized is very different, and complex.</p>
<p>Two, there's a suggestion that a chemical predictably does a certain thing.  Oxytocin=love bonding, serotonin=happiness.  Of course the effects of these chemicals are far more complex and vague, and what effect modifying the action of dopamine in one person actually does may have a completely different effect in another individual.  Public perception from junk science leads people to believe &quot;but more serotonin is happy, right?&quot;  </p>
<p>And &quot;if you had too much serotonin, you'd be orgasmically happy, right?&quot;  No, Serotonin Syndrome has a host of unpleasant, dangerous symptoms which are nothing like &quot;happy&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since L-DOPA causes dopamine down-regulation with continuous usage and may be addictive , how come it's still sold as a supplement and not regulated ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since I am not from the US, I am not informed about the specific regulations that apply there - in most european countries including the UK it is regulated. </p>
<p>However, L-DOPA in itself is simply hydroxylized tyrosine, i.e., something naturally occurring in the body and closely related to an amino acid. Furthermore, simple ingestion of L-DOPA does not have strong effects on the central nervous system, as the vast majority of it will be metabolized (decarboxylized) before crossing the blood-brain barrier and leads to peripheral dopamine increases causing mostly unpleasant side effects. However, combining L-DOPA with a decarboxylation inhibitor (like benserazide or carbidopa) prevents this metabolization and leads to increases of L-DOPA in the brain. These combinations should be regulated in most countries, including the US, however the names of the combination drugs can be confusing, as one is called 'levodopa' - which could easily be confused with the actual, pure L-DOPA.</p></div>		</li>
