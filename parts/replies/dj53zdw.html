			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the volumes don't matter, your 100 foot water column and drowning-cavity would be essentially the same as SCUBA diving in 100 feet of water, just a lot more claustrophobic.  This is deeper than most recreational dives, but not enough to crush you to death (by a long shot.)  PADI limits your run-of-the-mill recreational divers to 130 feet, so you would almost certainly be fine - until you drowned that is.  The air in your lungs would compress significantly and you'd run out of oxygen pretty fast, but your flesh and bones would be a-OK.  </p>
<p>The evil Professor would need to design the infernal rig with no less than 1,000 feet of water column above the crushing-compartment, as that's right about where the world record is for the deepest human dive outside of a vehicle.  He'd better aim for closer to a half mile to really be certain of your demise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although it has been pointed out that the depth quantity is wrong, the simple answer to your question is that, yes, the counterintuitive would happen, and the gallon of water would subject you to pressure much greater than you could experience from, say, putting it in a gallon jug and resting it on your head.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, consider this: what happens if you exhale? Your volume decreases by a pint and the water column (and thus the pressure) falls by an eighth. If you were in the equivalent depth of ocean and exhaled you would simply lose a lungful of air and keep getting crushed at the exact same pressure. Maybe that will make the situation seem slightly more intuitive, I don't know.</p>
<p>Edit - basically the two columns (ocean vs. 0.25 inch pipe) apply the same pressure but cannot do the same work.</p></div>		</li>
