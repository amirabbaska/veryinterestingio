<p>I actually feel it's more ok to discuss salaries between Co-workers, than with friends. Between Co-workers it has a strategical purpose, as you say, for the boss it's beneficial if the workers aren't discussing it. So for the workers it's beneficial - so they should be doing it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, there's a pretty good chance that a lot of your friends work in the same industry as you, so it's useful to know if your company is over or underpaying. Or even if the entire industry is underpaying.</p>
<p>Keeping workers ignorant about wages can only help the employers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Op uses taboo and rude when he asks. Anyone I've met that thinks it's rude is because work told them it is. Once they find out they are underpaid they get mad at everyone. The coworkers, the bosses, they may lose their job if they push it hard enough. So it's taboo.</p>
<p>I understand the other reasons too, just supporting another redditor. My friends range from dirt poor to lambo and mclaren drivers, I work in a warehouse, others are business owners and wealth managers, or both, etc. I don't ask because I know it's a lot, they don't ask because they know it's little. We are friends because of common interests that bring us together, usually car guy stuff.</p></div>		</li>
