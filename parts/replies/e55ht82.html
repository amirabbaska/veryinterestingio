			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, my old man (who graduated from undergrad in ‘68 and saw his fair share of riots and other 60s bs) says exactly this about every documentary and Hollywood movie. People who were swept up by the movement were <em>really</em> swept up by the movement, and they like to make the 60s seem one dimensional. With music in particular, creatives totally cherry pick the same 10-15 protest songs for the background of their work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s probably the problem. We’re generally speaking too lazy these days to ‘rally around’.  </p>
<p>Although in saying that, there were the 2001/2 massive worldwide marches against the Afghan/Iraq invasion, as well as the 2009 anti-1% ‘let’s occupy’ Wall Street thing.  Both of which seemed to have little if any impact on Government policy / create change.</p>
<p>So maybe it’s an apathy thing? </p>
<p>To the OPs Q tho, there’s plenty of ‘protest music’ around today. Just less visible public movement.</p></div>		</li>
