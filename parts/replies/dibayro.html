			<div class="markdown"><p>Stochastic models are really just statistics, though. Statistics with, typically, very large sample sizes, but still just statistics. The half-life is just the time period over which the probability of decay is 0.5. The probability that significantly more or less than half (say, more than 60% or less than 40%) of the particles will decay in that time, while negligible for any sample of more than two hundred or so particles, is still technically nonzero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, as jedi said, we are just taking advantage of large sample sizes. A single gram of a given substance will contain well over 10^20 atoms, so between the lot of them the deviation is tiny.</p></div>		</li>
