			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, isn't it just lovely how it's never just anxiety? Some days you also get the added bonus of being so depressed that you don't want to leave your bed or the house, or you are unable to focus if the window blinds aren't lying just perfectly or the vacuum lines in the carpet are off a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a firm believer that the vast majority of anxieties are induced by other psychological problems.</p>
<p>Phobias (thunder, spiders, etc.) seem to occur &quot;naturally&quot;, but abstract anxieties are more like a side symptom of most other things that cause social isolation assuming the patient has a certain level of emotional or psychological sensitivity.</p>
<p>They are basically that worst runny nose of every infect you ever had gave you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't explain how frustrating it is to be told 'just don't worry' for this exact reason. I don't intend to worry, and I'm a logical enough person to know that I shouldn't, but I can't help it.</p></div>		</li>
