			<div class="markdown"><p>It's simple. We free the slingshot ride from its constraints and wait for the panicked crowd to either disperse to the perimiter or exit. Assuming you came together, they're either in the car waiting for you or around the edges of the park.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I'd stand by the exit to ensure you'll eventually find the person.  However in a grid like situation such as lost in the woods make arrows as you move so a person looking for you can run into your trail and then follow it.  </p></div>		</li>
