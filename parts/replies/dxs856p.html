			<div class="markdown"><p>For the first one, we can, but it's not gonna be effective. And the ceramic shatter because they're having low toughness means they can't withstand impact force, or sudden increase of load. </p>
<p>But ceramic (or any hard material with low toughness) doesn't really disperse  the energy of bullet like rubber or fluid. They absorbed the energy and use it to make the crack happen.</p>
<p>The dispersed energy theory that you said is correct in kevlar vest but not ceramic plate,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you replied to the wrong comment. I am saying that the ceramic will crack on impact to absorb the energy of the bullet, which is exactly how it works...</p>
<p>Edit: I'm using absorb/disperse interchangeably here to indicate moving the impact force away from the wearer and into the armour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>\FirstWiseWarrior is correct. The ceramic dissipates the kinetic energy by using the energy to break molecular bonds (cracking). As opposed to dispersing the energy through redistribution across the material (rubber shock absorption).</p></div>		</li>
