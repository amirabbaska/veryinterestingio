			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I love watching something while eating dinner.  I don't so much enjoy eating at the table and talking which interrupts my eating and sometimes my enjoyment of the meal.  </p>
<p>E.g. You take a bite of that awesome piece of seafood that you have been saving towards the end of your seafood marinara then someone at the table asks you how your university course is going.  To be polite you chew your food quickly to respond or talk while eating which is considered to be rude, missing out on that otherwise enjoyable bite...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is right. I grew up rich enough to go to the movies, but poor enough that we never bought anything from the concession. Now I don't eat anything during movies, even as an adult it feels weird and distracting to eat popcorn or something.</p>
<p>However, I often watch TV during dinner (again, something I did as a kid).</p>
<p>There's no functional difference, but I think there are just some triggers people get used to.</p></div>		</li>
