			<div class="markdown"><p>When my son (now 20 years old) was small he took Singulair for several years and it worked wonders for his asthma. Unfortunately it also gave him severe nosebleeds and migraines so we had to stop it. But for a time we almost forgot how bad his allergies and asthma were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know. I wonder about all kinds of stuff- blood transfusions, stem cell therapy, etc. I can’t imagine it either. It’s basically a race against time- hoping that maybe one day your body will just say “okay, we’re done being allergic to everything now. Back to normal.” I can’t fathom living in a bubble, essentially. So sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m apparently slowly developing a latex allergy, at least, that’s the only thing I can think of it being, when I put on latex gloves (have to for work, non-optional) and I take them off I’ve started having a rash all on the sides and tops of my hands.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI, there are really thin cloth gloves that you can wear under the latex gloves to help with this. Your hands do get warmer in them, but they help. They are called, surprisingly enough, glove liners. Maybe that would help you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>iirc, it's not uncommon for your immune system to become sensitized to latex over time. Any reason you can't bring your own nitrile or similar non-latex disposable gloves to use instead?</p></div>		</li>
