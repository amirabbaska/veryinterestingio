<p>I saw a video at the Atomic Museum in Las Vegas that demonstrated this using ping pong balls &amp; mouse traps. I can't find that particular video but <a href="https://youtu.be/nM-_XaBVneE?t=35" target="_blank">here's a Pepsi Max commercial</a> where they do the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a 1 to 2 actually, as the trap itself is propelled along with the ball. The trap and ball hits another ball+trap combination independently and the process repeats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is absolutely true. There are many other factors involved, such as the ability of a certain atom to absorb a neutron (some don't at all) and whether or not that atom remains stable after absorbing the neutron. For example, Hafnium is often used in control rods because it can absorb a neutron and remain stable (it won't fission), but Uranium becomes unstable after it absorbs a neutron and fissions. </p>
<p>Plutonium is actually more potent in reactors and bombs, but isn't readily available in nature like Uranium. The second bomb dropped on Japan was a plutonium bomb. Plutonium is a by-product of the fission process in certain nuclear reactors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be completely precise, Plutonium isn't really a by-product of the fission reaction, in that it's not what we would call a &quot;fission product&quot; (i.e. one of the two atoms the uranium splits into). It's actually a by-product of the non-fissionable Uranium-238 capturing some of the enormous number of neutrons present, which are themselves by-products of the fission process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranium isn't necessarily the best atom to split, but it's the heaviest element naturally found on earth so it's most accessible. It's by no means the best to start out with, Norway has experimented heavily with Thorium-based reactors (where Thorium turns into enriched Uranium, which is much cheaper and much more clean, not to mention very hard to weaponize) and it's both viable and economically sound. It just so happens that the US and China has a large amount of Uranium, so they've kept researching and developing Uranium-based reactors at a much larger scale than Norway has been able to. Should be mentioned Norway has a large amount of Thorium, probably the largest supply in the world, so should we move to thorium it might be a primary economic income for Norway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>E = m*c^2 </p>
<p>E is energy, m is mass and c is the speed of light. c^2 is a stupidly big number, so E is proportionally huge compared to m. </p>
<p>As for actually WHY thats true thats a subject of debate in modern physics. If you heard about the search for the Higgs boson you might have heard that it is involved in giving mass to other particles, but this is what I was able to dig up just now from <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v6/111" target="_blank">https://physics.aps.org/articles/v6/111</a></p>
<p>&quot;The Higgs boson does not technically give other particles mass. More precisely, the particle is a quantized manifestation of a field (the Higgs field) that generates mass through its interaction with other particles.&quot;</p>
<p>So for some reason this excitation stores a huge potential of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>E=mc^2  </p>
<p>To clarify the energy itself comes from the binding force between particles. This type of force is incredibly strong but only acts over very, very small distances (distances between closely packed particles, such as in an atom's nucleus) so it doesn't have any macroscopic effect (like when you touch something).  </p>
<p>As for why this so strong, well that's really just how the universe works, look up fundamental forces if you are interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The neutron-induced fission cross section for uranium-235, averaged over resonances, goes like 1/v, where v is the speed of the neutron relative to the uranium nucleus. So actually, it’s much more probable for fission to occur with a <strong>low energy</strong> neutron than a high energy one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that’s why many reactors are designed to operate on a thermal neutron spectrum. In order to thermalize the neutrons, moderator is put into the core.</p>
<p>However there are reactors that operate on a fast neutron spectrum. Even though the cross section for fission is much lower for fast neutrons, you can make up for it in other ways. Fast reactors don’t require any moderator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but for specifically a weapon (per the OP's question and this answer), it is worth noting that they rely on high-energy (fast) neutrons (i.e., neutrons of the energy created by the fission process, 1 MeV or so), not slow neutrons. There is no time in a bomb for slowing neutrons down, unlike a reactor. Every neutron created by a fission event needs to immediately create another fission event if the reaction is to grow to a sufficient size prior to the heat of the reaction disassembling the system (which happens on the order of a millisecond).</p>
<p>This why bombs do not contain moderators, and also why their fissile material purity levels have to be so high compared to the flexibility one can have with reactors.</p>
<p>Moderated weapons designs were explored in the early Cold War (uranium-hydride bombs) but they didn't work (they disassemble before the reaction really gets going).</p></div>		</li>
