			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting thanks for sharing. Here in England I am also a systems administrator. There are a couple of ways to get here, study the correct courses at school then university, or like me, show an interest, get a job at the bottom of the industry (part time trainee technician) and work your way up. That's what I did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah we just combined those possibilities into one path to a specialized standardized worker.</p>
<p>I mean of course it sounds horrible to be &quot;standardized&quot; but thats what the industry needs. A uni education produces very well educated theoretical academics with some standardized knowledge imparted.</p>
<p>Your path is autodidactic and hence maybe not universally needed in the industry (only maybe I have no idea what you do so...)</p>
<p>If you have a standardized education and practical experience you are more valuable.
Thats why a lot of countries started or are planning to start using the german system (for example the teachers of my tradeschool overwatch the implementation of a Brazilian tradescholl with german standards)</p>
<p>On the other hand my education itself isn't worth much outside of Germany. But my experience and the international certificates I get on the way are very much interesting even internationally.</p></div>		</li>
