			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair to Carter based on timelines in his presidency we we're fixing the problem. Based on the low level energy act of 1980 (or some other act of that time period they all blur together) the government should've built a repository by 2000. But as we know yucca mountain is still not up and operational because Obama killed the project in 2010. But not Trump is possibly restarting it. </p>
<p>Additionally we don't actually have a pileup of rods, we can store safely on site in dry casket storage for about a hundred years before the storage systems start to deteriorate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The plans and everything we're finished at the end of Bush, but when they went to Obama's nuclear regulatory committee for permits they were denied and funding was cut off. Of course it wasn't all Obama's fault, a lot of nevadians didn't want it in their state and the location of Yucca mountain isn't the greatest. IMO the best option is to just expand WIPP or create a WIPP 2.0 in some other salt deposit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with dry casks is that everything is stored on site (usually). Even if theres the VIT plant getting built at Hanford, since we're already preoccupied with all the legacy waste, the casks won't  be moved to permanent storage or get treated for a long time. WIPP could be the answer but afaik it only accepts transuranic military waste. It'd be nice to have something like Onkalo but at this pace we'll be stuck like this for a very long time.</p></div>		</li>
