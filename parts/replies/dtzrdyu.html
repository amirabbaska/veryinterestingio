			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of the costs associated with creating artificial gravity by centrifugal force, if just hasn't been cost efficient (yet) to make it worth the undertaking.</p>
<p>However, I think due to the recent revelations brought about by Astronaut Scott Kelly's year in space, we are starting to understand how dangerous prolonged microgravity can be on the human body. As such, it seems likely that there will soon be more developments planned to create simulated gravity in space, as any real, long term plan for human exploration, or space colonization, will have to address the issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it is never likely to be cost efficient.  The structures are just too big.  Want the effect of 1g?  You are going to need a ring that is something like 300m in diameter.</p>
<p>EDIT: As people have pointed out, yes you can get 1g at a small radius. The problem is that the apparent force is drastically different between your head and feet if you have a small diameter.  If you want to have a meaningful &quot;gravity&quot; and you want your crew to be able to actually stand up and function, you need large diameters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't really need the whole thing, just a capsule, a tether, and something heavy to put at the other end. </p>
<p>As far as making big structures in space, the main truss of the ISS is around 100m in length. The occupied portion is much smaller, of course, but 100m is still in the same order of magnitude as 300m. On the other hand, the ISS is one of the most expensive single structures ever built and it doesn't have to support 1g loads across its structure so going up to 300m is definitely going to be a step up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bigger object doesnt produce a larger or smaller force. The force is directly determined by the velocity of the spinning object only.</p>
<p>However a large object is referred because there will be a difference in rotational velocity as you approach the center axis of rotation. This means your head could experience a much lower force than your feet. You need a very large structure or long tether to make the force uniform. </p></div>		</li>
