			<div class="markdown"><p>I convinced my dad to play Runescape when I was doing stuff like this around 2006. (I was probably 11). </p>
<p>That college educated motherfucker realized that different merchants on different servers had slightly different price-points for buying and selling stuff based on the economy of that specific server and he would jump around between servers using arbitrage to earn millions. </p>
<p>He would buy a bunch of cool stuff and give it to me as gifts. Best Dad ever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got to be careful with that. </p>
<p>There was a scam before where two guys would set up on different servers. </p>
<p>One guy saying &quot;Buying X for 10g&quot; and a guy on another server was selling X for 9g. </p>
<p>If you saw this you would think, hmm I can make that extra 1g just server jumping, cool. </p>
<p>So you go and buy x for 9g, but when you get to the guy buying for 10g, nah, he won't answer you. Then you realize you just massively overpaid for X, it normally buys/sells for around 4g. Now either you're stuck with X or you sell it for half of what you bought it for just to recoup your money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For derivatives markets (options, in particular), the pits are still useful because brokers can execute transactions as exotic packages. </p>
<p>For example, when you want to make a trade involving many contracts at various strike prices, on various expiration dates, if you try to do it electronically there is execution risk. In other words, even if you tried to make the trade as fast as possible, there is a chance you can’t get the exact price you see on the screen. This is because electronic algorithms are sensitive to the trading activity of contracts around them.</p>
<p>If you are trading in the pit, a broker can package these up and present them to the traders. Based on the value given by their models, good traders can figure out quickly whether there is enough edge to justify buying/selling and trying to arbitrage. Since it is entirely impractical/unfair (the fastest algo/richest company would always win) to do these packages electronically, there is still value in the pit for these kinds of transactions. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite the opposite actually. Routing a trade manually through the trading floor has the advantage of executing a trade through a specialist who has judgment. </p>
<p>However, it’s mostly obsolete, and the reality is the trading floors exist just for show. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pits allow very rapid price discovery and many simultaneous trades to occur long, long before computers.  Once computers were fast enough to out compete face-to-face trading, they mostly did.  </p></div>		</li>
