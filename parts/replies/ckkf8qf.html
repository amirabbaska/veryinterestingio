			<p>It means you will lose and gain back 10% of fat cells no matter how much you eat or exercise.<br><br>The 10% isn't the important part here, it's the fact that obesity doesn't change the renewal rate once you enter adulthood.<br><br>The study is saying that since fat cell growth is normal in obese adults, and since obese adults have more fat cells than normal, the only logical conclusion is that obese children must have higher than normal fat cell growth.<br><br>EDIT: I have no idea how rigorous the study actually was, but that is what the abstract is arguing. Also, a higher number of fat cells is correlated with obesity, but may not actually impact how easy it is to lose or keep off weight.</p>		</li>

			<p>thanks for the explanation. just to dumb it down a touch further so that I can wrap my head around it, does this mean that besides the 10% the die and grow back each year, you won't add cells by eating terribly? instead of adding cells, the existing ones would just grow larger? and then, conversely, it doesn't matter how much you exercise, the fat cells will grow smaller but not go away entirely?</p>		</li>

			<p>Adipocytes do not divide, they are differentiated from stem cells called MSCs.  They live for 7-10 years, then die off.<br><br>If you are extremely morbidly obese (&gt;50% bodyfat) you're adipocytes begin to malfunction due to size.  This releases hormones that triggers for MSCs to differentiate to adipocytes at a greater rate.  So adults can slowly increase the number of fat cells, yes.<br><br>The opposite has not been studied as far as I can find.  If a person who has an abnormally high number of adipocytes from being overfat through adolescence, does the body signal MSCs to differentiate to fat cells at a lower rate if they remain extremely lean?  It would be a very slow process, considering the old cells would have to die of old age, as the rate of new cells being created drops off due to some signal that adipocytes are too small to function properly.<br><br>I personally believe this to be the case, but you essentially need to be more than just 'healthy' weight to trigger this effect.  &lt;12% bodyfat pretty much year-round for 5+ years to reduce the number of adipocytes by any measurable amount.  So essentially the number is set in stone for all but the extreme cases on both sides.</p>		</li>

			<p>Liposuction. When you get liposuction, they're removing actual fat cells, lots and lots of them, and since they've left your body, they cannot refill.

			<p>There's a few different procedures with slightly different side effects and complications.  In general the problems are normal surgery problems - bruising, soreness, scars, pain as side-effects; risk of infections, allergies, incidental damage, etc as complications.  The only risks that aren't really global surgical risks AFAIK are accidental rupturings of organs while penetrating down to the fat cells; though again almost all surgeries have one or two unique risks to them.<br><br>That's not to say it doesn't have risks, just that the risks are pretty typical of surgery.  In general and out of pure speculation I imagine the frequency with which its safety is brought up is mostly just a function of (at least in the west, at least in most of america) society's general skepticism and wariness of cosmetic procedures done on &quot;normal people&quot; that aren't getting braces.</p>		</li>

			<p>Although there are good responses some people are misleading you.<br>Fat cells (called adipose cells) can be easily created in the body. Their job is to hold on to molecules that can be used for energy. When the body uses the cell for energy it pulls out those molecules into the blood and sends them on their way. The cell however remains, waiting to be refilled. The body typically never destroys the cell.<br><br>Fat people can gain their weight on quicker for a lot of reasons, one of the reasons being there are already storage cells (the adipose cells) to take on the excess energy.<br><br>Other reasons are typically hormonal, and I do not have full knowledge on them to teach it properly.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, the quantity of fat cells varies by individual. However, there is a heathy range that all normal people are in. It is incredibly rare and basically non-existent to have genetics make you fat due to quantity or size of fat cells, however certain people (ie- Filipinos) are going to be naturally stockier than others (ie- Nords).<br><br>The reason people struggle to lose weight is because when you gain weight, at first the <em>quantity</em> of fat cells is UNCHANGED. Instead, they simply grow larger. This is normal. Obese people go one step further. They grew so fat that the cells can't get any bigger, so the body makes NEW CELLS.<br>This is bad news...<br>Each fat cell has a <em>'target size'</em> they like to be. When you have a healthy amount of fat cells, you'll be a healthy weight. This isn't a 6-pack abs display, but it's a thin body shape that mostly depends on genetics. The whole calories in/out applies, but when your fat cells are smaller than their target weight, your <em>calories out</em> metabolism slows down. You enter a sort of starvation mode which means that your body is doing its best to retain energy via fat storage. This continues until fat cells regain their <em>target size</em>.<br><br>This is a huge problem, because if you're obese, you create a larger <em>quantity</em> of fat cells. Each one of these cells wants to be at that <em>target size</em>, so with all cells trying to be <em>target size</em>, you're guaranteed to be fat because that <em>target size</em> is multiplied by a higher <em>quantity</em> of cells.<br><br>Tl;DR<br><strong>How fat you are = (<em>Quantity</em> of fat cells)x(<em>Size</em> of fat cells)</strong><br>If the quantity grows (which is not natural), then to maintain the same weight you need to have each cell be smaller than they would naturally be.</p>		</li>

			<p>one way people have theorized to do this, with some evidence, is to eat foods heavy in MCT's - medium chain triglycerides - this is because they seem to stimulate your body to burn fat at the level of a larger triglyceride (a fat) but only requires slightly more energy to break down than a smaller lipid chain.

			<p>No; the lipase would have to go into the cells and proteins are usually too large to cross the cell membrane. However, there is a compound, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol" target="_blank">2,4-Dinitrophenol</a> that you can take that works in the way you're thinking (disclaimer: DO NOT do this; you'll die of hyperthermia).<br><br>How does it work? It removes one of the key steps in cellular energy production. It would be similar to adding sludge to a car engine; the engine would have to expend more energy (in the form of heat and increased fuel expenditure) to move the pistons. <br><br>For people versed in biology: It uncouples ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation by causing H+ ions to leak through the inner mitochondrial membrane destroying the proton gradient. ATP Synthase activity is greatly reduced and a ton of energy is lost as heat instead of ATP production.<br><br>Edit: Corrected 'glycolysis' to 'oxidative phosphorylation'. Although oxidative phosphorylation is the end result of glycolysis + the TCA cycle in aerobic conditions, 'glycolysis' refers to a separate chemical pathway.

ATP Synthase activity is greatly reduced and a ton of energy is lost as heat instead of ATP production.<br><br>I think you should change the word &quot;glycolysis&quot; to &quot;oxidative phosphorilation&quot; as &quot;glycolysis&quot; itself are sometimes referred to the Embden-Meyerhof Pathway alone.</p>		</li>

			<p>Biologist here... the answer is yes, but even in small doses DNP has unpredictable effects and is know to cause blindness and death.  The interesting thing is the death is caused by HYPERthermia, the opposite of freezing to death, but instad, overheating to death.<br><br>Theoretically, if you could take a very small controlled dose then you could keep this under control, but since the body's metabolism is a very complex pathway, you would have to completely control your body's behavior, meaning you are already straining yourself and pushing it to odd limits by taking DNP, thus a simple over-expenditure of behavior could then send cellular activity into overdrive, and this doesn't just have to be physical running, as there are other ways to expend your energy without realizing it, like with the eyes.<br><br>Also, there is the side-effect that you will likely still feel hungry, thus even with taking DNP, without sever self-control, the hunger pains induced by glycogen that would be produced when cell energy production is needed could cause you to overcompensate how you eat and completely negate any effect of DNP in the first place.<br><br>Furthermore, this effect can also cause a yellowing of the skin and a pungent smell to emanate from you which would make you less-desirable to even be around.<br><br>Overall, the cons outweigh the pros.  Technically it can work, but I mean, it is just very risky, and imo, not worth the risk or the side-effects.</p>		</li>

			<p>What about using it as emergency medication to survive short periods (but still longer than you would otherwise) in very cold environments?</p>		</li>

			<p>I mean, something like that might buy you minutes extra only. Raising your body temp 6+ degrees is not enough to really negate the effects of emergency extreme cold as to take a pill for it. I mean, if you are in a freezing cold situation that could kill you, boosting your body temp up to counteract the cold wouldn't do enough. Also, where you would first freeze is the extremities, not your core innards. It's not your arms and legs suffering hyperthermia or hypo that kills you, it's the damage to the vital area of the body. This drug may make you feel a little warm on the outside, but it won't save your life from extreme cold.</p>
<p>It's an interesting thought and I think that's cool you are thinking out of the box, but I don't see it as being practical.</p>		</li>

			<p>the risk would be too high due to it's inability to actually dose it properly. you're better off bundling up and loading up with Hot Hands, Toasty Toes, and food to stay work rather than an unstable injection </p>		</li>

			<p>One of the big things to add to this in the US is that DNP is capsuled by foreign labs, some of them fly by night guys who are buying in bulk and trying to turn a quick profit.  So when you buy a 100 mg capsule,  it could fluctuate anywhere from 0(fake)-125mg  in actual substance.     The same distributer doesn't guarantee the same lab/capsule filler.  So while the last time you may have been fine dosing at 2 capsules that were dosed low at say 82mg.   This time you get dosed high at 125mg and you've put considerably more into your system.   This is of course the risk with buying any substance in a black market type scenario.<br><br>The other big one is this trend of more is better that goes on here.   We've seen the people stroking out from overdosing on Ephedrine and other stimulant based fat burners.   These people are especially in danger when applying the more is better mentality here.  They get on the scale or they don't feel the symptoms right away.  They take more. Not realizing the long half life and cumulative effect of the substance.  And suddenly around day 3 when day 1 , 2 and 3 amounts are still mostly hanging active and they're over several grams of the substance cumulatively,  suddenly they find themselves in serious misery in the best case and dead in the worst.</p>		</li>

			<p>Very good point.  I live in Tucson, AZ, a mere 45 minute drive from the border to Mexico.  I know a lot of people that will go down there to get their prescription drugs as it is cheaper, but I remind them that these hole in the wall pharmacies of Mexico are not under the same scrutiny and regulations as in the US, so while they are probably ok buying from a legit doctor at a reliable pharmacy, there is no guarantee they are getting a pure substance or even the correct one.<br><br>There is a reason there are like 1 or 2 recommend pharmacists at the border town that seem reliable, but then half a dozen sketchy looking places that I'd be afraid to buy anything from.</p>		</li>

			<p>You wouldn't die unless you took something like 4-5 times the effective dose.  Granted this is a REALLY low ratio of LD50 to effective dose, which is why it's so dangerous.  Still, it has been used effectively for weight loss by many people, it's just that you'd have to be <em>extremely</em> careful with dosing it.  Even if just 1 in 1000 people overdosed on it, it's still too dangerous to use as a drug.  Not to mention, other drugs, especially alcohol, can interfere with your body's ability to cool itself.</p>		</li>

			<p>Lipase enzymes are inefficient and one of the rate limiting steps, but even if you did as you said it would also be inefficient because most lipids are in cells and the enzyme in the bloodstream would have no way to get into a cell.  To make things more complex, your fat stored as triglycerides in things called liposomes, and removing triglycerides from liposomes needs ANOTHER seperate, and also pretty inefficient enzyme.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Close.  The end products will actually be water and carbon dioxide.  The hydrogen atoms from the triglycerides have to go somewhere and they end up getting paired with oxygen to form water.</p>		</li>

			<p>And the oxygen atoms in carbon dioxide are not necessarily from atmospheric oxygen you breathe in either. The oxygen you breathe in, as you said, is reduced to form water. The oxygen atoms in carbon dioxide are from cellular water during oxidation, or from biomolecules themselves.</p>		</li>
