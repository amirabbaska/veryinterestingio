			<div class="markdown"><p>can you ELI5 what this means? does it mean that I gain / lose 10% of my fat cells each year depending on how much I eat / exercise?</p>
<p>is this why some fat people who get lean have a hard time staying lean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that doesn't really answer the intended question - if I add a lot of fat cells when I gain weight, do I maintain the same number of fat cells even after I lose weight?</p>
<p>This idea, that fat cells shrink but never reduce in number, is widely held but I have no idea if it is true or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This assertion is often repeated on the internet and on the street, alongside the assertion that fat cells are only created until a certain age, after which new fat is accumulated by the existing cells growing larger.</p>
<p>I'd love to see something authoritative about both of those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very basic nutritional concept that is present in nearly all nutritional textbooks. Literally 5 seconds on google shows <a href="http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&amp;ContentID=695" target="_blank">As triglycerides are stored within a cell, the <strong>fat blob inside the cell expands</strong>, increasing the cell's diameter. If enough fat cells in a body region enlarge this way, that part of the body begins to look fat.</a></p>
<p>The claim that new cells are only made until a certain age is basically a way of saying you grow until you stop. It's like saying we don't keep getting taller. You don't naturally get fat over time, it's that you're slowly gaining weight from a minor caloric imbalance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: NO
Since your cell membranes consist of a phospolipid billayer and would be broken down which, if a large enough dose is administered of a functional lipase will cause acute cellular lysis and a mild case of slow death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No; the lipase would have to go into the cells and proteins are usually too large to cross the cell membrane. However, there is a compound, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4-Dinitrophenol" target="_blank">2,4-Dinitrophenol</a> that you can take that works in the way you're thinking (disclaimer: DO NOT do this; you'll die of hyperthermia).</p>
<p>How does it work? It removes one of the key steps in cellular energy production. It would be similar to adding sludge to a car engine; the engine would have to expend more energy (in the form of heat and increased fuel expenditure) to move the pistons. </p>
<p>For people versed in biology: It uncouples ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation by causing H+ ions to leak through the inner mitochondrial membrane destroying the proton gradient. ATP Synthase activity is greatly reduced and a ton of energy is lost as heat instead of ATP production.</p>
<p>Edit: Corrected 'glycolysis' to 'oxidative phosphorylation'. Although oxidative phosphorylation is the end result of glycolysis + the TCA cycle in aerobic conditions, 'glycolysis' refers to a separate chemical pathway. Thanks to /u/Malleon for the heads-up on the possible confusion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you should change the word &quot;glycolysis&quot; to &quot;oxidative phosphorilation&quot; as &quot;glycolysis&quot; itself are sometimes referred to the Embden-Meyerhof Pathway alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close.  The end products will actually be water and carbon dioxide.  The hydrogen atoms from the triglycerides have to go somewhere and they end up getting paired with oxygen to form water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the oxygen atoms in carbon dioxide are not necessarily from atmospheric oxygen you breathe in either. The oxygen you breathe in, as you said, is reduced to form water. The oxygen atoms in carbon dioxide are from cellular water during oxidation, or from biomolecules themselves.</p></div>		</li>
