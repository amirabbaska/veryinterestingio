			<div class="markdown"><p><em>-ese</em> isn't specifically associated with Asia: Portuguese, Lebanese, Milanese, Bolognese, Viennese, etc. With the exception of the first, notice how the place names have an &quot;n&quot; in the last syllable, like China, Japan and Vietnam?</p>
<p>When there are different constructions available for a similar meaning, they tend to stick around based upon degree of analogy with other existent forms. If I told you about an alien planet named Splankon, your brain would naturally gravitate toward &quot;Splankonese&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mongolia and Korea both end in the /ee-ah/ sound, so in the easiest way to make a demonym out of it is to just add an “n”. How we make a demonym of a word mostly just depends on how it ends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about the Congo (Congolese) as this ends in a non-vowel as well. It's actually the reason I created this post was I was curiously reminded that Congo is not Congan or Congoan, but Congolese. Very interesting stuff that I don't believe has a general formula. You know, like Kansas vs Arkansas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>-inen does not mean a person, it's just a standard suffix for somebody from a place. Also, there are different rules for how exactly different suffices are applied. For example &quot;Venäjä&quot;-&gt;&quot;venäläinen&quot;, or &quot;Ruotsi&quot;-&gt;&quot;ruotsalainen&quot;. The &quot;rules&quot; come intuitively for native speakers, of course, but they are pretty hard to learn for foreigners.</p></div>		</li>
