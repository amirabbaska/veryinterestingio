			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back off this comment: the power grid has to produce the amount of power that is required at that exact moment in time.  So there's extra generation capacity that's not used all the, but instead, only when demand requires.</p>
<p>There's no full scale method to store excess power, so the right amount of power has to be generated moment to moment.  </p>
<p>They'll all turn at the same speed as they are all &quot;locked&quot; to the frequency of the electrical grid (60 or 50Hz).  An analogy for this is that they're all pulling on a weight on the same rope, or even pulling on the same team in a tug of war.   One team member can't pull faster than the rest of the team.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually really interesting, but the grid inherintly has a little bit of self regulation in it. Since transmission is in AC, there's an actual frequency running through the wiring that all generators have to sync with before they increase the energy output. If too much energy is present in the grid, it can increase the resistance in the generators and have them produce slightly less energy. Too much resistance or demand can cause problems, though, because equipment starts shutting down to prevent damages</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately it doesn't work for most renewable sources as they have to go through inverters. They either generate DC or AC at the wrong values. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlike thermal and hydro sources, I believe most wind turbines aren't synchronous with the grid - the optimum speed varies too much. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure they have an inverter at the bottom of each one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that - wind turbines can rotate the angle of their blades to change their power output. Sometimes they will be stopped this way as there is too much energy in the grid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3) There might also be <em>too much</em> wind, in which case some can be shut down for safety reasons.  Spinning too fast or fighting the wind to try and spin more slowly can both be very damaging on the turbine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And because i was interested and looked this up: they <em>can</em> build tougher turbines that cope with stronger wind but it makes them heavier and so less efficient for typical wind strengths, so they'd generate less power on average</p></div>		</li>
