			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, that's exactly it. I find this is particularly the case with sugar. The more you eat it the more you crave it, but you can also break that cycle if you cut back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what about more &quot;natural&quot; sugars like in fruit? Does the sugar in fruit make you crave the more refined and processed sugars?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree . I have for years limited my sugar intake, but would have sugar in my two cups of coffee, and often , like three cookies as a late dessert. Somehow for the last month I've just forgotten to buy the sugar, and couldn't find my cookie type ( chocolate , chocolate stripes with pecans.) so didn't have that. Sudden hard cravings were badly satisfied with, maybe, crackers. Now I don't miss the sweets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely true. I switched from eating sweets and chips 24/7 to only eating healthy in a matter of days, and after a week or two I already didn't crave for bad food anymore. It just doesn't seem tasty to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. Switched to a plant based diet, no dairy (as little as possible) and drink only water. Everything is sweeter, tastes better. It's kinda crazy to be honest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a million miles away from the science and totally into anecdote and speculation. But from what I've seen, going with less instead of none won't really change tastes that much. Most of the people I've known who tried to make drastic changes to what they eat only wound up getting over the urges after going cold turkey for 2 to 4 weeks or so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad's aorta exploded a few years ago and most of his internal organs quit working to some extent. During recovery he got C. Difficile which is pretty much the wrong kind of bacteria in his guts. One of the treatments was for me to poop in a bag and bring it to the hospital. They mixed it up so it was kinda runny and then gave my dad an enima with it in an effort to have healthy digestive bacteria reintroduced into his body. It was definitely weird but it worked eventually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude. I read an article a while back about a very fit personal trainer who decided that to better understand the struggles of his obese clients are going through to lose weight, he decided to gain a bunch of weight and then lose it again. In this article he described how his whole life he never really had to use willpower to not eat junk food and sweets because he just never really wanted them, but after gaining weight and then losing it again, he now has to deal with those cravings.</p>
<p>The info in this video completely supports his experience there - that's interesting.</p></div>		</li>
