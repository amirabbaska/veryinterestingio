			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't sure whether I heard this is my Neuroscience course, but doesn't the olfactory nerves run near the limbic system so sometimes smell are tied to memory? For example, if you smell apples, you may think back to the time you and grandma made apple pies together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smell is strongly associated with memory, but producing a mental representation* of smells is an uncommon occurrence.</p>
<p>Take your ability to remember your route to drive home from work/school. You can reproduce a mental image in your head of that route, how you get there, the way the car/bus looks, etc. This is necessary because mental representation of this visual imagery is important to your ability to get home.</p>
<p>Now try to imagine the way that your dinner tasted or smelled last night. It's far more difficult. Unless you are a chef, it is not ever really necessary to have a mental representation of a smell or taste. As a result, you rarely practice this ability, leading to the neural pathways associated with mental representation of smells or tastes being reduced or lost and it becoming difficult for you to achieve this.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the loss of these pathways occurs very early in our development -- likely before we are 3 years old, and very probably long before that. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never thought other people couldn't do this, but I totally can recall scents and tastes just by thinking about them.  Everybody can't do this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, are people not generally capable of recalling what foods they eat taste like or what body odor smells like? It seems fairly easy, yet at the same time, I have a habit of smelling things often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I was gonna say something roughly to this effect, so I'll just tag onto your post. We have a huge visual cortex in relation to the cortical areas devoted to other sensory information. Somatosensory and auditory cortex are also decently large. The olfactory and gustatory regions are significantly smaller and more primitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you maybe also know why I think I can remember smell as well as visual input? I think it's mainly my visual memory is not so strong, for example I cannot remember faces in detail - not even of people I am/was in love with unless I concentrate like crazy. And I guess faces are one of the most important visual inputs? </p>
<p>On the other hand I can remember the taste of, say, lemons, the smell of lavender, grass, my favorite book and so on. I don't often remember smells, but then again neither do I remember visual inputs very well. I think I have a sharp image but then I focus and it's not sharp at all. </p>
<p>I also have autism. Could this be related to memory working different? </p></div>		</li>
