<p>while the medicine itself doesn't affect the immune response, the effect of reducing symptoms does. </p>
<p>The reason the body reacts to the cold (symptoms) is to make the sick person to reduce activity so the immune system can function better (spending energy is contrary to recovery). By hiding the symptoms that feedback mechanism goes away and it take longer to fully recover.</p></div>		</li>
