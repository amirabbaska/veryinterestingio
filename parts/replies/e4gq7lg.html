			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the jets of energy coming from Black holes?  I’ve always wondered if this could account for the rotation observances in galaxies.  I don’t believe this energy is considered in the current models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes, even supermassive ones, only account for a small proportion of the mass of in the center of galaxies, and the jets only actually hold a small amount of mass or energy compared to the black holes. Anyway, adding more mass or any sort of attractive force to the center of a galaxy couldn't explain the rotation issue, as the anomaly isn't just one of magnitude but of the overall distribution of rotation rates; i.e., you need more mass distributed towards the edges of the galaxies to explain the rotation.</p></div>		</li>
