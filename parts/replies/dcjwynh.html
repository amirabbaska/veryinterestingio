<p>Who do you think lent all the money to the other european countries? german dutch and nordic banks. once they saw that they were not getting paid the called the government and Sanctions were imposed. So the german banks got their money back by making the people in the countries where they had lent the money to those banks pay back all the money.</p>

<p>Money was lent from all over the continent. The largest owner of greek debt for example were greek banks. There are also no sanctions on EU countries, just conditions for foreign money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The problem is that what was perfect for Germany was catastrophic for the peripheral nations. Those nations would naturally have had higher inflation, which would have helped lower wages with fewer layoffs and generally served as a buffer during the recovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>god no I am bitter about our politicians allowing it to happen. one of the biggest debts was with Anglo Irish Bank(anglo) the head of credit control was a good Friend of Brian Cowen who was minister for Finance and later  Prime Minister his party was Fianna Fail (FF) noted for having connections with the construction industry anglo began lending money to Construction Companies. There were reports and recommendations over many years that Anglo must diversify it portfolio of lending, these were ignored. Anglo was playing fast and loose with how it ran its business.  We are paying the bill for it now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet according to <a href="http://www.dbriskalert.org/2011/08/was-deutsche-bank-bailed-out/" target="_blank">dbriskalert.org</a> , Deutsche Bank got bailed out by the U.S. Federal Reserve. </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As one of the largest counterparties of failed insurer AIG, Deutsche Bank received $11.8 billion of the funds used to bail out AIG. [2]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Federal Reserve made emergency low-cost funds widely available to foreign as well as US member institutions through its discount window.  Deutsche Bank was the second heaviest user of such funds, borrowing more than $2 billion. [3]</p>
</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve also created a program known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility, which allowed banks to use their assets, including troubled or hard-to-value assets, as collateral for short term loans. Deutsche Bank was the largest user of the program, sending the Fed more than $290 billion worth of mortgage securities.[4]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Had it not been for the U.S. central bank, the world economy would have collapsed because the risk created by those fraudulent mortgage backed securities and the credit default swaps that backed them created a world wide network of risk that when contagion hit they would all fail because the risk was shared by all of them due to buying each other's risk.</p></div>		</li>
