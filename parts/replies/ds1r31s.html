			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say it depends on the school. My school for example just gets our boards and bricks from home depot. We use the common wood 12x12 inch and 1-inch thick for boards and stone slabs from the gardening area. I know other schools just use thin practice boards and such but it really depends.</p>
<p>As far as bricks are concerned, I know higher level black belts will use legitimate red bricks like the kind used for buildings in tournaments and stuff. The spacers do help, but that's basically the difference between trying break a 6-inch thick slab versus 3 2-inch thick slabs. It's what makes breaking multiple bricks/slabs possible to begin with.</p>
<p>As far as anyone doing it...You can very well break your hand trying it unless you have really good technique and form. I almost broke my hand breaking a single 1-inch thick board, and that was after 2 failed attempts to break it. So I would say it's possible, but unlikely for any random person to be able to do it with a little coaching.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same thing with the bricks and cinderblocks from the building materials department.</p>
<p>*Spent years managing each department for Lowes, while getting shit on by customers and eventually being terminated in the 2017 operational realignment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not from people hitting them. A lot break from dropping or being on the bottom of the stack, but if you drop a person into a concrete floor from 3 feet you get a concussion so it's not like that dropping is an insignificant force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, that is it. The commenter above got the &quot;domino effect&quot;, but it's not something that everyone can do. We also used actual red bricks when I used to train ages ago, but I never got to the bricks. The older and more advanced guys would practise one brick at a time, and then will move on to two once they can got last the single brick. It's definitely not a trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up around black belts and not once did they ever put up airs of impossibility. It was all about dedication to practice and every aspect of those martial art skills were looked at as something anyone could do with practice. </p>
<p>The way you describe it sounds disparaging. That's weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL those cinderblocks I broke we're just having stones.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Cinderblocks may be less dense than brick, but they are still plenty difficult to break. In my years, I have seen many a person fail to break them.</p>
<p>To answer OP, you really only need to break the first few, but make sure your force goes to the floor and not stop at the first brick. After that, the combined force of your bodyweight and the other bricks breaks the remainder.</p></div>		</li>
