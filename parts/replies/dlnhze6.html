			<div class="markdown"><p>To sleep, or not to sleep, that is the question:<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdote: when I talk in my sleep (which is often) it doesn't seem to be related to my dream. The talking is always angry and confused, as if the sliver of my brain that is aware of my surroundings while asleep is trying to communicate.</p>
<p>It's bloody weird.</p></div>		</li>
