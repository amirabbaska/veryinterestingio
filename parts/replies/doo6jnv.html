			<div class="markdown"><p>there is validity to this statement because if you look at how memory champions memorize insane amounts of data usually it is by tricking their mind into relying on spacial memory. the idea is that the easiest thing our mind can recall is places, real world spaces, hence the memory palace. personally, i found reading physical books being somewhat more effective, especially when it comes to remembering where i learned what. i remember how many pages roughly i was through the book, on what side, even the title. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>50 people does not make a large enough sample size for me to accept any conclusions about ability to retain information whether it be digital or not. How can you not remember any of those details yourself, how did you even pick the book you just select one at random? I read digital and listen to audiobooks and I know all of what you listed and plot points.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some people are like that. I have a friend who watches netflix series and anime just to kill time, and can't even remember the main plot points when I ask him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting that they mention that it could have something to do with &quot;pages accumulating on the left and getting thinner on the right&quot; referring to flipping physical pages. I could definitely see how a physical book could give a sort of skeletal outline as to where one would expect to find the rise, fall, climax, or conclusion to a story. That would make the whole reading material a bit more cohesive. I wonder if the same could be achieved digitally through a sort of timeline and marker, showing where you are in a virtual book. </p></div>		</li>
