			<div class="markdown"><p>That <em>is</em> interesting. Does that help explain the &quot;feed and breed&quot; part of the parasympathetic? Because, intuitively, I'd expect pupil constriction when someone is sexually stimulated, as the saying would imply an acetylcholine release.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always though of this as a mechanism to prevent having sex when you're not in a totally safe situation. And the sympathetic action, as far as I can remember, occurs relatively quickly right before orgasm.</p>
<p>But paradoxically there's also emotional bleed-through from being scared to being horny. I don't know how to reconcile all these things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The post was based on Aristotelian Teleology. Although such concepts are somewhat foreign in today's scientific circles, it has many explanatory resources not provided by views of the universe devoid of purpose. It had the secondary benefit to making people laugh. What a crime. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try and help, although the statement I know is geared towards a reference. Like they said you have your sympathetic (fight or flight) nervous system (NS) and your parasympathetic (rest and digest) NS. They work hand in hand until one needs to take charge. In this case your sympathetic NS takes over and hormones are released which will dilate your pupils. These hormones pertain to the sympathetic NS because whether you see a bear and you shit your pants, or you see someone you like and your heart starts racing, hormones such as norepinephrine and epinephrine are released causing side effects such as pupil dilation. </p></div>		</li>
