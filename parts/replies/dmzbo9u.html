			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking the top comment here because I am a little late to this party, and because this being the top comment shows the general public's lack of true understanding of the system.</p>
<p>This is literally my job, to manage international inter-company transactions for tax benefit for a Fortune 500 company. It is extremely rare that I get to use my specific knowledge of this on Reddit haha, but here goes. Hopefully I can help clear this picture up for you guys.</p>
<p>The field is called transfer pricing and my job is to do exactly what I stated above. I manage the inter-company pricing along the international supply chain, specifically for tax benefit, across our global operations, and it is nowhere near as simple as what this post says. For starters, the Netherlands IP box is not the big thing anymore. Mostly because laws like the one this guy stated where &quot;US law states you should pay tax in the country where the income was earned vs paying tax where the income originated&quot; don't exist anymore. Most countries around the world, with the exception of Brazil and to some degree India, follow transfer pricing regulations established by an unrelated entitye, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD. This organization suggests and reviews transfer pricing regs for all countries around the world, almost all of whom follow these regs and have adopted them as law.</p>
<p>This field is heavily regulated and is not as easy as slapping a royalty on some sales just to move a big chunk of profit to a tax-haven type country for many reasons. The first is that, in almost all royalty payment scenarios, there is this thing called withholding tax that the poster did not mention. This is when a portion of the royalty payment is withheld by the paying country's tax authority. They commonly range between 10%-20%. So, for example, if an entity in Country A pays a $100 royalty to an entity in Country B where Country A has a 10% withholding tax rate, Country B only receives $90, and $10 of tax is still paid to country A's tax authority. This is only one example of how countries get around the corps using royalties to shift profit. This same example also applies to interest, dividends, and even payments for software and specific services in a lot of countries. </p>
<p>The twist here comes with the actual countries, not the corps. Countries, in an effort to gain business in their jurisdictions, will sign treaties with other countries to basically play favorites with withholding tax rates. To continue to use the US/Netherlands example, typical royalty withholding tax from payments out of the US is 30%, but on royalty payments to the Netherlands it is 0%. So, if you guys want to be mad about the corps not paying this tax, do not get mad at the corps. We simply are following the laws the countries put in place, and even specifically signed a treaty around in this case.</p>
<p>Also, the actual pricing between related parties is heavily monitored. It is the basis for all of the transfer pricing laws that are in place, and is called the arm's length principle. This is the rule that any inter-company transaction that two related parties enter into has to have pricing agreed upon as if they were doing business as unrelated parties. You cannot simply agree to a royalty payment, software price, hardware price, etc that is insanely one sided and is specifically targeted at shifting profit to a low tax jurisdiction. Every multinational has to have tons of documentation in place for its major international inter-company transactions to show that they are arm's length in nature. During audits, if their transactions are found to not be arm's length, the company will be assessed tax, penalties, and interest just like any other traditional tax audit. Also, the more common occurrence for countries now is to have a list of countries/tax havens, that if you are doing any kind of business with these countries, it will immediately trigger an audit. So, the scrutiny on tax havens is higher than it ever has been before. Countries like the UK and Australia are leading this charge and, these two specifically, have actually taken an insanely extreme approach to this with their DPT/MAAL laws, but that is another conversation for another time.</p>
<p>The transfer pricing laws are more strict than they ever have been before also. The OECD recently led what is called the BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) initiative, which re-wrote the entire approach to transfer pricing, both from the documentation and execution from the companies' ends as well as the audit end for the countries' tax authorities. These recently just went into effect for fiscal years 2016 or 2017 for almost all countries around the world and have truly changed the game (for worse for the companies. Seriously, this new shit is actually insane with all of the new requirements on the corps' end).</p>
<p>Sorry, this is getting extremely long winded, but I am very passionate about the public understanding more about this because the general consensus is very, very inaccurate and leads to statements (like the comment I hijacked) becoming the top comment. Companies will almost always still end up paying their taxes. There is no way that we can simply get away with not doing that. To see what a corporation pays in taxes globally, I encourage you to look at the company's annual report, which is publicly released, and will include its Effective Tax Rate (ETR), which is the percentage of taxable income they actually paid in tax. Most American-based corps will be in the mid 20% range (24%-26%) ETR, which is nothing to get upset or excited about at all. If you think about it, the US has one of the highest corp tax rates in the world (35%), unless you are an oil company in the Middle East. So, for a multinational based in the US to pay about 25% globally, is pretty spot on. The key idea here is that you cannot take one small part, country, transaction, etc of a corp's global business and use it as an example to &quot;prove&quot; how they just don't pay taxes. That is simply just a lazy, incompetent approach to putting together an argument. The whole story tells the truth and the truth almost always is that the corps do pay. If we don't, then we get heavily punished, just like all of us people when we file our taxes.</p>
<p>TL;DR
Top comment is insanely incomplete in its view; completely illustrates the general public's lack of knowledge on this subject; Transfer Pricing is insanely cool and complex. You guys should check it out. Don't be mad at the corps for following the laws put in place; we do the same things when filling out our tax returns</p></div>		</li>

<p>I appreciate how informative this was, but I reject your assertion that we should be upset with the countries and not the corporations. The reason for this is that corporations create shell companies in these countries not in order to do business there, but to exploit the tax code. They make billions (or trillions), while enjoying the protections and security of operating within the US market, and pay zero tax because their IP was sold to a subsidiary which is nothing more than a mailbox in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>I mean, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3411183/The-building-tax-haven-20-000-firms-call-home-Cayman-Islands-companies-registered-inhabitants.html" target="_blank">there's a 5 story edifice in the Cayman Islands which is the official address for over 18,000 businesses.</a> It is obvious that these companies are not acting in good faith, and just because it's not illegal does not absolve them of shirking their civic responsibility to give back to the market which sustains them.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if I came off with that assertion. It wasn't my intention. The new beps rules will completely get rid of a lot of this. It is already starting to take place. the new rules focus more on substance rather than whatever legal agreement is in place, so that will (and already is) starting to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not trying to turn this into anything political. I'm just stating how it is. The reality is what it is, and you are not completely wrong about the lobbying. Not saying I support it or am against it, but more that it is what it is. If the rules change, the corps will adjust and find the next thing to move to. That's how it is and always will be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Get bent. Why are laws favorable to corporations ever in place? Because they lobbied for them and have more political leverage than the general public </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the flip side that the countries making these laws to bring the corps there bring a lot of jobs, economic stability, etc. Ireland is a perfect example of this. They lowered their corporate tax rate a couple decades ago and companies flocked there. The return they got is a ton of jobs, economic boost, and a very skilled labor force. I'm sorry you are mad that the laws are in favor of the corps, but the reality is that the corps will always find a way to work the laws in their favor. That's how it is and always will be. Not saying I agree or disagree with it, but it is what it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Netherlands royalties are exempt from all taxes except a flat sales tax.</p>
<p>As a result, our country is home to such wonderful Dutch companies as Apple, Google, Phillip &amp; Morris, Yahoo, and traditional Dutch musicians such as U2 and the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>A few years ago the Dutch branch of Starbucks even managed to balance their books in such a way that every shred of profit was written off as royalties paid over the recipe of their OWN coffee to a company in England. As a result they didn't pay a single dime in taxes.</p></div>		</li>
