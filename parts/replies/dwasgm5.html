I would guess that other long nose animals have similar markings. Like an ant eater, but more pronounced. I wonder if you could figure out that the trunk is prehensile if no elephants existed for comparison. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, most large animals have some adaptation for ground foraging and drinking at a watering hole. The elephant's short neck, long legs, and oddly shaped mouth might baffle scientists as to how it ate and drank, leading them to look for some kind of appendage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have an example of modern elephant skeleton that has these markings? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All skeletons have them. You need to know what you're looking for, but unfortunately I'm not knowledgeable enough to show you. What I can say is that in general, serving as origin and attachment points for muscle is one of the primary functions of bones. From the size of a bone, you can infer what sort of muscle it supports, and how much power it generates (it generally correlates with size) If you look at an elephant skull, you'll notice that the part corresponding to where the nose would go is absolutely massive. That suggests it supports a large muscular structure, which we know to be true.</p></div>		</li>
