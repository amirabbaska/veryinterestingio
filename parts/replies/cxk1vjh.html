			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of a story my old boss used to tell about when he was in high school. Apparently they had to make some sort of video project for a class, and one scene involved their group robbing a liquor store. So they went to a liquor store and told the manager their plan and that they would come back and put it back/pay for it all. Well, they filmed it, took the shit and ran. Never came back. Supposedly the cops were looking for them, it made the news and the teacher pieced it together after seeing the final film but kept his mouth shut. </p>
<p>Honestly probably a fake story but it was still funny to hear. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For something like that, I would assume they would require you to disclose which building in particular you were going to rob, and then they'd probably force you to make it a closed set </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you make the actual filming as legit as possible, then have paid actors steal the real cash, switch the bag with an identical bag of prop cash, then steal the bag from the set and vanish.</p>
<p>Sounds like an idea for tv show episode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need the permit to film things in public, you need it for all the other crap that a professional production entails. Like closing off the street, having a shitton of equipment out on the sidewalk, large trucks parked in otherwise not-legal places, etc. </p></div>		</li>

<p>TECHNICALLY You actually do in many places. In Los Angeles the cops will sometimes hassle you and shut you down if you look too professional. Apparently the dealbreaker is usually if you have a sound guy or lights. </p>
<p>But yeah, permits are needed and help especially if you want to shut down areas or park a ton of equipment somewhere.</p></div>		</li>
