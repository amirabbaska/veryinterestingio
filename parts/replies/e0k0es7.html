			<div class="markdown"><p>From a film perspective it not as exciting especially if you what a &quot;fun&quot; movie where the characters is heroic  and move and do something and succeed.</p>
<p>Most of the western front is relative static trenches so there is less opportunity to have a developing story. You can have a movie that show that war is hell like All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) but that is not the type of war movie that has been popular. </p>
<p>The eastern front is more mobile but war movies in the west are primary made where western nations  are involved look at WWII movies. There is the war in the middles east against the Ottomans and there you have
Lawrence of Arabia (1962) that is a late WWI moves and there Gallipoli (1981) that was most relevant to Australia and New Zeeland as it is a important part of they forming a separate identity.</p>
<p>So WWI is less exiting from a film perspective. There is also the problem that you don't have a great enemy. The Central Powers can not be painted as villans the same way as the Nazis in WWII. There is not a clear initiator of the war as in WWII and both sides are not that far apart from a moral standpoint and there was no atrocities on the same scale as WWII. The relative unknow Armenian Genocide is the only I know about. So you have more of a problem creating a simple story.</p>
<p>So when there are more opportunity for a cinematic story in WWII with a clear enemy, it is the more recent world war   it is not strange that WWII is more popular in movies.</p>
<p>A thing you should not forgot is that the US was not that involved in WWI and it is a huge movie market where most movies are made. So when most movies about WWII stars US forces for that large market WWI have a huge disadvantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is though that if you make a movie about it, practically all viewers have seen tons of airplanes and tanks before, it isn't novel to anyone. As those were also the first of its kind, they look rather ancient and unimpressive from our perspective (unless you can turn them into steampunk). Chemical warfare sounds special but in reality is just people in gas masks waiting for a special kind of fog to clear (or die a horrible, non-Hollywoodish death). Also the cultural impact was in fact limited, especially in the countries not involved in the war (and for those that were, it didn't bring much except a second war 2 decades later). Also don't forget things like the Soviet-Union and the rise of communism was mostly unrelated to the war and had more to do with shedding the elite and aristocracy, much like previous revolutions.</p>
<p>WW2 brought much more change in culture as a whole that many modernisms are classified as post- or pre-WW2. For example for the common man and woman to own a car and go on airplane flights regularly are clearly post-WW2 as that fueled both the car and airplane development and mass production capacity. Not to mention the rise of atomic weapons, ICBM's and the space race. I would gather those as certainly having the highest impact on culture and politics for decades, and that all started with the German rocket science and the Manhattan project during WW2.</p></div>		</li>
