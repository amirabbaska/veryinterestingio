			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to comment in support of your explanation.  Really nice example with galaxies and stars because that gets to the heart of the process without complicating with body tensile forces and rotation.  Earth-Moon gravitational attraction is different at different places on Earth.  Many people might start imagining the equatorial area of Earth facing the Moon vs. the other side.  But there is variation in distance from the moon everywhere, even the poles.  So to understand the tidal force, you just need to calculate the exact amount of the change in gravity acceleration from the Moon as you move some small distance on the Earth.  That's just taking a derivative: <a href="https://lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/scenario/Field_tidal.jpg" target="_blank">result</a>.</p>
<p>I really like the explanation on this guys website, and his angsty rants against old textbooks: <a href="https://lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/scenario/tides.htm" target="_blank">https://lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/scenario/tides.htm</a>
&quot;We shall argue that the &quot;tidal bulges&quot;, which are the focus of attention in many textbooks, are in fact not due to rotation, but are simply due to the combined gravitational fields of the earth and moon, and the fact that the gravittional field due to the moon has varying direction and strength over the volume of the earth.</p>
<p>These bulges distort the shape of the solid earth, and also distort the oceans.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
