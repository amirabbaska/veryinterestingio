			<div class="markdown"><p>Fruit has other nutrients, and has fiber which is good for your digestive system. Candy has little other nutritional value other than sugar and maybe fat. Simple sugars in candy are easy to break down in the stomach, so your body has access to a large amount of glucose very quickly. Your body can only use as much sugar at one time, and having the glucose in your blood vessels can result in damage to your blood vessels. Fibrous food is more work to digest, so you wonâ€™t have as much of a glucose rush. It also helps push the food through your digestive tract, and pooping regularly is good for you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically because fiber adds bulk, it slows down the absorption of nutrients (including sugars) so they are absorbed gradually.</p>
<p>Compared to candy, all the sugar is absorbed quickly and bam! Sugar rush.</p>
<p>It's been found that sudden peaks in blood glucose contributes in the development of type 2 diabetes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fruit also has more fructose and less glucose in it, which adds to the effect.  Fructose is non-insulogenic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need sugar to live. The issue is that you only need so much. </p>
<p>For example, a Reese's cup is about 20g, and 100 calories. You could eat 3 and not be full, but have eaten 15% of your calories for the day. </p>
<p>An apple also has about 100 calories, but weighs 10x more. It's that much more filling - try eating 3 at a time. So if you eat fresh fruit, chances are good you will struggle to eat too many calories, while you could easily eat too much chocolate. </p>
<p>EDIT math is hard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which part of that diet sounds good?  Or rather, which part of that diet wasn't a geographical neccesity?  You can subsist on it, not optimal by any means</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that's great if you're of 100% Inuit ancestry.  Which almost nobody reading this is.  </p>
<p>And it wouldn't be zero carb anyway.  Muscles and livers contain glycogen.  Modern meat does not, because it's not eaten immediately, and the glycogen turns into lactic acid.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are able to produce all the carbs they need from processing protein and fats.  Technically, even fiber is not needed.  However, many vegetables and fruits are excellent sources required vitamins and minerals, and hard to come by by purely animal sources.  Humans do need to ingest certain essential amino acids (protein) and essential fatty acids (oil and fats).  Vegetarians have to be careful about gettin the required amino acids, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_poisoning" target="_blank">lack of fatty acids</a> is bad too.  But a lack of carbohydrates?  Not an issue as long as you are getting your vitamins and minerals, amino acids, and fatty acids.</p>
<p>So while grains helped humanity create civilization, they are not required for a healthy diet.</p></div>		</li>
