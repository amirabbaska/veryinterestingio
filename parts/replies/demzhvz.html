			<div class="markdown"><p>The people who made the 1984 Transformers movie had the same issue with <del>George Orwell</del> Orson Welles his last role before he died). They had to heavily modify his voice and you can still hear that he sounds out of breath (he voiced Unicron) at times. He killed it the role, but you can tell it took a lot out of him </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was super confusing... but you mean Orson Welles. George Orwell wrote the book 1984 (nineteen eighty four) but died in 1950.</p>
<p>So mixing up George Orwell with 1984 and then with  Transformers movie made my mind go wild. The decepticons and big brother controlling the masses, and shit. :)</p></div>		</li>
