			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in private practice, and I can confirm this. My favorite is when you verify someone's benefits, the insurance pays you, and then insurance comes back almost a year later and says &quot;Oh wait, it looks like that person wasn't actually fully covered at that time, so now you owe us that $800 for your 10 hours of time back.  Don't worry, if you don't pay it we will just take it out of your future payments.  Oh, and we do this 'to ensure our members are getting the best service.'&quot;  As if they didn't know it's their member who is now going to get sent the bill (and probably not pay it).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to go to the ER and my mom had kicked me off her insurance without me knowing (I was 19). I had had an ovarian cyst the size of a cherry pit burst while I was at work (hurt like a motherfucker).
All they did was take an ultrasound of my uterus and took one vial of blood to make sure the burst wasn't bad enough to cause internal bleeding. They sent me three or four bills totaling about $5K!!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with you here. Because, somehow, you not having insurance means they get to charge you some ridiculously high amount and it's the insurance's fault. </p>
<p>I had a kidney stone a few years back and went to the ER. They put an iv in me and gave me morphine and a Rx. Took a MRI that was charged separately. My bill for all that was over 20k. Insurance kicked in and paid the hospital what their services were actually valued at. </p>
<p>The problem with healthcare is the providers. If they charged a reasonable amount, people could pay out of pocket and insurance would become obsolete. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spent some quality time one day shadowing  the chief administrator for a major US public hospital.  He points at the largest building on campus outside of the hospital itself, &quot;That is 30% of everyone's overhead right over there.  Literally, we could cut everyone's bill a minimum of 30% overnight, not including later cost reductions.  That is our billing office.  Several floors of people just to try and get payments for our hospital and coverage for our patients.&quot;. He went on to talk about how insurance carriers were increasing costs for a variety of reasons, and he wasn't happy about it, neither from a patient's nor a doctor's perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see patients whose insurance grants them approval on prior authorizations for 12k-100k medications with 2-24 months of refills. Then come back after 2 years and say they aren't paying for it anymore and leave the patient with a several hundred thousand dollar bill and us without payment. We get paid intermittently by the insurance company and not every month so we are usually able to collect at least a portion - half of it from the insurance company.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's more nuanced than just &quot;because insurance companies&quot;. Our healthcare system in The Netherlands was voted the best in the EU for years in a row and our system is almost exactly like Obamacare. </p>
<p>Here we have a mandatory insurance from private health insurance companies as well and like Obamacare there is no pre-existing condition. The basic insurance is between $100 to $200 p/month with a $400 deductible. Children under 18 are insured through their parents. The basic insurance covers medical care (GPs, specialists and obstetricians), hospital treatment, (most) medications, basic dental care and postnatal care. You can get additional insurance to cover other costs. You are also allowed to visit private clinics if you want better or specialized care but you'll have to pay (partly) yourself. </p>
<p>What is different compared to Obamacare? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Free market insurance. OMG CONSERVATIVES!</p>
</li>
<li>Regulated coverage. OMG LIBERALS!</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHeZJS4K6J0" target="_blank">Netherlands healthcare. What makes it work?</a></p>
<p>The other difference? Salaries in the medical and insurance industry. Here a doctor is paid well and easily upperclass. The same goes for insurers. But not the billionaire over the top salaries like in the US. </p>

<p>Oh no! I hear libertarians scream. How will those poor Dutch insurance companies survive? Also by paying CEOs millions instead of billions. <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JePDPq0YI_Y/VXdDfUm4KDI/AAAAAAABg_Y/Z6lw1TbLgds/s1600/statistic_id422459_largest-insurers-ranked-by-gross-written-premiums-in-europe-2012.png" target="_blank">That's how Dutch insurance companies became some of the biggest in the world.</a></p>
<p>Pffff, I hear Republicans scoff. You can't compare a teeny tiny country to the Great America. The Netherlands has a population of 17 million on an area the size of Maine. Even if a similar system doesn't scale (see the UK and Germany as proof that it does, but let's play devil's advocate) than you could divide the US is smaller pieces and implement multiple smaller systems. Let's call them exchanges. About 50 of them. OMG TRUMP SUPPORTERS! STATE RIGHTS!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Administrative costs are the highest by far in the US compared to any other countries: <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/in-the-literature/2014/sep/hospital-administrative-costs" target="_blank">http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/in-the-literature/2014/sep/hospital-administrative-costs</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>•Administrative costs accounted for 25 percent of hospital spending in the United States, more than twice the proportion seen in Canada and Scotland, which spent the least on administration. Administrative costs were notably higher in the Netherlands (20%) than in other European nation.</p>
<p>Hospital administration costs ranged from 1.43 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States ($667 per capita) to 0.41 percent of GDP ($158 per capita) in Canada</p>
<p>•In the U.S., the share of costs devoted to administration were higher in for-profit hospitals (27%) than in nonprofit (25%) or public (23%) hospitals. Teaching hospitals had lower-than-average administrative costs (24%), as did rural facilities</p>
<p>•U.S. hospital administrative costs rose from 23.5 percent of total hospital costs ($97.8 billion) in 2000 to 25.3 percent ($215.4 billion) in 2011. During that period, the hospital administration share of national gross domestic product (GDP) rose from 0.98 percent to 1.43 percent</p>
<p>•Reducing U.S. spending on a per capita basis to Canada’s level would have saved $158 billion in 2011</p>
<p>•There was no apparent link between higher administrative costs and better-quality care.</p>
