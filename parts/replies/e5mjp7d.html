<p>I'm curious as to what you mean by this as the only animals that are dinosaurs and not often considered as such is the Birds.</p>
<p>If aything I would say the opposite is true as animals such as Pterosaurs, Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Mosasaurs and Dimetrodon are often considered dinosaurs but aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much this, any extinct large terrestrial animal that existed 65 Million+ years ago is lumped in as a dinosaur even though most aren't. Dinosaurs have very specific criteria for their bone structures that classify them together.</p>
<p>One common misconception I like to point out is how many people assume Dimetrodons are actually dinosaurs when they actually have more in common with modern mammals (though it's believed they have no surviving descendants) and they went extinct 40 million years before dinosaurs even showed up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We tend to group things together which aren't actually related, in that &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; doesn't tend to just cover literal dinosaurs but encompasses a wide range of dinosaur-like animals such as Pterosaurs (which fly) and Ichthyosaurs (sea-dwellers). These aren't dinosaurs, but when folk say &quot;Dinosaur&quot; these creatures are also included something something while we're picking holes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh ok, yep i got the wrong end of the stick with your statement you were just pointing out that there are a lot of extinct animals other than dinosaurs which this thread also applies to. A good point to make</p></div>		</li>
