			<div class="markdown"><p>So does it matter what time you take the pill?</p>
<p>Not really, if you’re on the combined pill—but you do have to take it daily.</p>
<p>Since the pill relies on hormone levels, it is important to keep those levels as constant as possible, which means taking it consistently. However, if you’re like many women and take the pill at 9 AM one day and 8 PM the next, you’re actually okay, if you’re on combination pills.</p>
<p>“With combination birth-control pills, taking them at the exact time is not that important,” saysAlice Hill, an OBGYN in private practice in Los Angeles. “We tell people to take them at the same time just so they form the habit of doing it every day. But they are still protected as long as they take it daily.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to believe that because that's what I often do. But I think it's a case by case difference. I'm on Yaz and I noticed break through bleeding happening a week before im actually supoosed to get my &quot;period&quot; when I am not within 2ish hours. That implies to me that too much inconsistency for some people can make a difference.<br />
But that's just my story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same time every day is better for bleeding control, daily use (not time specific) is fine for contraception. As someone below said, this is for combined pills (the typical birth control pill).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I admittedly don't know much about each pill, is Yaz a combined pill? Obviously everybody will react differently, but I don't think because you're experiencing break through bleeding means the medicine won't be effective. But again, I'm not a Doctor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. With the combination pill, a 12 hr window is perfectly fine. With the mini-pill, you don't want more than +/- 1 hr, ideally, and definitely no more than 3. If you're more than 3 hours late, you're supposed to use backup protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the patient information leaflet of my pill clearly states that you have a 12-hour window to take your pill and still be protected. That's a blessing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah mine is the same way, it says if you miss a pill you'll be fine and you need to follow up with the pill right away, but you wont get pregnant. Even missing up to two days and taking the explained alternative dosage is fine. 6 yrs on it (with a break here and there for switching between insurances) and no issues. Only ONCE did I have premature bleeding.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For the same reason you should space your juice evenly: consistency of the buzz. Juice boxes too close together and your BJC goes above safe levels causing your date's stupid jokes to get funny. Juice Boxes too widely spaced results in your BJC dropping low enough to regret swiping right. So, taking your pill at the same time every day ensures that your anti-baby buzz remains at just the right level so you're best protected.</p>
