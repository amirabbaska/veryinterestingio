<p>on direct, a witness who will try to avoid helping the person calling them can be treated as hostile</p>

<p>In Canada, this also extends to witness that aren't necessarily trying to be unhelpful, but are just terrible at sticking to the point, getting confused by the open-ended questions, etc.. You can ask the judge for permission to treat them as hostile (although it's more polite to phrase it &quot;as if on cross&quot;). I assume the US is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's the same in the US, and pretty common to use &quot;as if on cross&quot; when dealing with someone who just <em>can't get to the damn point</em>, but is actually trying to help you.  If they're actually refusing to properly answer questions... then they're &quot;hostile&quot; :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>What if you're just a witness to a crime being interviewed and not considered a suspect? Is everyone basically considered a suspect until ruled out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Hostile&quot; is being used in a clinical sense.</p>
<p>In other words, it doesn't mean that they are a suspect in the crime or are a risk to get violent with anyone in the courtroom. In this context, it simply means that there's reason to suspect that they won't volunteer information or provide complete answers. This could happen for a multitude of reasons that have nothing to do with guilt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing. &quot;Hostile&quot; just means that it's reasonable to assume the suspect won't cooperate with the police; even innocent suspects will avoid saying things that might make them look guilty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Notice that it will only be used against you, but not for you (this is a byproduct of the way the rules of evidence work). The police are not your friend in this situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not exactly true.  Both sides have access to the same evidence.  Just because it is introduced by one party doesn't mean that it can't be used by the other side.</p>
<p>If you were to say something in your interview that was key to the defense, though I can't think of many situations where it would apply, perhaps you made a confession you want to retract and they have you on tape saying &quot;if I confess will you stop beating me? I'll sign anything you want just don't hit me&quot;. That can be used by your defense even though entered in evidence by the prosecution.</p>
<p>It's just very very rare you would say something key to your defense that you can't get on the stand and say again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is quite surprising how different the speech given in the US is to what we have in the UK which is as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You do not have to say anything. But, it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ours is far more neutral. In fairness though we generally have a different relationship with the police here. They follow the principles linked below in what we call policing by consent.</p>

<p>One of the biggest complaints about police in the UK is that we don't see enough of them out on the streets. Is that a complaint ever made in the US? Or do people only want to see them if they call the emergency services?</p></div>		</li>
