<p>Metal cutting tools need to withstand extreme temperatures (up to 1000ÂºC on the cutting edge) and loads (2+ GPa), so material integrity is extremely important. 3D printing is just not able to produce materials with integrity and consistency that equals existing production methods. Further, metal cutting tools often have very strict tolerances; a reamer for example might have a tolerance of +/- 1 micron on diameter; so as with any 3D printed part that requires precision fits, post-processing (often machining of some form) is required anyway.</p>
<p>Consistent, reliable metal cutting tooling is absolutely critical in high volume because entire lines shut down when a tool breaks unexpectedly, and in aerospace the tool might be machining a feature on a titanium forging that costs several hundred thousand dollars where a tool breaking could scrap the part.</p></div>		</li>
