			<div class="markdown"><p>So then do we know why some people are naturally more tolerant to these sorts of things than others? For example, when I had my wisdom teeth removed I was given a general anesthetic but the anesthesiologist had to increase the dose because it wasn't affecting me as well as it should have. In that sort of situation it wouldn't be because I had built up an immunity by using the anesthetic over a period of time, so what causes that sort of natural tolerance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad to see your comment get some traction. It looks like people are really prone to misunderstanding the genetic or developmental component, that there can also be a predetermined, individual physiological response that plays a significant role in what was referred to earlier broadly as &quot;homeostasis,&quot; something that's not separately psychological or physical, and it seems like that word physical itself is maybe confusing here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>maybe im weird or theres absolutely no connection.When i had my wisdom teeth pulled all it took was one shot to each side of my mouth for me to be numb as fuck, like you coulda drilled into my mouth and i wouldnt have felt a damn thing. The recovery though? shit i was good 6 hours later with nothing more than a minor twinge in my gums. Wasted 20 bucks on hydrocodone cause i wanted to have em incase that shit hurt like a sonofabitch. Doesnt anesthetic target your pain receptors though? like i figure the higher tolerance for pain the higher tolerance for anesthetic would be right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. The injections you received were most likely novocaine or lidocaine both which are local anesthetics that work by constricting blood vessels and blocking sodium channels which makes the area numb.  Hydrocodon is an opiate that blocks pain throughout your entire body by binding to your opioid receptors. Your opioid receptors are naturally bound by your body's endorphins or its natural painkillers. Opioids however are much much stronger than your endorphins and cause euphoria and other side effects. Got hydrocodon 5mg/325mg? Pop 3 of those and you'll feel pretty damn good. Other drugs that work the same as hydrocodon are oxycodon, morphine, heroin(diacetylmorphine), codeine and synthetic opioids like fentanyl, buprenorphine and methadone. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tolerance is also a psychological effect. </p>
<p>For example, if you're used to drinking every Friday night at the bar down the block, when you wake up on Friday morning and text your friends to make plans to meet up later in the night, and perform other cues that tell your body that you'll be drinking that night, your body begins to pre-adrenalize in preparation for alcohol consumption. </p>
<p>However, this sort of tolerance is based on recieving the cues that normally preceed drinking, so you might be able to down 4 drinks in two hours with &quot;no&quot; problem, but if you go to Bora Bora with your friends for Spring Break, you'll black out after drink number 3, because your body hasn't received the same cues, and therefore isn't ready to process all of the alcohol you drink. </p>
<p>Biologically, your body synthesizes these cool compounds that can detoxify the alcohol. Some people make more of this compound than others, so their natural biological tolerance is high. Men typically make more than women, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>So it's really an interplay between the biological (physical) and psychological (mental). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>huh i never thought of it like that but i have noticed it. I usually go out once a week on friday or saturday with my friends and i can take idk probly 5-6 beers and 3-4 shots or mixed drinks before im drunk. But if i have a random day off in the middle of the week with nothing to do and i wanna chill with a six pack and play a few video games i notice i get about as drunk. Never thought the anticipation made my body get prepared until i read this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think with heroin, it's less about tolerance and more about the variable quality of street heroin. </p>
<p>If you're used to shitty heroin, you're used to taking a dose that is X size. But one day you get great heroin. You don't know it, but it's twice as pure as the shitty heroin you had the day before. So you load up your regular X sized dose, without realizing that it has 2X potency. So you inject it, and you overdose, and you die. Not so much a tolerance issue as much as it is a sketchy-as-fuck supply issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, this happens because of receptor down regulation. Take alchohol, this is a gaba-a receptor agonist, meaning it excites this part of the brain (vs making it less prone to being excited). When you repeatedly excite a receptor, the body will down regulate it so that it normally exists in a less activated state. Essentially trying to counter the stimuli that you are causing to it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. And to add onto this even more,  ethanol (drinking alcohol) is indeed a GABA agonist,  which means it causes neurons to release more of it into the synapses (space between neurons). Benzodiazepines, such as Valium, Xanax, Klonopin, etc. are also GABA agonists.  </p>
<p>GABA is a neurotransmitter that INHIBITS neuronal activity throughout the brain.  So it lowers the activity in your prefrontal cortex, which inhibits cognitive function,  affects decision-making, lowers social inhibitions, etc. It also acts as a general CNS depressant...so enough of it will cause you to stop breathing, etc. </p>
<p>The description as tolerance being a result of receptor down-regulation is correct in this case.  The body tries to maintain homeostasis and after repeated exposure to alcohol and the brain being flooded with it and its GABA agonism, it begins to reduce the amount of receptors it can bind to on neurons.  So the same amount of alcohol that once got one drunk only results in a smaller number of binding sites being occupied, and subsequently less GABA is released. So, more alcohol is required to achieve the same effect. </p>
<p>When drinking is stopped, the brain is no longer releasing the same amount of GABA as it is used to...indeed even LESS than normal/before drinking started. So, with the brain lacking this normal,  functional amount of GABA, withdrawal occurs and the brain's neurons are more excitable,  resulting in insomnia,  anxiety,  and even seizures (which can be fatal). This is in part why benzos, which stimulate GABA release,  will stop seizures. Ativan and Versed (lorazepam and midazolam, respectively) are commonly used,  at least here in the US.  by EMTs and Emergency Departments in patients having seizures.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So from my understanding, tolerance and withdrawl symptoms are not due to real, mechanical damage in your body as a result of the substance, but rather your body's reaction of adjusting your natural flow of neurotransmitters to meet the conditions brought on by whatever substance you're taking.</p>
<p>Is there any way to inhibit this process so that one would not grow tolerant, or at the very least to speed the overall cycle of returning your body's neurotransmitter production back to normal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had problems with alcohol in the past and it's hard to describe the physical and mental hell of alcohol withdrawal. I know heroin withdrawal is no picnic but it seems like that is much more well known in the popular culture. </p>
<p>Best way I can put it is that your body and mind is screaming at you for another drink to stop the pain and that's how the cycle starts all over again. It's disgusting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there evidence to suggest that the body's &quot;chosen homeostasis&quot; for certain neurotransmitters like gaba, dopamine, adenosine, etc. is directly relates to the corresponding cells current needs, or rather it is just a safe guess the system has evolved that is good enough? Like, if you were to magically have your brain cells repaired/supplied 100% of the time, would your body ever prompt the release or regulation of adenosine or melatonin, or would you just feel awake and refreshed forever? </p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to get at, is that I want to know if frequently using substances that affect your neurotransmitters necessarily implies you are putting your brain cells at some level of risk, or if given the right conditions, your body would be perfectly ok having an above average presence of certain neurotransmitters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that the body's standard for wellbeing is genetically determined. So your body probably judges what is normal for your body from a baseline that's determined by your DNA. </p>
<p>If you were to overexcite those neurons, your genetics may attempt to downregulate them to achieve a natural level. </p>
<p>I'm not a doctor, by the way. Just an educated guess. </p>
<p>And also sleep is kinda weird.  It's not just used to repair/replenish. Sleep updates and reconfigures the brain. You could never just go without it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body has this fantastic way of changing itself to suit the normal it is used to, so it begins to function differently based on what it is constantly exposed to. However, if the normal is too taxing, the body depletes its resources quicker and then something has to make up the difference or else it will fail.  </p>
<p>One good way to look at this phenomenon is to look at people in high altitudes with oxygen use. Higher elevations have less oxygen in the air, so the body begins absorbing and using oxygen more efficiently as a means of survival. Their lungs change and their body has to use the oxygen it has differently. Take these people to lower altitudes and eventually the body will readjust to what it needs to survive, and vice versa. This works pretty similarly to how neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine work in the brain/body, as long as you don't go too far in either direction. Then you end up with issues like Schizophrenia and Parkinsons, because there is a certain level that you must stay in for the body to function and buffer its way into something that resembles life. The buffering system has limits, but those limits can be pushed fairly significantly sometimes. The human body is an amazing piece of work with some crazy evolutional traits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the neurotransmitters are above average for too long it will become the new zero-baseline though, as the post above explained. So if you use those substances for a high, you might need more to achieve the same effect.<br />
This is also dependent on what kind stimuli you're receiving though, and what kind of neurotransmitters are affected.</p></div>		</li>
