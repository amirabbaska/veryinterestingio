<blockquote>
<p>What is your viewing angle for an infinite plane? Well, go back to the picture of Earth. Can the viewing angle be any positive angle? Nope. If you look exactly parallel to the plane, then your line of sight does not end on the plane. But as soon as you look down at even the slightest angle, your line of sight meets the plane. So your viewing angle on an infinite plane is always 0 degrees, no matter how high your vantage point is. So if Earth were an infinite flat plane, for instance, the horizon would be pretty much exactly in the same place where it is now (at least for low vantage points). The angle 0.043 degrees is imperceptibly close to 0.</p>

<p>It's fine to like your own explanation or find it easier, but saying that &quot;the answer does not need to be at all as complicated&quot; as mine is a bit of stretch.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I pulled out that bit. It wasn't relevant anyway!</p></div>		</li>
