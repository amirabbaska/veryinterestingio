			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: it affects every part of the immune response both innate and acquired.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3887500/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3887500/</a></p>
<p>Long answer, it damages epithelial barriers hindering the innate structural defenses in the GI tract by damaging the tight junctions between cells which create a water-tight barrier preventing contents in the lumen from entering interstitial space. It depletes glutathione which prevents it from mitigating oxidative stress leading to death of cells in the lungs.</p>
<p>It inhibits the action of phagocytes like neutrophils and macrophages by inhibiting the enzymes they use to consume bacteria and other foreign material which prevents them from controlling the population of pathogens before they can grow to sufficient numbers and create illness. It also inhibits production of neutrophils and other granulocytes at every stage of granulopoiesis.</p>
<p>It inhibits the growth of natural killer cells (cells that are responsible for apoptosis in cancerous tissue and infections that enter into your cells).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a more macroscopic level it thins your blood and alters the kidney's function by acting as a diuretic, which can get rid of key minerals. So hypovolemic states. </p>
<p>It can also increase blood sugar, increase lactic acid (metabolic acidosis), etc. Less nutrients is never a good thing for a patient trying to fight off infection.</p>
<p>An interesting study showed it can cause changes in the contraction force of cardiac muscle cells and higher concentrations can affect the electrical signaling of the heart. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that happening while in the form of ethanol or acetaldehyde? I had always learned that the latter was more reactive and therefore more damaging. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps it's due to reduced NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) being produced from alcohol metabolism. Oxidized NAD is a pretty important coenzyme. One of the reason why you shouldn't consume alcohol after a very very strenuous physical activity is due to lactic acid buildup.</p></div>		</li>
