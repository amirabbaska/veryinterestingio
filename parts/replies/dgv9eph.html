			<div class="markdown"><p>Does alcohol neutralize the properties of ethylene glycol that gives it such a high boiling point and low freezing point? I'm just wondering if it would be possible to create an antifreeze that's just as effective, but less toxic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there were it would have been done already, antifreeze is one of those chemicals so many people are uncomfortable dealing with it would have been replaced by now.</p>
<p>In the presence of ethyl alcohol your body works on breaking it down first and you just urinate the ethylene glycol. Without the ethyl alcohol your body works on the ethylene glycol and in the process produces by products that destroy your kidneys.</p></div>		</li>
