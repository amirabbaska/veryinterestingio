			<div class="markdown"><p>Voyager passed through the heliopause - where the sun's solar winds meet the interstellar medium. However, the Oort cloud (consisting of objects orbiting the sun) may extend as far as two light years out. To put it in comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earth: 1 AU  </li>
<li>Uranus: ~19 AU  </li>
<li>Pluto: ~40 AU  </li>
<li>Eris: ~68 AU</li>
<li>Heliopause: ~100 AU</li>
<li>Voyager 2: ~110 AU  </li>
<li>Voyager 1: ~134 AU  </li>
<li>Planet IX: ~400 AU  </li>
<li>Outside limit of Oort Cloud: ~100,000 to ~125,000 AU</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically that's the distance away the sun can still hold onto the material. It is also far enough away that the gravity of passing stars can dislodge some of the material and send it back into the inner solar system. Most of the material most likely originated from the inner solar system and was ejected out to the Oort cloud by the big gas giants and the sun.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To put this into perspective, that is about half the distance to the next closest star. If the 2 light years hypothesis is correct, and if the next star wasn't so much smaller than our sun, it wouldn't be shocking to find out that the two occasionally exchanged material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, at least as far as gravity is concerned. All other aspects of being inside our solar system would be left behind long, long, long before you got to the limits of the Sun's gravity being strong enough for objects to orbit it. Of course, once you're that far out, it takes very little to nudge something out of orbit and have it leave our solar system forever. As another person pointed it, it also means that we could be trading objects with other nearby stars on a semi-regular basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are various definitions of where the solar system &quot;ends&quot;. Voyager has passed out of the areas defined by some of those definitions, but is still in the solar system by other definitions. In this case, this new planet is outside the solar system for a number of definitions, but is still inside the solar system in the &quot;things that orbit the sun&quot; definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voyager has left our solar system by several definitions, but the most common definition - the outermost planetary orbit - is now much further than we thought it was (assuming planet Doris Pringle-Brule is confirmed). It won't pass this 'new' outermost orbit for another 74 years. </p></div>		</li>
