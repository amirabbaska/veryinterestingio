			<div class="markdown"><p>Could calculate that by knowing how many light seconds it takes light to travel the distance from centre of the sun to the surface. </p>
<p>A quick calculation is... </p>
<p>from the outer edge of the sun that you could see is 2.15 million km further away than the equator pointing towards you. So basically measuring half of the sun. </p>
<p>Light travels 300,000km a second. </p>
<p>2,150,000 / 300,000 is 7.1</p>
<p>Light from the edge of the sun travelling to your eye is roughly 7 seconds older than the equator closest to you. </p>
<p>Interesting. </p>
<p>Edit I'm wrong. Alright, I'm wrong. Einstein was wrong too sometimes... probably. Haha </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um... The closest point of the Sun and the edge of the Sun only differ by the radius of the Sun, which is only 695,000km, not 2.15 million km.  That difference is only 2.3 seconds, not 7.1 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The distance between earth and close point of sun and distance between earth and side point of sun does not differ by the radius exactly because of trig, if you want to be precise lol. First distance is 1AU-R, second distance is sqrt((1AU)^2 + R^2 ). Since 1AU&gt;R this doesn't change by much, but if we're on the topic I might as well pitch in :P   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's too much. The solar radius is only 700Mm. Should be a 2 to 3 seconds difference.</p>
<p>I only know this because of my work on <a href="http://eolasun.info" target="_blank">a solar system model</a>.</p>
<p>This should have worked, but didn't. <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?q=sun+radius+in+light+seconds" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/webhp?q=sun+radius+in+light+seconds</a></p>
<p>This did. Yay Wolfram Alpha. <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sun%27s+radius+in+light-seconds" target="_blank">https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sun%27s+radius+in+light-seconds</a></p></div>		</li>
