<p>In case the buyer no longer able to pay the installment, in this example the house, is then sold to a third party by the bank,
the bank then returns the amount already paid by the buyer to him/her and collect the rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding some historical context here; Ancient loans could often have an interest rate over 200% or worse. In fact some loans were even designed to permanently trap debtors in debt and turn them into virtual slaves. Those religious prohibitions were meant to stop such slavery traps.  </p>
<p>In modern society we have laws and regulations limiting the amount of interest that can be charged. They essentially do the same thing as Islamic religion preventing late fines/fees; prevent people from getting trapped in debt traps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Islamic institutions in malaysia have what they call Ta'widh and Gharamah.</p>
<p>Ta'widh is a compensation to the lender, for the loss they incur because of the late payment. The rate is calculated using the overnight islamic money market.</p>
<p>Gharamah is penalty for late payment. This is allowed. However, if im not mistaken, the lender is not entitled to the money,  as the proceeds are to be given to charity.</p>
<p>Im not an expert, so I could be wrong. Im just a lawyer and had to do some research on this in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, Islam sees risk as a natural component of commercial transactions.</p>
<p>So, the bank and the buyer are encouraged in the Quran and Sunna to take their responsibilities to mitigate the risks involved.</p>
<p>So, Islamic banks have stricter rules and have fairly bigger margins to mitigate the risk. They also share information more efficiently between them.</p>
<p>Edit 1: just so you know, Islam sees money as a transaction facilitator and not as a comodity, since it has no &quot;real&quot; value of its own. In this regard, money can not generate profit (interest).</p>
<p>Edit 2: corrected typing errors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's sort of the point in the since it's a risk for both party involved. The ultimate rule is you can't make money on money. Having more money over one person and charging interest is considered a form of oppression because more often it is taking advantage of someone that's in need of cash.</p>
<p>So it's more of Bank taking a risk in &quot;investing&quot; on a customer per say. If anyone is interested I can edit or post a comment explaining how islamic banking works when it comes to &quot;loan for a business&quot; </p></div>		</li>

<p>I have one of these loans. The fee is $50 per missed payment, flat. Doesn't matter if I owe  a million dollars or 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But my bank owns my house until I pay for it in full. If I stop paying they come and repossess it, sell it, and take the money they need.</p>
<p>So isn't the Islamic bank doing exactly the same as what the other banks are doing?</p>
<p>They are making money off <em>my</em> transaction between the buyer and seller in parts rather than all at once. They might say they are not charging interest, but in reality, that's exactly what it is.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sharia mortgages work a bit differently in the sense that the mortgage isn't seen as &quot;debt with interest&quot; but as an interesting agreement. Say you wanted to buy a house worth a million dollars.</p>
<p>The sharia bank fronts up the million and then you have to pay off the million with a <em>fixed</em> flat amount on top (e.g. 1.2 million... though this would be a ludicrously low amount) to be paid in agreed instalments before the house is yours. As you pay off the sharia bank your &quot;share&quot; in your house increases. Once you've paid 600k, the house is 50% yours. At the beginning it's 100% the bank's. So unlike mainstream mortgages, where the bank &quot;owns&quot; your house until you pay it in full, ownership gradually transfers to the borrower over the course of the sharia mortgage.</p>
<p>One of the largest differences between Sharia and mainstream mortgages is what happens in the case of default. In the case of mainstream mortgages, the bank flogs off the property with the sole aim of recovering the debt. But in the case of a default in Sharia mortgages, the bank gets whatever its share of the sale is at the time of default. For example if you defaulted after paying off half your loan, the bank would take half the sale. This provides an incentive for the banks to get the best price possible instead of holding a fire sale as is done in the West.</p>
<p>Note that this is just one type of Sharia mortgage, but its the one I've heard the most about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is little difference in reality between a traditional mortgage and what you describe as a sharia mortgage.</p>
<p>The &quot;fixed flat amount&quot; is interest, no matter which way one chooses to describe it. My personal mortgage has a fixed rate, so I have a fixed amount I will pay, unless I reduce it by paying ahead.</p>
<p>In mainstream mortgages, the bank never &quot;owns&quot; (scare quotes and all) your house at all. You are the sole owner of your house from day 1. All the bank has is a lien. It takes court action to enforce that lien and force a sale. And if the house is foreclosed and sold and it brings more than you owe, you get the balance.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it's just a way for banks to charge interest while pretending they aren't charging interest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I understand what you mean, but if I buy a house for 1 million and I borrow money from the 'traditional' bank we will agree on a 1 million loan+interest.</p>
<p>Given a calculator, I can work out exactly how much the house would cost, (say 1.2 million using your example).</p>
<p>So both banks are effectively doing the same.</p>
<p>Also, if I default on my house, they will take it and take a 'buy-out' amount to settle the loan. They won't take the full amount.</p>
<p>Here, they will just auction it for what they need, and if you get more than what they need, they give you the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, it's essentially collecting interest but doing so in a roundabout way to avoid saying that it is collecting interest so as to comply with religious requirements.</p>
<p>It's like the Orthodox Jews who aren't allowed to use technology on Saturday (or Sunday? I forget), so elevators are programmed to stop at every floor automatically, so that Jews can take the elevator without having pushed a button and so are technically not 'using' technology.</p>
<p>People tend to get creative when their religious doctrines clash with the convenience of modern life, I guess...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>at the hotel I work at orthodox jews will sometimes ask us to &quot;disconnect&quot; or &quot;remove&quot; certain aspects of technology. This is a problem because it's a &quot;technology hotel&quot; where <strong>everything</strong> is automated: the lights, the drapes, the doors, the TV, the HVAC. </p>
<p>So what these guys do is they'll ask me to disconnect only the stuff they can live without for one day (<em>do the lights in the hallway, and the bathroom, and make the HVAC just cool the whole time</em>) but have me keep the more convenient stuff (<em>leave the bedside lamps and the TV</em>) on because it's hard not being sacrilegious I guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is incorrect. You own your home. Your bank retains a &quot;security&quot; which allows them to take ownership, if you fail to keep up with payments of the loan. Until they push the button and use their security, the bank don't own the house, they own the debt (the right to have you pay them). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference at a high level is the how profit versus interest is defined. Profit is ok in Islam and interest isn't. If I lend someone money and then ask for an additional amount in return, it is classified as interest.
However, if I buy something then I can sell it for more and the earnings will be halal. Here the bank is supposed to buy the house and then sell it to the home buyer for an additional profit.
Personally I think not taking part in transactions that deal with interest helps a lot. You only buy things you can afford, don't rack up interest on credit cards(buy only if it can payed in full every month). </p></div>		</li>
