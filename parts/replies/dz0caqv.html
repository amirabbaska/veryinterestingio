<p>In all likelihood that blurb of legalese doesn't actually do anything. . . . . The reason its showed at the start of the intro for South Park, rather than in the credits, is as a joke.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, the &quot;disclaimer&quot; used by South Park is pretty tongue-in-cheek,
and for that reason is probably worth even less than a &quot;standard&quot; disclaimer, which is not very much to begin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, it's probably worth more. One of South Parks most powerful weapons when they are sued (because they have been) is their history of parody &amp; satire. One of the main criteria for determining if something is satire (and therefore cannot be defamation) is whether a reasonable person would recognize it as satire. South Park's history and attitude plays into that. So having a ridiculous disclaimer on the show is one more bit of supporting material.</p></div>		</li>
