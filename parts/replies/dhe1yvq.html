			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't really call it minimum wealth since you also need to account for the liabilities the person holds, which if I were to guess wouldn't be in the public record. I guess you could see if this actually affects it if there is any info on the average leverage ratio for individuals though. Yo penises tho</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about a very small handful of people. Most rich individuals don't own more than 5% of any major publicly traded company. Institutions, mutual funds, pension funds, etc. do.</p>
<p>And all the &quot;celebrity net worth&quot; websites are pure bullshit.</p></div>		</li>
