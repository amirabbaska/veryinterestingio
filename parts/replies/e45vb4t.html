			<div class="markdown"><p>Something you may or may not know is that Downs Syndrome comes with a host of medical complications that lead to early death a high percentage of the time. By which I mean early childhood. If you meet someone with it on the street, they are a lucky survivor and in the minority.</p>
<p>This touches on /u/ColanSA's points 1 and 2. Many parts of the world are less able to help patients past these hurdles... or in some cases don't care to put in the effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also another reason maybe is for example in Australia, it's a test pregnant women can take and check if their unborn baby has the condition.   Nearing 100% abort rates for it in Australia. </p>
<p>*Another reason abortions are a good idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can test for Down syndrome in the US too.  Most women I know elected to not test.  The one person I know that did test ended up testing positive. Kid was born healthy and happy with Trisomy 21.</p>
<p>We didn't test for either of our kids.  We decided we'd keep them no matter what.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The ultrasound based test has such low accuracy, it's barely scientific.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/downsyndrome/data.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/downsyndrome/data.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/downsyndrome/data.html</a></a> is a good link and a good look as to why developed countries will have more down syndrome babies. The simple answer is, down syndrome babies are high risk of dying at birth. A very high risk of heart defects, stuff like that. Also an answer as to why there were less down syndrome babies in the past. </p></div>		</li>
