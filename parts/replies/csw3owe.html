<p>This Economist article does a great job explaining things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God bless you, The Economist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CHINA is certainly not the first country to try to prop up a falling stockmarket. The central banks of America, Europe and Japan have all shown form in buying shares after crashes and cutting interest rates to cheer up bloodied investors. But the circumstances and the manner of China’s intervention of the past ten days make it an outlier, worryingly so.</p>
<p>The trigger in China’s case is perplexing. Yes, the stockmarket is down a third over the past month, but that has simply taken it back to March levels; it is still up 80% over the last year. Growth, though slowing, has stabilised recently. Other asset markets are performing well. Property, long in the doldrums, is turning up. Money-market rates are low and steady, suggesting calm in the banking sector. The anticipated correction of over-valued stocks hardly seems cause for much anguish.</p>
<p>Lost in all the drama about the stockmarket is that it still plays a surprisingly small role in China. The free-float value of Chinese markets—the amount available for trading—is just about a third of GDP, compared with more than 100% in developed economies. Less than 15% of household financial assets are invested in the stockmarket: which is why soaring shares did little to boost consumption and crashing prices will do little to hurt it. Many stocks were bought on debt, and the unwinding of these loans helps explain why the government has been unable to stop the rout. But this financing is not a systemic risk; it is just about 1.5% of total assets in the banking system.</p>
<p>If economic stability is not in peril, why then the panic? <strong>The most compelling explanation is politics. The government has staked much credibility and prestige on the stockmarket.</strong> When the going was still good, the official press was chock-a-block with articles about how the rally reflected the economic reforms that Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, was set to push. Li Keqiang, the premier, said repeatedly that he wanted equity markets to provide a bigger share of corporate financing—comments, from punters' perspective, not unlike waving a red cape in front of a bull. The sudden end to the rally is the first major dent in the public standing of the Xi-Li team. The botched attempts to stabilise the market only make them look weaker, giving succour to their critics.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New article updated for today's crash:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The plunge of nearly one third over the past four weeks has left the dream in tatters. Although the market is still up by 75% over the past year, many mom-and-pop investors were late to the party. Less than a fifth of respondents to a large online survey by Sina, a web portal, reported making any money off stocks this year.</p>
<p>For the government, the fall is damaging. Officials are seen to have promised the population a bull market, only to lure them into a bear trap. A flourishing of gallows humour in mobile-phone chat groups captures the sentiment. “Friends, don’t run, we’re here to save you,” cry the valiant soldiers in one joke, representing the state coming to the aid of the beleaguered market. Their refrain soon turns to, “Friends, don’t run, or we’ll shoot you.”</p>
<p>The warning signs had been flashing for some time. ChiNext, a board for high-growth companies, reached a price-to-earnings multiple of more than 150 at its height in early June, in the same region as American tech stocks during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. When share prices started falling, many assumed that regulators would stay on the sidelines and let the necessary correction unfold. But they lost their nerve after the market fell nearly 20% and negative headlines started to pile up, even in the domestic press.</p>
<p>Attempts to steady the market have been frantic and futile. Interest-rates have been cut; short-selling capped; IPOs halted; share-buying schemes, backed by central-bank cash, hatched. “We have the conditions, the ability and the confidence to preserve stockmarket stability,” blared the People’s Daily. Still the rout has continued.</p>
<p>The CSI 300, an index of China’s biggest-listed companies, fell 18% in the eight trading days after the rate cut. Some $3.5 trillion was erased from China’s stockmarkets, more than the entire value of all listed firms in India. By the end of July 7th trading in over 90% of Chinese stocks had been suspended, either at the request of the firms concerned, or because they had tumbled by the daily limit of 10%. “The government won’t let us take our money out of the market, and we don’t have the confidence to put any more into it,” said Wei Xinguo, a chef at a noodle restaurant in Shanghai and one of the country’s 90m stockmarket investors.</p>
<p>The sharpness of the slide has raised worries that Chinese growth itself is about to fall off a cliff. Mercifully, the stockmarket appears to be as disconnected from economic fundamentals on the way down as it was on the way up. At the same time as shares nearly tripled from the middle of 2014 until early June, China slouched to its slowest year of growth in more than two decades. In the past couple of months, the economy has actually started to improve. A burst of fiscal spending on infrastructure looks to have stabilised the industrial sector, while property prices, long in the doldrums, have started to tick up again.</p>
<p>The stockmarket is still just a small part of the Chinese economy. The value of freely floating shares is about 40% of GDP, compared with more than 100% in most rich countries. Stocks account for just 15% of household assets, so their slump should have a limited impact on consumption. The systemic consequences of the margin debt are also limited. The funding has come from brokers, not banks, and equates to less than 1.5% of total bank assets.</p>
<p>There will undoubtedly be some spillover from the panic. Futures contracts for raw materials from lead to eggs fell by their daily limit on July 8th as investors rushed to get their hands on cash. On international markets, the price of iron ore, which China consumes the bulk of, slid. Yet risks of a systemic nature remain remote.</p>
<p>The longer-term consequences could be severe, however. Like any big, sophisticated economy, China needs a healthy, functioning equity market. For investors from households to pension funds, stocks should, in theory, provide a better return over time than low-yielding bank deposits. For companies, equity financing would be an alternative to borrowing from banks, helping reduce their reliance on debt. The scrutiny and rules that come with a share listings should also help improve corporate governance.</p>
<p>Before the crash, China was inching towards reforms that would fix at least some of the distortions in its market. A programme launched last year connected markets in Hong Kong and the mainland markets. Though subject to strict quotas, it promised to introduce more of an institutional presence on China’s exchanges. Regulators had stepped up supervision of insider trading and had also planned to change the way initial public offerings work, giving companies more control over the timing and size of their listings. But as the government’s all-out, if ineffective, response to the crash shows, it is reluctant to cede control.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love The Economist, been reading it for years, but I've always found their writing seems to tend to favor the interests of banks over a lot of other things.  I thought this was weird for such an otherwise open-minded publication, so I looked into it, and yep, they're partially owned by the Rothschild banking family.  Not saying you can't trust them in general, but it's something to be aware of when reading articles from them regarding banking practices.</p>
<p>I'm not saying this article has any problems, but I figured with such adulation I should inject a bit of skepticism regarding this publication.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The publication belongs to The Economist Group, half of which is owned by Pearson PLC via the Financial Times. A group of independent shareholders, including many members of the staff and the Rothschild banking family of England,[8] owns the rest.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The editorial staff happily admits to such a bias- since its inception the magazine has been a strong proponent of free markets and relatively limited government involvement in the economy. I'd hesitate to chalk their attitudes to large financial institutions up to their ownership.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good stuff. They are definitely more conservative than most of the publications I read, but I find that refreshing, especially in the era of the hot take (THE TPP WILL KILL YOU AND YOUR JOB). I disagree with them often, but appreciate their global stance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a fucking conspiracy. It's widely known that The Economist is pro market. Look at their name! You go there for that perspective, and you really shouldn't be reading it unless you are aware of their bias (whether you agree or not). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with the article, as somebody who works in this field I think there's a lot of unnecessary concern - and while the conclusion is broadly correct there is one thing not really addressed. essentially it's an incredibly volatile market. The vast majority of shares are retail so we lack the stability provided by institutions and also there is a major lack of information. This leads to firesales. I was speaking to a senior guy at the shanghai stock exchange who several years ago wiped tens of billions off by being misunderstood in a throwaway comment picked up by local media. That's the kind of market here-unsophisticated investors, poor information, unreliable assessment of fundamentals. Doesn't mean China's economy is crashing- its not. It's no different than it was a month ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lack of information in China is institutional and reflected in all walks of life, particularly their judicial system.  I found it enlightening when I realized the discovery period in China is so short as to be practically non-existent.  For all intents and purposes, in China, everything is need-to-know, because you're better off not knowing, especially in terms of liability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, yeah.  When I heard someone say it was &quot;crashing&quot;, I was like, wait what?  </p>
<p>I look into it, and the growth is only slowing...and my immediate thought is &quot;Oh, it's normalizing then....lol&quot;.  Massive growth rates are not sustainable in the long-term and most modern examples are from countries that haven't opened up to globalization yet and suddenly enter the market.  China's been pretty modern for quite some time now, so I don't see why people see this as surprising lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's surprising to Chinese because the government officials have been pushing the stock market through state media, encouraging the everyday Chinese person to jump in and start investing.  There was a huge surge of interest in the last year because of people like the Premier essentially telling all his countrymen to buy in through propaganda. The government virtually was guaranteeing you wealth. However recently, cracks are starting to show in the manufacturing sector, people are more well aware the government is propping up hundreds of failing companies, forcing many major investors to buy more stocks, and social unrest is a growing concern if unemployment numbers go up, and investment opportunities continue to disappear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waaaaay more to it than that.  It's very much a crash, as there's very good reason to believe that the growth over the last year has been purely speculative, if not outright synthetic.  China wouldn't scramble to pull together a 20 billion dollar market stability fund (effective for, oh, less than 24 hours) if this was a &quot;correction&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also important to note that unlike other large markets it has a few differences that are not really mentioned in detail in the article that exacerbate the volatility.     </p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike almost all other markets,  this one is very heavily based on private investors (people).   More than 80% of the market consists of investments from small investors which tend to react to market shifts much differently than large managed investments do. This is one of the reasons that even with China's govt doing much to try to artificially raise the market it is not having much effect -- the people are running scared.   </li>
<li>When this market is volatile like this, 40-100% of the stocks listed are being locked,  meaning investors that want to sell are not able to sell at any price.  Given the ownership/investment breakdown above this is having the effect of exasperating the scare -- as soon as the market reopens investors run to the market to try to sell off (possibly more shares than they would have) before the listings are locked again.   This keeps on repeating and is becoming a self reflective system. </li>
