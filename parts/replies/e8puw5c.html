			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my world. Eight weeks along today, and while I'm over the cravings for a good Cubano, I now &quot;need&quot; red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting, and Lord help me if there's peanut butter within sniffing distance, I'm gonna hurl.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm truly enjoying reading all your responses, guys and gals. It's really funny to see what you all like and can't stand! </p>
<p>Also, thank you- this is our first, and we are <em>very</em> excited!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ex and I loved to go out for hot wings. She was pregnant with our first and one night we decided to go for wings. Within 3 minutes of sitting down she said “if we don’t leave I’m going to vomit” and we needed up going for burgers. The smell of the hot wing sauce set her off. </p>
<p>I don’t think we went out for wings again until 6 months after our last kid was born. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Its cemented the idea that I really don't want to get pregnant for a WHILE</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I so feel this. I'm 28 weeks &amp; I've had such a craving for avocado lately. I seriously just <em>need</em> it.</p>
<p>I've never liked avocado. I don't like the taste. I had a sandwich with it in on Sunday and I still don't like the taste... but I still <em>need</em> it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. 12 weeks today with my second! Obsessed with the smell of McChickens and Aveeno soap... but don’t come near me with eggs or BBQ sauce. My main craving is an Essa Bagel and corned beef hash but I’m living in Australia now so I can’t get either =[ </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My needs were simple - I needed ground beef with something spicy on top and that was easily obtained. My daughter was more complex. She wanted Girl Scout Thin Mints... out of season...and burst into tears every few hours for days because there was no hope of getting them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about the bagel but corned beef is very popular here in Australia. I'm assuming a hash is something with potatoes (like a hashbrown?) so you should be pretty set just visiting any Woolies or Coles.</p>
<p>I cannot help with the bagel though I imagine they wouldn't be too hard to bake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm at 10 weeks.. bring me all the McDonald's and taco Bell please! But then, stand clear roughly 20 minutes later. My stomach never agrees with my cravings..
As for what to keep away, chicken. Uncooked chicken. Keep all that to yourself. I don't wanna see it, smell it, think about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading this made me think of a follow-up question. Is it only humans who exhibit the symptoms mentioned in the post? Do other mammals's food choices change when they are pregnant? Or is the hormonal changes that lead to these oddities uniquely human? </p></div>		</li>
