			<div class="markdown"><p>OMG, so you know how Tosh says Tony is lit? Girl, that's not lumins. I'm here to tell you that some of the boys over represent their standings and you shouldn't listen to nobody until you've seen for yourself. Size ain't where its at anyway. 2000 lumins for 2 seconds? I won't even take it out the drawer. I gotta want to use it, you know what I mean. Strong &amp; steady is what I look for. But if hot/cold is you? Then you be you.</p></div>		</li>
