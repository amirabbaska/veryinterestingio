			<div class="markdown"><p>Peirce Brosnan in driving a truck through lava in Dante's Peak was fun though.</p>
<p>But yeah, the subway official who felt responsible for everyone in stuck in the car because he didn't shut the line down early enough. Taking responsibility for your actions is an underrated trait. It's never easy to admit you made a mistake and can cost you dearly in the end, but goddamned if it doesn't show your character.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Offhand, I'd say that both he and the guy he was carrying would have caught fire from the radiant heat. If they were wearing reflective clothes, then as soon as he landed in the lava, the water in his flesh that touched it would have immediately exploded to steam. He definitely wouldn't be able to remain standing. But if he were tied to something holding him vertical, then yeah, he'd have slowly sunk into the lava.  Of course, if it was only a few inches deep, then it might cool off enough to harden, in which case whatever was left of him would just burn and melt. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure his own weight would be enough to prevent his boiling flesh from causing a leidenfrost effect under his feet. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A good analogue of what would happen can be viewed in this video in which some volcanologists through a bag of wet, organic trash into a lava lake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bag clearly splashes, though?</p>
<p>It's certainly less dense than the magma, but it's moving fast enough to punch through the surface and cause a splash. And the ongoing fountaining as the steam boils off implies that it's staying down there, doesn't it? Not just being thrown to the surface to boil away harmlessly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it has enough momentum to punch into the lava a short distance, despite being significantly less dense. I imagine the reason it seems to stay under the surface, despite the fact it should theoretically float, is the water in the &quot;organic matter&quot; will be exploding violently into steam, creating a cavity into which it can fall under gravity - this happens repeatedly and keeps the bag of stuff under the surface of the lake in its own little pocket of hell. (So it is floating, just floating under the lakes surface in a cavity of steam and fire)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less dense objects won't pop up like they do in water because lava has a high viscosity, but they won't sink either. All other things being equal (they aren't) if you
Drop a person in lava they will probably just slam on to the surface. If they hit hard enough to embed in the lava they will likely remain embedded because the difference in density isn't large enough to overcome the energy required to cause the lava to flow</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another variable has nothing to do with the characteristics of the lava itself. If you fall into water traveling at high enough speed, your impact with the water, while it may make a splash, will also result in a splat, at least as far as your body is concerned. It is the deceleration that kills you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At terminal velocity - 53m/S or 122mph - still water might as well be concrete. </p>
<p>If you're very, very lucky over sea you might hit a foamy whitecap, which will be less incompressible and all you'll have to worry about is drowning with broken limbs, terminal concussion, and very heavy bruising.</p>
<p>Otherwise your rigid bones will stop dead [1] with near instant terminal fractures. while the rest of you decelerates to zero around them even more quickly.</p>
<p>Lava has the advantage of making your remains burst into flames in a dramatic way, but in terms of survival prospects, the practical difference between landing from a great height on lava and on water is zero.</p>
