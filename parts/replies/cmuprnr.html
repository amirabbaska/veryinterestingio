			<p>Late to the party, and this will gaurantee get buried, but thought you might like to hear that that's not quite the case.<br><br>I've been doing the <a href="http://diy.soylent.me/recipes/people-chow-301-tortilla-perfection" target="_blank">People Chow 3.0.1 - &quot;Tortilla Perfection!&quot;</a> since early last summer, about 80% of my monthly calories come exclusively from P.C.<br><br>Yeah, the first 3 weeks were a bit rough, but then, after some regulation of receptors i imagine, it completely changed the way my body perceives sustenance.  Yeah, I still occasionally see a food I like and get a craving for it, but after biting down it's almost always instant regret. I still force myself to eat inferior archaic Food 2.0 (food 1.0 being early Homo food uncooked by fire...which we would have to <a href="http://scitechdaily.com/cooking-fueled-the-growth-of-the-human-brain/" target="_blank">eat 9 hours a day</a> of to feed our brain due to disproportionate brain-to-stomach size) on the weekends, but yeah.  This, lets call it Food 3.0, is fudging amazing once you get with it.  I don't see myself quitting anytime soon.<br><br>Let me know me if you want more details, this is already way too long..</p>		</li>
