			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend bought into it and has a shake every day for lunch. He claims he feels healthier and like he's been eating better. He was terrified of unforeseen health issues by strictly eating it, so he figured lunch every day would be a good compromise to getting the essentials in at least one meal a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually one of the main points the creator makes in basically all his interviews. He finds it unrealistic to give up all meals, so he advertises it as a compete meal for someone who maybe doesn't have time to cook. On your way to work? Want to get ALL your dietary needs for the next 8 hours out of the way in ten minutes? Then make some Soylent. </p>
<p>He does like to talk about the possibility that some day population will be so high that it will be inevitable that people live off such a product, due to its convenience. Wants it to be treated like water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Now I'm definitely considering it for days I don't have time to make proper food, no doubt it woul be healthier than a pre-cooked diner or a hamburger, but still I don't think your body takes it the same way it takes food. I'm not sure if it's popular enough in the UK to find it there. I've never seen something like that, at least. Unless it's only sold at specialty stores or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that Soylent is harmful in the long run because it doesn't involve chewing, and chewing is necessary to our health. Humans haven't evolved to survive solely on liquid food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't imagine any reason why your dietary health would depend on whether or not you chew something. Chewing is just the process of breaking down something so it can be liquefied anyway. You're just skipping a step. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or those of us who are tortured by normal food and would rather take a nutrient pill daily like The Jetsons did. My digestive system hates me most days. If I could replace one or two meals a day with a healthy alternative that is guaranteed to digest well I'd be all about it. </p>
<p>Some people have to look at food like &quot;how is this going to make me feel in an hour/later/tomorrow?&quot; rather than &quot;how awesome is this going to taste?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big selling point for Soylent, in my opinion, is as a meal replacement in situations where you otherwise would grab fast-food, a tv-dinner, hot-dog-stand 'meat',... things that are demonstrably poor in nutrition.</p>
<p>It does not replace the delicious BBQ dinner you were going to have on Friday night, or the chicken salad lunch you had time to make in the morning.</p>
<p>edit: spelling</p></div>		</li>
