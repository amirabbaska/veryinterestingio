			<div class="markdown"><p>I really enjoyed my undergrad courses on it, but they were a while ago now.</p>
<p>I'm understanding fuzzy sets as just being a set with a function on it, so surely the only extra thing in fuzzy topology vs a regular topology is that function on the base set, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't a clue. I literally begged my professor to pass me because I was so lost in that class. It was my last math elective I needed to graduate and luckily my professor took pity on me. For some reason that class never clicked with me, despite me spending at least 10 hours per week on that course alone.</p></div>		</li>
