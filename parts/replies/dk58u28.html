<p>By now you're wondering &quot;So why do I feel a pick-me-up from drinking caffeine?&quot; and mindblowing truth is that you weren't tired from adenosine being absorbed, you were tired because you were in the midst of a caffeine withdrawal and thus felt much better once you got your fix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's misleading as fuck. You get a pick me up because adenosine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter which affects heart rate, respiration rate, blood vessel constriction, etc. When your central nervous system isn't being inhibited, you experience a pick me up relative to that, aka a stimulant effect. There's also a dopamine release and some cholinergic effect (though that's related to the memory enchancement of caffeine and not the stimulant effects).</p>
<p>Naturally, you'll get a dopamine response if you were in the midst of a withdrawal, but to try and pretend it's only because of &quot;getting your fix&quot; is just dishonestly misleading.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like I said I'm not claiming to be an expert, but the above study concludes that the major beneficial affect of caffeine is to reverse caffeine withdrawal. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To avoid the shortcomings of standard placebo-controlled studies, which are ambiguous due to failure to control for the confounding influence of withdrawal reversal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's enough to question this study right there. There's a reason placebo-controlled studies are standard. I don't have access to the actual article, but when you forgo good methodologies due to difficulty of control in order to find what you want, you're not proceeding in a proper manner. If you have access, is there any way for you to get me a breakdown of how the studies they mention are managed? </p></div>		</li>
