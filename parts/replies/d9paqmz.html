			<div class="markdown"><p>Imgur sort of developed it's own pseudo-community, with some people finding the site without even using reddit.</p>
<p>This makes for some great misunderstandings and entitlement like over at /r/IgnorantImgur</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it how works for some stuff online too. Like if you're learning Japanese via Wani-Kani or Anki* for example.</p>
<p>So once you hit S-E than &quot;Se&quot; would come up in Hiragana etc. There are a few weird ones like &quot;the little tsu&quot; which has a bunch of compatible functions like X-T among others.</p>
<p>I'm still pretty new to it all, but I feel like If I had to eventually write everything in hiragana/katakana it wouldn't be a hindrance at all.</p>
<p>Kanji on the other hand would be far more tedious as I'd assume it's as you said, reliant on autocorrect and the most common. Or used via some form of stroke input (not sure if that would actually be faster).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These days the IME is standardised, fortunately, regardless of what device you're using. Anki/Wani Kani don't have their own IMEs :P</p>
<p>Btw, small tsu works fastest by just doubling the letter, which matches the hepburn system. </p>
<p>autocorrect guesses the right word on its first try most of the time, so kanji isn't really an issue. Stroke input kind of sucks unless you get the strokes right (including the details). I use stroke input when I forget the kanji reading and it's a real pain, especially if you use a regular phone (it doesn't follow the finger movement that well). </p></div>		</li>
