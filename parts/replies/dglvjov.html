Red wine makes me super sleepy and lowers my mood level. As much as I love the taste, I have began to severely limit my intake of red wine.. I drink it 2-3 times a month now. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm pretty sure I get this too, but I have a quick question. I've noticed that the day after I drink, I feel kind of...foggy, or stuffy all day, like my brain has been replaced with cotton balls. And I'm lethargic as all get out. I always thought this was a hangover, but there's no headache, no sensitivity to light or noise, no queasiness...and now, thinking on it, it does feel very similar to how I feel when spring allergies kick in.</p>
<p>Is that feeling alcohol intolerance, or do hangovers feel like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me  a hangover definitely feels like a hangover..head hurts, light is the devil and your body feels like it's been hit by a train. Nausea...etc...</p>
<p>What you describe sounds also like what I get too. Including ringing in my ear which makes me feel like I'm in an aquarium. And I get this when my season allergies start. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Alcohol intolerance for sure. If you aren't even queasy then you aren't hung over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm Hispanic/Irish yet I developed an alcohol intolerance about 2 years ago (at age 22). Get the flush on my face and sometimes my chest and back, and get congested in the throat area the next day. </p>
<p>Do indigenous Americans have the same flush problem? That might be it for me, since my Irish family are all great drinkers (hah). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Most Asians I know are pretty heavy drinkers, hang over aside, I've never seen them complain about allergy like symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the OP's title implies that all humans experience this when it is only those with a genetic defect. I was clarifying that but I guess I can understand how some people fail to catch on to that as this is explain like im <em>five</em> after all. I could have been a little more concise.</p></div>		</li>
