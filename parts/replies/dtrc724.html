			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to keep in mind, cheetahs only eat what they kill. They do not scavenge. They would sooner starve to death than eat something they didn't kill. They are also solitary and very skittish. So that means their prey/kills is vulnerable to being stolen from lions, hyenas, jackals, even wild dogs. </p>
<p>They tend to hunt around midday, which is why the black 'tears' are even more important to assist their eyesight. They try to hunt in midday so there is less outside interference from other scavengers. Midday generally translates into naptime in the shade for their potential adversaries. Once a cheetah gets a kill, the vultures will circle and the hyenas and lions are smart enough to realize circling vultures = kills. Easy pickings as the cheetahs don't fight. </p>
<p>Since the cheetah cannot fight them off, they need every advantage they can get.  </p>
<p>Edit: Cheetahs can also see approximately 1 mile in detail. I've been lucky enough to catch cheetahs hunting. They are wily, super cats. You won't notice they are hunting until you yourself actually see the prey. But they see it far out and stalk. They are patient and intent. The black tears absolutely assist them. </p>

<p>One of our girls, found about an hour after her kill. My guide has freakin' laser vision. We were driving down into an area known as the 'Forbidden Valley' near the Ndutu region of Tanzania. He kept asking me if I saw a cat and took off road. I was standing up in the truck and my dumb eyes couldn't see a damn thing. We found her, she'd pulled a gazelle into the bushes to hide it from the vultures. We just sat there with her for like an hour. Listening to her eat, and absolutely loving that this was an experience completely to ourselves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I appreciate the cheetah respect, it's not very scientific to say that since cheetahs behavior is impressive, it stands to reason that the color of the fur near their eyes has a substantially large effect on light entering the eye without doing any testing. </p>
<p>The methodology wouldn't be too hard. Get a cheetah corpse, replace its eyes with convex camera lenses, test, bleach the fur, test again. Get a rough idea of the impact. </p>
<p>It's not perfect unless you have the ability to test light coming into a live cheetah's eye, but it's a start. </p></div>		</li>
