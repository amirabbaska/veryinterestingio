			<div class="markdown"><p>If they are talking about the shape:</p>
<p>A radar works by bouncing a signal back to a receiver.  The parallelograms only bounce the signal in a couple of directions from the source of the signal and very rarely right back to where it's coming from.  The same concept as the wings on a stealth bomber.</p>
<p>The air intake is one of the hardest parts about stealth, as the signal tends to bounce around the inside of the intake then right back towards the emitter, so there is a heck of a lot more geometry going on than my simple explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great example is to shine a light on a reflective ball, no matter which direction you shine the light it will always reflect back to you dead center. This is the basics behind radar systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the shape also helps with oblique shockwaves. It has been a while since my aerodynamics classes, but IIRC this configuration helps with efficiency as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  There is materials stuff going on too, but if you look hard enough, you will find many parallel surfaceses, do from one direction your cover is blown, but the rest are sending the radar reflection away from the receiver </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: The &quot;belly scoop&quot; on the P-51 isn't actually an air intake for the engine (thats a smaller scoop on top of the engine nacelle), it's actually for the radiator.  The V12 engines used in the Mustang produced so much heat that the engineers designing the plane were able to take advantage of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_effect" target="_blank">Meredith Effect</a> turning the radiator assembly into a simple jet engine.  While it didn't directly make the P-51 faster, its thrust essentially negated the drag caused when using larger radiators which were required when running fighter plane engines at higher rpms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that. I'm now wondering if the Meredith effect is used in Formula 1 design - they have similar radiator intakes in the sidepods, usually exiting through a small opening at the rear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They denote &quot;kills&quot;.   Presumably the pilot shot down 3 German planes.<br />
Due to battle damage and upgrades, most WWI &amp; WWII pilots flew several different planes during the war.<br />
With current fighter aircraft, the plane will have many different pilots over its lifetime. So as a consequence, nowadays the kill markings reflect the successes of that particular airframe.</p></div>		</li>
