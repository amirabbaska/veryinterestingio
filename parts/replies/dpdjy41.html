			<div class="markdown"><p>Preserved, but I'm not sure this is analogous to being fossilised. Fossilisation implies preserving the appearance and structure of the original body but usually converted to an inorganic form, or at least a form that is profoundly different in content than the original.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peat is great for preserving fat and skin (as is permafrost) due to the high water content and low pressure, as well as lack of biodegrading organisms.</p>
<p>However these will last a few thousand years at most, and so are great for preserving very recent organisms.
These will eventually dry up however, and without a new sediment input and some way of preventing scavengers get to your newly exposed bones for the phosphorus, your remains won't last much longer.</p>
<p>If you really want to be preserved then I'd suggest dying during a flood event in a river/lake, a debris flow of some kind, or at the bottom of the ocean in the anoxic zone.</p>
<p>Have fun with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fossilized or mummified? Mummification is relatively easy, just remove all water and kill all life feeding upon your corpse. Salt is a popular way of doing both. There are other ways of mumifying, freeze drying works. You won't be rock hard but you will last well if properly cared for. And you will continue to look human.</p>
<p>Fossilization is a little more complicated and time consuming. Like mummification you need to kill everything but then you need to transition minerals into the body. Disolving them in water might be the quickest way. And then removing the water or dropping it's temperature will cause crystallization. This will cause discoloration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow archaeologist here, and I'm hoping you don't mind me pigging backing on this comment to further stress to anyone reading this the importance of preserving an Archaeological site. Not only does it safeguard artifacts and even burials, but it also preserves the layering of soils that is very helpful in identifing structures and other signs of human interaction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you even know if it's an archaeological site? I mean, plenty of construction crews backhoe'd their way into one and kept going, only realizing much later that there was something important. But by then a lot of it had been wrecked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't some of it the result of plant growth and death?  For example, I'm thinking of old ruins found in jungles or bodies found in bogs. As the plants sequester CO2 and grow, then die, and new plants overgrow the area and repeat the process until the remains are covered in layer after layer of organic material.</p>
<p>Along the lines of a KenM joke but half serious, could we &quot;plant fossils&quot; for the future by burying dead animals under tons of sediment (sand) now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's peat accumulation that works to preserve bodies in bogs...physically bogs are &quot;depositional&quot; environments, so anything dying there is gonna be buried in a relatively short period of time. Not sure about the chemical mechanics of it but the anaerobic conditions definitely help, maybe the low ph too? Curious if anyone can chime in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly! Bogs are defined by standing water and acidity. Sphagnum moss makes the environment acidic as it grows, plus you have organic matter accumulating faster than it can decompose and microbes sucking up the oxygen just below the surface pretty quickly. If an animal dies and sinks into the bog it'll be in an anoxic, acidic environment which is not hospitable to the things that normally decompose bodies, so they get preserved rather than broken down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's not fossilization.. and roots will destroy structures. Think of sidewalks that have tree roots growing through them. A Mayan temple will preserve if left alone, not if plants are growing all over it with their intrusive roots. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that human will probably extinct before we &quot;harvest&quot; the &quot;plant fossils&quot;. Moreover, after thousands years, human technology should have great advancement. I believe we will no longer use fossil fuels, but using solar energy or maybe nuclear fusion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking we'll be extinct too - so maybe another intelligent species will come along and find what ever fossils we deliberately plant now... maybe soak 'em in formaldehyde and encase them in concrete with a plastic ribbon around it like a present from us to them.</p></div>		</li>
