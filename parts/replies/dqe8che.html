			<div class="markdown"><p>We can move around in time, kind of.</p>
<p>We're always hurtling through spacetime at exactly C. We can rotate to be moving mostly space-ward and hardly time-ward, or vice versa.</p>
<p>When we're sitting still in 3 space we're moving through time at full C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there an arrow of time though? All of space time could just exist in a static way. Now if you &quot;perceive&quot; moments of your life in any order, in each moment it will seem as if time would have an arrow due to the nature of your memories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The second law of thermodynamics gives rise to the arrow of time. It states that, in a closed system, entropy will always increase. This means that as we experience systems moving from lower entropy (highly organized) to higher entropy (highly disorganized), we see the second law at work. You never see an egg yolk jump back into the egg and seal the crack, because that would be a decrease in entropy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just a property of the universe we experience and it happens to be one involving time. But I don't see that as any proof or explanation. To me it sounds like identifying a pattern in some crystal's growth from left to right and saying &quot;well, the x dimension must have an arrow&quot;. Well yeah, the crystal never grows from its tip to its base, so what - still no arrow in the x dimension.</p>
<p>As far as I know there are no reasons why the universe couldn't be a static 4D structure, while certain aspects of relativity theory and quantum mechanics tell a story that lets us doubt our perceived concept of time. Also an explanation that doesn't declare a whole dimension as &quot;special but we don't know why it moves only forward&quot; is (in my humble opinion) simpler and therefore to be preferred.</p></div>		</li>
