			<div class="markdown"><p>No, unfortunately it doesnt. Ammonia is a good solvent for some things that don't dissolve in water which is why we use it as a cleaning agent e.g. for fats.</p>
<p>The opposite of bleach (which is an oxidizing agent, in other words a compound which makes things more positively charged when it reacts) would be something like sodium bisulphite (some carpet cleaning products i believe). Reducers are very rare in household applications though, and are used primarily at industrial scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also neat to point out that chlorine and sodium as elements are nearly perfectly opposites.  So much so that they end up neutralizing each other and becoming salt.</p>
<p>That's how come a metal that explodes in water and a gas that will burn everything it touches becomes tasty salt when combined.  </p></div>		</li>
