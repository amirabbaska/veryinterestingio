<p>Ugh how do people keep spewing this shit. They price it to sell competitively. That's how they price it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to be in every subreddit, whenever economic matters get raised the conversation sinks to &quot;Corporations be gougin' me brah!&quot;</p>
<p>If this was true:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You need gasoline. They know you need gasoline, you will buy it, even if its more expensive.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then why aren't they charging $20/gallon?  In fact, outside the US there's plenty of places where the price is way higher. </p>
<p>Have a look: <a href="http://www.eia.gov/countries/prices/gasolinewithtax.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.eia.gov/countries/prices/gasolinewithtax.cfm</a></p>
<p>So we have definitive proof that people will pay $6, $8, hell even $9/gal.  Since reddit doesn't believe in downward price pressure from competition, can we conclude that the $3/gal price in the US is there because oil companies are super friendly and generous towards US customers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the us gov. subsidizes the hell out of gasoline in the form of: the military, roads, auto-bailouts, &quot;golden-gimmick&quot; subsidy, etc.</p>
<p>the major energy companies do fix the prices but many organizations <strong>also speculate</strong> on crude oil. this will also keep the price competitive/less competitive depending on the sort of deal.</p>
<p>the us gov. also provides some protections on gasoline and if you saw stations charging $9 per gal on gasoline you KNOW the federal government would be on the mother fucker. this country needs cheap gas. period. they would not allow anybody to jack up the price but them (to play geopolitics.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No need to look as far as the UK, just here in Canada, gas is much more expensive than in the states. It is however possible that the price in the US is what Americans are willing to pay, and same thing for Canada, i.e. the price is set for maximal profits for two differing populations. Perhaps if you decreased the price in Canada, Canadians wouldn't be driving more and buying bigger vehicles, but if you increased the price in the US to the price of Canada, Americans would drive less and buy smaller vehicles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main reason the price of gasoline is higher outside the U.S. is because those other countries tax the heck out of it.  It isn't because the refinery is making more profit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But have an upvote, because the people saying &quot;high demand&quot; aren't really responding to &quot;why is the price so low?&quot;, which is Op's question.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But high supply was why the prices went so low. The increase in fracking coupled with regular production caused prices to drop. OPEC saw the US market rise up and said &quot;no we aren't going to stop this price free fall&quot; by stepping back their production. One Saudi prince even promised he would not allow oil above $50 a barrel by increasing production enough that $50 would be the only competitive price. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to distinguish between the cost of GAS and the cost of OIL. Profits on gasoline on a per gallon basis pretty much never change, it stays around 8 cents per gallon. Pumping oil is a fixed cost, and is sold to the highest bidder. Oil prices are kept stable through futures markets, but move up and down depending on current supply.</p>
<p>Gas is cheap right now because oil is cheap, which is cheap because we're pumping 1.5 million more barrels a day than we consume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's do some very, very simple basic math:</p>
<p>Flour normal cost per unit: <strong>50 cents</strong></p>
<p>Employee cost per unit sold: 25 cents</p>
<p>Total operating cost per unit sold: 75 cents</p>
<p>Total cost per unit: $1.50</p>
<p>Sell price per unit: $2.25</p>
<p>Profit per unit: <strong>75 cents</strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Flour new lower cost per unit: <strong>25 cents</strong></p>
<p>Employee cost per unit sold: 25 cents</p>
<p>Total operating per unit sold: 75 cents</p>
<p>Total cost per: $1.25</p>
<p>Sell price per unit: $2.25</p>
<p>Profit per unit: <strong>$1.00</strong></p>
<p>Do you get it now? Just because one cost of a product drops 50%, does not mean your fucking profit goes up 50%.</p></div>		</li>
