			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I understand like apple stocks growing in anticipation of iPhone 8. But uber on the other hand loses like 2-3 billion a year and they're valued over 70 billion. Isn't the standard valuation like 5 times revenue? So it'll take a long time to get like 15 bil in revenue along with a lot of risk. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no such thing as a &quot;standard valuation.&quot; </p>
<p>Let's think about it rationally. </p>
<p>Uber and Tesla (&quot;U&amp;T&quot; from henceforth) both have assets, liabilities, current sales and net income, cash flows, etc. So, we have the value of &quot;what we currently have.&quot; </p>
<p>In these specific cases, the value of what U&amp;T currently own is likely negative. </p>
<p>However, if we based our valuation solely off of that, we'd be working under the assumption that the business essentially dies <em>right at this very instant.</em> </p>
<p>That doesn't make sense. They both have enough cash for now to survive, they're both growing their revenue and users, and are making advances in products and profitability.</p>
<p>So we need to add to our current value <em>the present value of growth opportunities.</em></p>
<p>This is where it gets very suggestive. But both of these companies can achieve <em>economies of scale,</em> where profitability goes up disproportionately as sales increase. </p>
<p>As such, if U&amp;T were to respectively become <em>very popular,</em> then their revenue would go up, while their costs would increase at a slower, possibly <em>much</em> slower rate, yielding large profits. </p>
<p>For Tesla specifically (Uber is private), their revenue growth from 2014 into 2015 jumped roughly 25%. 2015 into 2016, it was up 75%. They've got <em>7 billion</em> in revenue and it's still <em>skyrocketing</em> upward. </p>
<p>The market believes this growth can keep going on for a bit, and that's why the stock is priced so highly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my issue with it is the &quot;growth potential&quot; so say Tesla in 5 years will earn its valuation at 60 billion and say that's all it will ever be is at 60 billion. So the stock will be stagnant for 5 years at this valuation as it completes its growth potential? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tesla and uber have assets. Sure, they have physical assets, but i'm talking about IP. Intellectual Property. They have a portfolio of very valuable patents. Many big companies took years to turn a profit. Amazon is a good example. They lost loads of money starting up. That's because building a business takes time. Even with all the money in the world, it takes time.   </p>
<p>Startup investing is weird. Its high risk, so the reward has to be great. And the more money you give a company, the bigger they grow. So funding is done in rounds. about once a year the execs will start talking to investors for more funding. Each time the funding usually gets bigger as the rompany shows investors that it knows what its doing.  </p>
<p>I don't know about uber, but this is not musk's first startup. He already has successful tech companies under his belt, so investors are willing to give him lots of money.  </p>
<p>As far as the valuation goes, it's a made up number. Its meaningless. Its like a piece of art. It's worth that much because someone paid that much for it one time. It's not based on anything really tangible. </p></div>		</li>
