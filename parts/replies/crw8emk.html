			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty incredible how giraffes would sleep in micronaps for less than a total of 30 minutes a day.<br />
Wonder what they do with all that free time/at nighttime</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more a survival mechanism than anything else. A big giraffe lying down to rest is basically sticking a sign in its back saying &quot;Hey lions, come here and eat me!&quot; So they can't do it any longer than a few minutes at best.</p>
<p>I'm hardly a giraffe expert, but perhaps they also nap like horses do, standing on their feet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're wrong.  <a href="http://static.neatorama.com/images/2013-05/baby-giraffe-sleeping-2.jpg" target="_blank">But you're going to be glad that you are</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ever want to watch something Interesting. Find the whipsnade zoo documentary (from when the BBC recorded animals sleeping in the zoo).
Among the most interesting bits are the giraffes and the ostriches.
Ostriches use bi-hemispherical sleeping patterns... So half the brain sleeps whilst the other wakes. In between those phases, the bird does some pretty curious things.
It's a lot more complicated than &quot;half the brain sleeps at a time&quot; - the documentary explains it really well! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not what OP said.</p>
<p>&quot;Giraffes , for instance, sleep no more than 30 minutes per day scattered in little micronaps.&quot;</p>
<p>So do you have supplementary knowledge on the subject and you are clearing what OP said up? (Not trying to sound like a dick, I'd just like to know which one it is.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is your citation for giraffes sleeping only 30 minutes per day? That seems a gross underestimate compared to the figure of 4.6 hours from the only <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2869.1996.00010.x/abstract;jsessionid=6B9ECE0AE97EBAF5B48F00E4A14F61D1.f03t04" target="_blank">study</a> I'm aware of.</p>
<p>As to whether less complex animals can be defined to sleep, it comes down to where you choose to draw your line on the definition of sleep. There's no consensus on this, and it may not make any sense to apply a discrete cut-off to what is almost certainly a continuum of sleep-like behaviors.</p></div>		</li>
