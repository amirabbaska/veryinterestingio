<p>In the sense of the proximate cause for their cooperating, it has to do with the specific behaviors patterned into ants, rather than being directly because they're siblings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting -- but if it's because of genetic bottlenecks, that means that when transplanting fails, it's because they aren't exact genetic matches?</p>
<p>Even if that's a bust, you still can't attribute ants getting along <em>only</em> to them being siblings. There's also the fact that ants don't have things like &quot;ego&quot; or &quot;laziness&quot;.</p>
<p>Thought experiment: imagine a society of a billion human siblings. It wouldn't go as well as an ant society does, because even human siblings cooperate poorly compared to ants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it won't function correctly. It will be killed because it doesn't smell the same as the rest of the ants from that colony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently that's true for <em>most</em> ants -- which means my argument still <em>sorta</em> applies for the other ants.</p>
<p>But anyway I think the heart of my objection stands -- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/87jwov/do_other_social_species_like_ants_for_example/dweh67d/" target="_blank">see my other response to a comment making the same correction as yours.</a></p>
<p>Or actually I'll just copy the important part: if ant cooperation came down entirely (or mostly) to them being siblings, then you'd expect human siblings (or at least identical twins) to cooperate extremely well. But humans siblings still cooperate poorly, because we have lots of drives that go against intraspecies cooperation, compared to ants.</p></div>		</li>
