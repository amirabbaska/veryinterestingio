			<div class="markdown"><p>Do note there's a difference between <em>classical</em> Latin, the literary form in Rome at the height of the Empire, and <em>Ecclesiastical Latin</em> which is the Latin used by the Catholic Church long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, through the middle ages and until the Vatican II in the 60's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This difference is overplayed a bit, though, by classicists with an axe to grind. The difference between Classical Latin and Ecclesiastical Latin is similar to the difference between the English you read in the smart magazine (New Yorker, the Economist) and the English you hear in a mediocre TV show. </p>
<p>(I would say it is even less pronounced than, say, the difference between Shakespeare and today. Anyone well versed in Classical LAtin would have zero problem reading Church Latin.)</p>
<p>Are there differences? Yes.
Is it <em>a different language</em>? No.</p>
<p>(Yes, I'm aware of the pronunciation shift. That's a separate issue. Americans and Indians pronounce words differently, but they are speaking the same language.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think it's entirely accurate to call them different dialects, though. American and Indian English have significant differences but are almost entirely mutually intelligible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that Medieval Latin--ecclesiastical and otherwise--is gramatically much looser than classical. There are also many figures of speech, phrases, and words that are unique to Medieval Latin as the language was used in different contexts over the course of several centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire. If you are only used to classical Latin and you read many Medieval texts, you can get confused because of the &quot;incorrect&quot; syntax, unfamiliar vocabulary, and various Medieval-isms. </p>
<p>Any church Latin still in use by the Vatican today is more standardized and I would agree that someone with training in classical Latin would have no problem with it, other than perhaps some unfamiliar vocab.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Vulgar Latin isn't really <em>Ecclesiastical Latin</em> either. Vulgar Latin is mostly dead as it evolved into the distinct Romance languages. It's true the classical Latin we learn is a heightened literary language (ironic, because the true patricians of Rome spoke Greek rather than Latin) as opposed to that of the common folk.</p>
<p>Analogously, it's like if Received Pronounciation or &quot;The Queen's English&quot; was preserved for all time, and all other dialects of English died out or turned into other languages... but for some reason the specific dialect of English spoken by a group of blacksmiths in London was also used for Blacksmithing.</p></div>		</li>
