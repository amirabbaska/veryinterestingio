			<div class="markdown"><p>Additional fun fact: Neptune was actually discovered mathematically before we proved its existence. We noticed gravitational effects on nearby bodies that we already discovered. A lot of math determined that there must be a planet out there somewhere. We calculated everything, took a peek with better technology, and there you have it: Neptune, located within 1% of our math. Amazing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This stuff is true, and it's impressive. But maybe not quite as much as it seems. It vaguely implies we launch spacecraft and they zoom away and everything works out. In reality we constantly measure where it is and make course corrections as necessary.</p>
<p>It's like saying, &quot;I stepped on my gas pedal in New York and ended up in a parking spot in Boston!&quot; Sure, but there was plenty of driving along the way. You didn't just pick the perfect trajectory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are minor course corrections along the way, but a large part of the timing depends on the initial launch time and velocity. They can only put so much fuel on the probe for course corrections.</p></div>		</li>
