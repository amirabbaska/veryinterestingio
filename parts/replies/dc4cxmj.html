			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this one explains OPs question but you did answer something I noticed when I got my new car.</p>
<p>My 2004 Chrysler Pacifica was so horrendous at the helicopter noise thing that I always had to have the opposite side window open to lower how much it did it. It never made my ears pop when I closed the windows on the highway but I didn't notice this at the time.</p>
<p>Now I have a 2013 VW Beetle and it does the exact opposite. Absolutely no helicopter noise but ear popping when opening and closing the windows on the highway is extremely noticeable.</p>
<p>Thanks for answering my curiosity anyway! </p></div>		</li>
