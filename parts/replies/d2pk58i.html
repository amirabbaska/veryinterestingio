			<div class="markdown"><p>To add more to this: I actually performed a very similar experiment last year at CERN. We created rare gold isotopes at the ISOLDE facility by bombarding a molten lead target with highly-accelerated protons. The goal of the experiment was to measure the radius of very exotic gold nuclei using a technique called resonant laser ionization spectroscopy. With this technique, we can deduce the size of the nucleus down to less than a few hundreds of a femtometer! Pretty interesting stuff to be honest :)</p>
<p>EDIT: As I come home from work and re-read my comment, I notice that I mixed up a detail:
For the experiment on gold, we made use of a Uranium-carbide target which was bombarded by protons.
The molten-lead target, we used on a similar experiment on Mercury the week before!
Why one chooses a different target depends on how much of the element you want to study can be produced and how fast these elements come out of the target as well as how much other stuff (contamination) comes with your beams.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The size of certain elements with a similar number of protons as lead (82 protons) such as for instance gold, mercury, thallium, bismuth and polonium shows some strange behaviour. If you take away more and more neutrons from the nucleus, some of the isotopes have a sudden increase in nuclear size which is pretty cool if you think of it. (something gets bigger if you take away matter!) We wanted to find out where this strange behaviour stops by measuring the size of gold and mercury isotopes for very very light isotopes of gold and mercury. Our experiment kind of validated pre-existing theories but also discards some others. I am going back to ISOLDE at the end of June to redo the experiment for Bismuth isotopes. Doing the experiment with so many talented scientists is always super awesome!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Needless to say, it still makes far more sense for us just to use the gold that supernovas produced for us than to try to repeat the process ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's important to remember a subtle but important non-nuclear aspect of this: supernovas don't produce much gold either, in proportion to other elements.  Gold is therefore reasonably uncommon compared to, say, iron, which is abundant on Earth.  The real &quot;magic&quot; is the natural geological/chemical processes that have collected tiny traces of gold in rocks and concentrated it by several orders of magnitude into economically mineable deposits.  That concentration process has happened &quot;for free&quot;, so all we have to do is find those rare places where it worked well and dig it up.  The finding/processing isn't &quot;free&quot;, but does mean trying to do the same thing artificially and economically would be a tough challenge to meet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, since massive stars (those massive enough to end in supernovae, and which leave stellar remnants in the form of black holes or neutron stars) will fuse all the way up until they have an iron core (with fusion up to this point able to support the star), and the supernova occurs when the ability of the star to fuse exothermically runs out. This means that a supernova will release a large quantity of iron. It will also generate heavier elements, since there is such an abundance of energy in a supernova that heavy atoms can fuse endothermically during the supernova itself, but this does explain why elements heavier than iron are relatively rare (cosmically). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partly.  It explains why iron is relatively abundant in the first place in the &quot;raw&quot; material that formed the Earth.  However, the exact abundance at the surface of the Earth is a more complicated question because the Earth's bulk composition has chemically and density differentiated since its formation.  Much of the iron, nickel, and other metals sank to the core while most of the lighter stuff got concentrated in the silicate-dominated mantle and crust.  So, if anything, iron is a little depleted at the surface compared to what it probably would be if you took an average composition for the entire bulk Earth.  This also explains why gold, on average, is even rarer in the crust than it probably was in the initial bulk material (based on comparison to undifferentiated meteorites).  Things get a little more complicated due to the chemical behaviour of the individual elements too (it isn't all density).  If you are interested, look up the difference between siderophile and lithophile elements.</p>
<p>To use an analogy, it's a bit like baking one of those cakes where you mix the ingredients and then they separate into differentiated layers.  So, if the initial ingredients contain plenty of X, then there is probably a decent amount in the final cake, but the concentration is going to be skewed by the way the cake separated while being baked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the very broad scale, tectonics controls what is going on, yes, and the differentiation of silicate melts in a tectonic context can concentrate or deplete certain elements chemically.  However, in the case of gold it is usually hot water with gold in solution (i.e. hydrothermal processes) that is picking it up at low concentrations and then precipitating it due to a change in the chemical conditions (temperature, pressure, pH, Eh, presence of organic carbon, halogens, etc.).  Think of the flow of water in the subsurface due to heating around a magma body.  That can focus the flow of water and change the chemistry in such a way that diffuse gold is picked up and then funnelled through a narrow zone (e.g., cracks in the rock that eventually form veins).  The flow and composition of the water is ultimately going to be controlled by tectonics, but it isn't as if tectonics is somehow squeezing gold into a particular spot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Its called a Gold Mine, where large amounts of gold bearing ore are processed in a way to concentrate the Gold. I&quot;m not being facetious, the only way to create a process to concentrate gold is to get vast amounts of ore in the first place. </p>
<p>The natural processes, still quite vague, take thousands or millions of years to work. Diggin the stuff up is way easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but you'd be talking about many billions of tonnes of rock/cubic kilometres prepared to be chemically leached and then concentrated to get something economic.  While such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_leaching" target="_blank">leaching operations</a> are indeed used for mining, nature operates on a much grander scale and over much longer periods of time, so to be interesting on human timescales you have to start with a deposit that has already had a natural concentration processes.  It doesn't make sense to start with an &quot;average&quot; rock.  You start with the &quot;natural&quot; highest-grade stuff first.</p></div>		</li>
