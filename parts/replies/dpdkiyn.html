			<div class="markdown"><p>Its possible to develop a innate negative response to your alarm if it continuously &quot;harms&quot; you. For the past few years my sleep schedule has been mostly on point so i have very little trouble waking up or going to sleep and the sound of my alarm doesn't bother me at all. To this very day though, if I hear the alarm that I had when i was in high school, i immediately feel like shit and just want to curl up in bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've used the same alarm for both sixth form and so far through university. I starts with a very clear first note. There have been times when I'm up and about during the day and I hear the note that starts the alarm tune and I just have a massive spike of panic and anxiety</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also possible to get so used to your alarm you can turn it off without actually waking up properly. I realised after I was late to everything for a week that I wasn't really noticing my alarm in the mornings anymore. Changed it and the next morning was 100% awake after the first note of the unfamiliar alarm. Now I change it every month or so to make sure it wakes me up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Found a pretty cool website once that tells you about when you should sleep/wake up. I think it's something like sleepy time calculator. It's been a while since I used it so I forgot if I actually felt more awake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are bogus. You can't predict what someone sleep stages are like with out taking in a multiple of factors. So is the sleep teacher on your fitbit. While it may be good for tracking sleep hygiene and wake after sleep onset but the rest is just not real. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Sleepyti.me is the website. If works so well. I've used it to get like 3.5 hours of sleep one night and felt totally rested the next day because I woke up at the right time. </p></div>		</li>
