			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for a simple (elliptical-like, with only small perturbations) orbit.  </p>
<p>The planet orbits around something, so the gravitational potential gradient will &quot;spin around&quot; in a circle over an orbit, so it always on average angularly accelerates towards a tidally-locked scenario.  </p>
<p>It might be possible with more complex hourglass-like orbits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes all the way back to the planet's formation. As a nebula gravitationally collapses into larger bodies and those bodies collide and merge further into larger bodies, they continue to impart their angular momentum.</p>
<p>So the reason the Earth and almost every other body in the solar system tires in the same direction and has the same orbital direction (whether the planet around the sun or a min around the planet â€” or even the asteroid belt) is because several billion years ago more of the dust in a cloud was moving this way instead of that way. Basically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although what you wrote is not wrong it is not why planets rotate. </p>
<p>A planet with zero rotation traveling through a gravitational field at less than the escape velocity but more than the crash velocity will begin an orbit. During its orbit the gravitational field is not uniform because the orbit is elliptical. Planets do not orbit around another body they orbit around the center of mass of the planet-body system. Also the gravitational force is not equal across the surface of the planets. This auniformity will cause rotation </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of how planets form - particles of dust are attracted towards each other, with the center of the planet roughly corresponding to the center of the mass of dust. Unless the particles are exactly uniform in both their consistency and placement relative to the center of what becomes the planet, they will 'orbit' each other, ever so slightly, rather than simply mashing together perfectly into a planet. </p>
<p>Due to the uneven distribution of force as a result of this process, planets are 'born' rotating. Given that objects in motion will stay in motion, unless there is an outside force acting upon the planet to counteract this spin, they will simply spin essentially forever. </p>
<p>And if there were an outside force acting on them that could cause them to stop spinning, that force would presumably cause them to stop spinning only for a moment and then they would simply spin in the opposite direction, assuming the outside force is a constant acceleration (and it almost certainly would be).</p>
<p>Now of course there <em>are</em> outside forces acting on planets (in fact everything in the universe is acting on everything else in the universe at all times), so it would actually be rather impossible for a planet to <em>not</em> spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are only partially true. They're true for why most things <em>do</em> have some rotation inherently, but not at all true for why things <em>must</em> rotatte.</p>
<p>Not rotating is unstable. Things simply <em>cant</em> not rotate for a long period of time. It is due to tidal forces.</p></div>		</li>
