<p>It also appears that, from what I understand, when you take away my debt of 60, I in turn, don't have any positive gains. However there is $60 I don't have to worry about any longer, is this correct? Because it was something I thought of while reading the explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we really want to stretch the analogy, place yourself in the shoes of the seller. </p>
<p>Let's say you've paid $60 to put some items on your shelves. (and now have 'debt' because you've spent $60 to stock your store). A customer will take those debts from you if they purchase the items. In this case, they 'take the debt' from you by literally giving you $60. </p>
<p>However, it's totally plausible that someone could 'take debts away' from you that you don't technically have (Resulting in positive gains). For example, if you steal a bunch of stuff, you have no monetary debts. When you sell the stolen goods, customers are 'taking away debts' from you by giving you $60. However you never had any debts! So you gain the $60.</p></div>		</li>
