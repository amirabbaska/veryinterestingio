<p>It's the combination of a type of protein around neural tissue and an acid.  Think of it as a complex bundle of things <a href="http://www.ilovebicycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Protein_HBZ_PDB_1jeb.png" target="_blank">like this</a> where you add acid, causing parts of it to get warped and tangled in a different way.  When they are in the correctly folded shape they will tend to move around and the different charges around the surface will typically do what it is supposed to do within the part of the body it operates.  When you have them misfolded they do something else.  There are a lot of proteins in the body, the proteins and lipids around the neural tissue happen to be the ones that will warp into a shape that breaks things in a manner that spreads.  The proteins from different animals tend to be different enough that the issue doesn't <em>always</em> translate across species, however it usually does (for instance there is a serious risk of getting prions from eating monkey brains, but it's nowhere near the borderline-absolute chance of getting it if you eat Human neural tissue.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure if it is a &quot;near absolute risk,&quot; I think certain tribes have a single infection that they pass around.  People who develop a prion by random misfortune develop a rare neurodegenrative disorder <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/08/31/436377464/scientists-discover-new-disease-caused-by-prion-protein" target="_blank">Multiple System Atrophy or MSA.</a>  Eating the brain of a person without MSA would probably be fine.  Most of us have no prions to spread, <em>probably</em>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry_of_Alzheimer%27s_disease" target="_blank">Alzehimers is a disease of protein misfolding.</a> It is possible that Amyoloid beta protein acts as a mild catalyst misfold the protein, like a prion.  In that case, cannabalising the brains of early stage Alzheimer's patients would be a problem.  It is much more likely that inflammation or other processes cause the misfolded protein to propagate, but the notion that alzehieimer's involves a prion is <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/09/alzheimers-protein-contagious" target="_blank">under current investigation</a></p></div>		</li>

For instance haemoglobin is a protein with a specific job, and a prion version of it (which doesn't exist) would turn all haemoglobin it touches to the prion version, but it wouldn't do anything to other proteins. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe part of the answer to this question lies in the concept of exponential growth.</p>
<p>Let us assume that an animal has acquired exactly one prion amongst the billions (actually, probably far more) of proteins within the brain.</p>
<p>Let's also imagine a scenario where the process of transmission of the misfolded pattern isn't necessarily instantaneous.</p>
<p>When taking these two things into account, you could theorize that during some currently undefined incubation period, one prion transmits its deformity to one single other protein. Now there are two prions, which in turn create two more new prions for a total of four. Modeling this growth exponentially, it makes sense (to me at least) that it would take some time for symptoms to appear, and for enough proteins to be affected.</p>
<p>Now I don't actually know exactly how the process occurs (I think no one really does), so I can't say exactly how many different ways misfolded proteins can affect healthy proteins, but I can imagine it would actually take some time for the few beginning prions to multiply enough to take noticeable effect in a living organism. That's why it seems like everything is fine one day, and then you suddenly and rapidly take a turn for the worse.
It's pretty terrible stuff though, that's for sure.</p></div>		</li>
