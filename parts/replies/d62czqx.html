			<p>My only contribution to this discussion was the example of cowbirds, which lay their eggs in the nest of an entirely different species, who then unwittingly raise the young as if they were their own. So those other species can't be too good at realizing that 5 is one more than 4 if they're consistency investing time and valuable energy into a chick that they didn't create. </p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, cowbirds murder the young of any birds that reject the cowbird eggs. They're like the bird mafia.</p>		</li>

			<p>It may not be their ability to count that keeps them from rejecting cowbird eggs.  There's support for an alternative hypothesis that they can tell when they're parasitized, but accept it and pay the consequences because they've learned that otherwise the momma cowbird will come and completely destroy their nest.  Better to lose three of your five chicks because you're busy raising a baby cowbird than to your whole nest because the cowbird mafia came back to punish you: <a href="http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2007/03/uf-study-first-to-document-evidence-of-mafia-behavior-in-cowbirds.html" target="_blank">http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2007/03/uf-study-first-to-document-evidence-of-mafia-behavior-in-cowbirds.html</a></p>		</li>

			<p>How does that prove that they can count? Perhaps the coot could smell the presence of a foreign egg? A possible control experiment would be to remove an egg and replace it with a foreign one. If the coot is examining the eggs on return then she was not counting, but detected it through another sense.</p>		</li>
