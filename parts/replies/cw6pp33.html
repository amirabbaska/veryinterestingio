			<div class="markdown"><p>sorry, thats not how tension works. if i have a long cabal and it has a tension of say 30N at any poin along it, it will exert 30N of force. if i have 2, 30N  short cabals in parallel they exert a force of 60N</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you say is true, however I think OP was talking about &quot;real life&quot; strength. And to calculate that you have to add in leverages. if you have biceps pulling on an arm that is 2S long with force 2N you'll be capable to curl X weight. Someone with biceps that can give 1N but who only has a distance S to &quot;pull on&quot; will ALSO be able to curl X weight. (X=X) So while the person with longer arms will be doing more work, since the wight is travelling twice as far, in the gym people would say they're equally strong, since they're lifting the same weight.</p>

<p>Think of it in terms of leverage.</p>
<p>If you imagine that your arms are twice as long but keep their original thickness, then yes you have twice the mass of muscle in your arms, but the double length means leverage is working against you in terms of the actual force you'll be able to exert.</p>
<p>So you've got double the muscle-mass, but following the principles of leverage this is exactly balanced-out by the longer forearms, so your strength isn't actually affected at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand if your arms are kept at normal length but become twice as thick, your arm-strength is doubled.</p>
<p>(This is true from a simple physical analysis at least. It's possible that physiology makes things more complicated than this in real humans.)</p>
<p>This effect is why insects and small animals are (to us humans) freakishly strong for their size. Ants, for example, can lift many times their own body mass without issue.</p>
<p>Aside: it's also why it would be difficult to be a giant. If you take a human and make them twice as wide, no problem. Make them twice as deep, no problem. Make them twice as high, and their 'proportional strength' diminishes as their strength stays the same despite being huge. Also, they'll need extra-strong bones that won't break under the additional strain.</p></div>		</li>
