			<div class="markdown"><p>In what sense do you use &quot;meaningful&quot;? In our state, of course at one point, renewable consumers were a tiny percentage of total customers. However, demand grew over time, and with it, awareness of the program and discussion.</p>
<p>Now we have this:</p>

<p>I would say that those first customers who bought renewable only energy packages were more meaningful than their market share would have indicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I'm curious what anyone in here thinks meaningful is, and what op wants to see as market impact. Does op mean market impact as in I get more $$ for saying I'll use renewables? Absolutely not. The purchaser will never get any net profit from paying more for the same amount of electricity in return. The impact will generally be for long term sustainability and eco purposes, as is with any renewable or recycling program. It's definitely a great thing, it just gets better the more people participate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>people who voluntarily paid extra to get renewable energy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Genuinely curious, why would they have to pay more? When I was looking for an electric provider a few months ago the all renewable company was on the cheaper end of the scale of all the ones that I looked at. They weren't the cheapest, but they were far from the most expensive. </p>
<p>I remember they ran a lot of commercials back when I had a TV so I assume they have a pretty large costumer base.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my area, we don't have any options for renewables only companies.  The only choice we have is to pay extra to our existing provider to get part of our supply from their wind farm.</p>
<p>We're getting milked, and we know it, but it's worth doing to know that we're encouraging them to expand their renewables infrastructure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are some parallels with the local biomass plant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I signed up for an all-renewables package that's about 5% more per kwh. But it's still FAR cheaper than a lot of contract-locked-in termination-fee-having no-clean-energy suppliers. Like, some are more than twice the price. So why would anyone use those? I'm guessing those are suppliers that send their people door to door, hoping to get suckers to sign up without doing their research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically you are asked to subsidize the development of renewable sources of energy. Building solar farms, wind farms etc requires tons of capital, so having consumers willing to pay more improves the ROI and the economic incentive to do so.
It is no different than any other product: when consumers are willing to pay more because of specific attributes, a market for goods targeting those needs emerge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>residential power usage accounts for something like less than 20% of total electric use over a 24 hour period. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=86&amp;t=1" target="_blank">60% is used in industrial processes, and the remaining 40% is split between Commercial and Residential.</a> Residential being the smaller portion thereof.</p>

<p>I used to work in a factory. The electric consumption was insane. The power bill was $250,000 <em>a month</em>. They installed motion sensor lights in the bathrooms and offices as part of a &quot;green initiative&quot;, but would leave 50 horsepower motors running for hours on end because the shutdown process was &quot;too complicated&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
