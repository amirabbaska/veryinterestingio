			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to what others said about photons carrying momentum, the full (relativistic) form of the energy equation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2 )^2 . The form more widely recognised, E=mc^2 is a low velocity approximation, as for massive bodies with low velocity pc&lt;&lt;mc^2 , so the pc term is ignored in the equation and the full version reduces to the better known version.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So that full equation is used for low mass bodies??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>p is momentum, c is indeed the speed of light.</p>
<p>Not really low mass bodies, but relativistic ones - where they have a large velocity. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor" target="_blank">Lorentz factor</a> is important in finding if a particle is relativistic, mostly when the gamma factor significantly deviates from 1 (see the graph around half way down the wikipedia page).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually to be more precise, for low velocity, E=mc^2 +p^2 /2m.    </p>
<p>mc^2 is the mass energy and p^2 /2m=(1/2)mv^2 is the classical formula for kinetic energy.</p>
<p>For a massless particle such as a photon, E=pc, with p=h.lambda and E=h.nu where nu is the frequency and lambda=c/nu is the wavelength of the particle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - for many intents and purposes, photons behave as if they had a mass of hv/c^2, where v is the frequency.</p></div>		</li>
