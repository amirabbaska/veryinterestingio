			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe some mosquito &quot;families&quot;, i.e. like 10,000 generations of them (100 years of mosquito ancestry, a human lifespan) do develop cancer, but every single mosquito lifespan only develops like 0.1% of cancer (or 0.1% of the total amount of mutation required to develop something we call cancer), which may lead to that &quot;family&quot; to go extinct, given enough time.</p>
<p>So it might just be them splitting the work of developing cancer over several generations. But yeah, I'm just philosophizing, and I'm not even sure if philosophizing is actually a word since I'm not a native speaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be a birth defect if it's just a tiny fraction of it that carries on and on? I mean it would be a birth defect if a Mosquito Generation 0 gave birth to a Mosquito Generation 5,000, but from Mosquito 0 to 1 and 1 to 2 there is such a small step that it's not even measurable. Which is where we get back to natural selection leading to those developing disadvantageous traits in the long run going extinct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly right, but the rate at which each species develops cancer is different.</p>
<p>E.g. naked mole rats a really unlikely to get cancer. Elephants also get fewer tumours than humans do. Dogs and cats can get cancer, and their lifespan is a fifth of ours.</p></div>		</li>
