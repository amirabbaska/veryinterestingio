<p>Additionally, the barrel is obstructed so there's only a tiny hole to allow the flash to escape, but not a bullet.</p>

<p>In many cases that's necessary for operation. Many semi-auto firearms won't cycle reliably with blank ammo - the absence of a bullet means the gases don't get to a high enough pressure to cycle the gun, so you need to fit a &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank-firing_adaptor" target="_blank">Blank Firing Adaptor</a>&quot; to make it cycle. Obviously for film usage you need an incognito adaptor disguised as a muzzle brake or something that fits as a barrel insert, rather than the big yellow/orange jobbies the military favour because they show <em>very clearly</em> that the gun has a BFA fitted and you shouldn't put live ammo down it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a key problem. The military have those BFAs and it is very easy to ensure that any weapons on an exercise are appropriately marked and loaded. The problem on a film set is that all the guns must look realistic. Sometimes, a scene will feature what looks like real bullets being loaded into a gun. It is difficult to maintain the safety around all that intentional ambiguity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I remember in shooter Mark whalberg shoots a Barrett .50 and kept pulling the slide back in between shots. For whatever reason they decided to keep that in rather than editing it out but that particular Barrett is semi automatic. The blanks just weren't strong enough to rack the slide for him.</p></div>		</li>
