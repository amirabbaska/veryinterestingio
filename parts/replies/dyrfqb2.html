			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be a significant change.  Today there are some small geothermal vents, the the plate tectonics around Yellowstone don't lend themselves to crust thinning and gradual release of energy.  It's more the super-sized version of Pompeii where everybody dies at the end of the movie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yellowstone seems to be maintaining its pressure via the geothermal venting (like the geysers).  As far as I've read, the metric for determining if Yellowstone will have a supervolcanic eruption has to do with the amount of molten rock in its magma chamber, and it was recently discovered to be much larger than before (but mostly empty).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>[This nice USGS webpage](<a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/monitoring_tomography.html" target="_blank">https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/monitoring_tomography.html</a> ) goes into that in some detail.  Most of the two magma chambers at Yellowstone are &lt;15% melt.  Lava starts to flow at 50% melt, and given the size of Yellowstone that would be quite a problem.  The area is under intense scrutiny, as the largest supervolcano on Earth, and there aren't any reports of significant melt increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been considered, but even a trillion dollar facility providing a huge amount of geothermal electricity wouldn't likely have a significant effect on Yellowstone and no one would know either way for like 1000 years.</p>
<p>The immediate effects could possibly be the reduction in geyser activity which diminishes the appeal of Yellowstone Park.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do.  But by lowering the pressure, this allows more magma to enter the chamber, so it would seem that the metric that vulcanologists care about more is the amount of magma in the chamber relative to its size (when talking about the supervolcano explosions.  Geothermal pressure buildup can contribute to lesser events regardless of the magma ratio)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  The geysers and the rest of the hydrothermal systems there remove heat (by transporting it from deeper to shallower levels, where it can ultimately cool off by loss into space).  But this, by itself, doesn't relieve pressure, which is generated not by water but by magma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to note the pressure is largely the result of gases in the magma. Unless the gas escapes the pressure will remain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe so. Geysers are created when underground water gets heated and boils, as the result of coming into contact with hot rocks. The pressure relieved is that which is contained inside the underground pool of water. Kind of like a covered pot that has begun boiling - the pressure created by boiling builds up inside the pot until it escapes from under the lid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If pressure is the issue, why not forcibly create a 'relief valve or valves'?  Granted, it could be the equivalent of putting a blasting cap on the end of a stick of Dynamite.  I mean, the thing is gonna blow at some point, so scientifically, it seems it's at least worth thinking about.. Assuming the obvious implications to the surrounding area can be managed (shit-ton of lava), is it even feasible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some major issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's expensive.  We're talking about a project in the billions, something similar in cost to the panama canal.</li>
<li>You chance setting off the volcano.  A hole too big or in the wrong place could cause an eruption.</li>
<li>The risk of eruption in the immediate future is very low.  We're monitoring the situation and if it changes I'm sure priorities will adjust.  As it stands its a huge expense with no immediate benefit.</li>
<li>You have to drill ridiculously far down to get there.  The deepest humans have ever drilled is 7.5 miles, the magma chamber rests in the 5-15 mile range.  To get that deep in a hole large enough to do something meaningful would be an impressive feat.</li>
<li>NASA proposed drilling down even <em>further,</em> seven miles down, to connect the water reservoir with the magma chamber.  The water would cool the magma, making it thicker and an eruption less likely.  Even if it still erupted, cooler magma wouldn't fly as far, so we might could avoid a catastrophic level event.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with relieving pressure is that, ironically, the pressure is the only thing that keeps it from exploding.  </p>
<p>There are dissolved gases in the magma.  The more gasses there are, the more explosive the magma is.  Like in a soda bottle, if you start to open it (relieving pressure a little), all the other dissolved gasses start coming out and it really gets going.</p>
<p>Also the difference in the amount of energy between what, say, a geyser produces and a full explosion is truly beyond comprehension.  You would need millions of geysers going to even make a dent on the energy.</p>
<p>Now, if there were a way to cool it without reducing pressure, that would be worthwhile.</p></div>		</li>
