			<p>Depends mostly where they are: your hands have a higher density of nerves that deduct pain so they will hurt more rather than a similar sized cut on your forearm or upper arm. When you cut yourself, your body has the inflammatory response and basically gets blockages up for any type of leaking fluid. That creates a barrier. As dirt accumulates on top it, you can assume that barrier is holding. Then when you use water in the shower, you're essentially cleaning away the barrier as well as the dirt and exposing the pain receptors that are open now. And if you're participating in any sports, you'll have some adrenaline running through your body OR you're at least focused on something entirely different than a minuscule cut on your body and your body will ignore it until you're in a more relaxed state. </p>		</li>
