			<div class="markdown"><p>And as stated elsewhere, this inherit logic is theorized to contribute to chinese children doing better at math. Instead of having to learn that eighty seven means eight tens and seven ones, it's right there in the language.</p>
<p>Also: I'm wondering how does the chinese language deal with fractional parts? For example in the english language to say 3.582, it would be three and five hundred eighty two thousandths. Does chinese break down the digits as three and five tenths 8 hundredths 2 thousandths?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For decimals: 3.582 is Three-dot-Five-Eight-Two. </p>
<p>I don't know if there really is a hundredth/thousandth transliteration.</p>
<p>Fractions are spoken with the denominator first. The general idea is, for x over y, &quot;Out of y parts total, x.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3.582 = 三点五八二 = &quot;three point five eight two&quot;</p>
<p>There aren't place names for those, but we do have fractions in our language. e.g.: 千分之一 &quot;one of a thousand parts&quot; = one thousandth, 百分之三 &quot;three of a hundred parts&quot; = 3%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough there's an ongoing rift between the &quot;American billion&quot; and the &quot;British billion&quot;. </p>
<p>In the UK traditionally different names were given to very large numbers than in the US despite a mostly common language. A hundred was ten times ten, a thousand ten hundreds, a million was a thousand thousands, and a billion was a million millions. A trillion was a million million million, and so on. Everything larger was a million times the last unit size name. What the US calls a billion used to be called a thousand million or a milliard. The US trillion was a billiard (or &quot;thousand billion&quot;). The US quintillion was a trillion, followed by the trilliard (or &quot;thousand trillion&quot;), etc.</p>
<p>In the US, a billion has always been said to be a thousand millions. Then a trillion is a thousand billions, and a quadrillion is a thousand trillions. The US has always been on this &quot;short scale&quot;.</p>
<p>Now with so much publishing, TV, radio, movies, Internet, and whatever other media spanning the Atlantic the UK has basically relented and and has been using US words for these larger sizes for a few decades. Older text written in British English may still contain numbers written in the older meaning. Basically the UK has moved from being a &quot;long scale&quot; country to a &quot;short scale&quot; country.</p>
<p><strong>TL,DR:</strong> The US is a short scale country. The UK used to be a long scale country which became a short scale country due to drift towards the US usage.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The long scale is ridiculous anyways. The scale of numbers that we use in ordinary conversation are more in line with million = 10^6 and billion = 10^9. There really is no need to extend the range of the terms billion and trillion, and besides milliard and million sound similar spoken aloud. Can you imagine talking about things like &quot;a hundred milliard dollars&quot;? It'd get confusing and people would think you were saying million.</p></div>		</li>
