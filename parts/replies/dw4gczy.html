			<div class="markdown"><p>Gin was traditionally sold at 'export strength' at 46.7%(ish). Most European countries have a higher tax threshold on spirits 40% and higher, so most spirits here at 37.5% as a result. Premium brand gins here (well, at least in the UK) are still usually 46.7%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're talking our your ass. The beer tax in the UK is split between 1.2 - 2.8%, exceeding 2.8 but not exceeding 7.5%, and exceeding 7.5%. </p>
<p>So there's not a difference on the tax between a shit Carling at 3.8% and brewdog IPA at 5.6% (fairly popular IPA on draught at a lot of pubs). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughly enough for a pellet of gunpowder to burn when soaked in it. TIL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term proof dates back to 16th century England, when spirits were taxed at different rates depending on their alcohol content. Spirits were tested by soaking a pellet of gunpowder in them. If the gunpowder could still burn, the spirits were rated above proof and taxed at a higher rate.[1] As gunpowder would not burn if soaked in rum that contained less than 57.15% ABV, rum that contained this percentage of alcohol was defined as having 100 degrees proof.[2] The gunpowder test was officially replaced by a specific-gravity test in 1816.</p>
