<p>That's because <em>t</em> is cast as a negative in spacetime coordinates. You can describe any event by a location and time</p>
<pre><code>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - t^2</code></pre>
<p>and have it remain consistent at any speed (from at rest relative to one another, to observation near the speed of light). However, doing so requires that, if we want to actively observe our event, <em>t</em> be a value that exists in our past (the light must bounce off the object, to be perceived by our eyes, meaning what we 'see' is fractionally in our past). If <em>t</em> was a positive number, we would be able to see things in our future light cone.</p></div>		</li>
