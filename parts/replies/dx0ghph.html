			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the question though is asking specifically why this happens with white shirts.... as opposed to darker colors.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert on pigment but not all white shirts are going to be see-through.  It really has to do with how sheer the shirt is, but even then, I think (and someone correct me if this is wrong) that bleached cotton is going to be more translucent than dyed cotton, and undershirts tend to be more sheer than t shirts, unless you're sourcing t shirts from a manufacturer who uses very sheer ringspun cotton.... I have some shirts that even in dark colors are see through when dry if there's enough light exposure.</p>
<p>You can see that happen with celebrities, for example, when paparazzi snap photos with a very bright flash... they're wearing extremely sheer cotton.  Here's an example of a dyed cotton that's more sheer than typical tees you will find (<a href="https://imgur.com/bzv9OwA" target="_blank">American Apparel Power Wash Tee</a>)... More expensive shirts from other suppliers are far more sheer than that, almost like panty hose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's like paint, the white doesn't come from the inherent color of the material, but from gaps in the material yielding a scattering and averaging of the ambient light, just like snow.  Fill the gaps with water and the effect is dampened reducing the scattered light.  Soak a white t-shirt with resin and let it dry and it will probably be just as translucent as with water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends... some shirts are bleached white and others, that might have some rayon in them, are dyed white.  So yeah if it's dyed white, then yes.</p>
<p>But as I noted it's a combination of the sheerness of the weave and the presence or absence of dye.  For example, <a href="https://imgur.com/sSnv6j5" target="_blank">this</a> is an unstretched, extremely sheer cotton tee that's dyed navy... and it's bone dry.</p>
<p>Undershirts, which tend to be white, also tend to be a bit more on the sheer side.  Maybe not as much as this tee I'm wearing, but certainly more so than your average Gildan or Anvil shirt that costs $1.39 and sells for $24 on Redbubble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of a bubble bath vs clear water. Bubbles are see through but with enough surfaces light can't figure out where to go to go through. Clear water has just one path through. When you wet the t-shirt it fills in all the bubbles.</p></div>		</li>
