			<div class="markdown"><p>Decomposition requires either biological action or hydro/mechanical action.</p>
<p>Obviously, if there's not enough oxygen and water for the seed to sprout, bacteria are likely to be inhibited as well. So, the seed is unlikely to be broken down like the uneaten tomatoes in the garen.</p>
<p>OTOH, even if you killed a seed so it wouldn't sprout, soaked it with germicidal sprays, and left it out, the elements would reduce it to dust (just as they do to rocks, only quicker). However, once again: in the permafrost the seeds were protected from freeze/thaw cycles, UV damage, and abrasion by winds and the like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want this answered as well! Maybe some sort of stabilizing enzyme? DNA has a half life to break down as well. It would take an awful lot of stabilization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anything is there to decompose it. It's like an insect trapped in amber. It might breakdown a bit, but only due to natraul decay. Humans and most animals are filled with bacteria that decompose us from the inside when we die. But seeds are essentially sterile as long as the shell is not cracked. (Kinda like how canned goods last a long time)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it's completely dry in there and the surroundings (hence the entire question of hibernating seeds for long periods of time without water), very tough survival situation for any bacteria or microscopic organisms.</p>
<p>Place a dry grain of rice in a 0% humidity box and see how long it takes anything to happen to it.</p>
<p>Now place a wet grain of rice in a damp container and see what happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good structural integrity, mostly. A seed's primary job is to house whatever &quot;startup&quot; nutrients the plant needs, as well as to protect the important stuff. That's basically it. There's not much that a microbe or another small organism could get to to decompose it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there is very little oxygen and water, there aren't many more common &amp; naturally occurring small molecules that can cause degradation. Oxygen and water would be the two major ones, and their presence would also indicate other potential hazards for the seed. If the seed isn't growing, it isn't in the presence of them.</p>
<p>Increasingly, we are also finding that enzymes stabilize other structures to avoid degradation. For example, LEA proteins are produced in low water or high salt environments to stabilize other crucial proteins and enzymes.</p></div>		</li>
