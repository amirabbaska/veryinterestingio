<p>Edit: Should have scrolled down further. This is what I was thinking of: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6u2l13/comment/dlpk34z?st=J6FHGBAK&sh=33471a23" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6u2l13/comment/dlpk34z?st=J6FHGBAK&sh=33471a23</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen that in surveys, but I assumed it was to weed out bots. Things like,</p>
<p>Which of these have you done in the past 6 months?</p>
<p>-Purchased or leased a new vehicle</p>
<p>-Gone to a live concert or sports event</p>
<p>-Gone BASE jumping in the Grand Canyon</p>
<p>-Traveled out of the country</p>
<p>-Stayed at a hotel for a business trip</p>
<p>-Visited the moon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also do variants of that approach which include events which are unlikely, but not impossible. For example, very few people will have both 'purchased a new car' and 'purchased a used car' in the past twelve months. </p>
<p>Of course, some people will have done both, but that's why most cheater screening uses a 'flags' system (i.e., multiple questions with cheater checks, excluding respondents who fall for &gt;X). </p>
<p>There are very few instances where you would want to exclude anyone on the basis of one incorrect response. One which I've occasionally used is age (ask people what census age bracket they fall into at the start of the survey, and what year they were born in at the end) - but even there real respondents will occasionally screw up and get flagged. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a good technique.  However, we aren't allowed to use that so much in our practice, because of the specific nature of our questionnaires.  But with respect to other fields, and online surveys, this is exactly right!</p></div>		</li>
