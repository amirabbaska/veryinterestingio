			<div class="markdown"><p>Reactors already have pretty intense containment domes around them. If you're saying, &quot;why don't they build an even bigger dome around that, filled with gravel on top, that would collapse in the event of breach of main containment&quot; — reactors are much larger than bombs, so the amount of the gravel and containment etc. would have to be huge. It would also probably make it so you no longer had any access to the reactor during an accident, which would be bad in most cases. In Chernobyl, things were bad enough that they used helicopters to dump sand into the reactor to try and stop the fires, and eventually &quot;entombed&quot; the whole thing in cement, and then (recently) added a massive ($1.6 billion USD) steel top to that, etc., but that's a pretty extreme situation.</p></div>		</li>
