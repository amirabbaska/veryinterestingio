			<div class="markdown"><p>It's perhaps one reason why different groups across the world have such varied musical styles, such as quarter-tones in eastern music, which to western ears can be either oddly disturbing or often missed entirely. I'm not a music theory expert but my mother is so I've picked up bits and pieces from her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Music IS cultural. A lot.</p>
<p>As westerners, for example, we perceive a regular beat as &quot;normal&quot;, and the one we are most used to is 4/4, followed by ternary beats such as waltz (3/4) or 6/8. Uneven beats throw us off. </p>
<p>Indian music has a much different metric system based on groups of 5 (iirc) <strong>of different durations</strong>. For a westerner it's completely unintellegible and our brains are not able to make any sense of it. But for an Indian person it's just normal.</p>
<p>As /u/ZenithMythos says, other cultures employ quarter tones or microtones which sound odd to us. And probably Bach's <em>Wohltemperierte Clavier</em>, the first important example of equal temperament utilized in music, sounded horrible to the first listeners who were used to &quot;exact&quot; temperament for each key. Now we are used to equal temperament and it's the standard for us, but this cultural change happened only in the last 300 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The irregular beat part throws me for a loop. I've sung songs in several languages and measures over the years, but one English song in 7/8 was harder to get down than a Mongolian piece in 4/4.</p>
<p>I also find some songs that SEEM off but aren't necessarily to be both fascinating and irritating. Like there's one song (Altair on the Starbound soundtrack of all things) that to me sounds like 5/4, but apparently is still just 4/4?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The octave and fifth are generally regarded as pitch relationships across the world, more specifically the octave.</p>
<p>In western music, many point to the concept of schenkerian analysis (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenkerian_analysis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenkerian_analysis</a>), TLDR: that all music is generally one &quot;cadence&quot;, or the shift of the I chord, to the V, and back to the one. Schenker believed all music can be reduced eventually to this simple formula</p>
<p>If you can buy that theory, then you could also buy that the mind would impress certain relationships onto the &quot;tonic&quot;, or fundamental pitch of any scale.</p>
<p>Although, these relationships can be subverted a bit. Subdominant relationships as an example: In the key of C, one would expect the 2nd diatonic chord to be dminor. G is V of C. If one plays a major D chord, the ear and mind expect the shift to the key of G, because D is V of G. Playing with subtle changes (literally changing the third of the D chord from minor to major) can impact the context of everything going on musically.</p>
<p>On a more simple level, inversions of chords sometimes mess with peoples perceptions. Consider a normal C chord:</p>
<p>G</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>or a second inversion C chord:</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>G</p>
<p>These are the same chord, but the tonic has been moved to a different voicing. Perception of &quot;the note&quot; would also depend on the voice leading between that chord and another chord, or, how each chord is shaped/inverted. </p>
<p>Tuning systems also vary, even amongst western music. Orchestras are famously known to tune A to 440, or 442, historically it has even been inflated as high as 451. All of these were considered &quot;concert pitch A&quot;.</p>
<p>TLDR: Not only is our perception of pitch and harmony culturally constructed, but it actually also just varies within western tonal music as well.</p>
<p>EDIT: 2nd inversion C chord is GCE, not GEC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;close&quot; voicing of a 2nd inversion would be. Chords are laid out this close for teaching/illustrative purposes rather than practical purposes. There is nothing to stop the chord being played how you have said, but inversions only state what note is in the bass, not the necessary order of the other notes. This can also be called/thought of as a &quot;slash&quot; chord (C major 2nd inversion becomes C/G).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The inversion is based on which note is in the bass, so you’re both right; any C-major triad with G as the bass note is the second inversion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do our brains perceive harmony to correspond to roots because of some physical interaction in those frequencies? Or is it because our system evolved that way and we're just trained to think that way? Or did the system evolve to be that way because of something physical?</p>

<p>Wouldn't this be fairly easy to test using people who've not studied music at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be pretty hard to find someone who had never been exposed to music but could also articulate what they're hearing. We're trained to hear a certain way from our exposure to the music around us, not by learning how to make music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nature actually published a study on this a year or two ago.</p>
<p>By studying an isolated tribe they found evidence supporting the idea that our harmonic preferences are indeed learned.</p>
<p>Time to find this paper and add it in as an edit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need to have people that have never listened to any music that uses harmonic structures. And that's basically just 12-tone/serial music. And no one only listens to these types of music, this is not an option.</p>
<p>Edit: just to clarify - it would be an option if there was someone who has never listened to music.</p></div>		</li>
