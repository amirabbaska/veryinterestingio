			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. The small grids in the screen are like a bunch of waveguides, and the waveguides have a cutoff frequency higher than that of the microwave.</p>
<p>When the 2.4GHz waves try to pass through a waveguide that has a cutoff frequency higher than 2.4GHz, the waves decay exponentially with the depth of the grid (evanescent wave). By the time the wave reaches the end of the grid, the side facing the outside world, there's almost no power left so the microwave doesn't really radiate anything.</p></div>		</li>
