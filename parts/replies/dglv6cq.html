			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, you  will reach your destination if you have your speed be the square-root of the remaining distance. </p>
<p>In this case, your speed is v(x)=x^(1/2)b, where b=Km^(1/2)/1hour and x is the remaining distance. This is actually a differential equation. By definition, dx/dt=-v(x)=-x^(1/2)b (it is minus because the distance decreases for positive v, maybe I should have used &quot;s&quot; instead of &quot;v&quot;). The solution in x for this is x(t)=(c-bt)^(2)/4, where, to simplify, we write c=10Km^(1/2). We have x(t)=0 at bt=c, which means t=10hrs. In general, if you start a distance d km away, it will take you sqrt(d) hours to get there.</p>
<p>So this is a similar situation, but you'll make it in the end. This might seem paradoxical because doesn't square-rooting numbers make them smaller? This is true, when the number you're square rooting is larger than 1. But we are necessarily working with numbers smaller than 1. In fact, our numbers are approaching zero! This means that, as you get closer, you speed will be large compared to your distance, so you can make it. </p>
<p>Challenge: For which exponents v(x)=x^(s) do you actually get to your destination? What if your speed is v(x)=x/log(x), which is slower than x^(1), but larger than x^(s) for any s&lt;1.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that really makes sense though? Wouldn't then the time change if we used different units? eg. when we are 100km away, we travel at 10km/h, but when we are 100000m away (the same distance), we travel at about 316m/h.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you change your units, you have to  change that b I have in there. If you convert to meters, then b=1km^(1/2)/1hour = sqrt(1000) m^(1/2)/1hour. So at 100km=100,000m, the velocity would be sqrt(100,000m)*sqrt(1000m)/hour, or 1000sqrt(100)m/hr which is 10,000m/hr, ie 10 km/hr. It all works out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, when you change the units for one side of the equation you need to adjust them for the other as well. So you have ((100km)^.5 ) ( km^.5 )/h = 10km/h.
You change it to ((100000m)^.5 ) (km^.5 )/h = 10km/h.<br />
Then adjust the other units: ((100000m)^.5 ) (31.6m^.5 )/h = 10000m/h</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Your answer is really eye-opening. </p>
<p>Okay, since there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. Let's say that the last speed is going to be 1 km/h when I'm 1 km away. Even if the distance becomes nearer, I will not change my speed.</p>
<p>So again, from 100 km/h at 100 km away. Then decreasing <em>continously</em> until reaching 1. When will I arrive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The explicit formula for your distance from the destination at time t is x(t)=100e^(-ct), where c=1/1hr. If you want to stop this at a distance x=1km, then you need to figure out how long it will take you to get to 1km, and then how long it will take from there. We know how long it will take from 1km: 1 hour, since it's 1 hour from each point. To figure out how long until 1km, you just need to solve 1=100e^(-ct), which is t=ln(100) hours, which is about 4.6 hours. So, if you stop this process at 1km, then it will be about 5.6 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer - got the exact same thing but using x(t) = 100e^-t + 100, where x is the distance traveled rather than distance left. I'm wondering how you arrived at the c term though - how did you set up your differential equation and what is the significance of the c value in this context? Is it the constant of proportionality?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If your distance from the point is plotted along the x-axis, you can see how your distance keeps getting smaller. But it will never actually reach zero. You've come up with an infinite, limitless scenario, which is represented mathematically by a graph like this. A line that keeps getting closer to zero but never actually gets there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is discrete, and OP only changes velocity by 10 km/h after every 10 km then total time can be calculated by summing up amount of time it takes to travel each 10 km segment. Therefore if &quot;T&quot; is total time then the equation is as follows: T= (10/100 + 10/90 + 10/80 + 10/70 + 10/60 + 10/50 + 10/40 + 10/30 + 10/20 + 10/10). Units are in hours. T = 2.93 hours.

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. 100%. Most comments were giving huge numbers, or even infinite numbers. Logically and mathematically not possible to retain an infinite in this scenario. Acceleration decreases incrementally, 10 km/h at a time, which means <strong>t = d/v</strong> at each increment, then sum up the values of <strong>t</strong> to get the exact time of arrival.</p>
<pre><code>t = time,
d = distance,
v = velocity.    </code></pre>
<p>The arrival time will be 2 hours, 55 minutes, and 44.2857 seconds.</p>
<p>Velocity will reach 0 km/h at the 100 km mark. It cannot be less or more than zero since velocity only decreases at the moment of reaching an increment.</p>
<p>To make sure I got it right, I calculated the total value of t using three methods, and they all matched the exact value I got with t = d/v. </p>
