			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the issues with travelling with a bank card. Both the hotel and rental car agency could potentially hold up to a combined $1000, which is now unavailable for your vacation. You have to plan for that when travelling. If you're the type who cuts it close, you could end up with no spending money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm sorry,  but if you're the type that cuts it <em>that</em> close,  you can't afford a vacation.  Or at least not that vacation: go somewhere cheaper. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's literally only an issue if you're paying via bank card. Depending on the credit cards you have, it's even more advantageous to book your services via it than your bank card besides no holds of funds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you use debit, the money is literally pulled out of your account immediately without that intermediate &quot;credit stage&quot;. This is a big deal, for example if you use it to check in at a hotel then the full amount of the hotel's holding amount will immediately be pulled out of your checking account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not entirely true. It is actually an authorization hold that effectively makes that portion of your balance unusable as it then becomes earmarked for the hotel's use. </p>
<p>It's not like if you had $100, and the hotel did an auth hold of $100, that your visible ledger account balance is now $0. The money does not physically leave the account until the charge is finally passed through, however your available balance is now $0. This means if you try to process another transaction, you'll be overdraft. </p>
<p>If the hotel is doing it correctly, you'll never see on your monthly statement a -$100 debit to your checking account when you check in and then a +$100 credit when you leave. The original authorization will simply not post to complete the transaction and your available balance will be restored.</p>
<p>The easiest way to tell the difference is if the hotel asks you to enter your PIN. If they do, it is an actual transaction that will debit your account. If they don't ask for the PIN, they are running your debit card as credit, and will result in the authorization hold (for whatever amount they are asking for) against the balance in your checking account. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why it's better, if at all possible, to use a genuine credit card instead of a bank's card, regardless of whether you run that card as debit or credit.  With a real credit card, authorizations like this might eat into your limit but they never restrict your use of your actual money.  </p>
<p>If you have enough discipline to not buy things with a credit card that you wouldn't buy with your bank's card, to pay it off on time every time, and can get one with no fee (or are savvy enough to know when the fee is worthwhile for the rewards), then you should always get and use a credit card over other options.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you come across a POS system that just puts up a PIN screen look for OTHER, USE SIGNATURE, or just press the OK button and it will run as credit. </p>
<p>Also, FYI they are getting rid of the requirement for signatures so you may not have sign. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some places don't let you do that. Either CVS or Walgreens (I always mix those two up) require you to press the yellow button when it asks for your PIN. But it doesn't say that on screen, and half the time the cashiers have no clue either.  Some other places require you to actually press the red cancel button. So YMMV, in a nutshell.</p></div>		</li>
