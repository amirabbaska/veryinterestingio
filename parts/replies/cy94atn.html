			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this answer, this gradual movement away from a 24 hr rhythm occurs in most experimental animals.</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which the clock actually keeps track of ~24 hr are actually relatively well defined. At a molecular level the passage of time is measured by the time it takes for a biochemical &quot;cycle&quot; to take place.</p>
<p>Four genes (and the proteins that they encode) are central to this cycle. The proteins BMAL1 and CLOCK activate the transcription and translation (turning ON a gene, to turn it into protein) of the genes PER and CRY in the nucleus of the cell. The resulting PER and CRY proteins diffuse out of the nucleus, where they bind together. They then move BACK into the nucleus, when they stop the BMAL1 and CLOCK proteins from turning on the transcription PER and CRY (themselves!).</p>
<p>This results in a feedback loop, where BMAL1 and CLOCK activate genes that are turned into proteins that then turn off their own activation. The time it takes for the proteins (PER and CRY) to turn their gene activation off (and thus stop more PER and CRY protein being made) defines a ~24hr period biologically. There are many good diagrams of what this looks like - <a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v13/n11/fig_tab/nn.2668_F1.html" target="_blank">here</a> the loop is visible on the far left hand side. This central core loop has additional functions, and so the 4 proteins involved do more than turn each other on and off - for example, CLOCK and BMAL1 bind lots of other genes, including REV-ERB and ROR family genes, which are involved in regulating metabolism. This allow metabolism to be fine-tuned depending on time. It's a very ingenious set up.</p>
<p>Almost all cells in the body contain this clock mechanism, and can regulate their own time independently to a certain degree - it's just that the master clock in the brain takes light signals from the eyes to set up this clock in the first instance, and to make sure the time stays regular and linked to the environment. This allows the master clock to set time based on the sunlight, and then let peripheral clocks in other organs know the &quot;time&quot; to allow them to time their physiological roles.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as well as the clock in all cells regulating metabolism, metabolic cues can directly alter the clock - in particular, the cells of the liver rely on signals from food ingested to tell them what enzymes to produce at which times, for example in preparation for meals. Moreover, different foods alter the liver clock in different ways.</p>
<p>I'm actually editing a review on this topic at the moment. It's fascinating stuff.</p>
<p>TL;DR: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Master clock in the brain takes light signals from the eyes to &quot;set&quot; itself and keep itself set. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This master clock tells other clocks throughout the body what &quot;time&quot; it is. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These clocks throughout the body also take time cues from other environmental factors like food</p>
</li>
<li>All of these clocks in all cells in the body are based on the same biochemical cycle of genes and proteins that self-regulates and lasts ~24 hr</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's remarkable, isn't it? It might be worth pointing out also that some researchers believe similar phase locked loops that occur in cycles of oxidised and reduced compounds also has the same time-keeping function - they seem to be relatively common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In plants, our best understanding of the clock is that it's a repressilator</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressilator" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressilator</a></p>
<p>Gene regulatory networks are full of all sorts of Boolean logic, as well.</p>
<p>It's important to note, though,that biology is a lot more messy than you might think from all this.  A big part of the prevalence of 'neat and clean' stories in biology comes from selection bias; those are the ones that are easiest to study/understand.  Lots of very important developmental switches are the result of many interactions that behave in counter-intuitive ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first guess at why we go to a ~28-hour cycle in the absence of cues would be that it's easier to phase-lock a loop that has a natural frequency a bit too long, than one that has a natural frequency a bit too short.</p>
<p>Is there any fundamental engineering reason to prefer to err on the side of having your resonant frequency too low rather than too high?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting, i'd heard about this but not with this kind of details, thanks !</p>
<p>Two questions as a follow up. Where is master clock ? (like where in the brain ?) and how does it communicate with the other clock ? In the diagram you provided, CLOCK is the only transcription factor not shown to be produced in the cell. Is it this protein ? But aren't protein a bit big to diffuse throughout the entire body ?</p>
<p>edit : okay, that's 4 question, actually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The master clock is in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, which is in the brain. Communication between clocks takes place via neural signals, although exactly how this occurs isnt well known. </p>
<p>CLOCK and BMAL proteins are expressed (from genes) in all (well, the vast majority) cell types - this means they don't have to diffuse throughout the body - each cell has its own intrinsic clock, produced from expression of its own genes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else worth noting is the submarine crews deployed operate on an 18hr day.  6 hrs on duty and 12 hrs off duty.  Initially a 4 on / 8 off was tested but with the need for study, testing, and eating caused crews to rack up a sleep debt and become less alert.</p>
<p>If there's no sun and sufficient sleep the system seems pretty malleable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to keep in mind-- the malleable system your example demonstrates pertains to behavioural cycles and not endogenous circadian cycles. Behavioural cycles, such as rhythms of sleep, can be dramatically manipulated by external factors.</p>
<p>The circadian clock, on the other hand, exhibits &quot;limits of entrainment&quot; with regards to its period (for humans, I believe the limits are around 22 and 26h). To clarify, the circadian cycle would not align to cycles of light with a period of e.g. 18 hours. Instead, it would &quot;free-run&quot; with a period of around 25h. *Free-running is the term used to describe the cycle's behaviour in constant conditions, such as in the experiment in which subjects were placed in a cave in constant darkness.</p>
<p>The misalignment of behavioural cycles and the internal circadian clock is prominent in shift workers and is associated with increased rates of cancer, metabolic syndrome, and lots of other unpleasant conditions.</p>
<p>tl;dr system isn't actually that malleable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4 on 8 off would be perfect though. 4 hours on, 8 hours off to study/eat/test, 4 hours on, 8 hours off to sleep, repeat.</p>
<p>It fits in a 24 hour day, and provides ample recreation time, without sacrificing anything.</p></div>		</li>
