<p>In stars, the pressure is huge, and the temperature is huge, but the real key to fusion in stars is sheer number of atoms. The  odds of two nuclei passing close enough to fuse is ridiculously low (hence the sun burning hydrogen for 10 billion years), but because there are so many of them, they over come the probability issue. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun fact classical calculations show that the probability of two nuclei overcoming repulsion and fusion at temperatures and pressure at the centre of the sun is still too low to sustain fusion at the rate at which the sun is doing so ... It's quantum tunneling that shows there is a higher probability enough for sustainable fusion at the sun's core .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also stars operate at a really low power per unit volume.  The power per unit volume for the sun's core is about the same as a compost heap on earth.  This still equates to a lot as the sun is big,  but any fusion reactor we make will have volume limitations. We need a much hotter denser plasma with a much higher fusion rate. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Say I somehow had a 1 cubic meter piece of the sun, would it not burn me alive if I hold it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about a roller coaster with 2 equally high peaks. If a cart falls from one, it will almost go over the other, but not quite. Classically, it will never overcome the hill. If it were a quantum system, its wave function would &quot;bleed&quot; over into the other side of the hill (the downhill slope), kind of like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/TunnelEffektKling1.png/300px-TunnelEffektKling1.png" target="_blank">this</a>. Since there is some non-zero probability of finding the particle (the cart in my poor example) on the other side of the barrier (the hill), even though classically it can never overcome the barrier (or go over the hill), in quantum mechanics, there is a probability of the particle passing through the barrier. Even if its 0.001%, it still happens 1 in a 100000 times (ish), which is a lot when you're dealing with millions/billions/etc. of particles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would help if I could draw pictures,but here goes. For two nuclei to stick together they have to overcome the electric repulsion. So it's like trying to roll a ball into a valley but there's a hill in the way. You have to roll the ball fast enough to make it over the hill. But in quantum mechanics you can cheat. Even if you don't have enough energy to make it over the hill there's a small chance you can just spontaneously end up on the other side anyway. The thinner the hill and the closer you get to the top the greater the chance of cheating. When it comes to nuclei fusing together this means they don't have to be moving quite so fast, which means a lower temperature is required to sustain fusion. </p></div>		</li>

<p>horizontal axis is distance from nucleus, vertical axis is energy. green line is electrostatic repulsion, blue line is residual strong force attraction, red line is their sum. classically a particle would need to have enough kinetic energy to get over the red &quot;hump&quot;, but a quantum particle can tunnel under the energy barrier so long as it's &quot;downhill&quot; and narrow enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, proton-boron fusion is a thing, because it could eventually eliminate the need for neutron production and contrast to tritium, both fuels are abundant on earth. However, the reaction rate is orders of magnitude lower than for deuterium-tritium, making it unreachable anytime soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Source? I've just never heard of that. It sounds a little absurd to me though. Lets just look at stars again. More massive stars (1.3+ solar masses) use the CNO cycle to generate most of their energy in their main sequence phase. This requires more extreme (more pressure, more temperature) conditions than the sun. So that leads me to believe a boron-proton reaction is unlikely to be better than deuterium-proton or deuterium-tritium. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So the fact that any boron (along with lithium and beryllium) that is present in stars is almost instantly burned up leads you to believe that boron would be a bad choice for fusion?  </p>
<p>Stars need fusion processes that are painfully slow in order to have non-trivial lifetimes (i.e. not instantly burn all their fuel and die). This is a 'bad thing' when you're trying to use fusion as a terrestrial power source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it was Wikipedia ( I'm not sure, I could easily be wrong), it said that for aneutronic fusion, the research focused on boron-proton fusion because it was cheaper. Deuterium-tritium fusion is way easier, but it releases its energy in neutrons.</p></div>		</li>
