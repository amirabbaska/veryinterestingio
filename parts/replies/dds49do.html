			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if an artifact gets discovered and donated to a museum later, it's scientific value is often incalculably diminished. Archaeologists can't really tell much about the past from seeing an artifact in a vacuum. They rely on seeing it in context, which means knowing where it came from and what other artifacts were around, and even better, in situ, which means seeing exactly where it is. For example, many artifacts can't be carbon dated themselves, either because they are made of inorganic material or because radiocarbon dating is a destructive method and people don't want to cut off a sample, but the stuff that was buried right next to them could have been. </p>
<p>Also, many museums are notorious for buying stolen artifacts. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/arts/design/19bowl.html" target="_blank">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> has a long history of skirting antiquities laws, for example. With all the other pressing concerns in the world it's hard to get people to pay attention to lax antiquities laws, but valuable information about our shared cultural heritage is being irretrievably lost every day thanks to unscrupulous antiquities dealers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly true. One important thing to figure out is that art thieves will never get the full value of a piece. Usually they get pennies on the dollar. But hell, even 1/100 of a dollar is a pretty nice payday for a nights work when they have nabbed 6 million dollars in art. </p>
<p>It's also worth noting that a lot of pieces can be pretty easily lifted from the archive of a museum and nobody would notice for months. Usually what's out on the floor for the public to see is less than half of what's in the collection of a museum, so most of it is just locked away in drawers other kind of storage. So by the time someone's noticed a piece missing, the thief is LONG gone and likely fenced it. </p>
<p>The recovery rate for stolen art is low...like...super low. Like you said, many times a piece will change ownership over and over again until the person who has it, has no knowledge it was ever a stolen piece and often had no idea what the real value is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about people unwrapping mummies post mummy media boom in the 90s. Think of all that dna and archeological stuff destroyed. Maybe it is because im poor. but i sometimes feel like certain things shouldn't be allowed to be private property. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There definitely is that kind of idea in archaeology, put for a lot people these might be family heirlooms that have a lot of sentimental value to them. As for unwrapping mummies, and so forth, a lot of this kind of data has been destroyed by a lot of people, even archaeologists. Sites are excavated according to the practices and conventions of the time, and those change and are revised constantly. What one might think of as useless to the archaeological record may be able to be analyzed in the future to draw some answers from the site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You think that's bad, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy_brown" target="_blank">&quot;Mummy Brown&quot; pigment</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mummy brown was originally made in the 16th and 17th centuries from white pitch, myrrh, and the ground-up remains of Egyptian mummies, both human and feline... Mummy Brown eventually ceased being produced in its traditional form later in the 20th century when the supply of available mummies was exhausted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They ground up mummies for paint until they <em>ran out of mummies</em>.</p></div>		</li>
