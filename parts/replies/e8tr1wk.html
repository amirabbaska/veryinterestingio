			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, since we are running into the physics limits of Moore's Law there's a lot of research being done into trinary and other sorts of computing again, hoping that the increased bit-types might be able to push us back on the slope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually use ternary type systems today.  TCAM is used in networking equipment as an example.  In bitwise comparison options, we can basically say &quot;this bit must either be a 0, be a 1, or can be either&quot;.  TCAM is found in the part of a switch or router most directly responsible for forwarding actual frames or packets, and is programmed by a shower but more versatile supervisor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Early digital computers did not have transistors but used switches and relays instead. The reason has less to do specifically with transistors and more generally that binary data is easiest to store and manipulate with electronic technologies.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just ease of representation, otherwise we'd be building base-10 computers. Binary is both very convenient for building machines and for representation. </p>
<p>And it's not like the moment we made the first binary machine we were suddenly stuck with it forever. If there was a compelling reason to switch to a different numeration system then we'd do it. But there's not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true. The CMOS process we used today (which is the only viable and reliable way to manufacture chips as the scale we do) isn't well suited for ternary applications. It's not impossible to create ternary logic within a CMOS circuit, it's going to be larger and less efficient overall. That's not to say that it's impossible for there to exist a fabrication process that is well suited for ternary gates, obviously there hasn't been much research into this. But there's so many other reasons (like digital communication) to stay with binary systems, so there's a reason nobody is really doing ternary research. </p>
<p>When you get down the nitty gritty, it's hard to imagine a ternary system that's more power efficient. Right now, everything is on or off.  We like them being off because it's not wasting any power when it's off. In a ternary system, we've got 2 on states and one off state. That's twice the amount of states that can use energy as state that don't. In a post dennard scaling world, we likely can't support devices that burn power like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point was that binary was suited to previous technology as well as current technology . So the answer to &quot;why <em>were</em> bits  the powers of 2&quot; is not just because of transistors only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth pointing out that many digital communicatiom schemes have more than 2 symbols. That's one of the reasons we need modems. There's a reason we talk about baud rate and bit rate separately. FSK, PSK, and QAM are all commonly used with more than 2 symbols.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, as a general rule, any system that would allow you to measure a voltage as more than 2 values could instead be used to measure that same voltage as binary <em>even faster</em> by being less precise.</p>
<p>Digital always boils down to analog at some level. 0 is &quot;very low&quot; voltage and 1 is &quot;close to the top&quot; voltage, for whatever the circuit was designed for.  If you could have a clean value &quot;in the middle&quot;, you'd still be better off by only writing lowest and highest and then reading that value faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said.  Sometimes off isn't zero volts.  And on Isn't  always full voltage.  Trying to add a third state to those tolerances would be pretty hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer, I think. No matter the system, you’re always measuring the <em>difference</em> between voltages to represent a value. Two values is always going to be the most simple representation, and it scales directly with the ability of hardware to measure smaller differences.</p>
<p>Simple is better when you can crank a lot of cycles, so any advantages of higher base systems get wiped out quickly.</p></div>		</li>
