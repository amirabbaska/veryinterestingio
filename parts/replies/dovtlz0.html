			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. The concentrations of economic deposits of, say gold, are not migrated by magmas, but by hydrothermal fluids to the final emplacement site.    There is a huge difference between elements that can be mobile in magmas vs fluids.  Magmas will move materials through the crust and mantle, but will not typically concentrate typical ‘economic’ deposits.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there are other circumstances like tectonic movement that can impact non-molten sediment, but I don't know enough of the specifics to give an accurate explanation. /u/icefoxen can likely give you some specific examples, but if I remember by couple of college courses that's a brief estimation of how some gold ends up in river banks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this happens to gold nuggets and other heavy minerals, like magnetite (an iron ore).  When you have basically sand-sized particles the denser ones tend to collect in places like the bends of rivers where you have water moving quickly (which easily carries relatively-heavy grains) followed by the water slowing down (so the heavier minerals settle to the bottom of the stream and can't get picked up again).  It's easiest to make things move and make chemical reactions happen when they're liquid or dissolved in liquid, though.  The Moon, as a body with no liquid water, no atmosphere, and which was only very volcanically active briefly after its formation, probably has a lot fewer ore bodies than Earth.</p>
<p>Under high heat and pressure you can also have rocks/minerals deform and &quot;creep&quot; very slowly without actually being melted or dissolved, but I'm not aware of major types of ores being formed this way.  Doesn't mean there aren't any though!  (correction: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore_genesis#Metamorphic_processes" target="_blank">there are some but not many</a> .)</p>
<p>Plate tectonics, as far as I know, isn't <em>directly</em> involved in making the types of ore bodies I'm aware of.  But it's <em>really</em> good at stirring things up and making interesting environments for strange stuff to happen in.... volcanoes, hot springs, and mountains being formed and eroded are all great places to get rare and interesting processes.  The world is big enough and old enough that just about any set of circumstances where you would say &quot;yeah but what are the chances of something like THAT happening&quot; has probably happened six or seven times, if not much more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, you often get mixes of elements in magma that intrudes into higher cooler layers of rocks, then hits chemistry (different elements dissolved in water for example) which causes just certain elements to be deposited, say in a rock crack, where the water is present at very high temperature.  Over time the tiny amount of, say, gold that gets left in the crack fills the entire crack with a &quot;vein&quot; of gold.  The rock with the crack erodes and the gold &quot;vein&quot; gets washed into streams in chunks giving you gold dust/nuggets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your mention of gypsum brings a up a good point I'd like to piggy back off of this with.</p>
<p>I live in one of those areas that gets a buildup of water with nowhere for it to go. Except instead of salt we have gypsum.</p>
<p>Here in the Tularosa basin of Southern New Mexico, between the San Andres and Sacramento Mountains, we have a large deposit of gypsum. The mountains in this area are fairly rich in gypsum, and when it rains the water flows through the mountains, picking up some of the gypsum mineral, and then flows into the only place it has to go-the basin. And then it stays there. And this is the desert, so the water evaporates fairly quickly.</p>
<p>And for the past 10,000 years or so this cycle has been going on, depositing more and more gypsum into the basin, where it gets blown around by the desert winds until it breaks apart from little crystals into what is basically sand. At this point we have miles and miles of dunes of gypsum that stretch through the basin, and it's actually starting to expand into one of the nearby highways. It even made it as a stand-in for Qatar in the first Transformers movie.</p>
<p>This may sound like a prime location for a drywall manufacturer to set up shop, but thankfully having the only gypsum field like this in the world earns it some protection. You probably know it better as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_National_Monument" target="_blank">White Sands National Monument</a>.</p></div>		</li>
