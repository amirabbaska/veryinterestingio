			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I attended fifth grade at a public school, but that very year, the elementary school principal pulled me out of class and personally drove me to the high school to use THE computer, back when the whole school district had exactly one computer. The computer was the size of a dishwasher, built out of hundreds of little circuit boards that all plugged into a hand-wired backplane. This computer also came equipped with complete schematics for all the circuits, so I could really learn how it all worked.</p>
<p>Once, when the computer failed, I tracked down which circuit must have gone bad and told my findings to the company service technician that was called in to fix it. He told this little punk to just go away and quit bothering him, so I retreated to the corner of the room and watched him work for a couple of hours before he gave up and quietly replaced the circuit board that I told him was bad - and that fixed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I genuinely can't tell if this is a long-winded sarcastic response or if you really did completely miss the sentiment of my response. To be clear, the point is that this subreddit is named ELI5, and your response clearly was not in layman's terms. </p></div>		</li>
