			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s due to abnormal neural crest cell migration. There’s cells very early on near your spinal cord that eventually become many things around the body (melanocytes, your peripheral nerve system, etc.). These have to migrate from your back and form structures of the heart and face which is why heart defects (like single AV valve) are common as is the facial structure. </p>
<p>Neural crest cell migration is also part of the reason for dogs losing color on their face as the age, animals having white bellies, and men bald the way they do. Neural crest cells have to migrate all the way from back to front so sometimes they don’t make it or are the first to go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also the reason some dogs that are solid colors (black, liver) have a small white spot on their chests (and this it’s not considered a fault for most breeds). This white spot is caused by lack of melanocytes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's neat. My dog is mostly black, but she has a really thin white strip down her chest, and some white peppered around her muzzle. That explains why.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A certain percentage (I forget the exact amount) of those with Down syndrome might have an obstruction somewhere along their digestive tract that can prevent proper digestion of food. Meaning they can eat it but it’s not going anywhere or doing anything for them. They can get surgery to correct it when it’s diagnosed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s another condition hall Hirschprung disease (congenital megacolon) seen in Down syndrome. It’s again failure of neural crest cell migration all the way the GI tract so you have no motor nerves near the rectum. The famous “Squirt sign” describes the phenomenon where a physician can insert a finger in the baby’s rectum and feces will squirt out relieving the obstruction. Failure to pass meconium (first poop) is a warning sign. </p></div>		</li>
