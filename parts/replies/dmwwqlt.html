<p>This is true that they can technically print currency and spend it, thereby incurring a gain from printing of money.  However, it is NOT true that this form of spending incurs debt since there is no commitment to repay that.  Like you say, its basically spending via inflation.  </p>

<p>The money that is printed is US TREASURY notes--it's a debt that the government now owes to whoever bears that specific treasury note.  </p>

<p>This is not true in the sense that we all run around earning and spending treasury notes.  Treasury notes issued as government debt are NOT paper money in the US.  Paper money is a <strong>Federal Reserve Note</strong>  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry you got me on the second part.  I meant they were Federal Reserve Notes that the Fed prints on behalf of the gov't, even though they're not a gov't entity.  This isn't technically issuing debt, even though they're issuing fed reserve notes (and historically, your bank certificate was representative of debt) but the idea is that issuing more money causes the value to go down because money is not inherently valuable.  </p>
<p>I only touched on the debt part after reading my post--I spent a lot of time sidetracked--so I didn't catch the (pretty big) mistake earlier.  Let me see if I can clarify it.  </p>
<hr />
<p>Debt is formally issued through US Treasury Notes/Bonds (which I mistakenly called cash) which is actually the gov't raising money through debt.  You give them a principal amount, say $1000, per bond and they repay you coupon payments (interest payments) overtime and then returns the principal amount back to you after some time.  They basically borrow $1,000 per bond sold and then repay you back $1,000 with incremental payments overtime.  </p>
<p>Federal reserve notes aren't debt, because those notes won't be paid back just because they print more money nor do they increase their liabilities from printing more money (as you correctly said).  Raising and lowering the money supply is part of the job of the Federal Reserve and is done through reserve rates and other restrictions that they can place on banks (to force them to hold more cash, thereby reducing their loanable money supply, or vice versa).  This tightening and releasing of the money supply is the job of the Fed to curb inflation, manage interest rates, and other macroeconomic factors.</p>
<p>Printing money is not a common method of increasing the money supply (although quantitative easing was a contentious issue in recent past years) but it's kind of a good example to illustrate the issues of an increasing money supply relative to the actual GDP of a country.  In other words, you can't just solve your problems by printing more money and saying you're richer.  You just divided the total value of that money between more units rather than actually increasing the total amount of money you have.</p>
<p>Monetary policy (policy to control the money supply) usually involves actions by the Federal Open Market Committee to raise and lower the money supply, which is usually done through various methods such as setting target rates (which is related to controlling interest rates and the general economic environment of the US--higher interest rates encourage saving and lower interest rates encourage borrowing and spending).  </p>
<p>So you might ask why the gov't borrows money instead of just printing more.  This is why I touched on this earlier in my other post--if they just print more money, they're not raising money (per se) but simply transferring the value around.  So while the gov't might still end up with more money in the end, they've effectively just taken it from everyone else in the country.  It's not actually improving the economy.  This is, in part, why quantitative easing was so contentious.  </p>
<p>What is QE?  Well, the govt' basically is in need of money but people aren't buying up their bonds because low interest rate environments deter people from saving/investing--it's just not worth it for 2%.  So what do they do?  They print more money and use this newly printed money to BUY things with it, specifically their own debt.  That's kind of a big no-no.  You don't just print money so you can quickly satisfy your needs, you do it for the big picture.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we did it, twice.  </p>
<p>It's typically done to 'jump start' the economy (at least theoretically) but a side effect we have been experiencing from it is continually low interest rates.  If you own a savings account, you're probably receiving chump change on it, maybe 1%? It's safe but who the hell wants 1%?  </p>
<p>No one does and because we're already in low interest rate environments, Treasury notes and bonds are also extremely low interest.  This means no one wants to buy it so the gov't buys their own debt.</p>
<p>This is starting to get into more complicated and unrelated territory, so I think that's a good place for me to stop.  Although looking back, I feel bad for how little my post actually went towards addressing OP's question.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing that out, I must have been typing too fast and not thinking about what I was writing and thinking more about what I'd be writing next and made some bad errors.  I don't think this caused a chain reaction in my post so I think everything else still holds mostly true.  </p>

<p>I totally didn't believe you.  Paper is heavy too!  But a $100 bill weighs about a gram.  It takes 1000 $100 bills to have $100,000.  So a kilogram.</p>
<p>A kilogram of gold is ~32.15 troy ounces.  Current price of gold is ~$1331/troy ounce, so ~$42815 worth of gold.  Checks out!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's not at all easier to carry. It is heavier <em>and</em> less dense, so it takes up way more physical space than the same value in gold would.</p>
<p>The real advantage is that cash is much easier to know the exact value of at a glance and much more convenient for exchanging arbitrary amounts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What counts as money is really a signifier, a token of sorts, within a system. In very basic systems, all the other party knew was that gold (for whatever reason) was counted as money. Now, with bank IT systems coordinated across national boundaries, you don't need physical dollars or pounds or rubles or euros, just ones and zeros.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The government prints money to replace worn-out money already in circulation.  Money is &quot;created&quot; by different types of loans through the Federal Reserve, and also by the fractional reserve banking system used by basically the entire world.  There is nothing wrong with printing money, per se, but I understand that some people use the term as a shorthand for monetary creation.</p></div>		</li>
