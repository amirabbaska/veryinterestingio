			<div class="markdown"><p>The theory I read (which another poster already outlined above) claimed that parasitic intestinal infections have become significantly less common in modern times than they used to be. Humans evolved to coexist with the (formerly inevitable and incurable) parasitic infections in times past, and our immune system now can't function properly without the parasites, giving rise to autoimmune disorders.</p>
<p>Fwiw, I've seen zero proof of this line of thinking, just a theory. As far as actually RCTs examining the effect of intestinal parasites on autoimmune conditions, I have not looked, though it would be quite the revelation in medicine, and imagine it would reach my desk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Total proctocolectomy is curative. This doesnâ€™t really answer the questions because having a Helminth infection is so rare unless you visit certain areas it is on no way beneficial and is such a devastating illness (dealing with aggressive diarrhea at best to colorectal cancer or an ostomy at worst). </p></div>		</li>
