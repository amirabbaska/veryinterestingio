			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll second this. I'm a paramedic in Los Angeles and I have never heard of different BLS (basic life support) or ACLS (advanced cardiac life support) algorithms for drowning versus cardiac arrest. The AHA recommendations are the same for any pulseless arrest. <a href="https://eccguidelines.heart.org/index.php/circulation/cpr-ecc-guidelines-2/part-10-special-circumstances-of-resuscitation/" target="_blank">https://eccguidelines.heart.org/index.php/circulation/cpr-ecc-guidelines-2/part-10-special-circumstances-of-resuscitation/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quoting the page you linked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first and most important treatment of the drowning victim is the immediate provision of ventilation. Prompt initiation of rescue breathing increases the victim’s chance of survival. Rescue breathing is usually performed once the unresponsive victim is in shallow water or out of the water. Mouth-to-nose ventilation may be used as an alternative to mouth-to-mouth ventilation if it is difficult for the rescuer to pinch the victim’s nose, support the head, and open the airway in the water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite as prescriptive as UK guidelines which recommend five rescue breaths prior to commencing CPR in drowning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry. I was citing the acls guidelines. &quot;Victims in cardiac arrest may present with asystole, PEA, or pulseless VT/VF. For treatment of these rhythms, follow the appropriate PALS or ACLS guidelines. Case reports of pediatric patients document the use of surfactant for fresh water–induced respiratory distress, but further research is needed.526-529 The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe hypothermia after submersion has been documented in case reports.515,516,530&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unconscious drowning victims are also rapidly losing temperature regulation from being in water, which makes pulse detection more difficult due to the physics of the situation as well as the high probability that if they do still have a pulse, then it is probably decreasing in rate and quality very quickly. This is why you administer rescue breaths - on the off chance that the ventilation is enough to keep them going or even stimulate spontaneous respiration, maybe, hopefully, but probably not. </p>
<p>Rescue breaths are ventilation (movement of air) not respiration (exchange of gasses across alveoli). Because there is an obstruction (aspirated water) preventing respiration, ventilation with basic life support maneuvers does little to oxygenate the patient. Furthermore these patients are at risk of acid-base imbalance (respiratory acidosis) secondary to drowning, because they cannot exchange gas - another factor contributing to cardiac arrest in these patients. Paramedics/advanced life support has tools to treat the insult to the lung tissue, reverse respiratory acidosis, and maintain control of the airway manually, which leads to the best neurological outcomes. </p>
<p>Tl;Dr: 5 breaths ain't gonna save you if you're unconscious from drowning/near-drowning already. For lay folk, it also ain't gonna hurt really. Unless the patient pukes in your mouth, in which case you will instantly realize why nobody does mouth to mouth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My local system protocols have a slightly different algorithm if the cause of arrest can be determined; if arrest is caused by respiratory etiology, overdose, or drowning, the provider managing the airway should focus on securing an advanced airway ASAP (ET followed by King LT if two attempts at the ET fail).<br />
Otherwise, the airway provider can start with an airway adjunct (or more, load up on nasal trumpets if you want) and bvm until more hands arrive on-scene.</p>
<p>Mentality behind this is if cardiac arrest was brought about by respiratory arrest, then the first issue needs to be resolved before the second can be. Granted, these are protocols brought about by our medical director and not directly based off of AHA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UK ALS/APLS guidelines recommend the use of five rescue breaths prior to commencing CPR in drowning and in all paediatric arrests. (As opposed to the 30:2 /15:2 ventilation breaths during arrest prior to obtaining a definitive airway)</p>
<p>The rationale here is that the arrest is more likely to be of hypoxic aetiology so initial oxygenation is important to make sure pumping the chest is actually going to transport some oxygen to the brain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give five initial rescue breaths, supplemented with oxygen if available.If the victim has not responded to initial ventilations, place them on a firm surface before starting chest compressions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AFAIK our BLS guidelines don't made a distinction.</p>
<p>EDIT: Seems to be in AHA guidelines too, though doesn't specify a number of rescue breaths:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One caveat: if you <em>see</em> an adult collapse, you generally don't do rescue breaths for the first five minutes because the cause is likely cardiac in nature and so the blood is likely still oxygenated. But if you come upon someone unconscious, you don't know for how long they haven't been breathing and so give rescue breaths after the first 20 compressions, just as /u/aqueercalamity said. And because children generally collapse due to lack of oxygen rather than heart failure, they always get rescue breaths even if you see them collapse.</p></div>		</li>
