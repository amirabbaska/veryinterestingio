			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen different estimates for those requirements, ranging from a few 10s of m^2 to 100s of m^(2) per person. Most likely that it depends a lot on what you're planning to plant, and everyone has a different concept for that. How many plants is even harder to answer because they range a lot in size (i.e. you can have many small plants or few big ones).</p>
<p>What they all agree is that each person needs around 2500 kcal/day of food and 0.5-0.8 kg/day of oxygen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have never thought about the rough amount of oxygen needed per day to support life but this volume is surprisingly low. very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's 25-30 tons per person to completely meet oxygen demand. This is incidentally about half the amount of plant matter required to feed an astronaut indefinitely, so if you want to do that as well you'll have to find a way to make up the imbalance (burning the inedible parts of the plants should work, but there's probably a minimum viable size for this).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A number of biodomes on Earth have been tried, such as the Eden Project in England.  Where they're a self contained environment with various types of trees, plants, insects etc.  The problem is that they never produce enough CO2/O2/water etc. and they have to pump more in.  And these are pretty gigantic greenhouses in effect, far bigger than anything we can launch into space. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the google images the plants don't seem to look too strange but microgravity had some unexpected effects. There was a sensor malfunction that caused some plants to be given too much water - which caused sprouts and leaves to develop twice as fast. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The second surprising result was discovered when the root modules were unpacked on the ground. The new fertilizer being tested had a slower and more even release rate, which had helped lower the plants' accumulation of salts during ground studies. Investigators expected to see higher salt accumulation in the space modules, but the opposite occurred.  <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/10-074.html" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/10-074.html</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is great for damaging electronics too :) </p>
<p>But realistically, you'd 2 possibilities.  Have a airoponics in its own bay.  You stick the plant in a block of foam, have the roots in a humid enviroment with nutrient spray.</p>
<p>Or since water is good at absorbing radiation, Grow the plants using the water shielding as a base. You'd have a hollow big cylinder water stored. Some sort of attachment to stick the roots in without losing water from the containers. It would probably double as your shielded evac area as well. Double kudos for multipurpose. food and oxygen supply ensured :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been saying this for the issue of long haul radiation exposure. Water is a required resource and it blocks the radiation. Just turn the entire lining of your vessel into water storage. Use other materials when that is not possible. </p>
<p>You could have huge hydroponic tubes that have a shell, water, an inner shell and then plants. Use a central light or have a rotating light that simulates the day night cycle. Make these units modular so they can be added to your space station or ship over time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the context of ECLSS, the Russians have always burned lithium perchlorate to release oxygen and NASA has always used water electrolysis (each with pros and cons, they both require a lot of energy). The concept of using Sabatier to recycle oxygen is quite recent, and bioregenerative is even futuristic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure where you heard this, but Elektron actually uses electrolysis to generate oxygen. The SFOG canisters/Vika system are just a backup. </p></div>		</li>
