			<div class="markdown"><p>And in fact, the current rate of fusion for our sun is actually pretty low.  By volume, it's about as energetic as a compost heap.  A fusion power plant running at the same temperature as the suns core, 25-30Mº C) would be basically worthless.  We crank ours up to several times that, which makes the fusion reactions much more likely, and thus generating vastly more power.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another reason we need higher temperatures is that we generally use much lower pressures. Both temperature and pressure contribute to the reaction rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, even if we matched the pressure somehow, you'd still get relatively low rates of reaction, I believe. The biggest reason why you get fusion in the sun's core is quantum tunneling because there's just so much hydrogen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying that if we had a compost heap with the same mass as the sun, with adequate oxygen and such for decomposition, it would put out more energy than the sun?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did the calculation once and the sun puts out 0.2 mW/ litre so a bathtub full of Sun would feel pretty cold and produce less power than a compost heap and the human body per unit volume. However the Sun is big and energy only escapes through the surface, so burning hot to the touch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, sunstuff is way denser (70x that of water), so a compost heap that large would just collapse into a bizarre super-large rocky world.</p>
<p>Also, a compost heap runs out of fuel after a few months. The sun's supply of H2 will last for gigayears. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the limits when this probabilistic event takes place? In other words, is there a non-zero probability of a particle undergoing fusion under normal conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Define normal conditions. As in atmospheric pressure and composition? It's essentially zero. If hydrogen fusion were to occur in the atmosphere (I don't think it's ever been observed), there would be a large release in energy that would be noticeable.</p>
<p>The probability of fusion is dependent upon particle energy as well as density. For fusion (for helium) to occur, there needs to very high density of highly energetic hydrogen atoms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is non-zero, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamow_factor" target="_blank">Gamow factor</a> at room temperature is something ridiculous like 10^(-6000). In other words, we don't expect a single fusion reaction to happen at room temperature ever - even if we consider the whole universe over its total lifetime.</p></div>		</li>
