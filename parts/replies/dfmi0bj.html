			<div class="markdown"><p>The Norse in Greenland fed themselves primarily off of herding and were heavily dependent on imported wood and metals.  The Inuit knew how to fish, whale, make clothes, and gather other foods using just resources that are available locally in Greenland. </p>
<p>Without the walrus ivory, the Norse had nothing to trade the European traders willing to come out that far.  And without the metal and wood to trade the Norse could not survive off the land like the Inuit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I recall the Vikings were not very fond of the Inuit, considered themselves superior, and had not learned the Inuit survival techniques. Likely because the Inuit in Greenland attacked them often in a region with scare food resources. Thus, I suspect that a small band of the Viking explorers would have avoided contact with the North American Inuits. The fact that the Viking L'Anse aux Meadows settlement is on the island of New Foundland may be an indication of that. Especially since the point at which they settled was very close to the mainland. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is another theory used to explain the lack of technological exchange between the two.</p>
<p>I personally don't buy it.  I have never known open hostility to be much of barrier to technological exchange.  Hostile side more often than not delight in stealing one another's tools.  It definitely slows it down a little, but the Norse and Inuit were very close to one another and there was pretty much no copying of Inuit technology, even when the Norse colony was on the verge of collapse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To accept your perception of technological exchange would require that the Vikings valued the Inuit technology as an advantage. However, that was not the case. The Vikings considered the Inuit backward people and that the Viking way was the only way. That certainly is not a case of being socially close to each other, it might be a case of regionally close to each other but not close enough to willingly mingle one society into another.</p>
<p>In any case, the lack of technology exchange between them is only a symptom of the social exclusion and self isolation. Note that the Vikings settled on the island of Newfoundland where the ancestors of the later Beothuk lived and not across the channel on the mainland where the Innu lived.</p></div>		</li>
