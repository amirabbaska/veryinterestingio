			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm only a physics noob but I thought that the whole point of isospin was that you could more or less treat protons and neutrons as the same if you ignored charge... which is what you just said.</p>
<p>Except, it's only <em>more or less</em> the same. I thought that the difference in mass between the proton and the neutron was simply ignored when talking about isospin, and was due to something else?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, it's due to forces which break isospin symmetry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh. Uhh... right. That's what you said above, isn't it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I would have guessed that the difference in mass was due to a different binding energy because the two up quarks in a proton repel each other more than the two down quarks in a neutron. Is that right? Or is it way too classical for such a quantum situation?</p>
<p>(so... stronger repelling -&gt; less tightly bound -&gt; less stored energy -&gt; less mass. This much at least seems to hint that my guess is on the right path?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that atoms have a charge if they have an uneven amount of protons/electrons, but how do protons intrinsically have a charge while neutrons don't, if they both have an uneven amount of opposite-spin quarks? Shouldn't the neutron have a charge if it has two quarks spinning one way and one quark spinning the other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The differences between them are attributed to their electromagnetic interactions and differences between the masses of up and down quarks. But this is negligible when you're talking about nuclear interactions which is why isospin is useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isospin is a quantum number which allows us to treat <em>almost</em> identical particles as if they are identical. For example the up and down quarks, the proton and neutron, the three pions, etc.</p>
<p>By &quot;couple&quot; I just mean &quot;interact&quot;. Interactions of particles with other fields (and even themselves) contributes to the mass of the particle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a reason to emphasize the difference in charge rather than the difference in mass between the quarks? I thought the strong force is much stronger than the EM forces here and the strong force doesn't see the difference in charge, but it does see the difference in mass. So I would think that most of the p-n mass difference could be explained by breaking the symmetry only by the mass term.</p>
<p>Also, I thought that the mass breaking of isospin was the usual thing people talk about in eg the pion mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4088" target="_blank">this</a> paper, they use lattice QCD and QED to calculate the contributions of both QCD and QED to the mass asymmetry of the proton and neutron (and also some other isospin multiplets). They find that the contributions of QCD and QED are on the same order of magnitude, although QCD contributes more.</p></div>		</li>
