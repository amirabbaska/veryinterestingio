<p>Strange stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the idea is trying to explain with acceptable accuracy what we can measure with the simplest model we can figure out.</p>
<p>For example, for all-day applications Newtonian gravity is great, even if it is less accurate than gravity as explained by relativity, because it is so simple and still good enough.</p>
<p>Probably the four forces we use today to explain things will change a lot as science discovers new things</p></div>		</li>
