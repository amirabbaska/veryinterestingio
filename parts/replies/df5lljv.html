			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to get it. The horizon is the edge of the observable universe, but everything is moving away. The horizon is where the velocity away from us is equal to the speed of light. So due to expansion, the horizon is actually shrinking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the interesting bits -- there is no center! The Big Bang didn't happen at &quot;a point&quot;; there was no space for there to be a point (as far as we know). The Big Bang was the creation of the universe, and so it happened <em>everywhere</em>. There is no center to the expansion of the universe.</p>
<p>You can sort of think of it this way: imagine you have a perfectly spherical balloon. If the balloon expands, then naturally the surface area expands... but there is no &quot;center&quot; on the surface of the balloon that it expands around. The expansion of the universe is analgous to the surface of the balloon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But in 3space there is a center of expansion, it's just not on the surface. Is there a &quot;center&quot; in 4d or higher space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is true that as space expands our &quot;observable universe&quot; becomes more limited, but this is not the only limit on our observations! After the Big Bang (~13.7 billion years ago) we believe all matter in the universe was in a plasma state, meaning that rather than being linked together by atomic bonds the universe was made up of free floating elementary particles in this hot &quot;cosmic soup&quot;. The bitch about cosmic soup is that, like regular soup, it is opaque so no photons from this period were free to begin flying around the universe. &quot;Recombination&quot; happened about 300,000 years after the Big Bang so we still have a potential 0.4 billion more years of historical information to collect, but before that the universe had no free moving light particles so there is no light from that period to ever observe. </p></div>		</li>
