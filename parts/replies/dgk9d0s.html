			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming this is why, say in an office, of you are the first to get sick, you slowly spread it around the office until everyone is infected. And if it hasn't mutated, this is why you don't get sick again, till next season. If it has mutated we start the cycle all over again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would happen in boot camp. You'd get (what I assume was) a constant rotation of mutating viruses. In 7 weeks I got some sort of cold like symptoms 3-4 times. Some people were just continuously sick. </p>
<p>It'd be interesting to study environments like that and track the different mutations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And God forbid someone gets pinkeye. My entire company had pinkeye during my rotation. We had to take a day from training and sterilize the entire barracks and we had DS's losing their mind if you so much as looked like you might touch your face. For a week the entire company was on orders to wash hands and face a minimum of three times a day and use hand sanitizer something like every half hour or some stupid nonsense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, I definitely know about that. I went to a military school, and every semester people would come back with their germs from back home and when they come back everyone is close around each other. People were constantly getting sick. We called it Corps Crud. </p>
<p>I don't remember getting sick much at basic training (real army not school) . Maybe a scratchy throat for a week. But pretty much the people who got sick a lot were looking for a reason to be sick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is why you want to be exposed to as many of these viruses as possible from your teens to your late 30s, after this point your immune system is less reliable, and generally continues to get weaker as you age. Early exposure to the various viruses will give you a better range of protections into your old age. I mean its not like you will die or something, and many elderly people have strong immune systems, living in group accommodation probably keeps that system active, as each person will have different visitors from different walks of life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However people's immune system generally becomes less efficient over time (immune senescence) so even the response to a previously encountered virus can decrease in the elderly. Vaccination can also be a problem in the elderly as the immune response may not be protective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So parents who try to protect their kid from every single germ are actually not helping their kids, then?  I know a mother who did that and thought, every time the kid got sick, that weakened his immune system later in life and he'd get sick more. Sounds like that's almost the exact opposite of how it really works. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very good reason, another of which is that some pathogens have antigens that require very precise specificity to be functional so they remain genetically conserved. We can make vaccines to those conserved antigens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It usually depends on what the immune system readily detects as foreign proteins. Is it a protein that's not necessary for the virus to infect human cells? Well then the protein getting changed due to mutations doesn't stop the virus from infecting you or anyone else.<br />
Is it a protein necessary to get into your cells? Then only slight changes can be made without stopping the whole virus from working.</p>
<p>Those important structures are usually highly conversed because a virus missing them simply won't work.</p>
<p>And influenza is more of an example on how the virus frequently adapts. For influenza it's more like anticipating which 3 or 4 strands are most likely to sweep your country and the companies making the most likely to work vaccine.</p></div>		</li>
