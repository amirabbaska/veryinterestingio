			<div class="markdown"><p>Charge is a measurement of how the electromagnetic force interacts.  The value is a measurement of the strength of the force, so objects with higher numbers interact with more strength than those with lower numbers.  Charge doesn't change with energy levels, but higher energy levels can give particles enough energy to overcome the interaction caused by charge.</p>
<p>The positive/negative are kind of arbitrary terms for the fact that charge can come in two variants that change how charges interact.  Two charges of the same variant, positive and positive or negative and negative will repulse each other, while two charges of opposite variant, positive and negative, will attract dach other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the unfortunate train wreck intersection of math and language. Having charges represented by + and - makes math upon them extremely easy. But in language the words &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; carry an implication of being opposites, when charges are more correctly described as compliments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charge is not a measure of something. Charge is inandof itself, fundamental. Positive and negative are assignments we have made to refer to equal magnitude charges that result in opposite interactions with other charge carrying particles and fields.</p>
<p>Charge is a property that gives rise to electric and magnetic fields which is it's primary function.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some consider it a measure of the strength of a particle's coupling to the electromagnetic force.  But that coupling (or charge) is indeed fundamental.</p></div>		</li>
