<p>The reverse is used to lower the crane.</p>

<p>Often, a smaller crane is hoisted by the main crane and assembled at the top of the new building. The main crane is then disassembled and lowered piece by piece by the smaller crane. Then the smaller crane is disassembled and brought down the utility elevator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a time-lapse video and was excited to watch one go up near our local city-hall building. The time-lapse really didn't do justice to just HOW. STINKIN'. SLOW. the whole process was.  I think I watched for ~1hr and witnessed less than a single segment go into place.</p></div>		</li>
