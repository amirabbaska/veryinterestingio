<p>I should add that varnish also makes things &quot;shiny&quot;. The shininess is a result of being smooth. Paint tends to have a microscopically rough surface meaning that is scatters reflected light in almost every direction. As a result, light that reflects off paint tends to have equal intensity in most directions meaning that there are no strong/bright/shiny/intense reflections. Acrylic paint is soother than oil paint and therefore more shiny. When you varnish a painting, the varnish fills in the microscopic roughness smoothing everything out and producing shiny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the colors in a painting are not blue, but many pigments reflect a little bit of blue. If a red pigment reflects a little bit of green and little bit of blue, the pigment will look a little gray (dim white - white is a combination of red, green, and blue). If you take away either the green or the blue or both, the red will be more vividly red (more saturated) and less gray. Similarly, green paint reflects a little blue and a little red. If you take away either the blue or the red or both, the green will be more vivid (more saturated) and less gray. However, if you take away both red and blue, the only color you can see is green. Every other paint color looks gray. If you take away just blue, every non-blue color becomes more vivid, and only blue paint becomes gray. Now, consider the relative amounts of red, green, and blue in a typical painting. If you are going to sacrifice one color to benefit the others, blue is the one to sacrifice.</p>
<p>The varnish does not completely eliminate blue. It just absorbs enough to make the other colors more vivid. You are probably used to seeing blue with a bit of gray in it, so you don't notice desaturated blue as much. In fact, there was an NPR science story about how ancient people did not have a word for blue and didn't seem to believe it was a real color in spite of the fact they could see azure Mediterranean sea and the same skies you and I see. [Here is an article similar to the NPR story: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-blue-and-how-do-we-see-color-2015-2" target="_blank">https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-blue-and-how-do-we-see-color-2015-2</a>&quot; Radio story: <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/211213-sky-isnt-blue/" target="_blank">https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/211213-sky-isnt-blue/</a></p>
<p>Look at the &quot;Lastly, let’s look at “saturation,” or “chroma“&quot; section of this brief article explaining it: learn.leighcotnoir.com/artspeak/elements-color/hue-value-saturation/</p>
<p>&quot;Saturation defines the brilliance and intensity of a color. When a pigment hue is “toned,” both white and black (grey) are added to the color to reduce the color’s saturation. In terms of the “additive” light color model, though, saturation works on a scale based on how much or how little other hues are represented in the color.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't believe this, because any liquid will cause the effect.<br />
Also the layer is so thin that it won't change the color enough to account for the effect.  It might just be the higher index of refraction.</p></div>		</li>
