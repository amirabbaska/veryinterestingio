Honestly, if I start getting into it I'm just going to get mad so I'll just leave it at: If you have 3 billion dollars in assets and are continuing to expand throughout the region, stop being a dick and give the back office something worth a damn to use. </p>
<p>Also, I want to new chair because mine is terrible and I have to sit there and be mad all day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an American who lives in Germany.  Moving here really showed me how antiquated the US banking system is in many respects.  Two things really stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can pay anyone in Germany electronically and they will have the money in a few hours.  Anyone outside of Germany will have the money the next day.  </li>
<li>Credit card processing fees are half of what US merchants pay.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Leaving aside the monopoly that is Visa/MC, why hasn't the US advanced further regarding electronic payments.  I know we have the ACH system but it doesn't seem to be available for the average user, especially when they enforce the &quot;2 small deposits&quot; thing that makes it useless to send a single payment to someone.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting things they have here are ATM-like machines that people who don't have computers can use to pay their bills.  They fill out a form with the transaction they want, put their card in the ATM machine, feed in the paper and voila, payment sent.  </p>
<p>Do you see that changing and how long do you think it will take?</p></div>		</li>
