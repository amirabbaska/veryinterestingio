<p>So how would you get rid of those last bits of fat? I'm 1.85m and 76 ~ 77kg. I have my good and worse times maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I might gain a bit but have always been able to lose that again relatively easy by eating healthy (cut down on sugar and carbs) and exercise (running 5km 1 time per week) until I'm back at 76kg. From hereon it seems my body really wants to stick to that number and have never been able to lose that last patch of underbelly (by simply continuing the healthy lifestyle).</p>
<p>Same story with my girlfriend. She seems to be stuck at 52 kg.</p>
<p>Is this some kind of lower limit that is tougher to break through? That our bodies are actively trying to maintain?</p></div>		</li>

<p>ETA: a good way to think of the sites is primary is usually around the trunk of the body, and secondary are more peripheral.</p></div>		</li>

(Some girls...dont be offended if you aren't one...by no means all or even a lot) my ex used to hate that about her weight loss journey.  For a while she thought that working out made her look worse cuz he depleted her boobage and did nothing to her belly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. It’s a huge misconception in the fitness world. I get clients all the time who ask me for exercises to lose belly fat and tricep fat. They are in shock when I tell them it doesn’t work that way. Just gotta lose weight and wait for it to come off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think of having an impact on hormones? Lower stress can lower cortisol and mean less belly fat (in theory, I don't know if it has been well-proven). Some people even report losing some fat and gaining some muscle when they go on vacation despite eating a lot and not lifting weights.</p>
<p>I don't remember how but I vaguely remember something about higher adrenaline levels and belly fat. It was about using high intensity exercise (for the higher adrenaline boost) to lose belly fat.</p>
<p>Of course this is more about primary vs secondary fat stores. It is obvious that no exercise will randomly target triceps fat or anything like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You cannot do any targeting of any fat loss - sans surgery.  Doing crunches doesn’t cause the fat to be burned from just your stomach and doing curls doesn’t burn just the fat from your arm. </p>
<p>Losing fat is just part of the looking fit equation though. </p>
<p>You can, however, target certain muscle groups and make yourself look more tone/fit in particular areas.</p>
<p>So you can target certain sites, just not for the fat loss portion of looking fit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A perfect example of this is to work your chest and back to get more of that V-shape, which will make your mid-section look smaller by comparison.</p></div>		</li>

<p>True.  The only thing it does is build muscle which can displace some of the fat.  It still takes being very lean to have visible abs and vascularity, but it also takes lean muscle mass or you'll have nothing to show for that low body fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, no such thing.  It's like asking to burn a specific drop of gas in your gas tank.  Your body sees your fat as energy to be burned, and there are &quot;priority areas&quot; it will burn first, and &quot;secondary sites&quot; it will burn last.  This is largely determined by genetics and hormones, not anything that you do.  You get no choice at all in where you burn fat.  The one thing you <em>can</em> do is build muscle, which adds structure.  You see a guy with 15% body fat who lifts consistently and he will look pretty strong, just not very defined.  A second guy, with 15% body fat and no muscle, will look skinny-fat.  </p></div>		</li>
