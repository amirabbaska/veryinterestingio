			<div class="markdown"><p>To reword it. The total sunlight reaching the surface was reduced by 50% for the first 12 years. Though the article says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Models indicate that a global aerosol cloud would be continuously produced for about 12 yr, blocking out over 50% of the sunlight during the first 10 yr.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So maybe the estimation was a 50% reduction for 10 years, and not 12, but I did only skim the article and not fully read it.</p></div>		</li>
