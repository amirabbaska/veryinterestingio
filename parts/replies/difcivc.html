<p>Lots of high school teachers, including mine, say that. But it's not correct.</p>
<p>A non-inertial frame is a frame which is accelerating (including rotations). If you are not accelerating, your frame of reference is inertial. If you <em>are</em> accelerating, your frame of reference is non-inertial.</p>
<p>In a non-inertial frame, you see extra forces like the centrifugal force, the Coriolis force, etc. These extra forces arise because your reference frame itself is accelerating.</p>
<p>People who say that the centrifugal force &quot;doesn't exist&quot; most likely don't understand non-inertial reference frames.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say you're on an elevator starting on an upward trip.</p>
<p>You experience a force drawing you towards the floor.  It is not imaginary, you can read it with a scale!  BUT it's not a new force, it's just acceleration.  </p>
<p>In this case, you're standing on the equator at noon.  The earth is rotating about 1000 mph, in 12 hrs it'll be midnight and you're gonna be going 1000 mph the exact opposite direction.</p>
<p>You'd think &quot;well that's pulling behind me, right?&quot;  Common mistake.  No, it's always pulling <em>outwards</em>.  </p>
<p>Why?  Well, forget the EARTH'S n/s/e/w.  Just look at the solar system flat and make up a &quot;north&quot; and place the Earth there in your head.  At noon, you're moving 1000 mph east.  At 6pm, you're moving 1000 mph north, at midnight you're moving 1000 west.</p>
<p>So, at noon, you're both losing your east speed, and starting to accelerating north.  Net vector is outwards.  Nothing new or unique actually, just hard to see.</p>
<p>If there was no gravity because the earth was a hollow, thin shell with no significant mass rotating at 1000 mph, you'd just fly off in a line once you let go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that most physics teachers probably do this, but most students only remember something about centrifugal force not existing. It's sort of a complex topic, so a lot of them won't understand really, and the teacher likely won't spend a lot of time on it since most of what it's based on isn't in the curriculum. And especially if the kid isn't that interested in physics, that's a super easy phrase for them to understand and pluck out of the explanation, and it would probably stick with them, since it goes against something they've probably heard for their entire lives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's oversimplifying. All forces can be expressed as mass * acceleration. But specifically, centrifugal force is due to acceleration that does not affect the speed of the object (that is, only changes its direction of motion). </p></div>		</li>
