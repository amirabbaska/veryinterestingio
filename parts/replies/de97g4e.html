			<div class="markdown"><p>So I used to work for a drilling company and can lend some insights here. There are a couple things that make it hard to go so deep.</p>
<p>The first, you often need to put in some type of support around your hole so the pressure doesn't collapse it in. This is usually piping conduit. An issue with this is that it gets insanely heavy the deeper you go. You've got to be able to retrieve your drill and it gets crazy heavy. </p>
<p>Another issue is the pressure. It will actually make the pipe and drill bow. So you can find that you're not drilling straight down after going so deep.</p>
<p>Another issue is the heat. Things aren't quite as strong when they are hot, which causes breakdown faster. While some of it is certain due to the earths heat, a lot is just the heat from grinding. You've got to keep those drills cool. Usually by pumping a coolant mid or slide down to the drill head.</p>
<p>There is more to it than that, but those are some common problems with super dee drilling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That and as soon as they would remove the drill to replace them the hole would start to fill itself in again because of the properties of the rock at that depth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4-5 km is totally doable; oil wells get drilled that deep.  It's pretty darn expensive though.  The further you go, as /u/l4pin mentioned, the more stuff tends to break.  You spend two days getting your drill down to the bottom of the hole, drill for a few hours, then something breaks and you spend two days pulling your drill out to fix it...</p>
<p>It depends on the equipment and expertise you have available, not to mention geology.  But I know firsthand that you can slam out a 1.5 km deep oil well in 6-10 days.  Same equipment did one 3 km deep one and it took a month.  Extrapolating a bit, a 5 km one would probably take 3 months and the entire drill crew would be ready to strangle someone by the end of it.</p></div>		</li>
