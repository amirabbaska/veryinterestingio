			<div class="markdown"><p>I am currently a smoker (cigarettes) and I'm willing to quit if later on I could donate my eggs, however I'm also adopted (closed adoption) so I think that in itself disqualifies me even though I'm in good health. I've also smoked pot like 4 or 5 times, but thats it. I wish I could donate though, because I have no use for them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have pretty good evidence that what you consume even a week before you ovulate affects the oocyte. </p>
<p>They want strong family histories, although you could, of course, lie. I wouldn't suggest it. When I donated I quit everything and ate extremely well for a month before I even started the hormone injections. It's just good practice; why wouldn't we want to bring healthy children into the world?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The agency I'm with only requires donors to be tobacco free for three months. But yea, not knowing your family health history is a pretty automatic disqualification. Since people are often spending their life saving's on donor eggs/IVF, they want this information so that they could avoid choosing a donor with similar family health issues to that of intended father. However, if you are willing to donate independently with little or no comp, you may be able to find intended parents willing to look past your lack of family history knowledge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's impossible for us to know how that specific child turned out; but I will say we are the sum of our experiences and genetics. Some of those experiences we have directly, others are passed down from our parents. The egg-donor may not have turned over a top-shelf ovum, but who knows how the egg would have interacted with the sperm it was paired with or how much nutrition or social interaction the child got post-birth. Every piece makes a difference either positive, negative or ambivalent; tough to know what's going to be the most important variable ahead of time.</p>
<p>That being said, I hope the kid turned out okay too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although your answer about egg production is not totally off-base, I would point out that sperm is also susceptible to damage too.</p>
<p>As men age, there are noticeable declines in sperm motility, an increase in the number of sperm with odd morphology and a decrease in semen volume (see <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028200016794" target="_blank">study</a>.</p>
<p>Age and DNA fragmentation negatively affect both male and female fertility, but culturally women are judged more than are men for their (potentially negative) lifestyle choices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about for stem cell though? Your eggs still need to be in top condition. I have crappy eggs thay can be expirimented on. But no one will take them. I make a dozen at a time and I wish I could say I was joking. They aren't good for babies but they gotta be good for something.</p></div>		</li>
