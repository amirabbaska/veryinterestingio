			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really that much more expensive than building rotating orbital habitats.  If you're colonizing planets, you probably have the construction capabilities to pull this off pretty easily.  </p>
<p>Plus keep in mind this is just the living space.  Crop fields and such are probably fine chilling out in the .5g lands around your colony.  We've had stuff growing in outright <em>freefall</em> up <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/10-074.html" target="_blank">on the ISS</a> and the plants seem to do fine.  Mining facilities and other remote places that people commute to but don't permanently live in are probably fine too.  You could maybe have your entire industrial sector outside the bowl, if you want.  </p>
<p>And really, in all likelihood, the planet's probably not got a breathable atmosphere <em>anyway</em> as other people have said.  So you gotta build your hab spaces anyway.  It's nice to know that at least your habs on .5g world can have proper gravity if you go the extra mile.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You just split your society into different gravity classes of people, and the redfaction has to revolt against the Earth mining corporation for grav-equality, <em>you know for that extra mile</em></p>
<hr />
<p>That said I like your idea of building this, it tickles my scifi sensibilities, of machines solving problems, but realistically, genetically engineer people for different gravity, once your medical science is advanced enough is basically going to be as low resource intensive as vaccinations, while building giant spinning habitats will always require more resources and energy than regular buildings, no matter how advanced your construction science is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure. Maintenance might be an issue. Spinning a giant bowl on the ground like that is a different problem. You've got more problems with friction, and can't rely on inertia as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're not talking about a space torus, though (and there's a reason why we haven't done that). We're talking about a constantly spinning bowl on the surface of a planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think a bowl shape would work - it can only provide a normal force at a right angle to its surface so when you add that to gravity, you'll still have a net force vertically downwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.scifiideas.com/science-2/a-solution-for-long-term-living-on-low-gravity-planets/" target="_blank">Here's</a> a link with some images and more info.  The example they use is more of a tilted torus, but that's just one 'slice' of the bowl-shape I'm using.</p>
<p>Imagine if you were doing this with a cylinder going straight down into the ground.  You spin it fast enough people will stick to the walls like that fast spinny fair ride, right?  But they're being acted on by two forces; the inertial force of the spinning, and the force of the planet's gravity, so they won't feel like the walls of the cylinder are a straight floor.  People will be stumbling diagonally, like they were on a slope.</p>
<p>So now take your cylinder, keep spinning it the same way, all the forces are the same... but start pinching the lower end of it down, curving the walls inward, turning it into more of a cone or bowl shape.  It's still allll spinning at the same rate, all the forces are the same (well, less so at the center but that's an issue with all spinning habitats of non-uniform shape.)  but because the walls/floors are tilting to match the net force people are experiencing, they're now all standing up straight and not stumbling around.  The people feel like the ground is nice and level, and the gravity is 1g.</p>
<p>Now just make an equally slanted ceiling so people don't see the weird way they're spinning around when they look up, and voila, nice stable comfy habitation space.  </p></div>		</li>
