			<div class="markdown"><p>It's expected that they're not just neutrons though.  They should have an outer crust of mostly electrons and iron nuclei, and a deeper inner crust of mixed neutron-electron degenerate matter.  Under that, there's a proton- and electron-poor neutron mantle, and if it turns out to be capable of sustaining itself under degeneracy pressure like electrons and neutrons can, high-density <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCD_matter" target="_blank">QCD matter/quark-gluon plasma</a> at the core.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In general, a planet with a lower surface gravity can support larger mountains. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah that's pretty much it. Assuming the crusts of the rocky planets are made of approximately the same stuff (rock), then they should all have the same strength. If you pile stuff up you to make a mountain you increase the stress on the base. If the weight of that mountain is big enough it will be enough to break the base, and so that should limit the height of the mountain. Since the weight of the mountain is determined by the surface gravity, the maximum height should be determined by the surface gravity. </p></div>		</li>
