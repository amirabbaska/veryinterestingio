			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely, once you're using Wireless N or AC, you want to use the 5ghz band vs the 2.4ghz band, unless you need the range. the 2.4ghz band is crowded, has fewer channels, and slower, but the range is (sometimes a lot) better.</p>
<p>Assuming, again, that your receiving devices support it. You want to move as many devices as you can to 5ghz, so the ones stuck on 2.4ghz aren't competing for limited bandwidth.</p></div>		</li>
