			<div class="markdown"><p>I've taken a quarter tablet of finasteride daily for the past 11 years since I was 25 and it stopped my hair loss. I always thought I was screwed since men on both sides of my family are all bald at an early age. </p>
<p>Edit: I'm getting lots of questions about finasteride so I'll do my best to explain what my dermatologist told me. Finasteride is a generic version of Proscar which was developed for prostrate issues. They found out later on that people were noticing hair growth and thicker hair. After some research they discovered that these side effects can be realized with as little as 1mg. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started taking it when I was 23 until I was about 27. I had started prematurely balding. I went to the &quot;hair loss specialist&quot; and he insisted it was just normal hair loss and put me on daily 1 mg finasteride aka propecia. It seemingly totally worked for me and I got my hair all back, thick and healthy. I stopped taking it as I started getting really bad at remembering to take the pill daily once my hair was all back. It has been 6 years now and I've still got a full, thick, healthy head of hair. Only side effect I noticed was semen was more watery/thin but no actual decreased sexual function.
I wonder if my hair loss had another cause or if maybe you don't need to take it forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should have to take it forever so you probably don't have normal male pattern baldness. Or I suppose maybe it changed your body's ability to convert testosterone into DHT permanently, but I'm not convinced that's possible. I have heard other people say this though. They also had serious sexual side effects that stayed after quitting. At least they kept their hair?? Happy you have your hair and sexual function! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did the same thing - stopped taking it like 10 years ago after taking it for 10 years - I was losing a lot of hair at 21 and it made a difference when I started taking it, but my hair didn't fall out when I stopped</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took it for two years (22-24). I was fine for a year and a half, but then I got really not fun sexual side effects. Couldn't achieve or maintain a full erection ever. It was terrifying. I went to a urologist. When I mentioned finasteride he said that was without a doubt the culprit and I should stop taking it immediately. It took me almost a year to get back to normal sexual function. Thankfully rogaine works quite well on me and my hair looks much better than I ever expected after quitting finasteride. As for the other sides you mentioned no not at all. I went to the gym and built muscle regularly and if anything had better confidence than I did in many years because my hair was so thick. </p>
<p>Just be aware that it's possible to get devastating sexual side effects. It took me a long time to overcome and I hear nightmare stories on hairloss forums about people who never bounce back (but it's possible that finasteride is not the only factor in play with those cases). So it's a bit of a gamble really, but according to official statistics side effects are rare and reversible within a few months of stopping. My experience is anecdotal, but it was a lot worse than the official studies say and there's no doubt in my mind this was a result of the drug. Because of that I can't recommend using it knowing it might fuck someone up, but for the people who don't get sides it is amazing. It really stops balding.</p>
<p>Not saying this to scare you, I just want anyone who's considering finasteride to know there is a risk. Good luck fellow baldylocks! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I've noticed. I was 25 when I started so I'm pretty sure I was done growing and I'd say I'm in pretty good shape for my age but I try to workout 5 days a week. As far as confidence, I've always had an issue with that but if anything I don't have to be self conscious about being bald now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it killed my boner after about 6 months. Like very noticeable. Jerking off even became difficult. I decided it's more embarrassing to not be able to get your dick hard for a girl than to not have hair. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the hair in the head can be of 2 different types, one of them sensitive to DHT and the other not. That's why some men with high testosterone levels don't loose any hair or the reason why not all hair in the head dies in most cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well more testosterone would actually help with facial hair.  </p>
<p>The stuff that makes you hair fall out actually helps grow facial hair. </p>
<p>DHT. </p>
<p>Hence why a lot of bald dudes have amazing beards. </p>
<p>Of course you still have to have the ability to grow facial hair. </p></div>		</li>
