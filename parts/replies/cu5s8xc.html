<p>Edit: I'm kinda right and wrong, I think? Ima step out of this conversation...</p></div>		</li>

We got a comprehensive list of some of the flavorings, but when we tried to make it ourselves it turned up nasty (and blue?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually don't think its really that difficult to find an exact formula - though it changes over time.</p>
<p>I also don't think it would be really complicated to make a cola which tastes at least as good - it would actually probably be easy, as cola is far too sweet, to make people drink more, even when the taste already borders on annoyingly sweet.</p>
<p>But here's the problem: Especially the smaller brands will use any trick to reduce cost and to increase sweetness - thus you get those unbearable soft drinks only children can enjoy.</p>
<p>Additionally, the supermarkets make more profit with the branded drinks. If a lesser known brand offered a cheap coke which tasted better than the real thing, thus affecting sales of the far more expensive (and profitable) drink, it would be gone quickly. So they actually want the cheap stuff to taste mediocre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like they're not ALLOWED.  Pepsi has hundreds of food flavor scientists working for them (many of whom used to work at Coke).  Trust me, if they wanted Pepsi to taste like Coke, it would.  What they want is for it to taste close, but have it's own flavor.  Because that's how you build a brand identity.  Same with many other colas.  As far as generic colas go:  some of that is looking to save cost, but I promise that if I places ten colas in front of someone without branding, they could not pick out the coke. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously Pepsi doesn't want to clone Coke... but what about little shitty generic brands?  They don't HAVE a brand identity, and it would be to their advantage to just be a cheap alternative to coke that still tastes like coke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pepsi would not and could not be sued by Coke for using the Coca-Cola formula. This is the &quot;downside&quot; of using trade secret protection rather than patent, once it's not a secret, you have no protections.</p></div>		</li>
