			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.  When I read lyrics of songs that I personally connected with because of the melody, I almost always find a line or two that have deep personal meaning for me  (even if it's a song I heard years ago as a child and never heard the lyrics properly until now).  To go beyond philosophical, I theorize that lyrical music is like road-signs that reveal themselves to us through life. p.s: found this on another comment and thought it was relevant:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd agree with this. People are always searching for meaning in their own lives and the world at large, some universal truths. Music, art and literature taps into thoughts we all have about our own existence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I like proper Dubstep, like this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYoPaVV-qk8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYoPaVV-qk8</a> OR this - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEAf_ZztCP0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEAf_ZztCP0</a> on a big (40k watts plus) soundsystems. </p>
<p>the feeling of sheer unbridled dread you get from the physical WEIGHT and presence of the sub bass massaging every internal organ. When you get similar basslines to this, that use glide and portamento to move up and down scales, it feels like your body is being picked up and moved around the room. Its absolutely phenomenal. </p></div>		</li>
