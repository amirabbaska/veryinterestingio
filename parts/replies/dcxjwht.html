According to my observations it is closely related to fatigue and stress too. If I'm fatigued it gets more intense, and if I'm feeling better; my senses are sharper and I'm both better at ignoring it, as well as its intensity being less than otherwise.  </p>
<p>On a different note, when I was a kid I used to start seeing patterns in the random flutters. My brain would try to force a pattern on the randomness, so I'd see something like a 3D tube that it looked I was traveling along, with twists and turns... I would look at it for fun and pretend I was going on a ride, like some kind of space rollercoaster or tube waterslide.</p></div>		</li>
