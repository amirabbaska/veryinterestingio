<p>even if a molecule is heavier than another per se, it doesn't mean the actual material composed by those molecules will have a higher density.</p>

<p>Actually, it essentially does for gasses.  &quot;Equal volumes of all gases, at the same temperature and pressure, have the same number of molecules.&quot;  That's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro%27s_law" target="_blank">Avogrado's Law</a>.  Since density is the ratio of mass to volume, and the volume determines the number of molecules, we know that the density of a gas is directly proportional to the mass of the molecules that make up the gas regardless of the size of those molecules.  Sure, there's everything else that goes on with the ideal gas law going on and temperature and pressure can fluctuate a lot, but density of a gas is still directly related to molecular mass of a gas.</p>
<p>So, air with any amount of water vapor in it is going less dense than air without any water vapor in it (at the same temperature and pressure) because H2O has a lower mass than CO2, O2, Ar, and N2.  That's why humid air rises to form clouds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to your comment... A great way to think about this, even though it's not <em>totally</em> accurate for a variety of reasons, is to fill a big jar with marbles and place a steel ball bearing on top of the pile. The ball bearing doesn't just sink right to the bottom, but as you agitate the contents of the jar, it eventually does. So if O3 is generated high in the atmosphere, it takes some amount of time before it gets to the surface.</p>
<p>Edit: just to be clear, my point is that even when the densities are vastly different, it doesn't necessarily mean the densest will just go straight to the bottom. </p></div>		</li>
