			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response. Just wanted to add one additional point about handoffs.</p>
<p>In many institutions, there is a physician who stays overnight to take care of your patients after you go home. Every time you go home at the end of the day, you give signout on your patients to the night floater - why they're in the hospital, their medical history, what treatments they're getting, allergies, labs or imaging that need to be followed up on, and other things that need to be done. This process is called a handoff, and it is an opportunity for important information to be lost or forgotten (similar to a game of &quot;telephone&quot;), which can lead to errors in patient care. If physicians work longer shifts, there are fewer handoffs, and vice versa.</p>
<p>There is a lot of debate in the medical community right now about handoffs.  It is well recognized that during handoffs, some amount of important information is lost or not appropriately conveyed to the incoming physician.  It is less clear whether this leads to medical errors and/or patient harm.  Which is better - having fatigued a fatigued doctor making critical decisions after 36 straight hours of work, or having a fresher person who doesn't know the patient as well make those decisions? There has been a lot of research on the subject and I'm not going to include it all here in my comment, but I'd invite anyone interested to look it up. It's a very interesting topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good point about hand offs. I argue (without data, and solely by experience) that a good handoff is better for the patient than no hand off and having a fatigued doc stick around. When I hand off my patients in the ED I see it as a chance to bring in another view point/set of eyes to the patient's care. The new doc is fresh, awake, full of energy. I'm tired and mentally fatigued. I've had oncoming teams ask very pertinent questions and think of tests and diagnoses that I did not because I was tired at the of my shift. If it's a shit handoff then it's essentially useless, so as long as it's good, I think it helps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what's the overall consensus?
Other things that rarely get bought up:
Who wants to work 36 hour shifts like seriously why do we consider that an acceptable practice.
There are always going to be good and bad ways of handing over. Why don't we do more effort instead of relying on gruelling hours focus on optimising handoffs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it have to be a binary choice between poor handoff + fresh doctor vs no handoff + tired doctor? It seems to me (as a layperson) that the easy solution is to improve handoffs between doctors. Other industries (including very high-risk ones like air traffic control) change shifts all the time. Heck, even nurses work more reasonable shifts and don't seem to have as big a problem handing off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't and that's what pissing everyone off, especially the coming interns that would have to deal with this shit. Instead of working to improve the handoffs, they just avoid it all together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently just had an unfortunate stay in the hospital for my 4 year old. He is alright but had a febrile seizure and it was a bit odd the way it went down so it took a lot of testing to rule it down to that. It was pretty much a worst day(s) ever.</p>
<p>Its' funny though I thought about this exact question while I was there because I got to see the affects of the long shifts. </p>
<p>As a patient/parent of, I liked it. Each shift change you met new people and had to re-explain everything. While they had notes to review and consultation with each other they also check with us, which is really appreciated, but at the same time fatiguing.</p>
<p>It is also comforting to watch one person track everything through each of its steps from seeing my son the night he came in to through to the next day. First hand is always better than descriptions.</p>
<p>So, each staff member was really great, but that hand off was kind of a bummer in a way too, maybe it is dumb but it is easy to grow attached and familiar with the people doing such a great job helping you through a really hard situation, so it is sad to see them go.</p>
<p>I'm sort of glad they do it, though i do feel for the people actually doing it and what they have to give up for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that is true, it has to be compared to the effects of fatigue. Recent research has demonstrated that physicians-in-training working traditional schedules with recurrent 24-hour shifts:</p>
<p>■ Make 36% more serious medical errors than those
whose scheduled work is limited to 16 consecutive hours</p>
<p>■ Make five times as many serious diagnostic errors</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's seriously beyond stupid how much neglect fatigue gets talked about in this discussion. How can your clinical judgement not be compromised after working 20+ hours straight? It's absurd the number of even UWORLD question I would miss after 11PM. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was just mentioning more than 8 hours. I didn't know they went for 24 hours that does seem too crazy for everything you've mentioned. </p>
<p>I've done some 16 hour days (programmer here) and my effectiveness drops like a rock after like 12, you still are going forward but not very quickly and everything I do past that point usually needs a second look. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even just the simple stuff is hard to keep track of when playing basically report telephone. Our shifts are 12.5 hrs specifically to keep the rotation from being obnoxious to everyone. For longer term patients, I've had shifts where I'm with the same one I was with a few days prior and they'll have issues that we had solved then that hadn't carried over properly and were now an issue all over again. It drives me <em>mad!</em> I can't even imagine having to split into 8 hour shifts. I almost wish we could stay with the same patients once we've established a system with them-- <em>especially</em> with our psych patients. They go so quickly from calm to agitated to violent that even typically &quot;unimportant&quot; info like, &quot;bring grape juice when they're frustrated,&quot; or &quot;coloring reduces anxiety,&quot; or &quot;weirdly attached to the pillow in the corner chair and will scream incessantly if you move it,&quot; will prevent sooooo much chaos in the next shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually one of the reasons for longer shifts. Studies have shown that patients have worse outcomes when providers hand off patients to the next shift, which makes sense. There's always something that a doctor or nurse knows, but isn't communicated effectively to the next shift with the hand off or through medical charts. It just becomes a balance between minimizing patient hand-offs and fatigue from long shifts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a recent study that if I'm recalling correctly, shows the mistakes from hand offs are not statistically significantly different from mistakes made from working 24+ hour shifts. The fact is mistakes are made either way. We need know know if the the amount of mistakes are different or the severity of mistakes are different. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.pennstatelawreview.org/penn-statim/the-lasting-legacy-of-a-case-that-was-lost/" target="_blank">Here is a case that really made the medical field start looking into sleep deprivation and mistakes</a>. </p>
<p>In the last year there has been a study going on looking at first year residents and splitting them into groups that work the 24+ hour shifts, and interns who work no more than 16 hour shifts. I'm almost certain the initial results are showing there's no significant difference in the amount of mistakes. Depending on which side you view this from could mean two different things. From the resident side, I would take it as meaning they wouldn't have to work 24+ hours and have a better quality of life overall. From the administrative side, it would mean you could work your residents harder and maybe save some costs, as there's no difference in the amount of mistakes. I don't know if they looked at the severity of mistakes. I also believe this initial result was from surgical residents and not the medical residents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heck, even when you're in for a couple days following child birth (and I'm a dad) you sort of get a bit out of sorts every nurse changeover. And, provided the baby is well, and especially on your second or more child, there really isn't much going on. </p>
<p>Can only imagine if you were in for a critical condition that was changing and in need of acute care, how much seeing the same doc and staff would help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if performance suffers than the patient is more likely to suffer a medication error which can lead to poorer outcomes for the patient. Another thing one can do is maintain consistent staff so people have the same patients day in and day out. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Since the dawn of time, old crusty docs have been bemoaning how easy the residents of today have it.</p>

<p>And then my old sawbones family doc waxes nostalgic with me about how you used to not even have to show up for your continuing ed hours, just pay for your spot in the &quot;workshop&quot; and they'd send you your cert.</p>
<p>He was mildly complaining because now everyone has to retake their boards all the time and you actually have to do the workshops to get your CE hours. To his credit he was a great doc, and I don't think he minded except in the sense that it cut into his few days off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a few articles on kevinmd.com about certification through &quot;voluntary&quot; programs for doctors that are anything but. I definitely think docs need to actually attend their CE, but some of the re-certification stuff is more about money than it is standards. </p></div>		</li>
