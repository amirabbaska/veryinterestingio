			<div class="markdown"><p>One big problem with the Chinese stock market is that at one point investors were pouring so much money in that any stocks truly of value became horribly overpriced, so the money flow started shifting to stocks that were slightly lesser value, lather, rinse, repeat until people are driving up the stock prices of garbage shell companies far over their penny stock valuations.</p>
<p>This is compounded by the inability of investors to get reliable information about many companies and their financial health. Because, China.</p>
<p>This creates a bubble where many otherwise worthless stocks have value only as long as everyone agrees they have value.  As soon as a major institutional investor makes a run for the exit, everyone else follows and it ends up like a Great White concert.  This is exactly what's happening now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not, though.  The Shanghai bourse is blue chips, real companies with real profits from real operations.  It's down 1/3 in the last month.  These stocks aren't worthless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter.  When the bubble pops on the stocks that ARE worthless, it drags everything else down with it, including blue chips.</p>
<p>It happened in the USA in 2008-2009.  The bubble popped, everyone ran for the exits and even blue chip stocks took a beating.  People who were sitting on cash in 2010-2011 were able to cherry pick blue chip stocks that were unfairly punished and ride them back up.</p>
<p>And it's happening here again.  By keeping interest rates low, the fed is basically forcing investors to put everything in the stock market to chase yield since you can't get a decent return from bonds or CDs.  When there too much money entering the system and not enough legitimate value, people pay too much for stocks.  They also take too much risk with sketchy non-blue chip stocks (or mutual funds) in order to chase returns (often dividends) that really aren't sustainable.</p>
<p>Eventually, someone will pull out the rug and the people at the bottom of the pyramid will get crushed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know all the people who are explaining why stock prices have dropped 30% in China over the last month?</p>
<p>Where were they six weeks ago?  That's when I wanted to know about this, not now.</p>
<p>Fact is, they didn't know it was going to happen six weeks ago, and I don't think they know why it happened now, and I don't think they know what's going to change in the next six weeks, either.</p></div>		</li>
