<p>The difference between humans with different skin colors is like the difference between a chocolate lab and a yellow lab; when the two mix, you don't get a splotchy dog, but one with a uniform coat somewhere in between. Sometimes it runs a little darker but the pelt features are the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't get a blend or steps in between when you cross different colored Labs.  The colors for &quot;Yellow&quot; in Labs and the genes for &quot;Chocolate&quot; are on totally different alleles.  </p>
<p>A Yellow Lab is a black dog that is homozygous with the ee-recessive red gene.  ee-Recessive Red turns hair, but not skin (nose, lips, eye rims, etc) yellow/red but the skin remains black.  </p>
<p>A Chocolate is a black dog that is also homozygous with the liver gene (a dilution gene). The liver gene turns all black pigment - in the hair and the skin - to brown.  </p>
<p>Crossing a yellow lab with a chocolate lab may result in black labs, or if the dogs are homozygous for the liver &amp; ee-recessive gene, you might get yellow labs, chocolate labs or &quot;dudleys&quot; - dogs that are homozygous for both ee-recessive and liver.  Dudleys have yellow fur but due to yet unknown interactions between ee-recessive and liver, often the skin pigmentation is pink.  Here' a dudley: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/c95mT2F" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/c95mT2F</a></p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to talk about gradated differences between two genetic states, Labs are not a good example.  </p>
<p>Edit: I think a better example with Labs would be the I locus which is believed to control intensity of red pigment (phaeomelanin). It's the reason we have yellow labs that range from creamy white to deep fox-red.  The I locus has not been mapped out but it does seem to breed true: cross two &quot;pale cream&quot; yellow labs and you get lab pups in the lighter end of the scale.  Cross two &quot;fox red&quot; yellow labs and the resulting pups will also be darker red-gold like their parents.  Now cross a &quot;pale cream&quot; with a &quot;fox red&quot; and you're likely to get a &quot;yellow&quot; yellow lab, fairly close to the middle.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetics is not really for 5 year olds. That's why it's normally taught later. Basically humans don't have spots or stripes when mixed because their parents didn't have spots or stripes. u/hmm_yea_nono 's #2 is a good reason. Both &quot;colors&quot; get expressed to some extent, which leads to a blend.</p>
<p>edit: Actually gave a short explanation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The premise of this question is a little flawed. It's hard to say this without evoking somebody's political sensibilities, but when it comes to humans race doesn't really exist like we think it does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people's conception of race is actually correctish - the top level groupings (white, black, Asian, Polynesian, Amerindian) do actually exist, correspond to genetic and phenotypic differences between different population groups, and are are a result of historical reproduction patterns and much higher rates of interbreeding within population groups than between them due to relative isolation.</p>
<p>All humans are the same species - <em>homo sapiens sapiens</em> - but there are differences between different population groups due to differences in the distribution of alleles, which manifest themselves in phenotypic differences, such as skin color, facial structure, bone morphology, ect. This is why it is possible for physical anthropologists to determine someone's race by looking at their bones, and why it is possible for sites like 23andMe to determine your ancestry from your DNA.</p>
<p>People from different groups also show different rates of admixture with archaic hominids like Neanderthals (African populations did not mix with them, but all other humans did) and the Denisovians (Melanesians and Aboriginal Australians have some Denisovian ancestry; other humans do not).</p></div>		</li>
