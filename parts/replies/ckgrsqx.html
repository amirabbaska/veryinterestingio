			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to your 3rd paragraph is no. The force of gravity is still applied to the bottom penny despite the deformations of his uppers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to acknowledge that /u/Roll_Up_The_Rim was probably referring to a lower force due to greater contact surface, a subject on which I will have to agree with you, /u/Sazerizer.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the higher a penny is, the farther from earth it is, so the lower the G-force gets. It is a barely measurably slight effect, but a real one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key quantity is not force, but pressure, which will decrease at the height of any penny that deforms in such a way that its cross-sectional area increases.</p></div>		</li>
