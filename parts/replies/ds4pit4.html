			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the child's age.  Certain sounds develop at certain parts of their language development.  I'm no expert in that area, however, your public school has resources for screening and placement in speech services.<br />
A big indicator is if you or others are having a hard time understanding your child.  There are services available to preschoolers, but you may have to follow up with screening by contacting a local school district rep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a fight with our youngest son's school over this. He was in 1st grade and was having trouble pronouncing his R's. The school wanted to put him in speech class, even after telling us that he shouldn't really be fully pronouncing them until 2nd grade or so. We told them &quot;no&quot; and that we would revisit the issue the next year and if there was anything we could do at home to correct it, we would do that. The guidance counselor actually told us &quot;well, we'll take you to court and we'll WIN&quot;. We said &quot;uh, no, you won't&quot;, reiterated that he was not going to be put into speech class early, and that we weren't going to be bullied into putting him into any kind of special education classes without due, appropriately timed cause. It got ugly pretty quick. </p>
<p>His R pronunciation issue resolved by 2nd grade. </p></div>		</li>
