<p>Dark matter is mostly about explaining the apperant missing mass of individual galaxies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because it interacts only gravitationally - which does not apply to dark energy. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I made a mistake in saying it interacts through gravity while I should have said it enacts negative pressure, which results in a gravity pull. The cause or carrier of said pressure is the unknown part.</p>

<p>That is just a theory AFAIK, as Dark Energy itself might be a property of an improved gravity model.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would be gravity &quot;push&quot; (negative gravity). Gravity &quot;pull&quot; is just gravity. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That is true for dark matter, but if anything dark energy probably is like negative gravity (which is different than &quot;interacting through gravity&quot;). </p></div>		</li>
