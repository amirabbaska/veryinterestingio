			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a excellent response, I'll also add that cinema projectors use a different file formats known as DCP (digital cinema projection), which is less compressed and usually a higher resolution than consumer formats.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although this is true, that's independent of the projector itself.  If you had the necessary hardware to read the encrypted file and decode the video, you could send it to your home projector.  It still won't overcome the key limitations of your projector - namely the lens and the light output.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can play the trailers from the studios since 99% of them arent encrypted and you are dead right - they don't come close to the quality on a home projector as a D Cinema projector</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem is that the file sizes are huge. I've helped send out DCPs and they have to go on their own hard drive </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can play a blu-ray through these projectors and it will look amazing. Much of the quality comes from the hardware (lens, globe) and the fact that the colour and light output is much better quality (colour is adjusted to be exactly what the studios want) and xenon light is such a pure source of white light. The projectors are very expensive for a reason</p></div>		</li>
