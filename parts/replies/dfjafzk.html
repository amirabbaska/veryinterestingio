			<div class="markdown"><p>But the nice thing is that with TCP/IP this could actually work ;)<br />
If there is at least partial connection with the ethernet cables you might only get 10Mbit instead of a Gbit (one of 8 pairs connected correctly) and the connections may not be on the right cables. But with a good switching and routing system some of the packages could actually get to the right place regardless of which cables you connect to another. Of course this would need a lot of redundancy with the wiring and a bigger than necessary switching/routing system - but with the human body you have just this - a brain that adapts to input even if the source changed (to a certain degree) and nerve bundles with redundancy (to a degree)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it does connect like that, and I'm not saying it will, the brain is elastic. The extent of it has never been tested, but this could surely be it. The brain <em>could</em> just rewire itself for the new body. Honestly, I am not expecting much, but even a little bit of success could go a long way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if you're an infant. Not so much for an adult. </p>
<p>Just look at how the brain adapts to cochlear implants - for example. It works great for infants/kids... but works much less well for adults.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking most of those grew with a lot of potential at the beginning maybe more like ethernet wires connected to a switch and could be reconfigured but   an adult I'm thinking by then it's more like an electrical wiring diagram and if u wire A to B you get a short near A and a failure to power B</p></div>		</li>
