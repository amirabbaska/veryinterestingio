			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct- but I'll add on that the neurons aren't &quot;getting tired&quot;; they become less sensitive (&quot;inhibited&quot;) to repeated stimulus because sending the same message over and over again, at the same intensity, is almost always unhelpful or harmful. The failure of this mechanism, resulting in all or part of your brain transmitting the same signal over and over again, seems to be the cause of some seizure disorders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be correct to assume this is related to how you don't hear background noise after a while but as soon as it stops you think &quot;oh wow that refrigerator was loud&quot;.</p>
<p>Along those lines, are these effects related to other things your brain does to filter out senses? Color correction in poor lighting for instance, persistent smells being less noticeable, etc.</p></div>		</li>
