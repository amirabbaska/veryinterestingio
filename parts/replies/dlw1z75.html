			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a guy and I'm with you, my mom was a cosmetologist and offered to let me try her concealer once when I was younger and I haven't looked back since. I get dark circles every day with very little variance with increased sleep so I apply a little bit of my proper color blends to even out my skin tone. </p>
<p>I've had brands that were too dry and were more obvious to the casual observer, and after a few embarrassing situations, I was able to land on another affordable brand that sticks better and flatter. So far that has been the CoverGirl Trublend fixstick concealer, but after seeing some of the other comments in this sub thread I'm also going to try out the maybelline stuff. </p>
<p>I just think of this in relation to men in front of a tv broadcast or a film camera, they get makeup done for maximum attractiveness, and it really does make a difference. My wife wasn't alarmed by my daily use at all, I just explained why I use it and it was never a problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybelline has 2 amazing concealers for cheap! There's the age rewind which supposedly helps with wrinkles down there as well, but I go for their Fit Me concealer as it covers more. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't even notice that Fit Me existed. Will try that next since I use the Age Rewind now. Works well, there's definitely still some vague discoloration but far better than a purple blue!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other poster says Maybelline. This is it on Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YOQZ2T0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_l8FMzbCRW90Z9" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YOQZ2T0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_l8FMzbCRW90Z9</a></p>
<p>I should maybe try the alternative to Age Rewind!</p>
<p>There's a brand that's marketed for men called Menaji ior something similar, but I've yet to try it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same way. If you look back at pictures of me they were always there. It sucks now because it makes me look really old and really tired <em>all</em> of the time. I'm a woman so it means more to me and honestly makeup doesn't do a <em>thing</em>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel ya, make up isn't perfect, it just helps. Although I see some people have skin that's puffy or sagged almost? I can see how makeup might not help then. We're still awesome!</p></div>		</li>
