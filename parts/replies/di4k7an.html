<p>The following year I built a shed and used nothing but Robertsons because of the ease of use, and the ability to put it on the bit and not have it fall off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still use phillips on the fence because they are only $4 for 100, but when it comes time to do an entire fence, I will probably use something else. </p>
<p>The only readily available robertson drive screws here are Kreg brand for pocket holes. So those are like $6-8/100 but they are pan head and not regular wood screw heads. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not sure where you live in the US but if you go to the hardware stores around me Torx is just as common as phillips. When you get into more exterior/construction grade screws torx is even more common. </p>
<p>I universally use Torx  and I've never had difficulty getting them at any Ace, Home Depot, or Lowes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason they never became more widespread was the inventor Peter L. Robertson licensed the design and wanted considerable money to allow companies to make or use them. Much like why the Sony Betamax never caught on, companies and often people like simple and cheap, not always good, the best. </p>
