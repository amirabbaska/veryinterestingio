			<div class="markdown"><p>Frogs tend to die when crossing seawater, because their skins let water pass through.  That means sitting in seawater is equivalent to <em>drinking</em> seawater, and frogs can't survive that any more than humans can.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you hopped on a raft to drift from Central America to Fiji, you'd likely die of dehydration, so you'd want to drink the water but drinking all that salt will cause kidney failure. </p>
<p>The iguanas salt glands give them the ability to keep hydrated by expelling excess salt from their bodies, making long trips at sea more survivable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a cold blooded animal like an iguana could survive for some time without food ( not like it's spending energy hunting in the middle of the ocean) so the only limiting factor is being able to drink </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vegetation rafts are a really important component of Island Biogeography, and reptiles are very good candidates for island colonization via this method (mainly due to slow metabolism).</p>
<p>Reptiles and arthropods really don't have much of a problem hitching rides on vegetation rafts, for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Keep in mind there are millions of years to work with. If you had millions of years to throw a quarter into a coin slot 50 feet away, you'd eventually get it.</p></div>		</li>
