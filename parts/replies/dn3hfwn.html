			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a cute way to put it. Because of humans, there's a piece of Earth forever ingrained in Saturn, and without humans that would never have been a reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a bit of a weird way to look at it. Saturn and earth are made of the same stuff (though in different quantities) and came from the same place. crashing the orbiter is just a slight adjustment in the organization of stellar material, not even a noticeable one when compared with the constant impact of asteroids and the like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Other commenters have pointed out that the isotope of plutonium on Cassini is manmade / not naturally occurring. It is about as close to uniquely manmade as anything can actually be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dropping a chunk of fissile material into a gravity well will not cause a nuclear explosion. It will just scatter the material.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, note that the Pu-238 used in Cassini's RTGs isn't even fissile to begin with, and it's impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not quite true. With enough fissionable material a gun-type bomb is pretty easy. You just take two pieces of subcritical stuff and combine them into a supercritical mass. You need to do it quick enough that they don't just fizzle and there's a little bit of engineering that goes into the design of the masses and their holder, but it's not really that hard.</p>
<p>An implosion-type is much safer for transportation and much more efficient (in weight and volume), but requires very good engineering, like you said. That's probably a more realistic metric for trying to explode Cassini, for sure, but Cassini didn't have fissionable material so it's a moot point.</p></div>		</li>
