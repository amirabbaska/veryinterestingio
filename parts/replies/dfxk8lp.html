			<div class="markdown"><p>See if the aliens have any galaxy databases where you can look for a spiral galaxy with two smaller accompanying satellite galaxies (a spiral bar at 1.6 diameters and a bar at 2 diameters). If you can also communicate about the speed of light and give a good approximation of the length of a second, you can narrow the list of matches down to those with a central galaxy roughly 3 trillion light-seconds across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think communicating the diameter of the galaxy in meters / your preferred unit of length would be easier. You probably know your height already or the exact length of something you have to give the aliens as a basis, and you can calculate the diameter of the Milky Way in meters or feet rather easily (a simple multiplication if you know that it's ~100k ly and that lightspeed is 2.97E8 m/s) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... 3.00e8 m/s, 2.998e8 m/s, or 2.9979e8 to 3, 4, and 5 significant figures respectively.</p>
<p>What is with people wanting to round lightspeed to 2.99 or other incorrect values? 2.97 is the worst I've seen, and it looks like you've dropped a 9 AND rounded incorrectly.</p></div>		</li>
