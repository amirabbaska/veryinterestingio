<p>Think about it. If you have a large area to measure, more rain drops will hit it. And if a small area, fewer rain drops will fall on it. Therefore it evens out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important: The walls of the container must be vertical. They can't be angled toward or away from the center of the container because then the area you're capturing from will be funneled toward a smaller area and be inaccurate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have a funnel, as long as you compensate. (If you have a 10 sq in aperture, and the actual measurement location is a cylinder or rectangle with cross section of 1 sq in, each inch of rain will turn into 10 inches of vertical measurement. This is useful for precision.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Somewhat disagreed</p>
<p>Rain is random. A very small collecting chamber, measuring for a short time will be affected more by randomness than a larger chamber</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you move the chamber two feet to the left you will get a different set of random events. The idea being the randomness is smoothed out over a long period of time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No, I think I'll bounce this sentence back. Consider what you're actually measuring when you're checking the depth in your measuring container. Are you <em>actually</em> at all interested in the depth of water in your rain meter? Or do you measure it because it's proportional to the number you <em>really</em> want to know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But... everyone wants to know a different number - what volume of water fell on my garden, roof, hat, porch, parking lot, whatever... the answer is always the &quot;inches&quot; multiplied by the surface area of the thing - since the meteorologist has no idea the surface of your thing, he supplies you with the single missing piece of info you need. Why on earth does this need to be &quot;bounced back&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's not what you're actually measuring. Why would the cubic inch volume of the water matter? You're not telling someone that if you put a container outside measuring a certain size you will get this many cubic inches in water. You just say you'll get a certain amount of inches, or centimeters if you're making sense, of rain.</p></div>		</li>
