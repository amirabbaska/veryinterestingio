			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, but this is untrue. The morphological difference between A, a, and α predates the printing press.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3okeb1/eli5_why_is_the_lowercase_a_we_type_different_to/cvy475w" target="_blank">This comment</a> by /u/F0sh explains it a little bit, but the basic idea is that there were multiple methods for writing a's throughout the history of the Latin alphabet. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_script#/media/File:Evolution_of_minuscule.svg" target="_blank">You can see this quite clearly in this diagram.</a> Although beware, that this diagram is woefully simplified and cuts out a good deal of scripts. <a href="http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/history1.htm" target="_blank">For a more thorough history of scripts and an analysis of them check out this website.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/scrindex.htm" target="_blank">A good place to see the immense scope and breadth of scripts is this section of that website.</a></p>
<p>It's also important to point out that these different ways of writing A were not in &quot;direct competition&quot; with one another, scribally speaking. They worked in unison and performed different functions, depending on the script being used, the type of document being produced, the hierarchy of each part of the document (headings were fancier, the names and titles of kings and bishops slightly less so, and the main text of the document even less so).</p>
<p><a href="http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/examples/c13charter2.htm" target="_blank">You can see the multiplicity of As in this document from 13th century England.</a></p>
<p>It may be difficult to see them to the untrained eye, but here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a Roman-style, &quot;modern&quot; &quot;capital&quot; A beginning the 6th word on the first line - Ad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a very English-style, &quot;droopy-nose&quot; a (where the top line loops up and then droops down into the round-bit) in the 11th word on the first line - Samson</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Gothic-style, box a in the 6th word on the second line - Sal(u)t(em). In this style the A almost looks like a modern upper-case B. Not quite so much in this instance, but trust me, it can really look like one when they start squaring off.</p>
</li>
<li>There is a half-uncial-style, rounded α in the 12th word on the second line - Carta. You will also notice that this word has two styles of A. The first is a droopy-nose A and the second is a half-uncial style one.</li>
</ul>
<p>These differences coexisted in Europe throughout the period of both script and print. For an example of this, compare the A's found <a href="http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/examples/human2.htm" target="_blank">in the Italian humanistic script of the 15th, which eventually provided much of the basis for printing letters,</a> with the a's found in <a href="http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/examples/italiancursive2.htm" target="_blank">Italian cursive documents a century later in the 16th century, which were in use throughout the period of the printing press</a>.</p>
<p>In conclusion:</p>
<p>/u/glyttch's explanation that this has to do with old presses becoming worn is incorrect. The differences existed long before the printing press and were in mixed use for quite a while before, during, and after the press itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Letters that are the same in terms of <strong>appearance</strong> in the Greek and Latin alphabet: </p>
<p>A = A,
B = B,
E = E,
H = H,
I = I = i (dot over i not always present in Greek),
K = K,
M = M,
N = N,
O = O = o,
P = P = p,
T = T,
u = u,
v = v,
X = X = x,
Y = Y,

<p>EDIT: Please for the love of what you hold dear, stop telling me they don't sound the same. I know, I'm frigging Greek. I am comparing their shape not their sound. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current type face &quot;a&quot; isn't without precedent in old scribal hands in Latin either. We see it in the uncial script (pre-Carolingian period, early Middle Ages), though it falls out of favor in the Carolingian hand, which used an &quot;a&quot; more similar to how we write them by hand. The type style &quot;a&quot; returns in the Gothic hand as well.</p></div>		</li>
