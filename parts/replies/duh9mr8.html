			<div class="markdown"><p>How is everyone a farmer in Madagascar? I live in Indonesia where it's pretty much either farms or plantations or jungle when you're outside the cities and we eat so much rice we imported rice and the government has to convince people to eat less rice. I guess everyone also need to be a farmer here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extreme poverty is the reason. People are subsistence farmers growing food for their families on land that was handed down to them. There arenâ€™t many cities (only the capital has over a million people) everyone else lives in remote villages with poor infrastructure. There is extreme malnutrition and stunting due to overeating rice here. 50%-70% of children suffer from malnutrition and chronic malnutrition, all of which is easily prevented by eating a more balanced diet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a similar statement to one like &quot;everyone is a cook&quot;. Not everyone is a commercial farmer, but it's possible to grow some rice for your own needs. So if you have a small area of land, you can grow rice and the need to buy it is reduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live on a quarter acre in a suburb that is literally a 20 minute bike ride from the Canadian boarder. On my quarter acre lot, I have 4 sugar maple trees that I just started tapping, and will yield me enough syrup for the rest of the year. I also have 3 bee hives, and produce over 100lbs of honey each year. I have 4 egg laying hens (No roosters, because it's a suburb, and I don't want to piss off my neighbors). To reduce the cost of the chickens, I grow meal worms in a composting bin in my basement, and I feed the meal worms with leftover food from my dinners. Finally, I have a 19 x 22 foot veggie garden. I use chicken droppings to enrich my garden soil. I had an apple tree too when I bought the property, but it was struck by lightning 3 years ago, and I had to cut it down (I have been giving the applewood away to friends, family, and neighbors since it's great for smoking meats).</p>
<p>I turn 30 this year... I am amazed at how productive land can be. I give eggs, and honey, and surplus veggies/herbs away to my immediate neighbors. The kids all get a kick out of the chickens, as they are not a popular thing to have in my area. One of the boys likes the bees, but I yell at him to stay away because I don't want his mom hollering at me because her dumb kid stuck his nose too close to the hive.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is... 5 years ago, before I owned land, if you had asked me what I could do with a quarter acre of property, I would probably have guessed &quot;nothing&quot;, you can actually do quite a bit. I was lucky to find a property with established maple trees and an apple tree. I put the bees, chickens and veggie garden in myself, and I specifically constructed the plot to be aesthetically pleasing, with the garden and hen house lined up with the home on my property. This resulted in slightly less perfect placement, about 1/3 of my garden is in morning shade and can only grow root veggies. But I think having a more beautiful property is worth it, and prevents neighbors who might not like having foul and bees in the area from complaining. I will say, no one has ever complained to my face, I get a lot of compliments, and I like it when other families out for an afternoon walk stop at my yard to see what I've got going on.</p></div>		</li>
