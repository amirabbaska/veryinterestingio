			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting part is the delivery of the technology is within our known understanding.  The TV signal was returned from a satellite the <em>aliens</em> placed in a nearby star system.  Broadcasting that signal and additional encoded data back in similar EM spectrum.  This additional data ends up giving <em>us</em> the completely imaginary tech that we didn't know was possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interstellar wad a nice thriller. We have no idea whether wormholes exist or whether we can use them. Philosophers argue about the causality issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly Interstellar is a fantastic film but its adhesion to science is a bit overrated imo. Let's ignore the completely romantic guess of what is happening inside the black hole. That movie talks about how hard we have to work on a tech to get around gravity, yet has a spaceship going on and off planets without a blink and absolutely no thrust support. Sure the work done on outside the wormhole was outstanding, but the whole was nowhere near the scientific diligence of a contact or a 2001. </p></div>		</li>
