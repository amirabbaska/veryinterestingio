			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There might be other problems with the phone after such a long time, but getting a new battery will make it have the same battery life as new. If the phone is slow on the other hand, it might be because newer apps need more computing power, that won't be solved by a new battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of but not really. Not only do batteries degrade but the electronic components in the phone degrade and become less efficient over time as well. That, in combination with more graphically demanding OS updates as time goes by can be a majority of the reason why phones feel slower over time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Samsung/Google do not slow their phones intentionally over time (other than rolling more resource hungry OS that don't run as smootly on older devices, but that is normal). </p>
<p>What I am saying is: you don't need to switch your  battery, your phone will <strong>not</strong> slow down like iPhones. But you will have less and less time of battery as it gets old until either you will get fed up with having to charge twice a day, or the battery will simply die (when one of the cells short circuits the anode and cathode).</p>
<p>So ... keep using your phone and forget about Apple. You are probably going to switch your phone because it is worn out/old before the battery dies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The issue with the phones, is that all batteries develop internal resistance over time as a result of the charge/discharge process. As a result it’s harder for the battery to provide the voltage needed to run the phone. </p>
<p>So what you see is the battery can’t sustain that voltage as long. This causes the phone to shutdown to protect itself, even when the phone still reports it has battery left. Ever seen your phone say you have like 15% battery left but you run some hardcore app and it shuts down? This is the effect in action. </p>
<p>So what Apple did, was add code that detects when your battery starts to suck. It will slow down the processor. This means the hardware is drawing less power and the phone lasts longer. Apple has decided the best experience is to have a slower phone that still lasts a long time. It would have been nice if they told users this was happening, or maybe have a toggle switch to turn the feature on or off. But it’s a perfectly sensible power management technique. Windows laptops have been doing this by default also, for years. If you go into the advanced settings of your selected power management plan on a Windows device you can see on low battery it will throttle down the processor and optionally remove power to usb devices among other things. It’s pretty industry standard. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, puttting a new battery in your phone would prevent the power condition of high internal resistance from occurring (at least until this new battery goes bad) and since the battery is sound, there is no need to trigger the speed throttling code. Your phone will return to full speed. </p>
<p>That being said, flash memory also goes bad over time - but that’s a whole ‘nother ELI5. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, at the start of lithium batteries, it would be a bad thing to regularly run them dry. Also, a &quot;reset cycle&quot; where you purposefully ran it dry and recharged back to full was highly recommened. </p>
<p>Nowadays, I don't think the batteries benefit much from that reset cycle, and although it's generally bad practice to run the battery dry, it's less harmful now than it was a few years back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>apparently it's most harmful to completely drain them or to keep them very low. You want them to be decently charged most of the time</p></div>		</li>
