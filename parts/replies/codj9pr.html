			<div class="markdown"><p>With very sensitive detector panels that surround the collision region. These ultra hot particles live just long enough to be measured, but not long enough to destroy the panels. </p>
<p>Think of it like holding a lighter to your palm for a fraction of a second, as opposed to letting the flame sit on your skin for 10 seconds. Instead in the case of a particle collider, the heat only lasts for some tiny fraction of a fraction of a second. Enough to allow the detector panel layers to capture a measurement, then relay the data to computers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To continue the analogy, you can use knowledge of how sensitive your skin is to infer the temperature of the flame even if your skin doesn't heat up to that temperature.</p>
<p>What this means in a detector in a collider is that the decay products after this very hot plasma has dissipated are what are being detected, not the plasma directly. From the slew of resulting particles, the energy of the plasma can be inferred, and models linking binding energy to temperature are what gives the value provided in the picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're making the incorrect assumption that the detector panels are as sensitive as human skin. I can't explain exactly how they do it, maybe someone smarter than I can. However, particle colliders are designed to gather the most minute readings of the energy states of every particle that passes through the detector arrays.</p>
<p>The purpose of my analogy was simply to describe why the detector panels aren't destroyed by heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You said the are measuring the temperature of particles, but there are a lot of people in this thread saying that it doesn't make sense to talk about the temperature of single particles. Am I missing something? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lead atoms are pretty big and made up of lots of other particles, the protons and neutrons and smaller stuff, so they can still be broken down.  From what I understand smashing two lead &quot;particles&quot; together will annihilate both atoms producing a flash of smaller particles and that's what they're using to measure heat and look for different types of particles, like the Higg's Boson.</p>
<p>This is just a basic description, I don't know the technical details, so if I'm actually wrong somebody please correct me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, the temperature of a single atom isn't really a thing, however I didn't say that they measure the result of a collision by reading one individual particle's temperature. Allow me to clarify. The result of a high speed particle collision is never a single particle. It's a plasma soup made of high energy elementary particles, which has the bulk property of temperature. Now whether they measure the amount of heat generated by radiation/induction, or if they calculate the temperature using energy state readings is unknown to me. Regardless of the method, a temperature measurement is collected from the <em>entire</em> collision region. </p></div>		</li>
