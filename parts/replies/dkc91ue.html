			<div class="markdown"><p>One nitpick, there is actually not &quot;the&quot; Fast Fourier Transform but it is a whole family of algorithms with similar performance characteristics. There is the most common special case when the length of the input is a power of two (the Cooley-Tukey transform), or a number with small prime factors, or a prime number, and so on. Which algorithm is the most efficient depends on the length. Also, while all FFT algorithms compute the same expression in terms of algebra, the ordering of the operations is different and this affects precision.</p></div>		</li>
