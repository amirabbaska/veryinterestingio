<p>Nonsense. There are literally <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=herpes+simplex+vaccine" target="_blank">thousands of papers</a> researching HSV vaccines, and <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Herpes+Simplex&amp;term=vaccine&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=" target="_blank">dozens of clinical trials</a>.</p>
<p>It's not that there's no serious push, it's that it's turned out to be a very difficult job. </p>
<p>Herpesviruses in general are very difficult to vaccinate against. The only really effective herpesvirus vaccine is for chickenpox/shingles, and that is both relatively new and kind of lucky. There are lots of veterinary vaccines against herpesviruses (feline, equine, chicken, etc), but most of them are not very effective; they may only reduce clinical signs without blocking shedding and transmission, for example.  </p>
<p>Herpesviruses are in general extremely ancient viruses that are extremely well adapted to their hosts, usually having co-evolved with their host for hundreds of millions of years (the way you get a new herpesvirus is for them to co-speciate along with their host), and with a very large genome as viruses go, and complex life cycles, they are very, very difficult targets to vaccinate against. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See above comments about HSV encephalitis, which is what happens when the herpes virus infection gets into your brain. </p>
<p>It's quite rare (in the US, more than half the population is infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2, while the annual rate for HSV encephalitis is about 1 in 500,000) but it's also very, very bad. I'll leave this quote from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without treatment, HSE results in rapid death in approximately 70% of cases; survivors suffer severe neurological damage.[1] When treated, HSE is still fatal in one-third of cases, and causes serious long-term neurological damage in over half of survivors. Twenty percent of treated patients recover with minor damage. Only a small population of survivors (2.5%) regain completely normal brain function.</p>

<p>It's just very very hard to get rid of, if not impossible. HIV had a lot more attention and research money and yet you can't cure it. Some types of virus are hard to crack, HSV is one of them.</p></div>		</li>
