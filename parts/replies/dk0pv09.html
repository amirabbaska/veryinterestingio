			<div class="markdown"><p>The firefly generally stores up a little stockpile of the other involved chemicals in question and the light-producing reaction is a slow one (in the same way that a shaken glow-tube will last a few hours). Very little oxygen is required, but some must continually be supplied as the light-creating chemical reaction loses some oxygen in the form of given-off carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>But it's a tiny amount, so a firefly has plenty of time and access to more than enough oxygen in the air to both breathe for its own respiration and to continue to feed its light producing organs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>luminescent genes are one of the easier things to splice</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure you are referring to GFP and that class of proteins.  They don't create light, they absorb one wavelength and then emit a lower energy wavelength, which is fluorescence not luminescence.  </p>
<p>The ELI5 of this is that we have genetically engineered animals to glow in the dark, but not yet to produce their own light.  Here is more info on a cat that glows in the dark (<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-glow-in-the-dark-kitty-77372763/" target="_blank">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-glow-in-the-dark-kitty-77372763/</a>).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I also read about the 'algae lamps' that photosynthesize during the day and emit at night.  Neat trick, but a few LEDs seem to me like they would be better for nearly every situation.</p></div>		</li>
