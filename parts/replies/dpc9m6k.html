			<div class="markdown"><p>Swapping out CO2 for Nitrogen will not reduce bitterness. Rather, it will reduce sourness. Acids tastes sour to us. Always. Also carbonation bubbles provide a “sharp” mouthfeel. Furthermore, Nitrogen tends to form smaller bubbles than CO2 and so given the right protein profile provides a “creamy” mouthfeel. </p>
<p>So by using Nitrogen as a major component in the beer gas we have three desired effects with Guinness:</p>
<p>1) less sour tasting</p>
<p>2) less sharpness or bite in the mouthfeel</p>
<p>3) a creamy mouthfeel</p>
<p>It should also be noted that a Guinness tap has an aerator or mesh on the head that, by providing many nucleation points, causes much of the beer gas to come out of solution and give the abundance of little bubbles and foam we like to have. </p>
<p>I fucking love Guinness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. A good rule of thumb is this:</p>
<p>Plants that don’t want us to eat them tend to taste bitter to us. These bitter chemical compounds tend to be concentrated in the most nutritious part of a plant; this makes sense because a plant expends energy and time to concentrate useful vitamins and minerals and so spends some extra energy and time making these things taste bitter.</p>
<p>The bitterness you get in tannic acids are not due to the “acid” part but the plant matter from where the tanic acid is derived. </p>
<p>A related, interesting fact is regarding spicy foods. Capsaicin binds to receptors only in mammals; these receptors are not present in birds. Plants make things spicy so that the seeds are eaten and distributed by birds rather than mammals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each of the basic tastes tells our body about something we do or don't need. Sweet indicates carbohydrates, salty indicates salt, sour indicates spoilage, bitter indicates toxins, and umami indicates protein. Since detecting poisons is important to survival, humans have actually evolved about 25 different types of bitter taste receptors.</p>
<p>Tannic acid is a very weak acid, so it doesn't taste very sour. However, since tannins are antinutritional (they make it more difficult to digest proteins), so we've evolved so that one of our types of bitter taste receptors identifies them as bitter.</p>
<p>Similarly, plant evolution has been affected by the fact that many mammals detect tannins as unpalatable, so plants evolved to have tannins in leaves and bark that they don't want eaten, and have evolved so that unripe fruit has tannins in it until the seeds are mature and ready to be eaten and spread. Of course, many mammals that rely on such plants have evolved enzymes to allow them to consume plants that are high in tannins, but humans have not because we have a more varied diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I know monster energy drinks had a nitrogen line for a bit. I think it is more cost prohibitive. I also think it may diffuse into air quicker as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CO2 offsets the sweetness of sodas, so they would taste much sweeter. That's not the prohibitive part though, the real issue is that it's difficult to get the nitro infused cream effect when serving out of a bottle. Guinness and a few other companies have it kinda figured out, but I'd imagine it's cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>I serve cold brewed coffee on my nitro tap, and it's wonderful.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Couldn't they just... you know... add less sugar?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not why Guinness uses nitrogen. Guinness is a very old brewery that used to sell beer in casks. Cask beer is low carbonation and has a creamy mouth-feel caused by smaller CO2 bubbles in comparison to force-carbonated products. The nitrogen is used in Guinness packaging because the product replicates cask beer. </p></div>		</li>
