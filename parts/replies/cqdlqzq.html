			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it this way. A volume of space that contains a star has at least the same density as a volume of space that contains the stellar remnant of that star (i.e. a neutron star or a black hole). The only processes that we understand that form black holes and neutron stars are stellar core collapse and white-dwarfs gaining mass from another body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you are saying. Thank you.</p>
<p>The point I made was that the &quot;hollow brick&quot; gedanken is wrong.  the universe is not made up exclusively of hollow bricks.  there are neutron bricks,  which violated the assumption that the universe is made of hollow bricks.</p>
<p>If one additionally makes the assumption that in the past the universe was made exclusively of hollow bricks, then the rest follows.  But who knows, maybe the big bang left higher density structures in the universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interestingly enough, cosmologists have hypothesized about such structures.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutron stars contain less mass than the stars which formed them. You can just think of the mass of the Neutron star being expanded out to take up the original radius of the parent star. The density is going to be less than the original star had because there is less mass there. </p>
<p>The same reasoning can be applied to all black holes of stellar origin.</p>
<p>For black holes not of stellar origin, the vast majority of the total mass is in the form of supermassive black holes. The largest of these have density less than that of liquid water. This is because black hole volume grows as the cube of the mass, so more mass means less dense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This doesn't seem right at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually is. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the neutron star, it is basically a denser version of its parent star. There wasn't anything inside the original star's radius (other than the star), so after the collapse the distance between the old radius and the new radius is empty. If you took a look at the average density of the old radius of the star, you would find it slightly decreased with the neutron star there. This is because, though the neutron star is very dense, the space around it is very empty. They balance out. </p>
</li>
<li>For the black hole, it is somewhat counterintuitive but true. It follows the same reasoning as above. The thing is, the &quot;radius&quot; of the black hole expands linearly with mass. However, the <em>volume</em> expands cubically faster than the radius. So, you add 10 times the mass and you get 1000 times the volume. Which means that you now have <em>1/100th the density</em>, because density is mass divided by volume. </li>
</ol>
<p>The confusing issue here is that we're talking about <em>average</em> density, not density at a given point. So though the center of the black hole is extremely, and possibly infinitely dense, the space near the edge is basically empty (this is a very rough explanation). So the <em>average</em> density of supermassive black holes ends up being very low. Similarly, the gravitational tides at the surface are very weak compared to a smaller black hole, which means you could actually survive falling beyond the event horizon. </p></div>		</li>
