			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a recurring abcess on my neck and that packing sucks so much it is the worst part of having an abcess drained, and normally falls out within 24 hours. </p>
<p>I have read somewhere that in cases like mine the packing actually doesn't help, and may actually make thinks worse. But I'm not a doctor so I have no idea. I'm curious if there is any truth to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had one, it got big really fast, in my left armpit. Only one I've ever had. Holy crap it hurt to get it taken care of, and very embarrassing to see the cute doctor's assistant watch in horror as all that gunk came out. The packing part didn't really bother me much, and it indeed fell out within 24 hours. Then at the followup a few days later, the Doc realized there was more in there, and getting that last 5% out hurt more than the entire first time.  </p>
