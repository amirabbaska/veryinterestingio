			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing a Nat Geo or Discovery special 10 years ago about the Trieste voyage and being absolutely gobsmacked that I had never heard of it. I had been under the impression humans were unable to go that deep, let alone doing it in the freakin’ 1960s.</p>
<p>It seemed almost as incredible as going to the moon, and most people don’t even know about it!</p>
<p>There were all kinds of crazy details, like how their submersible started cracking from the pressure and they kept going down anyway. </p>
<p>After the special I immediately went on Amazon and tried to find books about the journey, and only found one, and I think it was in French or something. </p>
<p>It’s amazing no one has made a movie about it yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Distances astound me so much. When you hear something is 7 miles below the ocean surface it’s like pfft what’s 7 miles. I can drive or run that distance it’s not far but when you think of that vertically...it just blows my mind </p></div>		</li>
