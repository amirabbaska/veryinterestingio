<p>So a Canadian assault group is what most militaries call a fireteam?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Now, things have changed a bit for this ol' timer (I served from '94-'99) but the essentials remain the same. (really, they do.  I'm also a WWI historian and I could teach lectures from 1914 Infantry pamphlets that a rifleman today would understand.</p>
<p>The Fire Team being two individuals in a typical eight pers. section divides the weapons of the section evenly so that each Assault Group has a mix of rifles, light machine gun and currently, 40mm grenade launcher (something we didn't have readily available when I was in.)</p>
<p>The idea is this:  The Role of the Infantry is to </p>
<p>&quot;Close With and DESTROY the Enemy.&quot;  </p>
<p>That &quot;Closing&quot; is often boiled down to that last ten yards or so, the bayonet point, but in reality it starts much further away, and at organisations much higher up than Sections and Platoons.  But whether it's an Infantry Section of eight men or a Division of 10k+, that means overpowering your enemy's ability to impede the closing (it's ever so simple it's called &quot;winning the firefight.&quot;) so that those assaulting the enemy can follow through.</p>
<p>In section tactics, this means when under contact, the Section Commander can move his men forward in a leap frog fashion known as &quot;fire and movement&quot;.  This begins by moving one Assault Group while the other provides covering fire. At a closer distance, the Section Commander will indicate that each Assault Group will move its Fire Teams independently. Even closer, the movement will devolve onto the two individuals in the Fire Team move in like fashion.  Once close enough to make the final assault, a fire team will be assigned to take the objective, and will do so by use of grenades, automatic rifle fire and the bayonet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given how much human interaction can throw off the shot -- movement, breathing, positioning, trigger control, etc. -- why is the soldier still the lead actor in this situation? Meaning, wouldn't it make more sense for their still to be a sniper, but for him to be using technology to better the outcome? Weapon on a tripod, screen for aim, servos controlling and limiting movement, electronic triggering, etc.? I'm assuming that has been explored, so there must be limitations (performance of the equipment in difficult environments, etc.). What are they?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more moving parts, the greater margin for error. </p>
<p>Snipers often operate in hostile environments. The additional gear you describe may be bulky, awkward, and/or fragile.</p>
<p>I'm not a sniper, but I'm certain the weapons they use are designed to be as advanced as possible while still being useful in the field, which means easy to repair, tough enough to withstand adverse weather, and light enough to carry long distances. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that makes sense especially for static scenarios, but you'd be surprised how behind a military can be on tech and common sense because of tradition, machismo and just not being one to radically change things. </p>
<p>They do have all sorts of tripods <a href="http://www.lonestarfieldproducts.com/images/gallery/IMG_0132.jpg" target="_blank">1</a> ,<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/3c/b4/403cb413c5d7d8a8dc99d1bfc09671b9--air-rifle-sniper-rifles.jpg" target="_blank">2</a> in use or available off the self, full benchrest might be deemed impractical becaue it restricts movement but that seems silly to me.
electronic/mechanical remote trigger (like cameras in the 70's) make total sense. </p>
<p>Honestly my estimation is that armies isn't looking to change the old ways, and people aren't trying to take away from the machismo and glory of being a sniper by giving him a fully adjustable bench-rest with remote trigger and screen. (btw such expensive systems <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/06/for_years_and_y/" target="_blank">exist</a> in vehicles and borders but aren't manned by snipers or even combat soldiers)</p>
<p>The reality is that the act of pulling the trigger isn't rocket science, hunters do it every day and certainly within the military others know how to shoot, given a good sniper rifle and scope, range finder and ballistic calc app everyone in the squad can hit decently, the sniper true skill shows in other area such as comms, intel assessment, infil and basically being a great soldier not just pulling the trigger. </p>
<p>i'm guessing it's just not cool to diminish from the snipers traditional autonomy and capabilities, plus you want you're sniper to be able to sometimes react very quickly, not from a planned, long static ambush situation so you have to train him for those skill anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun trick to show people how much they flinch when pulling the trigger is to tell them there's a round loaded when there isn't. Even better if you have a laser sight. People are always surprised by how much they shake the gun around as they pull the trigger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We wouldn't have done that, mainly for the safety reasons of weapons handling.  One would never (or rather ought to never) be unaware as to the condition of their weapon vis. loaded or not.</p>
<p>The &quot;flinch&quot; and irregular breathing, in fact most of the points illustrated in &quot;HABIT&quot; can be determined by examining the groupings made by the firer.  I can't rightly recall them but, it has to do with the pattern of shots going one way or t'other.  This makes it easy to coach the learner in their mistakes, and a good way to measure progress.  Each application we shoot (i.e. to be graded upon) begins with several series of five round groupings.  This ensures both that HABIT is being considered, and that the weapon itself is properly zeroed to the shooter.</p></div>		</li>
