			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done this with an old big desk fan. I switched it on to the low power initially (possible because it has piano key style operation instead of a rotary switch), and the motor just hummed and the blades didn't move. I had to tap it to just get the blades moving that fraction required for the motor to pick up. </p></div>		</li>
