<p>The total mass-energy of our universe seems to be zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a tautology really.  The claim is that the gravitational potential energy exactly balances the mass-energy.</p>
<p>But, potential energy is relative in the first place. You could choose any scale for general gravitational potential so long as you stick to it. You could find a scale that happens to make the total zero, or anything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean? It takes a very specific amount of energy to separate two objects of mass X and Z. What scale are you talking about?</p>
<p>(I'm not saying you're wrong, just trying to learn / correct myself).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potential energy is relative.</p>
<p>For example gravitational potential energy on earth has a formula of mass * gravity * height</p>
<p>Let's say you wanted to get the potential energy of a 1kg ball on a cliff 10 m above you.</p>
<p>You could choose any reference point, if you chose your height as a reference point, it would have 10 * 1 * 9.8 = 98 Joules of gravitational potential energy. If you chose the ball's height at the cliff, it would have 0 Joules of gravitational potential energy.</p>
<p>Basically gravitational potential energy is measured relative to other locations.</p></div>		</li>
