			<div class="markdown"><p>In California, &quot;reclaimed&quot; water from wastewater treatment plants (where your poop goes) is being used for large scale landscape irrigation. Cities are converting public parks, medians, etc. to use this supply and are working with larger corporate parks, apartment complexes, etc. to switch over. All the piping for these systems is purple from start to finish, except where it has been retrofitted into existing sprinkler systems. This is why you will see communities with green lawns in many public spaces even in the middle of a drought. The financials make sense because you're not trying to run water to every building, much less every toilet.</p>
<p>As someone who works in a building with such irrigation outside of it, the water smells subtly like... a well aged pile of manure, or a forest floor with a lot of decaying plant matter.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live all the wastewater that goes through the sewer network is cleaned and discharged back into local rivers where it rejoins the water cycle.</p>
<p>Sewage is fed by gravity lines and pumps to our wastewater facility. It goes into large settling tanks where water is allowed to evaporate off and the solids are siphoned off to a press room. The press room squeezes any water out of the solids and gets piped back outside. </p>
<p>The solids go to these huge silos called digester buildings where special bugs eat what they can and express methane - which is used to help run the plant.  Anything they can't eat goes to some special landfill for municipal waste. </p>
<p>The water gets chemically treated and tested and retested and sent back to a receiving river or some other water body. Right before it's finally discharged it passes under a UV lamp to kill off any possible bacteria left in the water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Water gets pulled from upriver, utilized, and then cleaned and discharged back into the same river for the downstream cities to use. It works great until it rains and our combined runoff/wastewater system overflows and discharges directly into the local watershed without being processed. I've literally seen tampons shoot out a manhole on a geyser of wastewater and float on a river of excrement into a creek.  Then the downstream cities get a little something extra in their water supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note... While chemicals are commonplace in lots of plants today, the brunt of actual domestic wastewater treatment is physical.... You let gravity settle out the solids, then you aerate the water, which the microorganisms in the wastewater use as food to eat other bugs and get larger, then let them collect and settle them out again.... Then u can get into chemical addition to target specific constituents... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to live in Tampa and they had the same systems all over the place. Subtle smell is right, the first time I walked by a sprinkler system using reclaimed water I couldn't quite figure it out but yeah it does smell mildly like shit haha. </p>
<p>And then signs all over the place warning the homeless people to please not drink the reclaimed water! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cape Coral has the same program. They didn't have any city water service until a few decades ago, when wells around the city started running dry. They're now rolling out a water and sewer system across the city that includes a greywater line to each lot for sprinklers. It's really amazing when you consider that 10,000 individual wells nearly drained the aquifer, but a proper water/sewer system can provide clean water for 180,000 people and counting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom's house has exactly that system: a cistern to collect rainwater from the gutters, a filter, UV sterilizing system and an automatic pump to move the water to a tank in the attic. This would already make the water pretty much potable, but then it's also mixed with water from the utilities company, to make use of all the fluoride, chlorine and whatever else the company uses to kill bacteria and whatnot.
She can use that water everywhere and her bill is so low that the water company already replaced the meter 2 or 3 times thinking it was broken or hacked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool idea but be warned that chlorination to kill bacteria will most likely only work above a certain concentration. When you mixed the water from the city with your rainwater, it will dilute the chlorine and the bacteria killing effect might be dampened a lot. Same thing with fluorine. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You CAN get toilets that are specifically designed to use gray water, or some toilets that have the sink right over the toilet for this purpose. Its just specialty bathroom ceramics (therefore $$$) and additional plumbing $$.</p>

<p>It's much cheaper than that! I outfitted my half bathroom with <a href="http://eco-buildingproducts.com/product/sinkpositive-toilet-sink-accessory-conserves-water/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpNj3zK-j1QIVykwNCh0kKgypEAkYBCABEgIF1_D_BwE&amp;v=3e8d115eb4b3" target="_blank">this</a>. The refill time is more than enough to wash your hands thoroughly, plus it's pretty cheap and requires no additional plumbing. I highly recommend this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Japan for many years and this sink/toilet design was extremely common in homes. It's a little less convenient, but you have one in addition to a normal sink so it's not bad. Plus, it helps people who sometimes &quot;forget&quot; to wash their hands do it, as it's literally already running water right in front of you, you lazy, germ-ridden bum!</p></div>		</li>
