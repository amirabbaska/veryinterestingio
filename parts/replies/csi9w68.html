			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a bridge in Vietnam for years the US couldn't knock out. We did so many bombs and missiles at that bridge. Even dropped special mines into the river that floated under and exploded. At best we only could shut down traffic for a while. It was even suggested that a tactical nuke be used to take it out. Eventually a couple laser guided bombs took out the bridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first Gulf War in 1991 was a display of how well guided weapons. The last major conflict for the US was Vietnam and that ended in 1975. There were smaller conflicts after that, like the invasion of Grenada, and that had it's own problems as well. Other countries involved also had not had not been involved in any major conflicts for awhile.</p>
<p>Come the Iraq invasion of Kuwait, everybody thought it was going to be a long drawn out war due to the size of the Iraqi military. This would be the first major war where precision weapons and GPS were used. Even though only 7.4% of munitions used were precision, these had a huge effect. Instead of a long drawn out war, the entire conflict lasted 6 months, with Desert Storm lasting a little over one month.</p>
<p>Thanks to precision tools, and better explosives, the small diameter bomb was researched and created. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Diameter_Bomb" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Diameter_Bomb</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 7.4% stat always bugged me. non-precision weapons are used in larger numbers to make up for lack of accuracy.</p></div>		</li>
