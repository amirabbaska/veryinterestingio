<p>sending a &quot;hello&quot; signal at well-defined times, when Earth will be listening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is actually a concern for teams back on earth. If redundant timers have failed due to power issues, this could affect the well defined times of transmission. I keep getting this mental image of the team thinking it's 4:AM, and the Rover drunkenly blepping &quot;well it's 5 o'clock somewhere&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a manageable problem. The rover has to have some sort of mechanism to detect earths position. Couldn't they just listen from multiple locations for 24 hrs once they are certain that it should be up? If so they would just need to adjust the intervals based on that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd assume oppurtunity only has short range comms, so it probably has to relay with the mars reconnaiscnance orbiter or the other 2 in orbit. Most likely the interval set up is for when it believes it will be able to communicate with the orbiter, so if that is off then the Rover could miss the orbiter entirely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are numerous methods Rover could use to announce it's status. I'm sure those waiting for some form of reply from the Rover are monitoring 24/7 till something is confirmed. However, there are many issues that could affect the integrity of the transmissions to and from the planet. It all starts with a single handshake that could last a couple of seconds. The big question is what two seconds and whether Rover remembers the maths? In real life this is not about a small team sitting at a console in a single place. It's about numerous teams waiting at consoles in different locations around the globe, all waiting for that one
announcement. It takes a village to run a Rover...lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chance is that it will put up the antenna, and start looking for the earth signal.</p>
<p>The scheduled transmissions is most likelly not like a phone call, more like put up the antenna, aim the earth, transmit the data, put down, do whatever else it have to do, and put up at the scheduled time to await commands. If the signal is not found then it will most likelly wait for the full transmission window, then put it down until the next transmission window.</p>
<p>A transmission window is the time at which a transmission is possible. Think of the moon. When can you transmit/receive data from a lunar base? When you see it. With some math you know when such time is possible. When it is out of that time then it will just put down the antenna to protect it and save power.</p>
<p>If the rover lose time, it will most likelly put it up 24/7 and scan the sky all the time when power is available (i.e. the battery have some charge left).</p>
<p>It is all a priority question: what is more important now: protect the antenna? Or reestablish the signal? Or save power for the night? That is what the rover will do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main issue is not the time itself, but the fact that it use the time to figure out where to point it's antenna!</p>
<p>Imagine you want to aim the moon... You don't know where it is exactly, however you know your last position/orientation, and what time it is right now. A bit of math and you where the moon will be right now. Now you can aim the antenna directly there! If the signal is not found, you now have to go in search mode, which basically will scan the sky. there is many ways to do it, I don't know which way NASA used. I suspect it would be a spiral starting from the point it was supposed to be since that would be the fastest way to find a small error. thing to know is that those antenna are very directional, chance is that it have less than a degree beam width. Why so small? Do you want a flood light? Or a laser pointer to light up a dot in the sky? The tight beam concentrate the power in one direction, like the reflector on a flashlight does.</p>
<p>So yeah, the transmission time is not that important compared to the current time, so it can find the earth.</p></div>		</li>
