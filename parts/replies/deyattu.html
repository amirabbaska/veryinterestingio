<p>Commercial-sized plane?</p>
<p>You'd need all the necessary licenses for that plane and you'd need to file a flightplan before take-off and you'd need to stay in contact with the air controllers throughout the flight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can drive your car without government approval, a license, registration or insurance.</p>
<p>You just can't do it on public roads. But on your own land? sure, go nuts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heck even a single engine ground has to be registered and flown by a licensed pilot.  I'm sure if you owned a big plane you could fly it for fun as long as you had it registered, you were licensed and you had a path/destination planned out, yeah?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is your source for your info? As a pilot and former Air Force air traffic controller most of what you've said sounds either wrong or very poorly stated. As far as hidden RADAR, I've never experienced anything like that in my career. And the whole system requiring you to be monitored and talk to ATC is just flat out wrong. You can fly any plane you are certified in without talking to ATC so long as you stay below 18000 ft. Also if you turn off your transponder you just appear as a tiny dot on most STARS RADAR systems without any information about altitude or speed. While a controller might notice a very fast moving dot and raise a red flag during a busy time, I know plenty of controllers wouldn't even noticed that dot in the middle of the night shift.</p></div>		</li>
