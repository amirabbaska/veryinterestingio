<p>A programmer does not only has to apply a mathematical concept, but he has to formalize the problem and put it into code. They do not solve the problem themselves but teach the computer to solve the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, unless of course your specific field of programming heavily depends on a certain domain of maths. Then it really helps to have a deep understanding in that particular area.</p>
<p>On the other hand a broad understanding of maths is often really important, because if you have a weak foundation you will have difficulties even to even understand the problem you have and which area of maths holds the pathway to your solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need a good understanding of math to write code, but often enough you can tell from the code when somebody lacked mathematical understanding. It works, but it works in a way that betrays that the programmer was not quite clear about what they were actually doing and merely assembled pieces created by others.</p>
<p>Stuff gets done in completely roundabout ways and often quite redundantly.</p>
<p>Sometimes the code actually gets more readable as a result, but often it just gets bigger as the user reinvents a wheel that they should have learned about in school.</p></div>		</li>
