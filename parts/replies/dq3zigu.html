			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew that. I've seen whale birth and assumed dolphins were similar. I swear I'm freaking out right now...I've seen whales sleep underwater. How do you sleep without breathing? </p>
<p>Fuck I want to talk to someone about this but I feel anyone i contact will look at me like an idiot. I only learned 2 years ago that crabs swam. I always saw them walking so I assumed they just walked on the bottom of the sea. Now whales are breathing. </p>
<p>I might need to take another lap through elementary school. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, I thought it was like for food. Like they eat a crab in their mouth, then blow the shell out through the hole. </p>
<p>Or if they scoop up a bunch of sand trying to bite something, they use that to spit out the sand and keep the fish inside.</p>
