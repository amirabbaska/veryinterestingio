			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed the same thing and finally started trying to track which eye saw which type of color so I could ask my doctor with some data. That's when I realized it changes; sometimes left is cooler, sometimes right. </p>
<p>That led me to the same kind of conclusion as /u/MaxuchoTGr, that the eyes are adapting to different levels of exposure to different color lights.</p>
<p>One of the times I pretty consistently notice a color difference is when I'm applying eye makeup. I don't know if it's because I keep one eye shut for a while or because I'm putting some pressure on my eye, or both, but that's when the color difference is most distinct. And most annoying, because then I can't tell if I got the color levels right on each eye!</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;dada&quot; to &quot;data.&quot; Whoops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed it as in a car with one eye to the sun. That will go a sort of blue due to exposure while the other maintains its red and yellow. My conjecture is that it is the ineffectiveness of red and yellow comes after much exposure and need to 'heal'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My eyes are like this, too, I noticed it when I was a kid. I've asked several optometrists about it but they've never heard of it before. Online research hasn't been helpful, either. I was hoping to see a legit answer on here. :-/</p>
<p>If it's helpful, I'm myopic (~-5.25 in one eye and -5.75 in the other) and I have had a small, benign hole in my retina since I was a kid, too. Maybe enough of us have similar conditions and it's related? I don't know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just your eyes adjusting to different lights. I think everyone has that. Like that famous dress people used to argue about appeared to be different colors in different lighting.   </p></div>		</li>
