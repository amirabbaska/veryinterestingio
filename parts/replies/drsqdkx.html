			<div class="markdown"><p>This is most prevalent in meats. Cooking meat does not remove much energy from the food, but makes the energy much easier to access for our bodies, so we spend less energy digesting it. Letâ€™s say a piece of steak has 1000 calories in it, but raw it would require 300 calories of energy to digest it. But if you cook it, it becomes 950 calories of energy, but only requires 100 calories of energy to digest it. You get a net gain of 150 calories, which means you need to eat less cooked meat to get the same calories of an uncooked meat.</p></div>		</li>
