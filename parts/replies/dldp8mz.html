			<div class="markdown"><p>Swaying or swinging harkens back to feelings of being in the womb, I imagine, or perhaps more relevantly to our mothers rocking us in order to soothe us as babies - the feeling of which our brains associate with nurturing and comforting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, pregnant people move around and walk and stuff, so that's movement there. Also babies in the womb and floating in/cushioned by amniotic fluid, so they probably do experience some sort of swinging sensations from the amniotic fluid sloshing back and forth after the mother moves.</p></div>		</li>
