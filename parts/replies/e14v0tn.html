<p>I fully agree. I am one of the few people who can find enjoyment in tinnitus.  I call it finding the zen in the tinnitus. I have menieres, and therefor a lot of tinnitus. from high pitched to low rumbling. Some people say the low tinnitus is like a roaring jet engine. I picture a mountain forest with wind blowing. Very peaceful and calming. Now for high end I picture crystals vibrating. or a field with crickets. It really is about mind set. when I am stressed out, put on hearing protection and just listen to the tinnitus. Its literally my zen and happy place. My tinnitus doesn't bother me one bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got to look for enjoyment out of everything. I have chronic vertigo like all day every day. It can be debilitating at times. Some of it make be whats called PERSISTENT POSTURAL-PERCEPTUAL DIZZINESS aka basically tinnitus for your vestibular system. </p>
<p>The joy in this is that I can spin around and around as much as I want and can still walk normally. My brain has basically stop using my ears so I depend on sight and body feeling for balance. Though In the dark I am kinda screwed. also I still get nausea. Well Im basically always sick to my tummy.</p>
<p>Try to find the pleasure in the tinnitus, embrace it. dont fight it. make it your own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any sound that's not there in real life that no one else can hear is a form of tinnitus.
Could be your hearing blood flowing, could be wax up against your eardrum, could be an issue with your middle ear bones.
I know of one person who had their teeth out and ever since they've had tinnitus, but when they push their dentures up against the roof of their mouth the tinnitus disappears</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, if I didn't stay positive I would have lost it long ago. I also have vertigo like all day everyday. So the tinnitus isnt my frist worry. lol I am lucky that I have a strong stomach. I have done everything from visualize the movements to naming them. Its a very similar mindset in dealing with vertigo as with the tinnitus. also I vent all the time by talking about it. recently my brain has started to filter out and not use the vertigo for balance, So I feel it a bit less. Though because my balance is based on sight I am pretty fucked in the dark. =) I deal with all of it with grace and a positive attitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been thinking of something like this recently but hadn't put it together with some psychological aspect of tinnitus (which I guess I have, but not enough to really notice constantly).</p>
<p>I sometimes notice as I'm dozing off that sounds can seem much more clear and intense. Is it my brain/conscience turning off my very mild case of tinnitus and allowing pure sound to come through?</p></div>		</li>

If I'm doing something or there's noise in the background I don't notice it, but if I start to think about it, I can start to hear it again</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no known cure for tinnitus at the moment, but the best way to treat it is to change the way you think about it. If you think/believe its the worst thing in the world it can affect you really badly, but if you can find a way to ignore/embrace it it's not too bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I woke up one morning and there it was. I wasn't exposed to any loud sounds previously so I know I didn't do any damage that way. I can't figure it out but I have it.</p>
<p>Yup I just ignore it and I'm happy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can often be caused by neck and jaw problems. Basically if muscle tension is enough to damage the craniofacial nerves slightly and your auditory nerve is affected the damaged nerves end up bleeding signals into one another. This is why people with this muscular tinnitus often experience the tinnitus varying in intensity. Maintain good posture and a healthy TMJ, and the tinnitus will actually ease. It'll rarely go away because there's already slight damage, but it will get a good deal quieter. With mine, it used to be audible over the TV, but now on a good day it'll even be hard to hear in a quiet room with just a little ambient noise (fridge, AC, breeze, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>My dentist keeps telling me something like this. I thought it was because he wanted to sell me his expensive night guard...</p>
<p>He thinks I might grind my teeth at night and it could help with the tinnitus... </p>
<p>I'm starting to put 2 and 2 together, and maybe they're related.</p></div>		</li>
