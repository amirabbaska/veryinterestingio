			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeps, and the Venus fly trap is believed to have evolved further a locking mechanism as a means to be able to trap larger insects that would be able to escape the sticky solutions thus able to gain larger nutrient sources. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The locking mechanism in itself is what really boggles my mind. For example, the speed at which it closes seems so crucial that I can't imagine how it was able to accomplish anything before reaching that stage of its evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Proto venus flytraps had sticky leaves that trapped small insects. Then, a locking mechanism evolved to trap larger ones. Then, the stickiness evolved away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other plants move at similar speeds.  Look at sensitive plants and false sensitive plants.  They are not carnivorous but they have rapidly moving leaves that fold up when disturbed.  Many, many plants open and close their flowers in the morning and evening, some within a few minutes. A wide range of plants change their angle during the day to stay facing the sun and vines also actively seek out structures to climb on and can do so quite rapidly.</p>
<p>The mechanism for movement in plants, even rapid movement is widespread across a number of different species.  This suggests that it is either very easy to evolve (if it is independently evolved in all those different lineages) or that it is an ancestral trait that some plants have lost or have in a reduced capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that these plants are endangered.</p>
<p>It is really weird.  As a kid I remember being able to buy these plants all over the place.  You can buy them on the internet, they don't appear to be in short supply in any way shape or form.</p>
<p>Apparently what is going on is that the companies that sell them are growing them in a green house.  BUT in there natural setting people have dug them up and destroyed there habitat to the point that they are in danger of going extinct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know jack about evolutionary biology. But it would seem to me that the most apt response to OP would not be answering the question directly, but rather providing a list of plants or animals that seem to be midway from one form to the next. Granted, I can't think of any, but there's a lot of life on earth, and therefore I'm hopefully concluding there must be some good examples lurking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to consider is that not only have the plants evolved but their prey has as well. When these plants first started catching animals, the animals would have been much easier to catch. This would have required much less sophistication. Essentially over the generations both the plants get better at catching and the animals get better at avoidance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, we can see a spectrum of carnivory in plants. there are plants that do advantageously harness the nutrients of decomposing  animals but do not have any particular structures or mechanisms that indicate seeking out prey. One could extrapolate how moving from an ability to simply digest surrounding animal matter, random mutations could allow individuals in a population to attract those animals to their surround more frequently. The species would hone various small mutations that arose within the population over time.</p>
<p>Side Note:
And the fantastic thing is that it has evolved at 9 different times in plant evolution across 5 different Orders of plant. The morphological structures of quite unrelated plants be very similar because of the strict needs within such an environment. </p></div>		</li>
