			<div class="markdown"><p>But won't there still be some decay in the signal, or am I completely wrong? Like if the signal is so weak how could they make it clear on a TV screen? I know it might sound like a dumb question to someone who knows this stuff. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Essentially, the video got transmitted from the moon's surface to the orbiter, which retransmitted it to earth, where the signal was cleaned up reformatted for broadcast. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What did they do when the command module was on the other side of the Moon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of what radio waves are. Electromagnetic radiation, just like light. So they propagate at the speed of light, meaning they take I believe about 1 or 2 seconds to get to Earth. Not long really, and there's not much out there to get in the way of the signal. So if we're really far apart with nothing but the vacuum of space between us and we need to flash lights back and forth to communicate, it's going to be pretty easy to see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The antennas they used to receive the signal is huge. We are talking about building sized parabolic antennas. And you use use a tiny satellite dish to receive HD signals from satellites half way to the Moon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but the sensitivity of the receiver.</p>

<p>And when <a href="https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach//images/telescopes/parkes_blueday_med.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> is your receiver, you can get some decent reception.</p>
<p>Note: That's the Parkes Radio Observatory in Australia which picked up the first moonwalk of Apollo 11.</p></div>		</li>
