			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't really a way to put a brain in a vacuum per se to measure what happens during a day without learning. Even if you are stuck in jail you are still having experiences that can be encoded in episodic memory. You will also have internal stimulation (e.g., inner dialogue) that could be encoded as memory. Sorry if this doesn't answer your question but I honestly don't know what would happen to a brain during sleep if it didn't learn that day. I have heard in passing that synaptic downscaling still occurs during anesthesia (someone correct me if I'm wrong on this as I don't have a source) so I presume that it could still occur during slow wave sleep in the absence of learning. But I honestly don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very clear explanation. I appreciate you putting it together. I can't remember because I haven't looked at this topic for quite a long time, but are you using downscaling and pruning interchangeably?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not using downscaling and pruning interchangeably. With pruning the synapse is eliminated by definition. With downscaling, the synapse can just be weakened (AMPA receptor reduction, etc.) so that the influence of the presynaptic neuron on the postsynaptic neuron is decreased.  </p></div>		</li>
