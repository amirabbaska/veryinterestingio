			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add a little to this. The notion that cells in the brain or nervous system are not regenerated or not dividing has been considered false for around 20 years in the research world. The central nervous system does have stem cells which differentiate into &quot;new&quot; functional cells.</p>
<p>A big difference in the nervous system is the extent to which this happens. Skin is turned over very very quickly, whereas this occurs in the CNS much more slowly. It also is less of a necessity due to the differences in levels of trauma that the tissue experiences.</p>
<p>I can link some publications if you are interested in regeneration of CNS tissue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't take place <em>in</em> the OB. The cell proliferation happens in the SVZ, and the newly born neurons then migrate to and mature in the OB.</p>
<p>The distinction is important because there is no population of proliferative stem cells in the bulb, and the migration, maturation and survival of adult born SVZ neurons is a very active topic of research.</p></div>		</li>
