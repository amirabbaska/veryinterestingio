			<div class="markdown"><p>It represents the (quantum mechanical) probability for some event to occur. If you calculate W for some event, then from there you can compute the probability. In practice, we almost never compute W itself, and instead use various tricks and tools to approximate it to get out the answer we want. In particular, no one has ever calculated the W in that equation, and they shouldn't want to try.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/RobusEtCeleritas said, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better explanation than Carroll's. But that is probably geared at a lower level than physics undergrad, so for that audience, I can add a few things.</p>
<p>First, the part labelled &quot;quantum mechanics,&quot; as well as the &quot;W&quot; on the left-hand side, has to do with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation" target="_blank">path integral formulation</a> of quantum mechanics. This is a way of thinking about quantum mechanics that is probably not what you learned in your intro class, but happens to be much better-suited to describing a wider range of physical phenomena. In quantum mechanics, you compute probabilities for various events to occur. You get this probability (roughly) by squaring an <em>amplitude</em>, and that's what we're computing, W. This amplitude is, in the path integral formalism, given by an integral (as you'd expect). It's not quite a normal integral, as indicated by the unusual [Dg], [Da], etc., instead of something like dx.</p>
<p>The things you're integrating over - in that equation, g, A, ψ, and Φ - are <em>quantum fields</em>. They're the underlying mathematical objects that give rise to particles and forces. You might be familiar with some of these - for example, A is a vector which represents the electromagnetic field (as well as the fields for the strong and weak nuclear forces). If you've studied Maxwell's equations, you might have heard that the electric and magnetic field can be re-expressed in terms of a scalar and vector potential. If you combine them into a four-component <em>spacetime</em> vector, in order to be compatible with relativity, then you have precisely that vector A. Then we have g, which is a matrix representing the curvature of spacetime - it's the gravitational field. While you won't have learned to think about the gravitational field as a <em>matrix</em> unless you've taken general relativity, in the Newtonian limit (small speeds and weak gravitational fields), this matrix boils down to a scalar, which is the usual 1/r gravitational potential. Then ψ represents the various matter fields, for things like electrons and quarks, and Φ is the Higgs field, which gives rise to the Higgs boson.</p>
<p>Now you'll see that the path integral is of the form W = ∫[D fields] e^(i S), where S itself is an integral over d^(4)x, containing the last term of the first line and all of the second line. This S is an extremely important quantity in physics. It's called the <em>action</em>, and you've probably already seen it in several guises, most notably in Lagrangian mechanics. In classical mechanics, you have a Lagrangian for some system, call it L = T - U, the difference of the kinetic and potential energies. You may have learned that if you use the Euler-Lagrange equations to find a path that minimizes L, you recover the laws of classical mechanics. Another way to derive that Euler-Lagrange equation is by integrating the Lagrangian over time, S = ∫L dt. That integral is precisely the action. You can calculate the action for all the various paths a particle can take, and you'll find that the Euler-Lagrange equations pick out the path that extremizes (minimizes or maximizes) S. So the action provides another perspective on Lagrangian mechanics - starting with an action S, you can obtain the equations of motion for a physical system. And, indeed, all this path integral rigamarole serves to generalize that to include quantum mechanics, by allowing you to derive quantum probabilities from S. In nearly all of particle physics and gravitational physics, the action is what defines a theory. When you write a new theory, your starting point is nearly always some action, S.</p>
<p>So in this equation we're not actually finding the paths which minimizing our Lagrangian, but instead using the Lagrangian to weight our path integral and then doing path-integral quantum mechanics to determine which paths are most likely quantum mechanically. As you'd guess, the probability is usually highest for paths which minimize the Lagrangian, so this really does generalize our understanding of Lagrangian mechanics to a quantum setting.</p>
<p>Now let's look more deeply at the action S in that equation. As a reminder, it's everything in the curly brackets apart from the i. First, notice that it's an integral over d^(4)x, rather than over dt as in classical mechanics. This is just to include relativity, which treats space and time on equal footing. Similarly, the sqrt(-g) factor after the integration measure is also there to keep things kosher from a relativistic point of view. You're allowed to change your coordinates freely, since physics doesn't care what coordinate system you use, but if you change coordinates you'll change d^(4)x. The sqrt(-g) factor, where g is the determinant of the gravitational field matrix, changes in the opposite way so as to keep the whole thing invariant. You'll have seen this in multivariate calculus - if you're integrating something in Cartesian coordinates in 2D, you'll integrate over dx dy, but if you integrate in polar coordinates, you integrate over r dr dθ. The r in front is nothing other than the 2D version of sqrt(-g).</p>
<p>Now we're finally at the meat of things, which is the quantity in the square brackets. This is called the Lagrangian density, or usually just the Lagrangian (though it's not <em>quite</em> the Lagrangian L from classical mechanics - you may be able to see why). This contains all of the information about what particles and forces exist, how they evolve, and how they interact. All the stuff we've gotten to before was just setup - telling us that we have quantum mechanics, and setting it up to work in a relativistic context. The Lagrangian is where the actual physics comes in. That we have been able to determine this Lagrangian, describing the Standard Model and general relativity, is one of the greatest intellectual accomplishments in human history.</p>
<p>The first term in the Lagrangian, M_P^(2)/2 R, is called the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian and gives you general relativity. It tells you how the gravitational field, that matrix g which encodes information about the curvature of spacetime, evolves. M_P is called the Planck mass, and it's related to Newton's gravitational constant (as well as hbar and c, which we'll ignore). It sets the strength of gravity. By finding which paths extremize the Einstein-Hilbert action, you obtain Einstein's equations of general relativity, which generalize Newton's law of gravitation. It tells you how spacetime curves in response to matter and energy.</p>
<p>The second line, the rest of the Lagrangian, is the Lagrangian for the Standard Model of particle physics, written in an extraordinarily compact notation. The first term, -1/4 F^2 (with a bunch of indices), is the Lagrangians for electromagnetism, the strong force, and the weak force all summed up. For electromagnetism, F is the <em>field-strength tensor</em>, which is an object you're likely to run into at some point in an undergrad physics major. It's an antisymmetric 4x4 matrix that contains the electric and magnetic fields. If you find paths that minimize the electromagnetic Lagrangian, which is the trace of the square of that matrix F, you end up with Maxwell's equations.</p>
<p>The next two pieces, labelled &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;Higgs,&quot; are the Lagrangians for the various matter fields and the Higgs field. You'll learn more about these in a quantum field theory course. The equations you get by minimizing the matter Lagrangian tells you how quarks, electrons, etc. behave, including the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. These equations are responsible, in wildly complicated ways, for the formation of all the matter that we deal with in our lives, of course. And then finally the Higgs Lagrangian leads to equations of motion which tell you how the Higgs gives particles masses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely agree with the general point Carroll is making, and everything is &quot;correct&quot; when loosely interpreted in the &quot;everyday context&quot; but isn't the path integral with the Einstein Hilbert action not well defined on any space of 4d manifolds? Especially the lorentzian ones here?
He says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don’t understand the full theory of quantum gravity, but we understand it perfectly well at the everyday level. An ultraviolet cutoff fixes problems with renormalization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So can this integral be made to be well defined by limiting the space of manifolds in a specific way? If not I still understand the expectation that there <em>eventually will be</em> a way to make sense of this expression, because the action produces the right classical theory, but it bothers me that as of right now the integral is <strong>in principal</strong> undefined. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might help to see that the exponent basically just contains iS, where S is completely analogous to the classical action. The integration d^4 x contains a time integral dt (as you would expect from the classical action) and a space integral d^3 x which is needed because the square brackets contain the Lagrangian density, not the Lagrangian. This is because it is more convenient to work with the Lagrangian density in QFT. All the terms in it tell you how different fields (which give rise to particles) behave and interact with each other. So for example the psis describe fermion fields, so one of those (the indices indicate there is more than one of those, for each particle type one) describes how electrons behave and interact with each other and other fields (particles). So this encodes what can interact with what.</p></div>		</li>
