			<div class="markdown"><p>RE: geisha wooden blocks</p>
<p>Every Korean bath house ( 찜질방 jjimjilbang) that I've  been to (I've been to many)  has an area for napping, and they all have wooden pillows called <a href="http://image.auction.co.kr/itemimage/ea/6b/b7/ea6bb7e76.jpg" target="_blank">목침 (mokchim)</a>. They are quite comfortable for a quick nap. I just wanted to point out that it's not something unique that geisha used only for their hair, it's common and normal to this day among the regular population (at least as far as bathhouse naps are concerned). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Interestingly, the specific plants they found in the bedding served as natural insecticides, suggesting that protection from bugs was at the front of mind due cavemen as it was for ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>I would guess that goes back to a time long before anything resembling &quot;man&quot; existed.  I have read that some birds are very selective about what they build a nest out of for the same reason.</p></div>		</li>
