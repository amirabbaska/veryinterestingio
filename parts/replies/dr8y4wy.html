I'm buying some Scottish beer!&quot; and goes off and buys three pints of Deuchars.  They drink them, and then the German solar astronomer says &quot;My round!  I'm buying German beer!&quot; and goes off and buys three steins of Dortmunder Export.  They drink those, too, and then the Mexican solar astronomer says &quot;Right, my round!  I'm buying Mexican beers!&quot;.</p>
<p>The barman says &quot;Right you three, get out, you're drunk, I'm not serving you any more&quot; and papps them out on the street.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh well&quot;, says the Mexican, &quot;I guess we should have seen than Corona Mass Ejection coming...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On high voltages, typically at and above 230kilovolts, the voltage is high enough that it ionizes the air. This is called corona discharge, and it can be noisy and cause power loss. If it’s bad, it could cause a power outage. Power companies try to minimize this as much as possible with having very smooth and rounded surfaces. The sharper the surface (like the edges of a bolt) the more corona discharge. With an ultraviolet camera you can see what looks like popping or sparking at these edges. These cameras basically count how many times per second  this popping occurs in an isolated area, and if it exceeds so much (tens of thousands is what I’ve been told), then something needs to be done about it. </p>
<p>Also at night you can sometimes see this discharge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact:  Carona Discharges are often used to change the surface energy of many materials to change their surface energy to make the body accept them better.  They're done in a machine rather than the top of power lines, but its still cool AF.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm.  I used to work in plastics, such as packaging films.  We used carona treaters before bonding two layers with glue or more plastic.  The smell of ozone was the most memorable part.</p>
<p>Another fun fact, ever smell a strange smell when someone is running 1000 copies through the office copy machine?  Also ozone!  If you sit next to the office mega printer and get bad headaches try moving away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our company just placed a bid on a job doing a corona survey (I guess that is what they called it) using a UV head on one of our drones.   Unfortunately, our price was too high for the company because we would have to buy the unit (low price of 50k) and then portions of the job goes over water.  Our pilot was not comfortable with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think this happens very often, but sometimes helicopters or drones are needed to patrol a line that can’t be followed easily by car. I think the only way to know where the problem is is by finding the high intensity corona discharge... which could be 50 miles down the line. Same goes with infrared cameras (to find a physically hot spot from high resistance in the conductor). Where I work we are just starting to explore this option for substations and transmission lines.</p></div>		</li>
