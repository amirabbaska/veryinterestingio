<p>Up until this point, there have been very few clues about what Trump’s stances are on many issues with regard to basic and medical research. To the best of my knowledge, he has only mentioned NIH once, but that was to talk about how bad he heard things were here. He also doesn’t have any formal stances on other issues, like stem cell research or using fetal tissue for research. Both of those tools are absolutely indispensible for understanding disease and developing treatments. Some stem cell therapies are already being used in clinical trials, and fetal tissue has multiple advantages over other cell types because they far more accurately represent what happens in people. He also hasn’t picked a science adviser and rumors have been spreading he may decide to gut the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).</p>
<p>His executive orders on federal hiring and the travel ban have had enormously negative impacts. Federal staff is critical to keeping NIH functioning, and the travel ban has sent a highly unfavorable signal to other nations. We rely heavily on international collaborations, and students with green cards who work in many labs had been detained or sent back to their home countries. There is also a growing list of international scientists who are looking to boycott conferences being held in the U.S. Conferences help scientists stay up-to-date on the latest advances, generate new ideas, and provide millions of dollars to local economies. Whether the travel ban receives a permanent stay or not, some of this damage won’t be undone.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Trump has allowed the current NIH director, Francis Collins, to stay in that position for the time being. Collins has been a fantastic NIH director, able to address the needs of the research community and explain the importance of our work to Congress and the American public.</p>
<p>We’ll see what happens.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're lucky that Francis is still in position.  </p>
<p>Trump barely knows what you do, keep it that way (that's really not a message to you but to your leaders...who should be reading this if they're on the job for real).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's quite clear that the USA will lose many of its fine research facilities to Europe. The research undoubtedly will continue, just not in the USA, the Trump administration quite clearly is not interested in science or scientific research since they already have all the answers and are not open to questions/questioning.</p></div>		</li>
