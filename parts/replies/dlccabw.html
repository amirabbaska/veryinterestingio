			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this account for cravings for non-food items (pica), like dirt, clay, cigarette butts, etc? Those are all strange things I have heard women have craved during pregnancy. </p>
<p>How would the body know that dirt or clay has nutrients in it that it needs, if she's never eaten dirt or clay before? And what nutrients could the body possibly think it needs from cigarette butts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pica is an eating disorder with unknown causes. I would think that a body requiring more calories and nutrients, being in a stressful situation, with hormonal inbalances sometimes goes out of whack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the body telling your brain to eat as input and the brain making you crave non food items as output. Under normal conditions the brain would make you crave regular foods, but for some people their brains mess up and make you crave weird non food things. We don't know what is happening exactly that makes the brain mess up, but one popular theory is that your brain is working overdrive to deal with all the physical processes involved with pregnancy that it can interfere with psychological functioning. </p></div>		</li>
