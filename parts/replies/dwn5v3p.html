			<div class="markdown"><p>...and being <em>tough on crime</em> is a talking point that gets a candidate votes in <em>a thing.</em> And when people imagine crime they think of the street stuff that is directly visible and affects neighborhoods (burglaries, muggings, etc). As opposed to some day-trader fiddling with some numbers or whatever.</p>
<p>So they want to appear tougher on street crime for the sake of popular support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother told me once in his criminal justice class, the teacher asked everyone to describe a neighborhood where they picture crime happening. Everyone in the class described, in short, a ghetto. My brother said a white collar neighborhood. when the teacher asked why he said, &quot;because they are the ones stealing peoples retirement funds and getting off.&quot; The Teacher went on to teach the lesson about how people have preconceived notions of crime and where it happens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another very important part is that the people that make the rules are far more likely to be charged with white collar crime over street crime of any sort. </p>
<p>Connections in politics have huge influence on our laws. Not just in the US, but everywhere.</p>
<p>Just looking at minor drug possession will show that it's definitely not all about violence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor: white collar crime cases are more sophisticated, resource intensive, and difficult to prove. When you gotta pour through millions of documents and transactions, you donâ€™t do as many cases as you would with cases that have physical evidence and eye witnesses. </p></div>		</li>
