			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about when you simply shake the can? The whole can immediately drops temperature and even forms frost around it. Does shaking the can turn the liquid into a gas inside of the can? </p>
<p>Edit: As some people have pointed out, I was wrong about the can getting frosty. This only happens after you use the canned air </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bear with me, this will end in a good LPT for anyone who uses canned air.</p>
<p>Try it right now.  Without blowing any air, shake the can. Notice that it doesn't really get colder (it may seem slightly colder because the liquid draws heat from your hands).  Now run it for a few seconds then give it a shake.  Whamba!  Frosty cold.</p>
<p>When you ran the air, the gas in the can got much colder (pV=nrT where nr and V are approximately constant).  If you just leave it at this point, outside heat will boil the liquid in the can and the raise the whole thing to room temperature but it won't happen very fast.  We can speed it up a LOT by spreading the liquid all over the warm sides of the can.  This will cause it to boil rapidly bringing the can back into equilibrium much faster.  To the outside observer, the can will sizzle (as the liquid inside boils) and get very cold very fast.</p>
<p>The LPT is ....</p>
<p>You may have noticed when you use an air can that it gets weak quite quickly (because low temperature means low pressure).  Shaking the can and warming it as best as you can will bring it back up to pressure much faster than just waiting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So do they say <em>DO NOT SHAKE</em> because the pressure could build back up too fast? I’ve always wondered why they had that, but following your explanation it sounds like that could put excess stress on the can itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that pV = nRT is the ideal gas law, and ideal gases by definition do not undergo Joule-Thomson cooling, which is the main reason for the temperature change here.</p>
<p>In a real gas, the molecules feel a slight attractive force among each other. This is due to transient and permanent dipoles, van der Waals force, etc.</p>
<p>This force means the molecules want to be closer together (up to a point). When you spray the can, you are reducing the pressure, which increases the volume, which moves the molecules farther apart. They don't 'like' this. It's energetically unfavorable, and something must foot the energy bill. That something is their own internal energy - their own heat - so by forcing them to separate against their will, you rob them of their temperature.</p>
<p>Ideal gases are defined as having no intermolecular forces (this is a simplification). So by definition, they cannot experience JT cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was one made a few years back but not much came of it due to costs. 12 oz size can would hold like 10oz and could cool in around 5 minutes; fan and some type of evaporant in the base. One of the major beer companies did it but can't recall. </p>
<p>More recently theres been some tweaks on that concept and a few products/beverages were in development or nearing market as of a year or two back. Not sure what came of them. </p>
<p>Also remember seeing some sort of crowdfunding thing in 2015/2016 for cooling cans; not sure if connected to the beverages I allude to above or seperate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In principle, yes.  But you need to vaporize quite a lot of propellant to adequately chill the drink, meaning you'd need a larger container without getting more product.  Also, propellant isn't free.  If I'm doing my numbers right, you'd need a minimum (probably significantly more, as you're also pulling in heat from the air, not just the can) about 120ml (80g) of liquid butane (commonly used as a propellant, in addition to lighters and such) to chill a 355ml can from 25c down to 3c.  That's about <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zippo-Butane-Fuel-5-82-oz/dp/B0062YBCNW" target="_blank">half a can</a> or about $3 worth of butane, so you've about tripled the price of your drink.  Not exactly practical.</p>
<p>But you can jury-rig the concept into a useful party trick.  Don't try this without adult supervision if you're actually 5.</p>
<ol>
<li>You'll need : a warm canned beverage (soda, beer, etc.), a can of compressed air, and a cup or other open-topped container large enough that the can will fit in it.</li>
<li>Put the drink can into the container.</li>
<li>Attach the little straw to the can of air, flip it upside down and spray it onto the drink can.  <strong>Keep your fingers well clear of the spray</strong> (It says on the can not to do this for a reason.  The liquid spraying out will give you a nice case of frostbite if it gets on your skin).  Because the can is upside down, you're spraying out liquid propellant (the vaporized propellant is trapped up at the bottom of the can due to buoyancy, but the pressure from it forces the still-liquid propellant down and out), and it doesn't vaporize until it hits the drink can, at which point it robs heat from it and then vaporizes semi-instantly.  Avoid breathing in the vapour.  Try to cover all of the can with the spray so you're chilling as much as possible.</li>
<li>By the time the can of air empties, your drink will be nicely chilled.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, spraying it doesn't seem like it would be a great idea aside from novelty. But what about a can that you buy compressed, and then can uncompress to chill the drink? Like, maybe there is a plunger keeping pressure that you release before opening it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not $3 worth of butane.</p>
<p>It's about ¢3 worth of butane</p>
<p>Seriously</p>
<p>That shit is super cheap, especially in bulk</p></div>		</li>
