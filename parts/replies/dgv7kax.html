The only site do this is <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/" target="_blank">https://www.annualcreditreport.com/</a> I wouldn't trust any other site.</p></div>		</li>

I can't believe how many myths still get perpetuated about checking your credit score.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, I can log into Credit Karma and check my score everyday if I want? I've been quite paranoid about ID theft recently for some reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used this site. It gives you your credit history but you have to pay for your score. For this reason, I use credit karma AND annualcreditreport.com. Credit karma to keep an eye on the score and annual credit report to keep an eye on my history. </p></div>		</li>
