As I kept reading more and more clicked and I started to remember learning all this from a somewhere. I don't know where, but it felt kinda great to remember. Thanks a bundle sir.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You learn a bunch of this before high school too, so I'd be surprised if you never encountered it. Might be worth going over the wikis on sperm, meiosis, mitosis, haploid cells, diploid cells, and oocytes just to get a refresher. The pages are pretty good surveys on the topic and something like that is going to be fairly closely monitored for accuracy. </p></div>		</li>
