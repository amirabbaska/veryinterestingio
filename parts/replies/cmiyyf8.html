			<div class="markdown"><p>Leaving the course of action up to the victim is one of those things that seems like a good idea, but may also not be. I question the state of mind of a young person who was recently assaulted, to be able to make the appropriate decision. Like how when a person is severely depressed sometimes the morally right thing to do is to put them in an inpatient treatment center against their will, it may be in a rape victims best interest to bring them to a hospital regardless of their desire. Of course then their is the HUGE negative to that which is, then the victim will be less likely to report the assault. I know in the military victims had a medical reporting option, but a university is not much like the military.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Believe me, as a member of that team all aspects were discussed, including the counterpoints you made.  They were not easy decisions to make, and we understood the complexities of the situations.  We valued the victim coming forward and suggested paths forward that put the victim back in control, rather than forcing the victim to the hospital or forcing police involvement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For the love of all that's holy, that needs to happen. Followed by a counseling plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of that should make it okay for you to report a rape on behalf of someone else.  Whether you think they're making a good decision or not, I don't think that justifies taking even more power out of their hands.</p>
<p>It's their choice, and it's condescending for someone to assume another adult is incapable of making decisions for themselves.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa, why? Any crime committed on campus should be a MUST that it is reported to the police,not a choice. If the victim then chooses to drop charges, that is up to them. How can the public have any idea what the true crime statistics are on campus otherwise? I suppose I just answered my own question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what you're asking.  I was required to report to my management that a sexual assault took place.  I was required to respect the victim's privacy, and if they wanted to press charges against the assailant the cops would be there within minutes to take their statement and get them to a hospital.  </p>
<p>Maybe because forcing a person who had just been raped to explain the entire story to uniformed police officers and medical personnel immediately after having their rights taken away by an assailant isn't exactly the way many people want to proceed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, being processed in a hospital and reporting to the police asap is the only way there is even the tiniest sliver of hope for a conviction. I agree it's traumatizing but, that is the only way it can be done so real charges are pressed and an actual investigation is guaranteed. </p>
<p>I am saying, campus should be required to report all crimes committed on campus. Period. The fact that is left up to the victim explains why so few convictions and very inaccurate crime statistics are accounted for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and I'll bet you never once, through tone of voice, emotional pressure, or other intimidation &quot;suggested' that that person NOT report their assaults to the police.  /end snark</p></div>		</li>
