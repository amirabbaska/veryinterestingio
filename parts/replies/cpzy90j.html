			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not sure thats accurate.... meteorites have a ton of kinetic energy, but that doesnt hold a candle to actually converting a sizeable chunk of matter into energy.  Our nuclear warheads-- which can produce fireballs well over a mile in diameter-- use kilograms of fissile or fusile (a word?) material.  Imagine a multi-hundred-ton block of fissile material going critical....</p>
<p>EDIT:  To be clear I had understood the comparison to be &quot;kinetic energy vs nuclear reaction&quot;, purely in the realm of science fiction.  I do not dispute that the bombs we have created tend to be dwarfed by 6-mile radius chunks of iron slamming into the earth at Mach 10.  Regarding the impracticality of a mult-metric-ton reaction mass, Im sure there is some incredibly contrived scenario where a perfectly set up asteroid with subcritical chunks of fissile material are compressed by the impact into a critical mass, but that wasnt really what I was arguing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no comparison. A nuclear weapon is a comparative joke. If a 100 meter diameter dense stone struck the earth at 30km/sec. head on, the resulting explosive force would be 170 megatons. No fusion reaction is possible in nature on a large scale outside of the Sun. Two planets colliding head on couldn't provide the necessary energy density. So fission it is and fission reactions are self limiting because they'll simply blow the reacting element into fragments which are not in the proper configuration to cause further explosions. </p>
<p>Here's a calculator to look at bodies striking the Earth</p>
<p><a href="http://www.purdue.edu/impactearth" target="_blank">http://www.purdue.edu/impactearth</a></p>
<p>A 1km dense stone object striking at 45 degrees and 30km/sec (and it could hit much faster) works out to 170,000 megatons. That's more than all the nukes there are. 1km isn't close to an extinction level strike. The dinosaur killer was probably equivalent to 2 million Tsara bombs, the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated and that asteroid still isn't the largest extinction causing impact. </p>
<p>No conceivable human effort can compare to such an event. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a rock of that size and made of fissile material would already be critical. Plus, it's very hard to get large amounts of material to convert to energy before the process blows itself apart. </p>
<p>For an example, the Little Man bomb had 64kg of material. Of that less than 1kg was converted before the weapon blew itself apart. That was even with large amounts of engineering to maximize the yield. The largest yield of a pure fission weapon, Ivy King, was only 500kt. Meanwhile, Ivy Mike, the first thermonuclear weapon, was over 20x as powerful at 10 mt. Tsar Bomba was tested at 50 mt and could hit 100 mt. </p>
<p>That's one of the reasons the fusion bomb was built. It is much more scalable. Fission is powerful, but there's a limit in scale. </p>
<p>Meanwhile kinetic energy only has relativity as its upper bound. That's why scientists use supercolliders to create ridiculous energy levels by for research instead of using nuclear weapons. Instead they use magnets to accelerate particles to relativistic speeds then use the kinetic energy of them when they smash them together.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny that you mention it. I actually read this article in an attempt to try and guess a limit for the the maximum size/enrichment for a possible uranium asteroid. I thought about about including this, but OP wanted an 'explosion,' not just a reaction, so I left it out. </p>
<p>It's some cool shit though. I wonder if there's a simple relation between the mass of a spherical ball of matter and it's fractional mass that's fissile uranium that will give you criticality. I suppose a lot depends on the other materials in your block as well - if they are a neutron poison or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would make for an interesting thought experiment... if you had a comet made up of a slush of boric acid and a bunch of U-238, could you greatly exceed the critical mass for a runaway reaction on impact without the impact target by vaporization of the water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The natural reactors at Oklo are absolutely enriched ( greater than normal amount of U-235), it would not exist otherwise as U-238 will not go critical. The precise geological reason for the natural abundance of enriched Uranium is not known, which is pretty interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much that the uranium ore at Okla was somehow enriched.  It's that the ore we see today has become depleted.</p>
<p>All the Uranium in the solar system was produced in a supernova long before the sun was born.  U-235 has a half life of 0.7 billion years, while U-238 has a half life of 4.4 billion years.  U-235 is decaying away 6 times faster than U-235 so, as time goes by, the proportion of U-235:U-238 is shrinking.</p>
<p>Today, uranium ore contains about .7% U-235.  According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklo" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>, 2 billion years ago the natural proportion of U-235 was about 3%, which, under the right conditions, was apparently enough to support  fission reaction. </p>
<p>It makes me wonder if we might have had better luck making a meteor impact go nuclear if we'd done it many billions of years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The natural enrichment of uranium is almost exactly the same around the world. The U-235 half life is 700 million years, the U-238 half life is 4500 million years.  This means that the ratio (or enrichment) of U-235 decreases with time as it decays more rapidly.  The Oklo reaction was 1700 million years ago so the ratio of U-235 was higher at that time (as it was everywhere else in the world).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just read the Wikipedia article, and it gives the reason:</p>
<p>&quot;A key factor that made the reaction possible was that, at the time the reactor went critical 1.7 billion years ago, the fissile isotope 235U made up about 3.1% of the natural uranium, which is comparable to the amount used in some of today's reactors. (The remaining 97% was non-fissile 238U.) Because 235U has a shorter half life than 238U, and thus decays more rapidly, the current abundance of 235U in natural uranium is about 0.7%. A natural nuclear reactor is therefore no longer possible on Earth without heavy water or graphite.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
