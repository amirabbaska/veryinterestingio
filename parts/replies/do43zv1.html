			<div class="markdown"><p>I know exactly what you mean and not many people know how to do this. It's like a hidden muscle in your inner ear that you can flex to pop the drum? A lot of people don't know what I'm talking about but this is as normal to me as blinking manually. </p></div>		</li>

Things like people eating,  computer fans, alarm clocks 3 hotel rooms away, etc will make you want to take a fork to your ears.  I can't wait for my hearing to die out a little. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude I worked at a lead mine for five years and listen to loud music every day and my hearing's still doing that shit. I don't think the problem is the actual sensitivity of our ears, I think it's just a brain thing where you either don't have the wiring or the resources to selectively ignore noises, making everything seem way too loud regardless of the actual acuteness of your hearing. My further evidence for this theory is that the problem becomes far less noticeable when I'm on ADHD meds.</p>
<p>I guess try getting yourself hopped up on stimulants and see if it gets better, and if it does go get tested for executive function disorder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always knew my hearing was a little better than most peoples' but I can hear electricity too. Is it so rare? I have to blast the fan on full volume to sleep and it drives me nuts when I can hear anything slightly off about its motor or operation.</p>
<p>Do you also have a quiet voice? It always sounds like I'm shouting, but to everyone else, I'm quiet as a mouse. </p>
<p>Never thought of this as anything special before :o</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never done an irrigation in my life, I clean my ears with qtips daily after shower so the wax is soft, so my canals are always clean, I have a system for not hurting my drums by holding the qtip at a specific spot so it can't reach my drum because my hand run into my ear. Otoscope has been at least 8 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well it depends, our brain can actually filter out sounds it considers noise pretty well, given enough focus and time (less than a couple of minutes). The same applies for touch based measurements (pressure, heat, etc), smell and taste. But vision is a bit special, while you can improve how quickly you notice motion, or how small the moving object is (basically dynamic vision) and noticing small details to a certain extent, you cannot change your focal length. Focal length is essentially equivalent to zooming in and out in a camera. Human eye (and most animals for that matter) have a fixed focal length, so  you cannot zoom in on an object thats far away or zoom out on something close by since our shape of our eye is fixed, and thus the focal length is also fixed.</p></div>		</li>
