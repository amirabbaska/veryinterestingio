			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a treatment being developed in my city that's been showing promise, only this one is using a few different viruses/strains for a similar reason. It's been effective against multiple cancers from what I've read, and my mom actually met one of the patients who'd undergone the treatment for melanoma. After the virus did it's thing all he needed was a minor skin graft and you can barely tell the skin on his arm tried to kill him</p>

<p>From the third and most recent link</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Researchers at The Ottawa Hospital found that staged immunotherapies (an oncolytic virus before surgery followed by a checkpoint inhibitor after it) cured 60 to 90 per cent of mice with triple negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease now treated with limited success using surgery, radiation and chemotherapy</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This specific trial is only for stage 4 brain cancer called glioblastoma, and is even then only for patients where the cancer has started growing again after conventional treatment.  Because they are testing it, they are only using it on the patients with the worst prognosis.  Many of the patients ended up dying from the treatment because too much of the virus was injected, which resulted in too large of an immune response.  In other parts of your body, you simply get swelling as a result of a large immune response. The skull, however, does not allow for any swelling whatsoever, so too large of an immune response creates so much pressure inside the skull that the patient dies.</p>
<p>The phase 1 trial was a dose escalation study to determine the optimum dosage.  They started at dose level 0 and were working their way up when they realized that the high dosages were causing death.  They are now in phase 2 of their trials, and they are using a dosage that is smaller than even dosage 0. The phase 2 trial says that they are using dose level negative 2, so less than even the starting dosage from the phase 1 trial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha, thank you. The clinical trial options that are out there interest me greatly as I really like seeing the progress we are making and experimental treatments that don't completely destroy your body like radiation and chemo do.</p></div>		</li>
