			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/cherenkov.html" target="_blank">Sort of.</a> The mechanisms for the production of sound and light waves are different, so obviously the analogy should not be taken too literally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually as good an analogy as you can find. The blue glow is a result of the medium (for a reactor, this would be water) reacting to a <em>charged particle</em> going through it. If this speed is greater than the phase velocity of light in the medium then the medium's response can't &quot;keep up&quot;. This &quot;medium keeping up&quot; business is exactly what gives rise to different effects like metals being shiny (during interactions with light) while dielectrics typically are not.</p>
<p>In a metal the electrons swimming around can move very fast! So as light(em wave) tries to propagate through the metal the electrons can respond fast enough to literally reject the light! Which is why it is shiny. This frequency (essentially speed) the electron plasma can oscillate at is also known as the plasma frequency of the material.</p>
<p>The result of this is the effect of the particle/wave/etc can create a sort of after effect in its path if it is flying though faster than the material can respond. Under the right conditions this quite literally is like a shockwave felt after the particle passes through. Just like supersonic speeds and pressure waves!</p>
<p>Pretty cool stuff, but I should note that I didn't study high energy particle business, so you might want to do your own research to get a better idea haha. Some of what I said might not be perfectly correct, but it gives the idea :).</p>

<p>It is the medium reacting to <em>charged particles</em> going through it. Light sent through a medium won't produce Cherenkov radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It makes no sense to say &quot;space is expanding faster than light&quot;. For more details, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6o78mn/do_scientists_have_take_into_account_the/dkfuawx/" target="_blank">see this post</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5fh6ae/how_is_it_possible_for_galaxies_at_the_edge_of/dakf9d3/" target="_blank">this post</a>. Pop-sci videos and articles often express that incorrect statement because there are galaxies whose recessional speed is greater than the speed of light. But this doesn't mean those galaxies are moving faster than light. This doesn't mean space is expanding faster than light. Also, the distance at which galaxies have superluminal recessional speeds is much smaller than the distance to the edge of the observable universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;expanding faster than the speed of light&quot; doesn't really make sense because the speed of light is measured in units of m/s, while expansion is measured in units of m/m/s.</p>
<p>Points beyond (and some points within) the edge of the observable universe are receeding from us faster than the speed of light. Whether one can really call that &quot;motion&quot; seems to be a bit of a moot point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read the m/m/s as meter/meter/second = second ;)</p>
<p>Assuming that you didn't mean m^3 / s either, why does universe expansion have different units to the expansion of any regular 3d object?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stupid question: Is that cause or effect?  As in, would light go faster if it could but it happens to hit this unrelated limit?  Or is it impossible for anything to go faster because light is the most efficient traveler?</p>
<p>Is light stopped by an arbitrary limit, or does light itself cause the limit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, the number we typically use for <em>c</em> is for a normal (if idealized) vacuum, and you can get a little faster in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light#Faster_light_.28Casimir_vacuum_and_quantum_tunnelling.29" target="_blank">Casimir vacuum</a>.</p>
