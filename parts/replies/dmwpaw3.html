			<div class="markdown"><p>I love when kids do this. It will happen when I'm substitute teaching a lot -- they're talking as they work independently (which I don't mind), then they randomly start shushing each other until it's quiet. Then they just sit there and look at me, waiting for direction. I just shrug at them. </p></div>		</li>
