			<div class="markdown"><p>I also want to make a point that I think non-technical folks may not be aware of:   </p>
<p>Even without the ability to override the anonymity of reported data, the technical abilities we have today with respect to data mining of large datasets effectively eliminates your anonymity. If they get a dataset from one source with your IP and search terms, and another source provides IPs mapped to Addresses, and another source provides common searches from anonymous users of a particular browser, etc then it's really, really straightforward to map those search terms and patterns back to a user in a government database. </p>
<p>I'm probably not explaining it well, but the point I'm trying to make is that simply requiring companies to provide the anonymized data eliminates any real expectation of privacy you may have about your activities online, especially if you regularly use social media, google, reddit, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first point, and the example it contains, is totally incorrect.  </p>
<p>There is no requirement for any company to share anything with the government.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(f) Information Sharing Relationships.—<strong>Nothing in this Act shall be construed</strong>—</p>
<p>(1) to limit or modify an existing information sharing relationship;</p>
<p>(2) to prohibit a new information sharing relationship;</p>
<p>(3) <strong>to require a new information sharing relationship between any entity and the Federal Government; or</strong></p>
<p>(4) to require the use of the capability and process within the Department of Homeland Security developed under section 5(c).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The companies are already the ones detecting and eliminating threats to their individual security.  They will obviously continue to do those things.  This bill is about getting companies to then share the data that meets certain criteria with the government so government organizations can investigate and work on broader cybersecurity protection.  The bill specifies that the two things to be shared are &quot;cyber threat indicators&quot; and &quot;defensive measures.&quot;  From the bill:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(6) CYBER THREAT INDICATOR.—The term “cyber threat indicator” means information that is necessary to describe or identify—</p>
<p>(A) malicious reconnaissance, including anomalous patterns of communications that appear to be transmitted for the purpose of gathering technical information related to a cybersecurity threat or security vulnerability;</p>
<p>(B) a method of defeating a security control or exploitation of a security vulnerability;</p>
<p>(C) a security vulnerability, including anomalous activity that appears to indicate the existence of a security vulnerability;</p>
<p>(D) a method of causing a user with legitimate access to an information system or information that is stored on, processed by, or transiting an information system to unwittingly enable the defeat of a security control or exploitation of a security vulnerability;</p>
<p>(E) malicious cyber command and control;</p>
<p>(F) the actual or potential harm caused by an incident, including a description of the information exfiltrated as a result of a particular cybersecurity threat;</p>
<p>(G) any other attribute of a cybersecurity threat, if disclosure of such attribute is not otherwise prohibited by law; or</p>
<p>(H) any combination thereof.</p>
<p>(7) DEFENSIVE MEASURE.—</p>
<p>(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the term “defensive measure” means an action, device, procedure, signature, technique, or other measure applied to an information system or information that is stored on, processed by, or transiting an information system that detects, prevents, or mitigates a known or suspected cybersecurity threat or security vulnerability.</p>
<p>(B) EXCLUSION.—The term “defensive measure” does not include a measure that destroys, renders unusable, or substantially harms an information system or data on an information system not belonging to—</p>
<p>(i) the private entity operating the measure; or</p>
<p>(ii) another entity or Federal entity that is authorized to provide consent and has provided consent to that private entity for operation of such measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing in there has anything to do with putting a filter on Google searches to find people using the word bomb, ISIS, Islam, or Unabomber.  This bill is only dealing with sharing cybersecurity information.  That's why it is the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act.</p>
<p>However, there are apparently provisions which allow for data to be used for issues outside of cybersecurity.  From the bill:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(A) AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES.—Cyber threat indicators and defensive measures provided to the Federal Government under this Act may be disclosed to, retained by, and used by, consistent with otherwise applicable provisions of Federal law, any Federal agency or department, component, officer, employee, or agent of the Federal Government solely for—</p>
<p>(i) a cybersecurity purpose;</p>
<p>(ii) the purpose of identifying a cybersecurity threat, including the source of such cybersecurity threat, or a security vulnerability;</p>
<p>(iii) the purpose of identifying a cybersecurity threat involving the use of an information system by a foreign adversary or terrorist;</p>
<p>(iv) <strong>the purpose of responding to, or otherwise preventing or mitigating, an imminent threat of death, serious bodily harm, or serious economic harm, including a terrorist act or a use of a weapon of mass destruction</strong>;</p>
<p>(v) <strong>the purpose of responding to, or otherwise preventing or mitigating, a serious threat to a minor, including sexual exploitation and threats to physical safety</strong>; or</p>
<p>(vi) the purpose of preventing, investigating, disrupting, or prosecuting an offense arising out of a threat described in clause (iv) or any of the offenses listed in—</p>
<p>(I) section 3559(c)(2)(F) of title 18, United States Code (<strong>relating to serious violent felonies</strong>);</p>
<p>(II) sections 1028 through 1030 of such title (<strong>relating to fraud and identity theft</strong>);</p>
<p>(III) chapter 37 of such title (<strong>relating to espionage and censorship</strong>); and</p>
<p>(IV) chapter 90 of such title (<strong>relating to protection of trade secrets</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way the bill is written it definitely has problems.  I don't think it should be passed in it's current state.  However, the language in the bill in no way allows for the government to &quot;have much greater access to your personal data on commercial platforms than ever before.&quot;  The point of the bill is to create a framework through which companies can collaborate with the government and increase cybersecurity.  The only information the government is supposed to receive is what companies decide to give them.  That information is supposed to meet with the definitions of &quot;cyber threat indicator&quot; and &quot;defensive measure.&quot;  The information is then not supposed to be kept unless it can be used for one of the authorized activities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this.  I eventually got tired of all the misinformation and kneejerk reactions going around and not having my questions answered regarding that misinformation, so I read through it all myself.  I came to roughly the same conclusions: it's dominantly about setting up a way for the government to receive information regarding cybersecurity or potentially catastrophic personal^1 or national issues, how they handle said information, and setting up provisions to allow (but not force) companies to share said information with the government and each other.</p>
<p>I was somewhat surprised by the amount of text used to basically say &quot;this applies to companies and any relevant corporate relationships (i.e. subcontracted cybersecurity work)&quot;.  I think it was like 5-7 times that it was stated and took up about 10 lines (roughly 2 inches of page length) each time for what could have been stated once in the definitions section.</p>
<p>^1 Basically if Facebook sees you make something like a serious death threat, they're allowed to - but don't have to - share it with the police without risk of repercussions from you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Government: &quot;give me more data&quot;</p>
<p>Company: &quot;OK&quot;</p>
<p>What's going to stop the company from giving more data? Now they have a law that makes the government look like less of a jackass when they force the data out.</p>
<p>All in all, this bill is EXTREMELY VAGUE and hands down steps on our constitutional bill of rights. Amendment 4 definitely, amendment 1 indirectly...</p>
<p>Given governments use of the patriot act and how many tragedies &quot;They stopped&quot; and how often they actually abused the power to silence or lock up people, i am slightly against your comment not because you corrected a misconstrued interpretation of the bill, but because you did not emphasize enough how dangerous this bill has the potential to be. </p>
<p>Thanks for your insight, but I would appreciate if you expanded on the problems you mentioned in the last paragraph. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that 6(A) &quot;malicious reconnaissance&quot;, 6(G) &quot;any other attribute of a cybersecurity threat&quot;, and 6(H) &quot;any combination thereof&quot; would allow for exactly the type of example I give. </p>
<p>I agree with you on the intent of the bill, but I'm arguing that the very broad language of the bill allows for something completely different.</p>
<p>On the requirement for providing data -- I replied to someone else as well, but you are correct, the current senate version does not have a strict reporting/sharing requirement. I got that from a version I read earlier in the year and didn't realize it had been changed. That said, the liability protection the bill offers will, I think, result in ubiquitous voluntary participation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the context of the bill those things don't really mean what you think they do.  </p>
<p>You think malicious reconnaissance means some sort of dangerous information gathering done using the internet, like searching about bombs on Google.  For cybersecurity, malicious reconnaissance means information gathering about a network to potentially damage it or gain access to secure information, like finding out how much traffic will cause a DDoS or trying to find a backdoor into a secure network.</p>
<p>In the same way, cybersecurity threat doesn't mean any threatening behavior that happens to be conducted in the cyber arena, like searching about bombs.  It literally means attributes of threats that are cyber in nature.</p>
<p>Again, I agree with you that the broad language in the bill allows for a little too much leeway.  Without context certain things in the bill can be interpreted pretty widely.  However, that is true of pretty much every bill.  You can never be specific enough when it comes to people who will abuse their power.</p></div>		</li>
