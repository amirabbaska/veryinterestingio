			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember an episode of QI mentioning that a monk in the ancient days became famous for being able to read without moving his lips. That made me wonder if this kind of internal monologue is connected to the learning of skills like that and whether people years ago did not all have an internal monologue. </p>
<p>Possibly why 'talking to oneself' is a bit of a taboo: maybe at one time there was a split between people who always thought aloud and those who could internalise. </p>
<p>Where would this karate bs if hint even be documented?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied psychology and don't think this has been specifically adressed. Consciousness is more or less an unknown, other than that we know it (probably) exists. There is a theory though that we have an auditory function that repeats audio in short-term memory.</p>
<p>On a personal note I recall that as a kid at some point I realised I could produce a voice in my head to talk on my behalf, and was surprised. I was 6 years old. At the same time my reading skills improved significantly.</p></div>		</li>
