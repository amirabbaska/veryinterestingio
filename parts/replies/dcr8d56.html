			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough this year, it was 18 to 24 year old whites that went heavily right, even compared to the traditionally more conservative older demographics.</p>
<p>These things seem to be cyclical, and a lot of it comes down to whoever was in power at the time and whether there was a reaction to them.</p>
<p>Quite a few youth growing up under Clinton voted Bush in 2000, but many youth opposed Bush in the 2000s and became Obama/liberal voters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my theory is because youth people tend to be anti-status-quo. if their parents are liberal, they will be more conservative as a &quot;rebellion&quot;. youths who grew up under liberal president and see how bad things are under him/her would vote more conservative candidate as break of status quo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdote: my kids (15 and 14 white boys) are turning into some pretty staunch Trump supporters.  They have an eclectic circle of friends and take great offense when I judge their language to be offensively bigoted at times.  They say it's all in jest, and their speech is them recoiling from the political correctness they're drilled in to at school.  I get angry sometimes trying to understand them - which I'm pretty sure only serves to solidify their politics.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not <em>quite</em> what that article says.  It upholds the idea that age groups absolutely have strong political identities (with exceptions, of course), but those identities are more oriented towards the favorable politics during their adolescence and early adulthood.</p>
<p>Which is to say, young people aren't primarily liberal because they are young, but rather because they came of age during a liberal tenure (Obama's presidency).  But the article does agree that, in fact, young people [today] are primarily liberal.</p></div>		</li>
