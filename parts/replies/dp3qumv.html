<p>Take pill, drugs go to liver and go away</p>
<p>Dissolve pill in mouth, drugs go in blood for a bit before liver</p>
<p>Quack quack</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I passed this question on to a doc as I wasn't totally sure. I'll try to paraphrase his answer here:</p>
<p>Buccal is the exact same as sublingual in terms of drug delivery. However certain drugs either taste <em>really</em> bad or can stain/damage the teeth, so we'll give them back in the cheek where it's less of an issue. Putting them under the tongue causes them to dissolve and spread more easily in all that saliva, which can be unpleasant</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why do we take things like birth control orally instead of letting it dissolve? I’m assuming it’s because the general public finds it easier/quicker to swallow pills? It seems like it would be better to not get chomped by the liver immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my understanding it's a combination of what you've suggested.</p>
<p>Most medications taste very bad, and people don't want to take them that way. You may have accidentally been unable to swallow a pill or vitamin on the first attempt and noticed that it's pretty disgusting. There's also a risk that the medication doesn't play well with the tissues in your mouth or your teeth (amphetamines, for example), and we'd like to avoid that.</p>
<p>With birth control, we have a good idea how much is removed by the first pass through the liver, and doses are made accordingly. We accept some amount of loss, knowing that enough will reach the circulation.</p>
<p>Birth control and Rifampin (antibiotic) is an interesting situation because the doses between the two are so different. They're both processed by the same liver enzyme, but you take <em>way</em> more Rifampin than birth control in one pill. The liver responds to the (relatively) high loads of Rifampin by producing more of that enzyme, which is enough to overwhelm the contents of your birth control.</p></div>		</li>
