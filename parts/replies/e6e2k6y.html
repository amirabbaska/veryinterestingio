<p>Adults need only carbohydrates to survive since they do not grow or repair and honey provides that.</p>

<p>That is fascinating in itself.  To have a final rigid form that needs no protein is so <em>alien</em>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we just shed skin cells like they are going out of style.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the hive is going through bees like they're going out of style. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heck, even the growing a new queen bee goes through a batch of queens.</p>
<p>Bee growth has a failure rate, so there is more than one queen put into production. However, the swarm only can use really one active queen bee, so there is a bit of an oversupply of queen bees.</p>
<p>How do they resolve this?</p>
<p>Battle Royale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this abnormal in insects?</p>
<p>It wasn't clear if this was a bee specific behavior, or if most insects do not need to consume protein once they reach adulthood other than for mating.</p>
<p>I know that many insects do not eat at all in their adult form, and that only female mosquitoes suck blood while the males subsist on nectar, so this made me wonder about the rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time I think about the insane amount of abuse our bodies can take and still keep going it impresses me. We can heal routine wear and tear pretty well, and many serious injuries heal with time and care. Heck, lots of us deliberately put poison into our bodies for <em>years</em> before dying.</p></div>		</li>
