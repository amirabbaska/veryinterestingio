			<div class="markdown"><p>It is so rare I get to share this fact, so I'm taking the opportunity. The LD50 applies beyond toxicity as well. It can be applied to anything with a potential lethality. For example, based on empirical data the estimated LD50 of falling off a building is 5 stories, meaning if you fall off a 5-story building you statistically have a 50% chance of death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually did (accidentally) fall from about about 3 stories, around 35 feet. I couldn't move my legs for a while, and crushed a vertebrae, but I did survive, and can walk just fine now. I was a bit surprised that I survived as well as I have. The guys in my unit that saw it, said I actually bounced...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could definitely figure that out.  It's not quite the same thing but the military/NASA have done pretty extensive testing on how many Gs a person can take before passing out.  </p>
<p>We would just have to beef up those tests.  </p>
<p>Edit:  also, I get your joke but in this case it isn't really the gravity that is killing you.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>So there is something called the median lethal dose, or LD50 for short. It basically refers to the dose required to kill 50% of the population within a certain timeframe. The units are typically mg/kg (mass of toxin/mass of animal). So with this data, scientists can extrapolate how many animals it would kill within that time frame by working out the total mass of the animals and then dividing by the average mass of that animal.</p>

<p>Nicotine more toxic than arsenic! Is that why they add arsenic to cigarettes? To water them down?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both nicotine and arsenic are way below any acutely dangerous dose in a cigarette. Arsenic, however, is a carcinogen. Nicotine isn't, at least not in any direct way.</p></div>		</li>
