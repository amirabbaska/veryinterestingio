			<div class="markdown"><p>First, the spectral slope of something tells you about how it varies over a range of scales. A large spectral slope means as you go to smaller scales, the value increases, with larger slopes leading to the value increasing more quickly. A large negative slope is the opposite, with the value getting larger on larger scales. Sow what is 'r'? r is the ratio between the spectral slope of tensor perturbations on the CMB polarisation (due to inflation), and the spectral slope of scalar perturbations on the CMB polarisation (due to overdensities, and inflation). It is essentially a relative measure of the strength of the inflation field. 0.2 is quite large, only because previous recent studies by Planck suggested a value below 0.11, although that was not a direct measurement, it was based on other results as well. 0.2 matches well with some models of inflation, it's just larger than we expected based on the Planck results.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The significance of the r figure is specific to this context and explained in other replies throughout the thread.</p>
<p>&quot;5 sigma&quot; is a characterization of the confidence of the measurement. It's shorthand for &quot;5 standard deviations from the norm&quot;, since the greek letter sigma (Ïƒ) is the common mathematical notation of a standard deviation. &quot;5 standard deviations from the mean&quot; refers to the probability of the observation if we assume the theory is false. The probability of seeing a result 5 (or more) standard deviations from the mean in a normal (Bell curve) distribution is about 1 in 3.5 million.</p>
<p>So saying a observation has &quot;5 sigma confidence&quot; roughly means that this is a result that jives well with the new hypothesis, but only has a 1 in 3.5 million chance of occurring under the old, or &quot;null&quot;, hypothesis. This is strong evidence in favor of the new hypothesis.</p>
<p>Note: 1 in 3.5 million may seem long shot odds, and they are, to the point we can classify this as a discovery, but there's still that (small) chance it was just blind luck. This is one (but not the only) reason why reproducibility is a key element of the scientific process. Each independent confirmation of this result multiples that confidence. If there's a 1 in 3.5 million chance of it happening once, what are the odds of it happening twice in a row (or even two out of three times)? Hint, it's over 10 billion to 1. Three times? Now we're in &quot;ludicrous&quot; territory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to buy beer tickets, but short answer:</p>
<p>-Expansion refers to the general trend of things in the universe to move apart from each other because of the universe getting larger. This has been directly observed and is extremely well accepted.</p>
<p>-Inflation refers to a very specific model of the behavior at the <em>very</em> beginning of the universe where there was a massive expansion by a factor of 10^78 over a period of about 10^-33 seconds. The idea is that it's driven by negative pressure from the vacuum energy, so it's part of a model of how the universe functions at a very basic level. Until now it hasn't been observed directly, so it was little more than conjecture. The result shown today has extremely good statistics and is as near to a direct measurement as we're likely to get, so it's pretty damn good evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has been bugging me for a while, how does red-shifting indicate the universe's expansion is accelerating? Wouldn't light from objects further away be a look further back in time, so if they are moving away from us faster than the objects closer to us the expansion is slowing because as we see light closer to the present time the objects are moving slower?</p></div>		</li>
