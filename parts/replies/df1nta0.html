			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I see a lot of in those abandoned homes is that there isn't really anything worth saving. Just because a home was built in 1900 doesn't mean it was well built or built with character. Beyond just a total money pit of potential problems (termites, water damage, $50-70k in foundation repairs, etc) you may end up with a bland home that sits in a 100 year old shell at a cost that could be twice what it cost to just rebuild it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Even if money could be potentially saved on the renovation of the older building that doesn't matter as much as having a known budget to succeed at, it is not like you get to keep the money you would save but you ass might get fired for cost overruns on a project gone sideways. .</p></div>		</li>
