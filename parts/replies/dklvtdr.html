			<div class="markdown"><p>They also do constant training about how to handle classified materials and conversations even if you've been there for 40 years. They also encourage you to keep an eye on your coworkers for anything suspicious and never leave anyone alone with valuable information. You're always being monitored. Another thing is you never hold all the information. You only get what you need to do your job and nothing more. If you're gathering intel on a person you don't get to know who they are. If you're installing servers you don't get to know what they're used for. You're also blocked from accessing information you don't need. Separate the jobs and information needed and there's not much they can leak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in the DoD when this whole thing went down. Snowden's job was to install new servers and transfer the files over from the old system to the new. These kind of contractors push a cart with a computer around inside the data center. He was able to copy files for himself during the transfer. He was never supposed to have administrative privliges or any real access to the files or systems he was installing. He was not a part of any of those missions he stole documents from and he was never truly supposed to have access to them. There has always been a huge security risk with people unsupervised in data centers. You have to watch out for people plugging in hard drives and making sure all the racks are locked up. It's easy</p>
<p>But every time something like this happens new rules and securities go in place to prevent it from happening again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They'll still talk to people you dont list as references for SSBIs (for Top Secret / SCI clearances). They'll talk to your neighbors regardless.  They also asked references if we had any mutual friends I didn't list. They knew I was renting at the time and contacted my landlord as well. Maybe it was just a really thorough investigator, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They get more thorough. If you've ever lived abroad the CIA has a branch that gets in touch with people where you lived and makes sure you weren't being recruited as a foreign agent. It adds months to the security clearance process </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had assumed it would be. The only reason I knew they were interviewed is because the people who were interviewed brought it up in passing. It's not like the government is telling you who they interviewed. I didn't even have an SCI clearance, only eligibility. I'd always assumed it was so a temporary SCI clearance could be granted if a mountain of shit is about to hit the fan.</p></div>		</li>
