<p>That is sous vide. It would be excellent no matter how you sliced it, and it would not taste significantly different sliced thick vs thin. I do understand you're asking a different question though: large intact cuts of meat sliced thinly across the grain have had their muscle fibers essentially pre-masticated. You don't have to concentrate on chewing them so you can concentrate on tasting them. It really does work.</p></div>		</li>
