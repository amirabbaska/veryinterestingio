			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for taking the time to answer! Even though my question may have been poorly worded, I'm glad that you caught the gist of what I was trying to ask.</p>
<p>I guess now I'm curious about how the words &quot;Hrere&quot; and &quot;Hreran&quot; relate, since one is about the quality of what's being cooked, while the other is about motion. Hmm...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think your question was poorly written as much as reddit likes to take the piss out of posters. Sure, under-cooked is raw, and rare is &quot;lightly cooked&quot;, but even as someone who loves rare steak, I understood your question just fine and was annoyed by all the other responses.</p>
<p>I'm more curious at how someone would pronounce hrere and hreran than how they relate, but that's just me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you know IPA, /hreː.rɛ/ for hrēre, and /hreː.ran/ for hrēran. Or something like &quot;hray-reh&quot; and &quot;hray-ron.&quot; Old English was pronounced more or less how it looked, if you ignore the fact that Modern English spelling went so off the rails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if it originally applied to eggs, hrere eggs were ones that could still be stirred. </p>
<p>Imagine if we started calling undercooked, runny scrambled eggs &quot;loose&quot; because they didn't hold together. &quot;These eggs are too loose!&quot;  Or &quot;I won't eat loose eggs.&quot;</p>
<p>Over time, that becomes an adjective that means undercooked. Eventually, someone just said, &quot;make my steak loose.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in Dutch the word evolved to &quot;roeren&quot;, and we call a scrambled egg a &quot;roerei&quot;. Not because you can still stir it, but because you stir it during cooking. Cooking with a wok is often referred to as &quot;roerbakken&quot; (stir fry). So the process of making a rare steak is not that far away. Put it on a pan, stir a bit and remove. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good explanation, made even more potent by the realization that runny eggs are <strong>run</strong>-y eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to motion it relates because the origin of the word is associated with eggs (not beef etc) meaning the eggs would still require stirring as they were not fully cooked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer.  </p>
<p>Rare in this context comes from middle English &quot;rere&quot; which comes from germanic roots while &quot;rare&quot; in terms of unusual, comes from the old French word &quot;rere&quot; which had a different meaning, coming from latin &quot;rarus&quot; which meant sparse. </p>
<p>The &quot;rare&quot; cooking of a steak is completely different and unrelated to the meaning of &quot;rare&quot; to do with frequency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What did &quot;rere&quot; mean in old French? Sparse in modern French is actually &quot;rare&quot;  - open A, a bit like the initial sound of &quot;out&quot;, and the French R sound is quite different from English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In German, the term for a rare steak is &quot;englisch&quot; (English) although you can also say &quot;blutig&quot; (bloody).</p>
