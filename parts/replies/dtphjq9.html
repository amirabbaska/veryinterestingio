			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really think these answers about sucking water out are the real reason why it hurts so much. It's part of it, but the reason it hurts is because sodium is a chemical that is used by the nervous system to conduct electrical signals in nerves. If you increase the amount of salt on the outside of your nerve cells then the electrical potential will be greatly increased and pain receptors will be hyperactive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. It distorts the body's local electro-chemistry. This distortion is interpreted as pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't be putting anything but soap, water, and some kind of cover on minor superficial wounds. But, no, sugar will not stop pain from a wound. I would expect that it won't cause as much pain as salt though because it does not play the same role in electrical conduction within the body. It will still suck out water from cells through osmolarity though which you don't want as this will just cause more damage and not assist healing at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually...
Iirc some vets use sugar on animal wounds as it absorbs liquid and doesn t allow bacteria to grow well.</p>
<p>Think saw it on vetranch channel.
Dog had a lot of flesh missing on leg, but couldn't operate to close it so used some medicine and sugar wrap for few days (changed regularly ofc) until felt comfortable doing the operation to sew the skin together.</p>
<p>Edit: found video. (Around2:30 in)
