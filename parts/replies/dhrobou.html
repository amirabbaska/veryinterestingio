			<div class="markdown"><p>QR codes are cool example of barcodes type thing that can hold a lot of information. Although I guess not technically 'bar'codes..</p>
<p>They can hold just over a 1000 characters, and can encode HTML as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>so you can send commands to a cellphone like 'send a text to this number'.</li>
</ul>
<p>One guy tried to scam people by spreadingâ€‹ QR codes around the place that would send a paid text donation type thing.</p>
<p>But I guess most QR code software protects against this kind of thing these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're a bit off on one major point:</p>
<p>GTIN14 is just a (14-digit) extension of UPC and EAN. It's an identifier for a specific product, just like UPC and EAN, but extended to include a &quot;packaging level&quot; which can be determined/decided by the company producing them.</p>
<p>GS1 specifies the Application Identifiers, and GTIN14 is just one of the datapoints that can be identified with an AI (number 01, as I'm sure you know).</p></div>		</li>
