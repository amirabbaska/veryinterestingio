			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that's the better question.  Besides the obvious fact that we'd all obviously die.  It's a question in environment. </p>
<p>Assuming pressures remain same at current sea levels, what would pressures and temperatures and oxygen be like at say Challenger Deep?</p>
<p>Also, going step further...what would happen with current levels and Temps at say sea level if ocean magically drained?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically the atmosphere would replace the vacuum created by removing the water, reducing atmospheric pressure at sea level by creating more volume to fill, not sure about temperature and oxygen but I would assume we'd see a decrease as well, considering there'd be less particles in the air around us to exchange energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also far more fascinating to imagine a drained ocean. Since I was little I've tried to imagine what it would look like if the ocean froze as in everything was still, if the water was gone but the contents were suspended in position, if everything were just completely gone, etc. It's kind of a different and more interesting question and I'm glad you asked it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The oceans are dark and therefore absorb and hold heat, this is why when factoring for global climate change its not just the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere that contributes to the warming, but the part that it plays in negative feed back loops. If the dark ocean water was do disappear, temperatures would probably drop, but that doesn't mean that there wouldn't be drought or other heat related issues to contend with. Global ocean currents help drive the main weather patterns of the earth. Without them, there would be no reliable way to predict the outcome of the weather that I'm aware of and our &quot;weather belts&quot; would just stop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that before any temperature changes, we'd be more concerned about the disappearing precipitation worldwide if the oceans disappeared.  In that case, we'd be losing both all of the food the ocean provides, and virtually all food produced on land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cofferdam's interior would only be SLIGHTLY above sea level air pressure.</p>
<p>However, the pressure on the walls from the water would be PHENOMENAL.  Like 15,000 PSI.   This is basically the same problem as a submarine deals with.  Modern nuclear subs probably have a crush depth of about 2,400ft.  The ocean DOES go deeper than that.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not right. The pressure at the bottom of the cofferdam would be the same as it would be if all the oceans were drained. Being in a cofferdam wouldn't make any difference, you've still got the weight of an extra <strong><em>x</em></strong> kilometers of air above you.</p>
<p>If you were at the sea floor, it wouldn't be slightly above MSLP, it'd be at least three times higher. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it depends where you want to call &quot;the bottom&quot;.  Marianas Trench goes to 10,994 meters but that's an exception, but then again I did use that for the 15kpsi figure.  Average is more like 3700m, which would only be about 14% increase in air pressure.  But less pressure on the cofferdam walls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it be an even higher pressure with the cofferdam+ocean due to the fact that the ocean displaces the atmosphere to a higher elevation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's common practice to run pipe far below the sea floor with water depths of 3000m.  That includes 16&quot; casing that is hollow internally.  The problem with submarines is that they have irregular shapes and have to function as well.  If all we need is some thick steel tube, it'd be much easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking the pipes are installed filled with water.  If they are pumping a liquid that displaces the water.  If it is a gas then it is at high pressure.</p></div>		</li>
