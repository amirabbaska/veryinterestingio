<p>Other species have genes that can create descendents that only produce one sex or the other? That's fascinating, which ones have these genes and does it cause problems down the line with &quot;communities&quot; having vastly more &quot;boys&quot; than &quot;girls&quot; (or vice-versa)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It happens.</p>
<p>I don't have the time to give you a good explanation, but the phenomenon in general is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiotic_drive" target="_blank">meiotic drive</a>, and is not necessarily limited to the sex chromosomes. Basically, in males one allele will kill sperm that carry a different allele, whereas in female meiosis (which won't affect sex ratio) one allele will cheat its way into the egg more often than its counterpart (this is a non-exhaustive explanation). Oftentimes these alleles will have otherwise negative consequences (or as you correctly anticipate, if the sex ratio is involved, that can be very bad). This sets up an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intragenomic_conflict" target="_blank">intragenomic conflict</a>, as the rest of the genome evolves to shut down the distorter allele.</p>
<p>One mildly famous example where this has been observed is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=stalk+eyed+flies&amp;es_sm=91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=29g2VfHiFY6-yAT_6YDQDg&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=806" target="_blank">in stalk-eyed flies</a>:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most species tend to have approximately 50-50 sex ratios, and there is a good theoretical reason why:</p>
<p>Imagine, for whatever reason, females leave more offspring than males.  Natural selection would then favor individuals that produce more female offspring, because they would more successfully pass on genes to the next generation. So, over time, the proportion of females in the population would go up and the number of males would go down.
Imagine, as an extreme example, that the sex ratio gets so skewed that females outnumber males by 100 to 1.  That is one lucky male, and he is basically guaranteed to have free reign over as many females as he wants.
So we now have a situation where males are incredibly reproductively fit solely because they are the limiting resource.  It now becomes strongly beneficial to have a male offspring, as this basically guarantees your genes will be passed on to grandchildren.  As a result, individuals that produce more males are more successful, and start to increase in the population until there are as many males as females.  You're back to a 50-50 sex ratio. It's a negative-feedback loop.</p>
<p>Note that sex ratios are unlikely to skew to the 100-1 ratio I used as an example: even a 55-45 skew would be enough to strongly favor one sex over the other and bring it back to 50-50.</p>
<p>As another caveat, the sex ratio at birth does not need to be manifested in the adult population. In some cases, one sex suffers much higher mortality and is therefore less common in the population, but generally speaking the sexes should be approximately equally common at birth, to my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read the same thing! I can't remember the original source I read, but here is a fun article: <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/12/why-women-s-bodies-abort-males-during-tough-times" target="_blank">http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/12/why-women-s-bodies-abort-males-during-tough-times</a></p>
<p>Also, the normal 105-to-100 ratio of boys-to-girls at childbirth is a fun factoid. As far as I know, this is because male sperm weigh every-so-lightly less than female sperm. The Y chromosome is much, much smaller than the X chromosome. So for 2 equally strong spermatids with an equal energy store, the &quot;male&quot; sperm can swim just a tiny bit faster or farther and will beat the &quot;female&quot; sperm to the egg slightly more often. Fun!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned this about deer in my college behavioral ecology class - that if a doe wasn't able to find enough food, she was more likely to give birth to a female fawn than a male. The theory was that</p>
<ul>
<li>calorie intake of the mother is associated with birth weight of the baby</li>
<li>birth weight of the baby is associated with it being smaller when it grows up (exacerbated by the possibility that the mother still isn't getting enough calories while nursing, so the baby may also not be as well-fed after birth)</li>
<li>male deer fight with each other over mates, and larger deer are more likely to win, so a small male may not have many offspring - grandchildren of the original doe</li>
<li>female deer, on the other hand, are very likely to find a mate no matter what, because one male mates with many females</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, although a son could yield many grandchildren for the doe, it could also mean zero grandchildren. A daughter is a safer bet.</p>
<p>General disclaimer: None of this was posited as being at all conscious on the part of the doe, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, you could have something like a homozygous lethal allele that increases the odds of all-female offspring by causing an early miscarriage in any XY embryos that receive the mother's affected X. So 100% of XX embryos would be viable, but only 50% of XY (the half receiving the non-affected X from the mother) so the &quot;predicted&quot; ratio goes from 1:1 to 2:1 favoring girls so a family with 4 girls becomes statistically more probable.</p>
<p>Or an autosomal allele that interferes with pathways that are specific to male or female development and causes a miscarriage early on, but that seems less likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't this contradict <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_principle" target="_blank">Fisher</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose male births are less common than female.</p>
<p>A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.</p>
<p>Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.</p>
<p>Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.</p>
<p>As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.</p>
<p>The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd expect genes causing such biased outputs to disappear quickly, within a few generations. Am I wrong to think this way? Maybe certain subgroups can get away with violating Fisher's principle, as long as other subgroups counterbalance it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this contradicts Fisher.  Fisher just predicts that the advantage is kept in check, not that the genes go away.</p>
<p>If there were no counter-genes, the genes would actually run rampant.  If we assume a balanced population and a dominant point mutation on the Y chromosome to create only male children (without loss of overall fertility), we'd get a doubling of the number of individuals with this each generation until we start hitting the limits of population size/male density.   If we call males that can beget males and females normal males (marked as nm) and males that can only beget males bad males (marked as bm) and mark females as f, we get each generation as</p>
<p>f(n+1) = (f(n)* nm(n)) / (nm(n) + bm(n))</p>
<p>nm(n+1) = (f(n)* nm(n)) / (nm(n) + bm(n))</p>
<p>bm(n+1) = f(n) <em> bm(n) </em> 2 / (nm(n) + bm(n))</p>
<p>If we arbitrarily assume a population size of 10000, we'd get the following population development (<a href="http://pastebin.com/KCD5xFeK" target="_blank">python program</a>):</p>
<pre><code>n =  0 f = 5000  nm = 4999  bm =    1
n =  1 f = 4999  nm = 4999  bm =    2
n =  2 f = 4997  nm = 4997  bm =    3
n =  3 f = 4994  nm = 4994  bm =    5
n =  4 f = 4989  nm = 4989  bm =    9
n =  5 f = 4980  nm = 4980  bm =   17
n =  6 f = 4963  nm = 4963  bm =   33
n =  7 f = 4930  nm = 4930  bm =   65
n =  8 f = 4865  nm = 4865  bm =  128
n =  9 f = 4740  nm = 4740  bm =  249
n = 10 f = 4503  nm = 4503  bm =  473
n = 11 f = 4074  nm = 4074  bm =  856
n = 12 f = 3366  nm = 3366  bm = 1414
n = 13 f = 2370  nm = 2370  bm = 1991

<p>So, the selection isn't against the gene as a such - it is just the entire population dying off, and quickly.</p>
<p>There are types of variation that could counteract this effect.  A couple of examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>An X-bound tendency to create more females, e.g. by aborting all males.  If this was X-dominant, it would cut at minimal prevalence in the population cut off half the male offspring of the carriers (since there would usually be only one copy); if it became more advantageous (because females can get more children), it would reproduce and become common.  And if this worked by abortion, would effectively make all the carriers of the male-only gene sterile with those females, since their offspring would all be aborted.</li>
<li>A tendency in females to select normal males, e.g. by only wanting to have offspring with males that have sisters.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you got into a situation where having only male offspring was truly bad (as you can see it would be, based on the above numbers), you'd have strong selection pressure for any variant that chose to mate with normal males, restoring equilibrium.  And for any species where the variation wasn't available, you'd have rapid extinction.  Based on this, you have to presume that for any existing species either this kind of mutation has a very low likelihood of happening, or the requisite counter-variation is available.  (This is getting dangerously close to arguing for species level selection; however, I think I'm saved by this optimizing for individual level survival.)</p>
<p>EDIT: Replace &quot;selected away the bad males&quot; with &quot;chose to mate with normal males&quot; as the previous formulation was easy to read the wrong way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't that assumption kind of begging the question? If you're making twice as many males, then you're going to have a harder time finding them all women.</p>
<p>Regardless, shouldn't traits like this (tend to) disappear over time, as the few people with the alleles reproduce with the majority of other people who don't have the alleles? Or, if people are only reproducing with others in the allele group, then it's inaccurate for you to act like these people benefit from the sex ratios of humans as an aggregate group, since the only sex ratio that's relevant to them is the one of their own subgroup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I would expect such a gene to stick around.  In a 50/50 split, neither the boy gene or girl gene overwhelms the other.  Much like eye color, there is no particular pressure to force one or the other to extinction.  But, if some catastrophe kills off 50% of the women, those groups that had a high percentage of girl genes recover faster.  Likewise, if something happens to the men.  Since mild versions of these 'catastrophes' are going to happen just by random chance, each gene is kept going in the gene pool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's just part of how that observed balance is achieved.</p>
<p>Remember that <strong>evolution occurs at the level of populations, not individuals</strong>.  Individuals don't evolve, populations do.  So long as a population is near 1:1, it's in good shape.</p>
<p>Consider this.  If you have an allele to have mostly girls, and the general population is 50/50, then your daughters aren't really at a disadvantage.  So, at the level of the individual, variation in offspring sex ratios isn't that big of a deal.</p>
<p>Now if a population is out of whack, you've got problems.  60% girls means that male offspring are, generally, going to have better fitness.</p>
<p>However, in that population exists some variation, and some alleles that favor having boys are out there.  Any individual with those alleles will have more boys, which will in turn have more offspring themselves.  In other words, there's a good amount of selective pressure for those alleles.</p>
<p>Basically, everything balances out on it's own.  You can have lots of variation at the level of the individual, but what really matters is allele frequencies in populations.  This is actually a very common misconception, and part of why communicating about evolution is so difficult.  It's a very nuanced concept and has more in common with statistics and math than it does biology.</p></div>		</li>
