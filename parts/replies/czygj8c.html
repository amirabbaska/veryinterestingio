			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies for my ignorance on the subject. Regarding organs on a chip. Is there a priority as to what you would study first?  Example intestines or pancreas would take higher priority than an spleen. I also want to say thanks to your team.  My Dad passed 18 months ago from Alzheimer's and I have an 18 year old autistic son. Your efforts and research are answered prayers for some people. </p></div>		</li>
