<p>If you're only used to dissolving solids in liquids, and dissolving a liquid in a gas seems weird, note that you can also dissolve a gas in a liquid. For example, CO_2 dissolves quite nicely in water, especially with a little pressure and agitation. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, cold water will dissolve CO_2 better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I first heard that gases dissolve more easily in cold liquids, it actually made immediate sense. A <em>heated</em> solid is &quot;closer&quot; to becoming a liquid, but a <em>cooled</em> gas is &quot;closer&quot; to becoming a liquid.</p></div>		</li>
