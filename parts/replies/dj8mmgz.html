			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they typically work really well.  Getting the shots is a huge pain in the ass as you may need them anywhere from twice a week to once a month depending on severity.  But yeah they work.  They're the only actual treatment of the disease (aside from oral drops which are less effective) available.  A few more treatments are in the works though, which work on the same principles more or less: &quot;tell the body that cookies aren't trying to kill it&quot;.  </p></div>		</li>
