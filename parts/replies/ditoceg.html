			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll also add there is significant tax breaks for owning a house that both renters and these REITs don't get to enjoy. The property tax and the interest on your home mortgage can be offset in your income tax. As you said there is a &quot;homestead&quot; tax reduction in some states. These mechanisms - plus with new construction and expanding population - make home ownership a thing people still want. Now could it ever be the way OP hypothesized? sure if some of these conditions don't exist anymore. </p></div>		</li>
