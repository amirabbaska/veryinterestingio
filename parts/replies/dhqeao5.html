<p>Why did they think it was greedy? Owners spends thousands on them. That's ridiculous. No one wants to lose an investment like that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These people don't that you not only lose out on winnings but on profit from breeding. Yes, insurance covers a bit but you never know how far a horse can go until it gets there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Horses are in an odd no man's land between livestock and pet. Most people are way more attached to a horse than a cow (whether or not they personally spent time with it), but a horse has a job unlike a family dog and requires more special training.</p>
<p>If they truly were in it for the money they'd let the horse suffer because euthanasia isn't actually that cheap.</p>
<p>No one goes into the horse business to strike it rich anyways (rich --&gt; horse, not horse --&gt; rich) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's not greedy to euthanize on the track. People just didn't realise that that was more humane than moving them. Euthinising them may or may not have been humane as any surgery might not have worked. However, if the motivation for the owner euthanizing the horse was to save money, then that is greed. How could it not be? You don't euthanize a human because you can't afford to pay for their healthcare, why a horse?</p></div>		</li>
