<p>The mechanistic control of these programming factors are broadly explained by the concept of epigenetics.  The specific processes are still being elucidated by science (DNA Methyltransferases DNMTs, MicroRNAs, etc.) and it is a very young area of research.</p>
<p>It is fairly well established that excessive caloric intake (drinking sugary soda etc.) in infancy will program the organism to a hyperinsulinemia and excessive adipose tissue production, such that white adipose tissue will be highly sensitive to any excess calories and readily expand.  In that sense, obesity can be 'programmed'.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any studies specifically about height, but presumably certain dietary factors (i.e. protein malnutrition) would cause stunting like Marasmic-kwashiorkor syndrome.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How would a bad diet (...) change the genetic vs environmental factors percentage?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question hints that you might be misunderstanding what the general notion means that the factors are, in this case, &quot;75% genetic and 25% environmental&quot;. This percentage doesn't change no matter what happens to a person during their life, it just describes the magnitude of the effects of genetic and environmental factors. Diet is part of the environmental factors, as such, it can only account for up to 25% of (the variance of) height development. Conversely, if you have bad genes, they will still account for 75% of your height variance as a factor, and no matter how great a diet (and other environmental benefits) you have, those positive effects will still be outweighed (and counteracted) 3:1 (or 75%:25%) by your bad genetics.</p></div>		</li>
