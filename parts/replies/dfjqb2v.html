<p>In technical terms, air has a heat capacity of 1.02/.77m3</p>
<p>In comparison, steel has a heat capacity of 0.5/0.000127m3</p>

<p>You forgot half of the units.</p>
<p>Steel specific heat 0.49 kJ/(kg*K) (metal generally have low heat capacity)  </p>
<p>Air at 250 C:<br />
Specific heat 1.034 kJ/(kg*K)<br />
Density 0.675 kg/m^3  </p>
<p>Lets say the oven has 66 l = 0.066 m^3 volume (the first oven from google). The air inside would have heat capacity 0.05 kJ/K</p>
<p>A 94 gram steel piece would have same heat capacity. The cold steel tray you put the food on into the oven most likely has larger effect than the air escaping.</p></div>		</li>
