<p>Good question. The obvious, but time consuming and expensive option, is to go for an MS in Computer Science specializing in AI. A less expensive ... but very effective option is to get a series of online certificates from one of the online education companies that offer them, such as Udacity. Third, you could apply for a job at a company doing work in this area and learn &quot;on the job&quot;. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some of my kids are a few ways away from college now, being that I work with data and automation I see a relatively bleak future of possible employment for my children. What can they do to prepare for the lack of jobs in the future?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder if there are any career opportunities for a person who has more social sciences/cognitive background (theory of law), but it's willing to learn coding.</p></div>		</li>
