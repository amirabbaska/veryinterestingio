			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to stress a point from your point on &quot;creation of FF was to break the IE stranglehold of the 90s&quot;. Nowdays this isn't as obvious but before there was a real shortage of browsers. You could have explorer, netscape, Lynx and opera iirc. Opera, explorer and netscape were completely windows based and Lynx was a text-based browser. WYSIWYG, and drag and drop were features bosted at the time as cutting edge and nesscape didn't get one till like 1998. Anyhow, people got bored of slim pickings offered and wanted an extensible, adaptable, open source browser they could fit to their needs.</p>
<p>Today it's mostly about market percentage as there's good money to be made. </p>
<p>EDIT: I forgot all the fanclub circlejerking like emacs vs vim wars (although, emacs hands-down obviously wins.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Netscape was available for lots of platforms and oddly enough for a while there was an MS Internet Explorer for Unix, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bad then. Thnx for the correction. Anyhow, the point that the market was crap. So rise of a new browser for technically savvy and common folk was bound to happen and the clash between the two was inevitable from that point on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never learned to use emacs and always used vim, but don't know any vim command besides thr basic q! and stuff so I don't see myself as able to engage in a vim/emacs debate. I hate circlejerking peeps claiming X is better than Y. Just let people use whatever they think is best for them.</p>
<p>Also, isn't vim included by default in most UNIXes while emacs isn't? Some environments don't really like GNU stuff and will stir away from it as much as possible like HP-UX or other proprietary UNIXes... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find Vi to be present in a lot of places. But Vi != Vim. I don't usually use Vim so I wouldn't know. It's the same thing  - I usually use EMACS because I started with it and am now accustomed. There is no particular benefit to either these days as they're so extensible and so many plugins have been made that I wouldn't be surprised if there exist Vim/Emacs plugins that make them look like Emacs/Vim. </p>
<p>The point of mentioning that was that after a certain while, where you only had 1 option to use (because in the time when modem speeds were counted in bauds you didn't have a lot of text editors to pick from either) and then suddenly you had a choice between several other O.K. choices you would always have the clash between adopters and the &quot;classicists&quot; about which one is better and why. And over time the O.K. choices would become about the same in the sense of how well they perform their purpose, to the point that there would be no distinguishable difference or the differences would be so small they could be ignored. Once that happens the choice becomes personal preference and not an actual choice like it was when they were just O.K., when one of them could do things the other one couldn't and vice-versa.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Apple likes their walled garden.  Though in the case of browser choices, it's more along the lines of &quot;Garden with a knee-high fence that you can step over&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
