			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is actually an incredibly frustrating discussion to have with people. </p>
<p>I had a 40 minute argument with a friend of mine, who actually believed that it worked like, if for example the tax rates are 10% for up to 100K and 50% for 100K+, then if you make $99,999.99, you take home $89999.99 (90%), but if you now make 1¢ more and hit $100K, <a href="https://m.imgur.com/gallery/iWKad22" target="_blank">you are suddenly taking home $50K (50%)</a>. It ended up with me calling him a moron over and over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah, I had a similar experience with my sister.  </p>
<p>Sister: &quot;I didn't take the promotion because it would have put me in a higher tax bracket and I'd actually make less money.&quot;</p>
<p>Me: <em>blinks</em></p>
<p>Edit: TIL that this is actually possible to make less after changing tax brackets.  Thanks redditors :D.  In my sisters case though, it was salaried -&gt; salaried so I think she was just being bone-headed.  But it worked out in the end. She ended up changing careers, moved out of state, and is much happier now :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason a lot of people end up saying this because with some pay checks, it actually does <em>look</em> like that at first.  Some places project your earnings for the year, then withhold accordingly. So, if you work overtime at the beginning of the year and rack up 20 hours of time and a half in the first month, your income looks like it's 20% higher that month.  So more tax gets held out (projecting to put you into a higher bracket).  But you could end up only working 3 or 4 months with overtime and still be within the same bracket as before.</p>
<p>In the end it works out. You get your money back with your tax return.  But that's another reason someone will get mad: they earned the money but they don't get to have it until later.  That matters to a lot of paycheck to paycheck people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The worst one I had was with someone who was a tax preparer. It was at least a 10 minute argument before they finally agreed to look it up. They admitted they were wrong in the end but I couldn't understand how they didn't know it... it is effectively their job!</p>

<p>Note that software does the work for most 'cheap' tax preparers these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This works both ways as people who constantly drone on about the rich not paying their fair share do the same type of shitty calculations.</p>
<p>Not a humble brag, I swear.</p>
<p>I made 1.06 million dollars in 2016, I paid 440k in taxes.  State, Fed SS and ObamaCare Tax (the rich fee) combined. I remember looking at my accountant like he was fucked in the head and he basically told me you're screwed once you start making big money and then we had a long conversation about how come the rich never pay these kinds of taxes.  He laughed and said &quot;welcome to the rich club&quot;.</p>
<p>I am NOT complaining because I &quot;got to keep&quot; the other 566k and that is a shit ton of money, but still, people anecdotally call me an evil greedy fuck who doesn't pay his fair share.</p>
<p>I could understand if I fell into a barrel of money with no effort, but it's the hardest I've ever worked and I literally risked it all for my success.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, you live in a society which provided you with the opportunity to make ridiculous amounts of money. That has to be paid for somehow.  </p>
<p>$500k take home pay is more than enough to live all but the most luxurious lifestyles possible. It's not like the cost of living scales up either really. If you wanted to you could live like an 'average' person on $50k without feeling hard up at all. What I'm saying is, while paying 440k might like a lot in terms of percentage, you're still taking enough home to live a moderately luxurious lifestyle at least ten times over. If anyone has to pay for society (which I repeat, provided you with the opportunity to earn this much) then surely it should be those who have done well out of it? </p>
<p>You're not just in the 1%, you're in a very, very tiny minority if you earned over a million dollars last year. My heart doesn't really bleed for you, no offence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the moment in the UK the tax rates are:-</p>
<p>£0-£11,500             - 0% (tax free allowance)
£11,501 - £45,000   - 20%
£45,001,- £150,000 - 40%
£150,000+              - 45%</p>
<p>This looks a similar process to the US but obviously different bandings and rates. Low earners don't pay any tax.</p>
<p>On top of this we also have National Insurance (NI) this is supposedly to pay for the National Health Service. We have VAT on purchases and Council Tax which is a local tax to pay for local services.</p>
<p>In the recent General Election the Labour Party wanted to increase tax for those earning more than £80k and also push up the rate for those earning more than £150k.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I dunno, they manage it here in Japan just fine. You're doing a ton of calculations on your tax forms anyway (subtracting various deductions, adding various other income types). All that math is getting double-checked, so one more math check isn't that big a deal for the tax bureau.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That &quot;they&quot; do not tell you what percentage you owe?  </p>
<p>I mean, it's a calculation, having a chart with every dollar (rounded) through the brackets (as one whole) on it already exists and it's how you come to the amount you owe or are to be refunded and this is presented  before you file.  I am not arguing with you, just wondering what specifically you are asking &quot;for&quot;?</p>
<p>A tax bracket breakdown?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not asking for anything, really. But think about this. As a wealthy person, your overall percentage of taxes is going to be higher, because you have some income in those upper brackets. Having a higher overall rate can make that wealthy person feel like they are paying more than others - not just in pure dollars but <em>as a percentage</em>. That can come across as unfair or be characterized as unfair. However it is still completely fair because a rich person still gets the same tax-free first $36,000 (or whatever) that a poorer person gets. That is fair. I think a lot of people on the Right are walking around saying that the rich pay more in taxes than others and they are missing this key point. Is it clear what key point I mean, now?</p></div>		</li>
