			<div class="markdown"><p>I have become aware of my dreams a few times, but inconveniently enough I have trouble controlling my dreams to any level beyond just waking myself up.  </p>
<p>I will have Ah Ha moments where I realize it is a dream but for example, if I could fly in the dream, once I am aware of it my flying skills are sorely lacking to the point I may struggle to be able to fly at all.  Or I will be driving but once I am aware I am dreaming the car only goes much slower and has worse braking and handling even if I try to think that the car should be faster.</p>
<p>One theory I have is that I am not really becoming self aware, I am just dreaming that I am becoming self aware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I remember reading something like that here once before. That it largely has to do with the shutting down of the frontal lobe which helps to perceive logic. Thus, when we dream it doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never had anything in a dream convince me I was dreaming. Not even when I'm having a dream I've already had and remember.</p>
<p>I've spontaneously come up with the idea a few times, like twice, only to think something like &quot;I hope I don't crash while flying&quot; only to crash and wake up.</p></div>		</li>
