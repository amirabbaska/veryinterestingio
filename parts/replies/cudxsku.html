			<div class="markdown"><p>China fluffed up their own spending to make them look worth more. When that extra fluff popped they suddenly weren't worth what they said. Now people are selling all the little bits of China they bought so they don't lose the money they spent buying bits of China.<br />
This sucks for everyone else because China used the money they got from people buying them to buy other people's stuff. Now the money China gave them for their stuff isn't worth as much, thus making the stuff China bought not worth as much.<br />
Their closer trading partners are feeling the bigger sting, such as Australia. They sold China lots of stuff to fluff their worth up, and now it's not worth what they got for it. This leaves little worth, but a lot of debt.<br />
Is that ELI4 better?   </p></div>		</li>

<p>But what I got from this is that there stuff isn't as good as it used to be, so clearly it's old and they need to buy new stuff at the store!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI4: China's economic growth is slowing.  Economic growth is like gravity, what goes up must come down.</p>
<p>ELI5: Chinese economic growth in its current form is not sustainable, since China is no longer a true developing economy.  Growth is slowing, yet Chinese stock prices were growing greatly in the recent past.  Stock prices tend to reflect the overall economy.  So, here, what goes up must come down.  The real question is whether this economic slowing will be sudden or gradual (aka &quot;smooth&quot;).  We don't know the answer.  The Chinese government has been taking actions (suspending trading, pumping in cash, etc.) to affect the market.  Government intervention itself is a signal for risk; the government wouldn't take drastic action if major risk wasn't present.  The global market is uncertain whether the government can control the stock market in the face of this economic downturn.  To sum up, markets don't like uncertainty and the exact future of Chinese economic growth is uncertain.</p>
<p>Note: DON'T PANIC.  Life goes on and the economy will be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing Notation like XTYY or XTYYYY is short hand for time. In business, particularly in finance you will also see &quot;FY&quot;YY. What they break down to is as follows:
XT = Time Frame. The X is the number proportion and it always references the time. Time is either going to be Quarter (Q) or Half (H) the year.
YY/YYYY = Year. So YY is the last 2 digits of a given year. YYYY is the full year.
If someone ever uses &quot;FY&quot; followed by a YY, they are referring to the Fiscal Year, which is when companies have their &quot;Official Business Year&quot; from So instead of Jan 1 to Dec 31, a Fiscal Year could be Sept 1 to Aug 31. It's just done for reporting. Usually it's in line with the start and end of a given quarter. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Does China allowing pension funds to be gambled in the stock market mean they just collapsed wealth across the country for normal workers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a loaded question. First, I don't know what China does with their Pension system. It's not something I can speak on because I just don't know how the country handles it. That said, any money invested in the stock market will be affected by will be affected by the movements in the stock market. So if the market crashes, the pension will lose money leading to a collapse of wealth regardless of what happens. The only way to &quot;regain&quot; that wealth is either let growth happen organically, which is out of the picture if you are the Chinese government, or you prop the markets up, which China has done, but not to the extent of the Fed and Quantitative Easing. Watching the Shanghai Index crash is, effectively, a retread of the '08 collapse in that we are going to see a massive collapse of wealth in the a singular marketplace and watching the cascading effects happen. I don't think the effects are as pronounced as they were in 2008 ('08 was tied to the Global Credit Market vis a vis Collateralized Debt invested by investors around the globe; this crash is isolated to China but has a cascade effect as it shows weakness in the Chinese economy), but give it time. We have yet to see a significant enough action in the markets to roil things. A 10% Dip is a correction, not a recession. The other thing to consider though, is this is a 10% correction in a Post-QE world. This may get far worse than it actually is once people start digging deeper. </p>
<p>As far as being localized to China, I think that Chinese wealth tied up in the market will take a great deal of financial tomfoolery to effectively recreate what was lost and keep the machine pumping hire. Globally, however, I don't think we'll see anything significant until Mid September. August tends to be a relatively stable month as most investors and institutional players are away on Holiday. Once we hit September, all things are off. It will defnitely be be an interesting month when you look at timing. Between Labor Day being a full 7 days into the month of September and the Fed Board of Governors Meeting falling out the day after Rosh Hashannah this year, I would expect to see the potential fallout happen right around that point in the month.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an economist but I think the idea of post-QE economic intervention is interesting. What tools does a state (like the US) have at its disposal once interest rates are already so low? I've heard of negative interest rates, but how would that work?</p></div>		</li>
