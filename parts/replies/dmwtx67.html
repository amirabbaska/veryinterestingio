The copper winding I work with is 3mm x 2mm hollow conductor wrapped in glass fiber. Source I hit magnets with hammers for the LHC and various particle accelerators. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What is the purpose of this? Are you working with AC so the skin effect make solid wire no more effective?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motors and generators are surprisingly low-tech compared to other electronics.  They're often made on-demand, configured as required for a particular need based on a phone conversation between a distributor and end customer. </p>
<p>The distributors say that their technical expertise is a value-add and that there's simply not enough volume to make a standard lineup, automated manufacturing, and maintaining an inventory economically viable.</p>
<p>I say they just a matter of time before someone willing to do so comes on and dominates the market.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Definitely. The generators I work with (250kva, 3 phase, 2400vac) were installed in 1962, but were purchased used. We think they were manufactured around 1920, and they carry patent plates dating to '86. </p>
<p>This part of the technology, converting rotational energy to electrical really hasn't changed much at all in the past century. The biggest change is the advancement of technology that allows the generator to spin asynchronously, and then convert that to standard line frequency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive worked at a place making various armature and stator coils for the last 12 years and while we've gotten some updated machinery that are supposedly more efficient and require less physical labor, they are much more prone to error and IMO much more wasteful in terms of copper scrap. When I first started at my company i was amazed at how low tech and manual labor intensive it was. I use no tool more than a nylon/Teflon mallet. An entire 12 drawer toolbox and 80%  of it just sits and waits for the off chance i may need it     </p></div>		</li>
