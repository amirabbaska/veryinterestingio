			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you thought to search the Reddit archive before punting your chimp to an uncertain fate at the depths of a body of water.. I would strongly advise you to refrain from throwing any chimpanzees into any form of pool lake or ocean.</p>
<p>However if your chimp knows sign language you can ask them for informed consent, and should your sign language speaking biped inform you that it does indeed know how to swim, and that it would enjoy being thrown into the body of water immediately near you...... Well shit.. I guess punt that monkey.</p>
<p>But in all other circumstances.</p>
<p>Do not throw apes into bodies of water.</p></div>		</li>
