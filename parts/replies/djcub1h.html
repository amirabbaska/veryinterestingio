			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just going to comment the same thing. And add that it takes awhile for the patient compartment to get warm or cold depending on weather, so we keep them running 24/7(when not plugged in on shore power) to keep it appropriate for providing care and keeping meds. Pharm-guards help when plugged in but only for minor temp control and with trying to keep everything charged... I've had a newer ambulance with good battery's die on me in an hour with mod-power turned off just due to random parasitic power draws. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, and another issue is if you shut off on scene what's to say it's going to start up again? Leaving apparatus running is essential when not plugged in at base. It also allows random people to inform you that it's their &quot;tax dollars we are wasting.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha! Sounds like you worked for RMA ... We never shut our rights down for fear of it not starting up again. At the station? Sure shut her down. On scene or at the hospital, let it run?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add some information on how this works: <a href="http://imgur.com/notNuDa" target="_blank">Here</a> is a schematic.</p>
<p>There is a charging regulator which keeps the batteries topped off and with that, there goes an air pressure system that keeps the air breaks (many firetrucks have those here) under pressure. The couplings on the trucks are quick release so the truck can just drive off and the plugs will disconnect automatically and roll up.</p></div>		</li>
