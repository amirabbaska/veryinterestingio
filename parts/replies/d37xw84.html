			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty confident that you are correct.  The examples listed above seem to reflect damage due to scouring of particulates under the finger.  I have had most of my phones for years, and have never seen a spot wear on the screen... conversely, I have often cleaned my phone screen to discover quite a coating of oil, dirt, grime, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried doing that, that's actually the reason I had to get a new phone! It's definitely not just the screen being dirty, I've had many other touchscreen phones for work and never noticed a similar texture to the wear on my original phone. Hopefully I can find the phone somewhere at home, I'll link a picture of it if I can. </p></div>		</li>
