			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the thing about energy. Released it over the course of many small increments throughout the day,
it's nothing special. Release it in under a millisecond (and in a confined space), you're liable to see an explosion.</p>
<p>A cow contains as much energy as a hydrogen bomb, but it's a slow burn so we're all still here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the much less badass-sounding Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) regulates most of the alcohol industry day-to-day. BATFE spends about 98% of its time on firearms/explosives, 2% of its time on the illegal cigarette trade, and a negligible amount of time on bootleggers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting aside, TTB was part of the BAFT until like 2003 or something.  they reorganized (thanks congress) and the BATF became the BATFE and moved to the justice department.  the TTB split and stayed with the treasury department.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mostly TTB. They set the federal rules and regs for legal sale of alcohol (although the states do most of the work in this regard, per the 21st Amendment). BATFE is a law enforcement agency whose principle concern is the illegal transfer of the products in their name.</p></div>		</li>
