			<div class="markdown"><p>So weird because I bought some Cree LED bulbs for my house a while ago and I have to say they were terrible. Buzzing noises and very short life.  Maybe it was a bad batch or something, but it certainly wasn't obvious that the bulbs bearing the Cree name were somehow better from my experience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you had them on a circuit with a dimmer or some other incompatible switch. LEDs need compatible switches or they buzz, blink, and break. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be. I've had other LEDs since that have done better. But it's also possible that LED bulbs in general have also improved and are more robust than they once were. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The circuitry on some of those Cree bulbs is just cheap. We've had a few fail to light up, or the glass fell off (cheap glue), etc. We don't have a single light dimmer in the entire house, just dumb switches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buzzing wouldn't be the LED arrays themselves, I'd suspect the driver. Those also vary in quality, some companies will pair good quality LED chips with the cheapest power supplies and optics available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cree does make fairly good LEDs, one of their plants is where I live.  Their big claim to fame is the fact they were the first I think to be able to produce blue LEDs.  Now the Cree LEDs bulbs you got could have been a bad batch or just bad  ones.  Most LEDs shouldnt buzz where you can hear it, they can mess up video feeds sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We made the first SiC (silicon carbide) blue LED. Also, the buzzing was probably either an incompatible dimmer/ switch like you mentioned, or a problem with the driver. The LED bulbs have to turn AC current into DC current, and problems with that driver (including sending power to it through in incompatible dimmer/switch) can cause buzzing. I don't know much about our bulbs because I work in a different group though. </p></div>		</li>

<p>unreputable vendors will also label their light 2000lumens when they're not</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a big difference between <em>bulb lumens</em> and <em>out-the-front</em> lumens.  A flashlight may be technically be producing 2000 lumens, but only 1200 are actually illuminating the surface that you're pointing it at.  Most reputable companies would rate this as 1200 rather than 2000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shady companies don't really base their ratings on anything though. It's just a made up number so that people without any understanding will see a higher number than their shady competitors and buy. They don't care, they know it's a lie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering our best LEDs, which are expensive, are less than 150 lumens per watt, having 2000 lumens would mean that thing is consuming at least 15 watts of power. You couldn't acheive that in any less than 10 D Cell batteries, and even with 10 you would drain them all in about a half hour.</p></div>		</li>
