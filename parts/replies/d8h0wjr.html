<p>It would be a better world if people did nothing but saturate in National Hurricane center data all day, but we don't live in that world, U/Seraph062...We don't live in that world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah a lot of people don't really consider the hurricane/cyclone activity that happens outside of the Gulf/East coast region.</p>
<p>Last year, Hurricane Patricia literally came out of nowhere - tropical storm to Category 5 in 24 hours, and has the strongest sustained winds ever recorded, but possibly faster than the 215mph they got since the plane could not safely continue flying through her. Fortunately, the geography of the coast it hit was a storm killer, so the damage was a lot less than anticipated in Mexico. Texas got hit with flash floods though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh yeah, I remember that one.  Everybody was freaking out and it basically hit the western mountains of Mexico and died out quickly, leaving nobody dead.  Seems like that one came and went before most even knew about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, Patricia began to weaken directly before landfall. It's the strongest storm ever recorded and it intensified incredibly quick. It went from 85mph to 205mph within 24 hours. It's weakening was as much of a record as its intensity. Even still, it was the strongest storm to make landfall in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Absolutely insane storm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to look at it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accumulated_cyclone_energy#Atlantic_hurricane_seasons.2C_1950.E2.80.932016" target="_blank">Accumulated Cyclone Energy</a>. For the last 10 years it totals 938, the 10 years before that is 1504. I think ACE is a better measure than &quot;number of named storms&quot; for hurricane season strength, and there is a significant dip there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That only proves that the last 10 years were quieter than the 10 before that. 2005 was an absolute freak, and the late 90's and mid 00's were both periods of significantly above average hurricane activity, so even a &quot;normal&quot; period is going to look depressed using that methodology.  </p>
<p>If you compare the average ACE from 2006-2015 to the 1966+ average you get very similar numbers (I'm not energetic enough to look it back up but it's 938 vs 960ish).  </p></div>		</li>
