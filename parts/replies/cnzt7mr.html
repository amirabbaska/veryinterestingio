			<div class="markdown"><p>And even <em>if</em> it were &quot;just&quot; unvaccinated people.. Keep in mind that some folks are legitimately unvaccinated - i.e., the immuno-compromised, those allergic to some vaccine compounds, those who are particularly elderly, etc. etc. Some also just haven't got their vaccines <em>yet</em>. It isn't &quot;just&quot; other people who choose not to or unfortunate children who don't have a choice, it undermines the entire purpose of using a general immunity to protect those who cannot obtain said immunity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An allergic reaction develops after your immune system encounters a foreign substance at least once. Although there are many checks and balances to ensure that your immune system functions properly (a proportional response directed at the correct intruder), it can, in rare cases, become sensitized to the new substance. When your immune system encounters that substance again, it launches an attack. This can be a minor reaction (seasonal allergies which are controlled by antihistamines, for example) or a full-blown allergic reaction (anaphylaxis.) </p>
<p>The reason for the latency between the sensitizing exposure and the next exposure/reaction is that it takes time for your body to make antibodies against the foreign substance. Once those antibodies are present, your immune system is primed and ready for that particular allergen.</p>
<p>Allergic reactions to vaccines are very uncommon, but they can happen -- think in the neighborhood of roughly 1/10,000 chance (0.01%). Not my child, but my kitten had her normal kitten series of vaccines with no adverse effects. When we boosted the vaccines again at 1 year, she had an adverse reaction: within 10 minutes, she started vomiting, so I rushed her back to the vet's office. About 15 minutes after the vaccine, hives began appearing on her skin (visible just in front of her ears). The veterinarian quickly administered steroid and antihistamine injections to calm her immune system, but the end result is that she probably shouldn't have any more vaccines.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you've ever been asked to hang around the pharmacy for 15 minutes after a flu shot, this is why; they're waiting to see if you have an allergic reaction so you can be seen immediately by the pharmacist.</p></div>		</li>
