			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you cover education a lot, your post is incorrect on many areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We do know (objectively) that Indian universities till the medieval era at least did not restrict anybody based on caste - children of all castes were admitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do know that the village schools (surveyed by the British) were common schools, and there was no &quot;secret school for Brahmin kids&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>We do not have any evidence to suggest that Shudras were paid poor wages, in fact that in itself is a very Eurocentric understanding of the peasant classes (serfs and bonded labour) whereas Indian agriculture had the peasants own the land they tilled. They had smaller landholdings, but the money they made from their fields were theirs. We do know that for instance, during the Mauryan period there existed broadly two type of landholding patterns. The Rashtra and the Sita - the Rashtra were basically the existing peasants who held title to land over generations. The Sita type was when the state encouraged the landless and the displaced forest dwelling tribals to clear jungle land and then lay claim to a title. The Sita lands were owned by the state directly (no cruel landowner stereotype here) and the state imposed a tax (on par with that extracted from the Rashtra holders and defined clearly) on the Sita holders. Whatever surplus the peasants extracted was theirs to keep. Keep in mind, there were no intermediaries (landlords in Medieval Europe or Zamindars in British India), the state extracted the revenues directly from the land owners. We also know that during the Gupta periods and even in Chola era Tamil Nadu, if you tilled a plot of land for 10-12 (time period varied) years, you automatically gained the title to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was during the Delhi Sultanate period that this long established pattern began to change. The Imperial court gave huge land grants to its nobles who then sub let the land who then used tillers - but even this was relative to the overall scope of land in farming, very limited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your points of correction, despite really liking the ELI5 OP used.</p>
<p>Is there a book you recommend to read into the caste system? I'm aware this weird website called wikipedia exists, but I'm finding out I am retaining less and less from it compared to reading a physical book (or ebook at least) than looking at a shiny screen besides my already 8 hours of work and tv for leisure...</p>
<p>anyway... yeah, do you have a book or group of books that go in depth about this topic? thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ever consult an elder, they will tell you the realities behind these &quot;free&quot; schools.
The higher cast kids were given preferences by the teachers.
Not only that,
They had the luxury to study without other obstacles.</p>
<p>The starting line for the castes were very different</p>
<p>Even today in rural areas we can see how some groups like tribals or backward areas still Suffer from Derth of awareness and education and opportunity </p></div>		</li>
