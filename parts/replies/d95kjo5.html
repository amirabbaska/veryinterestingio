<p>If you hack a larger server and don't use some obscure &quot;thing&quot;, they see (encrypted) traffic coming in but 99.9% of it is legit - all but yours...</p>
<p>It's like finding the man in a black suit carrying a briefcase in Manhattan during rush hour.</p>
<p>The worrying thing for you isn't being spotted, it's who you talk to in the building.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's pros and cons of it.   VPN won't be able to work out tor traffic but will still know it's tor. </p>
<p>Last I had read on it is it doesn't make you more secure,  but will hide tor traffic coming in and out of your  computer. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's still useful to have your own VPN, and that also adds some security since you add keys to the connection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because national security.  Or child safety.  Or public health.  Or whatever bullshit excuse they use.</p>
<p>I mean, it looks like the power elite are murdering Wikileaks people left and right.  It's best not to assume the government cares about your right to privacy.</p>
<p>I hate that I live in a time where nutty conspiracy talk is actually viable truth, but there you have it.  Tangentially, this is exactly what is wrong with a surveillance state, it suppresses free though even if it's not illegal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they know it's you they can call up your ISP and be like &quot; yo give me the data&quot;</p>
<p>A VPN stops them from tracking you back to you (or should anyway), but to be safe many hackers use multiple VPNs or proxy chains to make it very difficult. </p>
<p>Just remember: the government can't subpoena the VPN corporation for data they don't even store, but they can force them to monitor your connection or log that data themselves in your specific case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And of course, with TOR, you must trust that the nodes you are connecting to are not compromised by the authorities, as they could match up the traffic at the end node and others with that at your ISP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a degree, TOR also wraps the connection in layers of encryption, each node in the chain can only decrypt their layer of the connection in order to route it to the next one. That's why it's called The Onion Router, because each node in the route has its own layer of crypto.</p>
<p>By default TOR uses 3 nodes, an entry node, an intermediary and an exit node. The nodes only know the next in the chain, so the whole chain doesn't know where traffic originated from or where it is going to. That's the theory anyway, as long as the crypto is safe it shouldn't be possible to trace who has requested what even if you compromise the entry node.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you add nodes? Let's say you wanted to use 5 or 10.</p>
<p>And could you layer it? You use a VM to VPN and RDP to a remote server from which you VPN and RDP another remote server through the TOR network. </p>
<p>From the second server you browse incognito using the TOR network again.</p>
<p>Is that possible? Is it worth while?</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not doing anything illegal. I just like the concept of security (bunkers, and alarm systems, castles, etc...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that confuses me is that at each node there exists an encryption that is then decrypted.  If the decryption is being performed then how does that not compromise the entire system's security?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And because tor anonymity cannot be guaranteed, people (attackers) usually make their own network of nodes to skip across. You get a box in China, Iran, some eastern euro countries it will be very hard to work through.</p></div>		</li>
