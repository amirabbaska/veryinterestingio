			<div class="markdown"><p>People do this with margin trading.</p>
<p>However, this is also how people can lose everything very quickly.</p>
<p>Most common example for everyday folks is a mortgage.  I have 3.75% mortgage and my savings is mostly in mutual funds earning 8-12% each year.</p>
<p>If I won the lottery for $100,000 or even sold an old car for $1000....I have no incentive to pay down my mortgage faster with my extra money.</p>
<p>Why save 3.75% when I can earn 10%?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This obviously depends on which tax legislation applies to you, but you may have to pay income taxes for those 10% you earn as well. However, many legislations have tax exemptions for retirement savings up to a certain amount. </p>
<p>The principle that 10% &gt; 3.75% still applies, but the tax advantage may not be a thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do the investing yourself...I caught my parents &quot;financial adviser&quot; only earning them 1%.  The &quot;finance guy&quot; sits in a meeting with my parents and myself, laughs at &quot;bonds&quot; which only would pay 3%.  Then I ask him &quot;bottom line, what is your average return for my parents since you took over managing.&quot;</p>
<p>His answer...&quot;1%&quot;</p>
<p>Financial advisers are the scummiest of the scum in my mind.  They are out to make commission and drain your potential retirement.</p>
<p>Go over to /r/personalfinance and convert to the religion of Vanguard.  Lowest mutual rates and no shareholders to please, you are technically a share holder if you hold investments with them.  As someone who hates corporate greed, lobbyists, the FCC, the system, etc....Vanguard is really a &quot;For the people, by the people&quot; type of investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it doesn't matter if your investments have surpassed both the original debt and the interest.</p>
<p>e.g. loan of 10k over 30 years. pay 20k in interest over those 30 years. So you have to pay back 30k overall to borrow that 10k. well if that 10k was invested at 10% returns over 30 years, you ended up with about 175k on the investment. So taking out that 10k loan was worth about 145k of free money over those 30 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, but student debt interest rates can be fairly high so you'll have a hard time guaranteeing a better return with investments.</p>
<p>If you can get that return (like with a company match on 401k contributions) then go for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about what rates you get. college loans are usually high. People generally recommend paying off any debt with rates &gt;4% before investing, which means most college loans are better to be paid off before investing. Some situations can change though, like employer match 401k is usually recommended before student loans.</p></div>		</li>
