			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people claim this to be a density problem, rather this is mostly a frame of reference problem (thanks u/mkang96). Newtons first law states that an object at rest wants to stay at rest whereas an object in motion tends to stay at motion. If the drone is flying stationary and then the car moves, indeed the drone does move to the back. But again this is relative to the frame of reference. If we are in the car it does appear that the drone is moving back. However, not accounting for air resistance, if we were an observer standing outside, the car would be the one moving but the drone would appear to be stationary. This is the reason why air in the first place would pool to the back of the car, when the car accelerates, newtons first law indicates that the air naturally wants to stay at rest.</p>
<p>Likewise, if the drone was sitting in the car, (not flying) and the car is moving at a constant velocity, all objects in the car are moving at the same velocity relative to each other including the air. So when the drone starts flying, it's already technically in motion in refence to an observer outside the vehicle, but stationary inside the vehicle. Since everything is constant, there is no force on the air or the drone, so they would continue to stay at the constant velocity with  the car.</p>
<p>Edit-&gt; as pointed out general relativity was changed to frame of reference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does depend on density though, since there is air involved. If you had an object the same density as air, the air around it would force it to accelerate with the car. If you have an object that that is less dense than air, a balloon for example, it will actually move relative to the car in the direction of the cars acceleration. This is because the air in the car has more momentum than the object and will want to continue moving at the same velocity &quot;more&quot; than the object, having the air move away from the cars acceleration relative to the car. This is all assuming the windows are closed and everything in the car has to stay in the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well let's say we just eliminate the entire density portion by replicating this experiment in a vacuum. Also let's just replace the drone with a special edition model that uses some sort of combustion propulsion to hover. Let's say the drone is hovering. It currently is not in contact with the car whatsoever. The moment the car moves forward the drone will soon hit the back. Technically the drone has not moved. However if the frame of reference is the car, the drone seems to have moved backwards. </p>
<p>Now let's add air and replace the drone with the regular one. The drone technically is still affected by the air. However it's actually so negligible because the drone is much denser than air. Although it still is a form of drag, it won't be much to overcome the resting state of the drone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the drone ascended after the car is moving at a steady pace (and the controls are neutral), wouldn't the drone slowly drift back anyway? </p>
<p>My logic is like this: If the car suddenly stopped while the drone was hovering, then the drone would fly forward at the speed the car was going...say 70 km/hr. </p>
<p>So if we calculate the distance the drone would've launched forward at the speed of the car until the drone stops, then that number would be the limit of the drone's momentum. </p>
<p>That should mean that in the case where the car is traveling at a steady 70 km/hr, any effects of its momentum would have a similar limit to how long it affects the drone while hovering inside the speeding car. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you elaborate? Takes all the air? How does air move forward? And wouldn't it be harder to breathe? </p></div>		</li>
