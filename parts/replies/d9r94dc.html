			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine holding the sun near a swimming pool. Pool looks normal for the first few moments, and then starts to heat up. </p>
<p>A lot of stuff starts vaporizing. Like, by the end of it all, the sun will have to shine through steam, chlorine, and all the other fun stuff people leave in the pool that's now all heated up and gassy. </p>
<p>Similar thing happens during dawn and dusk. Morning air is calm, unheated, and stable. It's like looking through unwrinkled saran wrap. By the end of the day, the heat causes the air to stir up the fumes, chemicals, water vapor, air, and all the other fun stuff people leave in the atmosphere. The saran wrap's now scrunched up and wrinkly, it's not as clear anymore.</p>
<p>The result? Different colors during sunrise and sunset. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you have a cup of cold water, and a cup of hot tea.
If you look at the cup of hot tea, there is steam in the air above it.  The cup of cold water does not have that.  </p>
<p>The steam coming off the cup of hot tea is like the atmosphere at the end of the day because the sun has made it really warm. Because it is really warm, there is more stuff in the air for sunlight to bounce on. </p>
<p>Something like that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The resulting color, which appears like a pale blue, actually is a mixture of all the scattered colors, mainly blue and green.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the actual color is not what we see?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conversely, glancing toward the sun, the colors that were not scattered away — the longer wavelengths such as red and yellow light — are directly visible, giving the sun itself a slightly yellowish hue. Viewed from space, however, the sky is black and the sun is white.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's cool info. I always thought Sun was actually yellow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the sun is &quot;white&quot; to the extent that our earthling eyes have evolved to see almost exactly one octave of the electromagnetic spectrum centered at the sun's peak output and what the atmosphere absorbs or filters the least of (what we call 'the visible spectrum'). So 'white' to us is just what light the sun emits most of.</p>
<p>the sun is &quot;yellow&quot; to the extent that among all the main body stars, which have been grouped up according to their surface temperature, the sun is in the 'Yellow Group' (i.e. stellar classification G)</p>
<p>the sun is also &quot;yellow&quot; to the extent that the white light that shined in a straight line from the sun to your eye gets some of its blue/violet scattered away from it. and this makes the sky glow blue, and what's left makes the sun itself looks a little more yellow-ish</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I almost agree, very nice reasoning and links in your first two paragraphs, I just don't like the last paragraph.</p>
<p>Holding pressure constant, atmospheric density is a function of temperature. So in the morning the atmosphere is cold, has multiple stable layers, typically much higher density than in the evening when convection is still settling down. Also high humidity typically leads to haze particles, large enough to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering" target="_blank">Mie scattering</a>. You say &quot;blue-light-scattering water molecules&quot; but all relatively un-clumped molecules with a dipole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" target="_blank">scatter blue light</a> preferentially, most notably nitrogen, the main constituent of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Perhaps you meant to say the density of pollution particles is greater in the sunset atmosphere than the sunrise atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
