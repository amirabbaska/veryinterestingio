			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to read the KJV for the beauty of the language, but for meaning I use a Greek interlinear. You can see every greek word next to the most literal English word, the order of the words and look up its meaning in a greek dictionary. Of course, I don't have the cultural context as well as I would like, but it is a lot better than a flawed translation!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. As he didn't have a complete greek version of the book of Revelations, he took his latin Vulgate (he was also working on a latin bible) and he used that to back-translate to Greek. </p>
<p>By the way, Erasmus is also on record stating he touched up the latin here and there, too. </p></div>		</li>
