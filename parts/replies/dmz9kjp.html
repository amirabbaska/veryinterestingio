			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but it's more equivalent to using a nic patch to quit. Not enjoyable but it can help someone get over nic withdrawal. However as a smoking cessation method, it wouldn't do as well as a flavored liquid since smokers ironically crave the flavor of a cigarette, not just the physical act of lighting up, holding it, tasting, inhaling, etc. </p>
<p>I use very low (1.5 to 3mg) juice as I don't like nicotine much, but the flavors are genuinely enjoyable and it cuts down on snacking as it's kind of a treat that satisfies a lot of hunger cravings. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's used in a lot of buttery, caramel, and cream flavors like custards. Most manufacturers have gone on a witch hunt to make sure they aren't using it and you can be reasonably sure any over the counter juice will be fine but it's always best to go with a company that tests and reports their findings. </p>
<p>There haven't been any cases of popcorn lung in vapers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's unregulated at the moment so it's kind of an honor system. There have been an increase in 3rd party testing in laboratories and some juice makers pay to have their juice tested as well. Not all do this. Generally being safe, transparent about ingredients and testing, are all good for business and help build brands that people trust much like any other consumer good. </p>
<p>An equivalent would be specialty liquors like absinthe, where alcohols dangers are well understood, but the other non alcohol ingredients may have some health impacts of their own. </p></div>		</li>
