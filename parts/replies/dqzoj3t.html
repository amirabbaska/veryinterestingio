<p>Edit: So apparently Mythbusters says no. I don’t drink, so I wouldn’t know, but just something I saw on an episode of Good Eats once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can, but once you account for time and the cost of a new filter you might as well just buy decent vodka, it's not <em>that</em> pricey!</p>
<p>Edit: jeez a lot of you guys live near some fairly overpriced vodka! We get taxed on it in the UK but it's still one of the most efficient ways of getting leathered</p></div>		</li>

<p>Grind up some charcoal into a fine powder, pack it tightly between coffee filters, layer said charcoal/filter a few times in a cylinder.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They tested that in a Mythbusters episode. They called in an expert to do a blind testing, he drank from eight different glasses, IIRC. One was a good vodka, one was unfiltered cheap vodka, the others were cheap vodka filtered successive times. </p>
<p>He could tell exactly which was which. Not even when you filter it six times will cheap vodka taste like good vodka. It will improve, but will never be like a good vodka.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With alcohol it is about distillation... not running it over an actual filter.
An actual filter would only have an actual benefit is it is really, really bad quality booze, or possibly when using activated carbon... though that would only filter a certain impurities and not the main ones you want to get out (methanol being the main one)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a thin connection at best considering we still aren’t sure what causes hangovers. Also, that would mean vodka and gin would always give you less of a hangover than whisky which is defined by the congeners and that’s just not true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their called congeners. Byproducts of the distillates and number in the hundreds of types. They provide flavors, aromas, and mouth feel. Some are considered dangerous (fusel oils) while others are left in the final mix like when making more flavorful products like whiskey or rum. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One key impurity would be Methanol. There are many types of alcohol, the one we want is Ethanol. So the more and better you destill the liquid, the closer you usually get to only having ethanol alcohol in it. The key factor during destillation is temperature, as every type alcohol has a different boiling point, so the more precise the temperature is being kept and depending how often the process is repeated, other types of alcohol are being filtered out (they vaporate). </p>
<p>Methanol is really dangerous in larger concentrations, but a tiny fraction of it remains in virtually every alcoholic beverage. The higher the amount is (without reaching a concentration that makes you go blind or die), the worse your hangover will get the next morning. Since cheaper alcohol is being produced while keeping production cost as low as possible, it is not being filtrated/destilled five times but perhaps just once, hence more methanol in your liqour. Some liqours actually contain more methanol &quot;naturally&quot;, Tequilla for example. That's one reason why many people have a greater hangover from Tequilla than, say, high-end Vodka.</p>
<p>But this is only one factor, there are many other substances that can make it more difficult for your body to filter out the alcohol – aroma and spices for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the main factor that causes a hangover is dehydration. </p>
<p>People think they get worse hangovers with cheap alcohol because they think they get worse hangovers with cheap alcohol. </p>
<p>In reality, whether cheap or expensive, the alcohol in tequila, vodka, rum, and whiskey is all the exact same chemical.</p>
<p>Sugar may cause more issues depending on water content of the drink since your body is going to have to use some water to digest the sugar, but as far as a bottle of Tavarsky vs a bottle of Kettle One, the only difference is in your head, mainly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's true but when people say it's filtered more they aren't referring to filtering in the sense of running it through a Brita. When Alcohol is distilled the distiller is trying to remove impurities referred to as congeners which boil off at different temperatures than the ethyl alcohol they want and also are partially responsible for the severity of your hangover. What ends up being bottled is actually only part of the product of the distillation there is a portion before and after that is done away with because it contains these congeners. Cheaper liqour is distilled fewer times to keep production costs low which results in more congeners in the liquor. </p></div>		</li>
