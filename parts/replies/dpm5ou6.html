			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope you understand photography, because it's the only way I have to try to explain it.</p>
<p>Imagine NMR is a picture you are taking of the protons for 3 seconds. If they stay still, you will get their picture clearly. When you have equilibrium, where A is converting to B and B to A, it is in equilibrium because both species are interconverting at the same speed, so the concentration doesn’t change (but both of them are actively changing). But the A specie can convert to B after a few milliseconds, return to A after a few more ms, and in a 3 second period can be A and B many times.</p>
<p>So when you take a picture of a person physically changing position between 2 places many times during the picture, you don’t see a clear picture of the person in both position, but a blurred trail between those two positions. In NMR happens something similar (again, I’m talking about 1H-NMR, not MRI). If a proton of A appears at 3 ppm, and the same proton in B appear at 4 ppm, you won’t see both signals, but an average one between 3 and 4 ppm. The way to separate them is reducing the temperature, so the speed decreases and A spends most of those 3-4 seconds as A without changing into B, and vice versa. There is a specific temperature (coalescence temperature) where the average signal separates into both signals (A and B) and it can be used to get information about the equilibrium process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many chemicals are in a state called &quot;chemical equilibrium&quot; which is the state with the lowest free energy. This is often not actually a pure compound, but instead a mixture where some compounds are the &quot;product&quot; of a reaction and some are the &quot;reactants.&quot; What the other commenter is saying is that it doesn't take long for a pure chemical to go into equilibrium, and so it's essentially impossible to get a pure NMR spectrum for some chemicals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. That's way slower than I was expecting. It seems as though with most quantum events they occur on the scale of nanoseconds with rare cases of milliseconds for a &quot;slow&quot; event. I didn't know anything occured over such long time scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right? Like <em>absurdly</em> slow. I figured the answer would be something along the lines of &quot;After around twenty femtoseconds, only around 2.3x10^-19 percent of protons are not relaxed.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not so quantum (in it's timescale, with quantum events hppening close to the speed of light, since that is how fast electrons go), it is magnetic mostly.
The exact nature of the chemical environment will dictate the relaxation time, but for quantitative NMR ananlysis (what I am used to) leaving a 12 seconds delay is more than enough. In most cases you can get away with ca 4 secs.</p></div>		</li>
