<p>This. I invest in the stock market through index funds, and since I'm at the beginning of my professional life I have <em>a lot</em> of time (think: 25+ years) where I can wait for the overall stock market to grow (thats the basic assumption that I make). I don't care about HFT unless this trigger some kind of algorithmic Black Friday, but then again humans panic too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, efficient markets dictate that over the medium/long term it won't be possible to make 'irregular' returns, that is, you'd be lucky if you made more than a passive instrument such as an index fund.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a massive loss rate if you aren't a bank. If you have paid the up-front cost of getting the hardware and software to plug in (like any major bank or brokerage has) then the cost of each trade is nothing.</p>
<p>For individuals who pay by the trade, yes it is a great way to lose money. Also because of short-term capital gains/losses. US tax law states that that you can only claim $3,000 in net losses each year. You can carry this forward forever, but if you had a big loss it won't help much.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose in year 1 you lose $100k. But in year 2 you gain $100k. What sucks is that in both years you only get to claim $3000 in losses. So your taxable capital loss in year 1 is -$3000, and you get to pay capital gains tax on $97k in year 2. You won't run out of that carryforward for 34 years.</p>
<p>Between this and transaction costs, day trading is a terrible way to entertain yourself. If you're a business the costs are vastly lower and the tax treatment is different (it's just part of your business operations).</p>
<p>I personally know someone who made lots of money in options for his first two years, paying short-term capital gains tax on them both times. Then he lost nearly all of it in year three. He can deduct the loss on his taxes but it'll take him forty years to do it at $3k per year. He is 72 today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that capital losses in year X can offset capital gains in years X+Y and <em>in addition</em> can offset 3,000$ in regular income or profit in those years. The 3,000$ limit only applied to offsetting regular income or other profits - not capital gains, which it can be deducted from fully until it's gone.</p>
<p>Is that incorrect? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems I'm correct according to Turbotax - <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/investments-and-taxes/capital-gains-and-losses/L7GF1ouP8" target="_blank">https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/investments-and-taxes/capital-gains-and-losses/L7GF1ouP8</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have an overall net capital loss for the year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of that loss against other kinds of income, including your salary and interest income, for example. Any excess net capital loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be deducted against capital gains and against up to $3,000 of other kinds of income.</p>
