<p>Probably not. The actual function and initiation of sleep is not completely understood, and it's more complex than just a quantity of that hormone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. While I'm all for spreading the knowledge of sleep apnea testing in our growing obese population, this is not the first step. Consider sleep apnea testing and see your doctor to figure out the other likely culprits. See a good reply below from u/davidhumerful</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are some people’s sleep buckets significantly deeper than others?</p>
<p>I have horrible insomnia, all I’ll want to do is close my eyes and sleep but I literally cannot close my eyes- they want to be open. When I finally do get to sleep though, I’m dead. I cannot hear/feel anything whatsoever (alarms, a punch, being dragged out of bed even won’t wake me up immediately like i feel it would for most anyone else). If it’s a weekend where I don’t have to set an alarm (okay- 15 alarms with snooze enabled), and I was able to go to bed at a reasonable time for once (1-2 AM), I somehow still find myself waking up at 4,5,6 or even 7 PM! And I’m still EXTREMELY exhausted and can/want to fall back asleep within a half hour and sleep for the rest of the night into the late morning. </p>
<p>I’m always sleepy.. it’s a problem that people don’t seem to understand. I’m not just tired occasionally- I’m constantly exhausted even when my insomnia takes a minor break. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! My doctor has tried many different things for me and they all either do nothing at all, or the worst possible side effects that could result from the meds happen. </p>
<p>And it doesn’t help my being near dead while asleep either lol sleep meds make me even harder to wake up and I’m a zombie for the entirety of the day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been trying to find where to start for about two years now..I have severe PTSD, severe anxiety, ADHD and a bit of depression mixed in... the anxiety and depression stem from the PTSD. I just don’t know WHERE to start or HOW to start finding the appropriate route to take (do I talk to a counselor because talking is all that helps PTSD? Or do I need a psychiatrist or psychologist and what kind of therapy (cognitive, behavioral, etc.) do I need? </p>
<p>It’s a bit discouraging just trying to find the starting point when there are multiple paths and you have to decide which one is the best for you with just the definitions of what different therapies are while all saying ‘helps people who suffer from PTSD, anxiety and depression’.</p>
<p>If anyone out there who either has experience from being a patient or being in the field- I will gladly listen to any and all advice you may have for me in how to go about getting the proper help relating to what I’m struggling from. </p></div>		</li>
