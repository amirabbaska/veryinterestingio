<p>directors have a lot of control over the &quot;feel&quot; of a movie</p>

<p>So, if I am feeling myself in the battle, it's Spielberg; feeling sad for Captain, it's Hanks; and should thank Robert for creating these characters and situations. (Saving Private Ryan)</p>
<p>Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feeling yourself in the battle also has to do with the cinematographer (Janusz Kaminski), who decides where to put the camera in each shot and what camera settings to use, and the editor (Michael Kahn), who decides which shots to splice together to turn dozens of takes into one continuous film, alongside many other people like the sound mixing team and set designers.</p>
<p>So the whole thing is a team effort.  For that opening beach battle, the gritty, almost slow-motion filming?  Cinematographer.  The back-and-forth cuts of soldiers getting slaughtered?  Editor.  The dark humor (e.g. the bullet bouncing off that one guy's helmet)?  Writer.  The pain you see on Captain Miller's face as he orders his guys to certain death?  Actor.</p>
<p>The thing about directing is that there's not any one specific thing to point to that you can say &quot;that was the director doing a good/bad thing&quot;.  But the whole team effort mentioned above gets coordinated and managed by the director.  So you can tell a good or bad director based on how well the team effort seems to be put together.  In <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> all the various elements come together seamlessly to create an amazing battle scene, so you can say that Spielberg did a great job as director.<br />
By contrast, the battle scenes in the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels feel disjointed and clunky, as if the editor and the cinematographer had different ideas on what a scene was supposed to show.  This lack of coordination points to a bad directing job by George Lucas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very easy to understand director's job using &quot;Captain of the Ship&quot; analogy. But whenever evaluating individual work, things mess up for me. Thanks for explaining, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An example of a good editor/director combo is, incidentally enough, in Rogue One. In the final battle, there's a shot when they're landing that sets up the planet gate, the tower, the landing pad and a general feel of the geography of the battle. Later on during the battle the audience knows exactly what's happening and where, where each character is and what their individual missions are. You never feel lost or overwhelmed like in many other battle movies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I would consider is watching what are generally thought of as truly exceptional films, and then perhaps reading about them.  I have picked up a lot about what I feel makes  a good film.  Watch good non-US films as much as US films.  Frankly, a film with subtitles and unusual settings, it somehow gives me focus on the acting, the camera work, the lighting.  Enjoy building your taste, but challenge yourself regularly.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For Spielberg, think of Super 8, in the minute before the train crash. The action is in the dialog, but that is really just background noise while the camera slowly zooms on the one kid who is watching the train, which the viewer can't see. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well acted - a really good actor can communicate a character's thoughts, personality and emotions with very little. The way their voice trembles when they say &quot;I love you.&quot; The way they stand when in the background of a shot. The way their eyes seem to flare with rage when the villian is talking and they're not. All little details that can make a big different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good example of this is Nerdwritter1's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kSGkGKwp9U" target="_blank">video about Anthony Hopkins in WestWorld</a>.</p>
<p>In general u/iAmDumber, if you're interested in that subject, I'd recommend you watch youtube channels like Nerdwritter1, Every frame a Painting, Now You See It, Channel Criswell. There are tons of other but those are the one I like. Especially Every Frame a Painting.</p></div>		</li>

Every Frame a Painting is where it all started. I can't place any other channel to even a distant second to Tony's videos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cinematography and shot composition is an art form unto itself, and you can communicate a <strong>lot</strong> of relationships between things (or lackthereof) just by where the camera is sitting.</p>
<p>For example, verticle angles. Is the camera (and thus, the audience) looking up at someone? Are they looking down at them? Dead on? All 3 can create different feelings of power relationships. Then you get characters <em>into</em> those positions and it creates even more dynamcs, you can tell who is and is not in charge of a situation just by where and how they're in the frame. Then throw in some &quot;negative space&quot; to create relationships. Are two characters facing each other, but far apart? They don't like each other. Are they facing each other, with less room in between but some breathing room on the sides? They <em>do</em> like each other. And then there's zoom. Are we close up? Are we <em>extremely</em> close up? That's personal, intimate even. Are we back, revealing more empty space? Then we're kinda lonely, isolated.</p>
<p>All of this stuff should be in sync with what the director and script are trying to communicate. If the framing and whatnot is REALLY GOOD, you should be able to tell people's roles and the basic plot <em>from just that alone</em>.</p>
<p>And that's just for very basic pose framing and posing. Start throwing props and scenery in there and <em>lordy</em> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point.</p>
<p>I'll be objective here. Does the director just ask the cinematographer that he wants to show intimacy with the character or directly orders him to just zoom in. &quot;I know what I am doing&quot; style..?</p></div>		</li>
