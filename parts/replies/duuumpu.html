			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. This is exactly how you grow pot indoors. You program your lights to make the plant do what you want. Generally there's a vegetative stage (long light cycles simulating summer) where you encourage the plant to grow big and robust. Then there's a flowering stage where you encourage it to bud (shorter light cycles simulating autumn). The actual season outside doesn't matter at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also how &quot;Easter&quot; and &quot;Christmas&quot; cacti are made. The blooming cycle is determined and, working backwards, the cacti are &quot;forced&quot; into flowering at the right time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true for photoperiod strains of pot(indica and sativas).</p>
<p>There are also strains with the scientific name 'Cannabis ruderalis'. Ruderalis plants flower based on how old they are, not the light cycle.</p>
<p>You can breed plants from the ruderalis species with the indica/sativa species to make strains that flower based on age instead of light cycle. </p>
<p>This is what autoflower strains of cannabis are - a strain of weed bred with a ruderalis plant to get the time based flowering trait, but all the other traits of the photoperiod strain.</p>
<p>I grow my Autoflowering cannabis under 24/7 light. Last plant took a while and was 85 days from germing the seed to harvest. 212 grams dried.</p>
<p>Certain other types of plants can also flower independent of the light cycle, I'm pretty sure peppers will flower with atleast 12 hours of light as well, they can take 18 hours without issues I believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the plant they can actually get 'stressed' and die. I'm an avid bonsai keeper and for the trees you have to put them outside during winter if it's not a tropical plant. The reason for this is that the winter dormancy is actually a 'rest' period for the tree and without it they can end up dying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>some fruit trees require &quot;chill hours&quot; where you play soft music under dim warm lights and read poetry to them OR it was the number of hours a tree requires below 44F to properly flower. As the global climate warms up, we will see a shift in where fruits are grown. Maybe one day, Georgia will no longer be a source for peaches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a super silly question, but I've often wondered if the same applies to indoor cats? I've only ever had indoor cats with very consistent temperature inside for their whole lives but they still grow winter and summer coats! Does it work the same way?</p></div>		</li>
