<p>the sounds birds have trouble making are the sounds that require lips. But they use substitutes that are close enough that we might not notice. For &quot;p&quot; you can substitute &quot;k&quot;. For &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot; you can substitute &quot;Å‹&quot; (the sound at the end of &quot;thing&quot;)</p>

I'm in a linguistics class now and am disappointed that I never thought to apply what I've learned to understanding ventriloquism, but I guess you've done that for me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may be young but you're certainly not dumb. Thanks for putting this together --very helpful. And don't worry about the trolls... Some people truly are cunts, especially on the internet and those who'd take the time to do stuff like that proves it. It may be hard, but ignore. Keep moving and thanks again for sharing your knowledge. </p></div>		</li>
