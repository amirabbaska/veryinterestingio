			<div class="markdown"><p>This is excellent. I love that each element seems to have an indication for what proportion is due to each event.</p>
<p>What's indicated for the elements in dark gray/brown (e.g. Radon)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are elements that are not present in significant enough quantities for us to observe them in any natural sources in the universe. Most of these elements either have no stable isotopes (so even if they ARE produced somewhere, they quickly decay away), or they do not lie on the common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rp-process" target="_blank">synthesis and decay chains</a> that stars progress through when producing new elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>White Dwarfs are stable when left alone, but they cannot be heavier than a certain mass, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit" target="_blank">Chandrasekhar limit</a>. A supernova that creates a stellar remanant will create one of a couple of different object depending on how heavy the remains are. A white dwarf, a neutron star, (some hypothetical stellar remnants like quark stars) or a black hole. Each of these is related to a force that keeps the star from collapsing further (except black holes, which are so massive that no known force can halt collapse). For white dwarfs, that is electron degeneracy pressure, for neutron stars, neutron degeneracy pressure.</p>
<p>Now, here comes the actually answer. When a white dwarf is not alone, but in a binary system with another star, the white dwarf can steal mass from that star. The typical scenario is a white dwarf and another star in the red giant phase. So what can happen is that by stealing mass form another star, the white dwarf becomes heavier than it is &quot;allowed&quot; to be to remain stable. Not quite massive enough to simply collapse into a neutron star, but enough to trigger a new round of nuclear fusion of heavy elements. Because it is so compact (much denser than any steller core in the main sequence), nuclear fusion is much more &quot;efficient&quot; (in normal stars, the collision of atoms only occasionally leads to a fusion event thanks to quantum mechanical uncertainty), and the star can't get rid of the heat quick enough. This triggers a runaway reaction that fuses most of the mass of the star into heavier elements within <strong>seconds</strong>. The sudden release of all this energy rips the star apart entierly.</p>
<p>This event is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova" target="_blank">Supernova Type 1a</a>, and is very important in astronomy for a couple of reasons, most notably as standard candles for distance measurements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mainly from the interstellar medium - there is a <em>lot</em> of primordial hydrogen! There's probably a bit of 'recycled' hydrogren: ejected via stellar winds and stars blowing up at the end of their lifetime, but I don't know the fraction this makes up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thanks. I confirmed from further googling that the amount of H in the universe is in fact decreasing, and this will eventually limit the formation of new stars and contribute to heat death. </p>
<p>I always just pictured heat death in terms of entropy without considering the details, so that's interesting to think about.</p></div>		</li>
