			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say something along these lines. The biggest Federal line-item spending in Alabama (iirc) comes from veterans benefits. Something like 40% of our state was active military or has a parent or spouse who was in service. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're not talking about federal money spent in a state, because that doesn't factor in to the government's calculations either. We're talking about states that take more federal dollars for state services and run a deficit, i.e. Medicaid, infrastructure development, etc. Having an army base in your state, doesn't mean your state spends federal funds to run that base. The DOD spends that money to fund those operations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be very clear, yes this is political. The reasons you have listed are political.</p>
<p>Household incomes in Alabama and Mississippi are low, in part, because of the policy in those states. If you don't take care of your own poor citizens, those citizens stay poor and end up having children that are also poor. If you don't make health care and education cheap and available, your citizens will not be productive.</p>
<p>Florida and Arizona have a lot of senior citizens because they're warm. That is not political. But they also have a lot of senior citizens, in part, because they have low tax rates on investment income - if you're a senior that moved to Florida to retire, you very possibly don't pay any state-level taxes (and so are subsidized by all the younger and poorer people who, in return, have less state money available for health care, education, welfare, etc).</p>
<p>Southern States have more military bases because military base placement has historically been incredibly valuable pork. Oregon doesn't support the troops any less than Alabama.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of the poor in Alabama are on Medicaid which is basically free and education in Alabama is free like every other state.  College is extremely affordable and Alabama has a network of Junior colleges that are even more affordable.</p>

<p>I never said Oregon didnt support the troops.  Military bases are located primarily based on weather, geography and population density.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the poor in Alabama are not eligible for Medicaid. You basically need to have a kid, or you're out of luck. And even then, you need to be very, very poor. That homeless dude you pass on the street is not eligible for Medicaid. Neither is that the family of four with full time, minimum wage jobs. </p>
<p>Alabama spends about $1,500/student/year less on education than the federal average. This report ranks them 39th for K-12, and 49th for post secondary. </p>

<p>I don't know what to say about the military base thing. Just looking at a map tells you it's pork. Bases are in Democratic strongholds (NY and CA), Republican strongholds (former confederate states), and swing states (Ohio, FL). Obviously some are strategic as well (ie: pacific fleet in Hawaii, etc). </p></div>		</li>
