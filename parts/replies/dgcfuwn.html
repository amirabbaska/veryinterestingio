			<div class="markdown"><p>Scarcity means different things in different contexts. For example, the United States could very easily afford to provide every citizen three generous meals a day for free. It has plenty of money and food to do this. Food is 'scarce' in that it's finite, but not 'scarce' as in so restricted a supply that it must be rationed.</p>
<p>Even if we just let people walk into the grocery store and take whatever they wanted (and the government would pay for it), after the initial transition where people gorged because they could, people would probably just go back to getting the things they intended to eat. It's not like people want to eat continually--they get full, eventually, and want to do things other than cook and eat. This would only really work if the government could actually guarantee that the shelves would be stocked (so that people would be able to trust that they could 'always come back later if they needed to'), but it's pretty doable for basic staple food items in the US.</p>
<p>We could probably do the same thing with loads of other products and services. Cell phones and internet connections, for example. Electricity and water could almost certainly be covered by the government, or at least given such a large free ration that it is effectively free for personal use. We already pay for most of people's education, so that's basically covered too. These are all things that are 'scarce', but which could be provided at levels that reasonable people would not want or need to exceed without requiring rationing through price mechanisms. The US could certainly afford universal government-funded health insurance too (hell, we already pay for the Americans who cost the most, health care wise).</p>
<p>There are other things we couldn't give away like that--housing would be a problem, for example. We could surely build enough apartments to give one to everyone, but people don't <em>want</em> to live in assigned housing like that, and aren't all content with a small apartment.</p>
<p>We don't do any of this because we don't want to do it, not because we couldn't do it or because these goods are fundamentally too scarce to distribute approximately evenly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's theory... But basically there should be enough to go around if you don't have a small minority holding vast amounts of wealth and means of production. Capitalism creates artificial scarcity by unequal distribution of resources. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Who will buy the pipes? Or, sorry, who will manufacture pipes? And why?</p>
<p>Who will mine the iron for making the pipes? And why?</p>
<p>How do you get all this organized? How do you select who tells everybody what they need to do? Some title passed down from parents to the first male child? A title you select by voting? I don't get this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory you'd be assigned to do something according to your ability. (Like going to a job interview and competing with others for the best jobs) You'd do it for the greater good and to improve the lives of everyone. So you still indirectly benefit. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So, if there is a competition, there will still be long hours, and very stressful at work, just like today.</p>
<p>And everyone will pretty much end up with the same type of jobs they have today.</p>
<p>Except the ones who are assigned to push a carriage 200 meters below ground for 10 hours. They will probably think it is unfair, and that it seems boring. And since &quot;work is voluntary&quot; they will probably choose to do in some other day. There are free concerts to go to today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically nobody does much of anything.  I'm not cleaning toilets for the good of other people.  Sure as hell won't be mining for ore either.  I will play golf and other fun activities.  None of which help the greater good.  </p>
<p>With human nature it would take a colossal change in human behavior to make it work.  Basically we all need to forget about our dreams and own selfs and become drones.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assigned a job? Sounds like Futurama haha.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, Who decides what my ability is and what job it is best suited to? How is this ability fostered or is that decided for me too? And if I don't agree what happens?</p>
<p>Sounds a lot like life in North Korea. No thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if food becomes post-scarcity via automation, what about other essential jobs?  How is it decided who will becomes doctors or other medical providers for instance?  There's no way to make the need for health care go away, even in post scarcity </p></div>		</li>
