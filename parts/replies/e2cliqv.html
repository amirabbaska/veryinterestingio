			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, the are very few parts in comparison. Less parts=fewer ways for it to break and lower cost. The low pressure side of a refrigerator's sealed system is created by using a capillary tube, so only a little can get through at a time, and having the compressor on the other end of the low pressure side, sucking it down to a vacuum. Super easy, and the only ways it breaks is if the compressor fails or a hole is formed somewhere. Even a restriction can be traced back to one of these 2 causing it.</p>
<p>Oh, and now that all new systems are moving to r600, they are incredibly environmentally safe. Still blows my mind to know that a 30 cu ft fridge is being cooled by the amount of butane in a disposable lighter. </p></div>		</li>
