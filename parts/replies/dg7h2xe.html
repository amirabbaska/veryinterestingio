			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you run a lap in 20 minutes.  So your speed is 20 minutes per lap.  You want the final average to be double your first lap speed, right? So the final average needs to be twice as fast: 10 minutes per lap.  That's the same as 20 minutes for 2 laps.</p>
<p>In this scenario, <strong>it already took you 20 minutes to run the first lap</strong>.  But you need to do 2 laps in 20 minutes to meet your end goal.  Which means that you have <strong>zero</strong> minutes left to do the last lap.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speed = distance / time. That's the definition of speed. </p>
<p>It will always give you the average speed over that time, whatever time or distance it is you are measuring. </p>
<p>So if you get an average speed for the first lap, then you want to get double that average speed for two laps, you do the same calculation twice.</p>
<p>The second time, your overall distance will be twice as much (because you did two laps). If you want the average speed to also be twice as much, the overall time has to stay the same. For it to be the same time, you have to do the second lap in zero time! That means for THAT LAP, the speed has to be infinite. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speed, or velocity, incorporates time innately by definition.</p>
<p>As others have described, the main disconnect here is between two ways of looking at average speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take two discrete, separate values for speed and treat this as a set of values.  Find the average of those values.  This is what you did.</li>
<li>Find the average speed for the journey overall.</li>
</ul>
<p>All you really need to do in order to see why these don't work together is to ignore the two laps and imagine this as an overall journey.  No matter what you did speeding up and slowing down to get from Chicago to Los Angeles, the only thing that matters for AVERAGE SPEED for the entire journey is the distance of the overall journey and the time the journey took.  Work backwards from this view, or understanding, rather than forward with the concept of laps and lap times or speeds.</p>
<p>The problem statement is asking for the latter.  &quot;Average speed of the two laps&quot; = overall journey.  They COULD have said &quot;the average of the speeds of the laps&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
