			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, although &quot;steam engine&quot; sounds archaic, the technology is <em>very</em> mature and water is a really handy medium for working with heat - safe, clean, free<strong><em>¹</em></strong> ubiquitous, high specific heat capacity, etc. The efficiency of a multi stage turbine is pretty high.</p>
<p>The obvious answer to your question is solar, wind, hydro, etc. But if you mean &quot;generating electricity [from a fusion reactor]&quot;? Not that I know of.</p>
<p><strong><em>¹</em></strong> as in <em>free</em>ly available and, likely, as cheap as such a medium can possibly be second only to air, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The general class of machines that produce work using temperature differentials is termed 'heat engines', and we have a number of variations on the design.  Jet turbines, steam turbines, your car's piston engine, these are all heat engines.  Their maximum possible efficiency is well below 100%, and is given by the Carnot Limit, which is (1 - (sourcetemp / sinktemp)), using absolute temperatures of the heat source and wherever the heat is going.  A coal boiler might reach ~600 kelvin, with the ambient air at ~300 kelvin, giving a maximum-physically-possible efficiency for a heat engine of 50%. Then after that, you need to turn that mechanical energy into electricity;  While this has its own losses due to real-world considerations of design and manufacturing, its theoretical best is more like 100%, and large coal plants do achieve 95-99% on this stage.</p>
<p>To increase efficiency, you can scale and design and build and optimize, within your theoretical limits;  Using better materials, insulating better, optimizing engine design/timing/pistons/turbineblades (depending on what design you're using), but that's still limited to a certain Carnot efficiency.</p>
<p>Some types of heat engines work at higher efficiency than others at certain scales &amp; conditions;  More importantly, though, you have some ability to trade off mass per power (and portability) for efficiency.  This is why turbines are used at high altitude rather than piston engines, why some military vehicles have both types of engines with the capability to switch between them, and why Sterling engines never really took off.</p>
<p>To increase your Carnot efficiency, you can raise the temperature of the material (often associated with increased pressures you need to deal with and different material science requirements).  A combustion cycle running at 1000K is has fewer limits in efficiency than one running at 500K.  One of the ways to do this is switching from water to something else, since high temperature steam is an aggressively corrosive substance.  Supercritical CO2 looks to be the best option for an alternative coolant, and designs are coming out of the lab and into the testing phase now.  Molten fluoride &amp; sodium salts, and lead, seem to be favored for various facets of fission reactor design, I think as an intermediate (with favorable neutron-moderating/absorption characteristics) between a phase change H2O or CO2 external loop and the internal heat source.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be pedantic, the flame in the boiler itself can exceed 2000K, whilst the steam can only gett to 800K or so (USCS). Limits of materials (pressure rating, design, corrosion etc) are what prevent the steam from running hotter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In software when things start to look like this it tends to be a result of tweak and refine to ‘just about work’ but progress takes forever to enhance and doesn’t scale because one modification requires changes to absolutely everything.  Cant help feel this project will encounter the same issues whereby a radically simpler modular design like those homemade polywells will prove more scalable but just a speculative redditor armchair hunch.
Its an absolutely incredible bit of engineering they’re doing, can’t wait to see what they achieve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even just the cost of the superconductors is a major drawback at this point. I know that for many particle accelerators like the one I work at, and especially ones like the LHC, liquid nitrogen at temperatures of 77K isn’t cold enough, and they need to use liquid helium, which is 4K. Which definitely isn’t cheap. So superconductors that work at higher temperatures would help greatly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you cool down a conductor, the colder it gets, the lower its resistance. For some materials, it is then possible to get the resistance to zero, meaning that no electrical energy is converted to heat and wasted. The critical temperature for superconductors varies for each material, but is extremely cold. So the superconductors used will only work at low enough temperatures. Liquid nitrogen is still too warm at 77K, so it will not get the resistance below zero, making it ineffective.
Of course, you can use superconductors with liquid nitrogen, but the ones powerful enough for nuclear fusion reactors and particle accelerators need something much colder, and at 4K, liquid helium is the best choice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a material to be in a superconducting state you need it to be under two thresholds: a temperature, and a magnetic field strength. In materials that achieve superconductivity at high temperatures (liquid nitrogen) that superconductivity breaks down around strong magnetic fields. So they are unsuitable as cabling for the electromagnets of fusion reactors (or particle accelerators)</p>
<p>I admit it: there exist some superconductors which allow both high temperatures and magnetic fields. They tend to only work in very limited ranges of temperature and magnetic field though, which makes them unstable - and therefore unsuitable for conducting high currents. Finally, the only such materials we know of are &quot;cuprate materials [which] are brittle ceramics which are expensive to manufacture and not easily turned into wires or other useful shapes&quot; (lifted that sentence from Wikipedia).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going forward, that will definitely be a priority, considering that helium is a non-renewable resource, but for now, while we still use it in balloons for parties, the supply is large enough that we can use it cheaply. And don’t get me wrong, getting helium to close to absolute zero is not cheap, but getting literally tonnes of high temperature superconductors instead of tonnes of copper and litres of liquid helium would cost much more.
Considering that the biggest source of nuclear fusion in our solar system creates helium as a product, maybe we won’t have a scarcity of helium in the future?</p></div>		</li>
