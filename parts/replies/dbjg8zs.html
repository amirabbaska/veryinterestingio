			<div class="markdown"><p>Most films shot on digital between 2000 and 2015 or so were only ever recorded at 1080p, so any 4k masters of those movies are going to look significantly worse than 4k versions of things shot on film before the explosion of digital cinema or after shooting in native 4k became a more common practice. The same thing will happen to 4k media once the next resolution standard comes out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the process of going from the 2k master to a 1080p Blu-ray they compress the file a ton.</p>
<p>The UHD Blu-ray spec allows a lot more data storage, so you can use a better color space, and higher bitrates. </p>
<p>I'm sure there will be re-releases of movies shot in 2k for a 4k Blu-ray, and they will probably end up looking better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that, while II/III were filmed that way, I wasn't. Sony was pressured to accelerate its invention of HD digital cameras for the filming of II, but I was too early.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true; Episode 1 was still shot on Arriflex. Episode II was shot on Panavision HD-900F which was one of the first digital cinema cameras. It featured a 2/3&quot; CCD sensor, which is absolutely crazy by today's standards...</p>
<p>George Lucas said that Episode II would be the first major motion picture to be filmed 100% digitally, but a french film actually managed it first.</p>
<p>I've gotten the impression George Lucas is a bit too much of a nerd for the latest and greatest, which has ended up with him using technology that wasn't quite ready for some of his films just because he wanted to use the newest stuff. That being said, would technology in digital cinema cameras and <del>special effects</del>/VFX have progressed as dramatically if someone like him wasn't driving the industry forward?</p>
<p>Edit: special effects was the wrong term</p></div>		</li>

<p>The older films were higher quality releases. In every sense of the word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a guy who just digitized his own home movies, this is the correct answer. </p>
<p>Actual film has quite a bit of information on it, 20 megapixels sounds like a reasonably number. </p>
<p>The way we talked about in physics way back in the day is talking about digital vs analog scales. You obviously could measure someones weight down to arbitrarily small measurements, but it would get expensive to get a digital scale that can do that. But say objectively, you weigh 170.55 lbs. A digital scale will probably only read, 170, or maybe 170.5. But on an analog scale an eagle eyed observer will see they are a little more than 1/4 between 170 and 172. Which puts you at a whole range of possible outcomes, but in someways it is a more precise measurement. </p>
<p>One way of thinking about it is imagine a single pixel. Digitally this is unambiguous, this pixel <em>is</em> a certain color. In the analog approach, there are no pixels. You can do some math and find the number of pixels <em>if</em> you digitized it attempting to keep it lossless. But you are removed from clean digital distinctions. </p></div>		</li>
