			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, actual neurons. The little guys in your guy known as your gut flora send signals to tell you what to eat. In short, we think that we want a certain food, but it's actually the civilization living inside us that dictates our food cravings for the most part. </p>
<p>Learning this helped me change my diet because I realized I was actually a zombie of sorts and so I was able to gain control of what I ate, essentially by telling my gut to fuck off and do what I say. After a few weeks of no sugar or refined carbs, that nausea that OP was talking about went away when I would get hungry. I still get hungry but I don't crash or NEED to eat immediately. It's just a sensation that isn't positive or negative, and sometimes feels good depending on the context, like if I'm exercising.</p></div>		</li>
