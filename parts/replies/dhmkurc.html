			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a precision on the rules of friction to beter understand. The amount of friction between two objects will depend of 3 things: the nature of the two surfaces that are in contact, the normal force (which is the force that the two objects are pushed against each other) and whether the two objects are moving realtive to each other. </p>
<p>The friction will be substantially higher if the two objects are static and that's why some creaking can get pretty loud. As soon as the static friction can no longer hold two objects together, they start moving and they'll suddenly stop when they come to a rest (kind of like the kick it gives in your car when you slam on the brakes really hard until you come to a stop)</p></div>		</li>
