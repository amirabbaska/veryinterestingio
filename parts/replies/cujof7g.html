			<p>I'm pretty sure they're privately held companies. But they are known to buy small amounts of stuck in large public companies and cause problems at the general shareholders meetings...

			<p>I know that induction sensing is what those actually are.

With him came out a young guy with colorful shirt, looking obviously chimpira.

			<p>There's one small difference: mafia in western countries are usually ultimately taken down by catching someone low down and coercing them to testify against people higher up. That doesn't work against the yakuza. Whenever the authorities catch someone actually committing a crime the organization will forswear any connection to that person and the person will say that they were acting independently.<br><br>It's a cultural difference which makes things harder to prosecute.</p>		</li>

			<p>I have a BA in English and an MS in Communication. I don't think the degrees as intrinsically useless in terms of helping a person become a more literate and educated individual. And I loved my coursework.<br><br>However, I think they are next to useless for getting a decent job, which is the most important thing for something you are paying thousands of dollars for. And that the communication skills needed in most business jobs can be handled with a few classes, not an entire degree program focusing on shakespearean prose and old english.<br><br>Now, there are roles where the primary function involves written or verbal communication. Marketing, public relations, etc. But there are far less of these jobs than there are qualified graduates for them.<br><br>I did multiple internships, had good grades, and had part-time experience. I still couldn't find a decent, full-time job a few years out of school. I would fight to get in the final round of interviews. My peers all had degrees and great experience as well. And the prize at the end was a $30k a year marketing manager job where you would be over-worked and under-appreciated.<br><br>And those are the top-cut jobs. I'm not even mentioning all of the English majors I know that are still working at starbucks and taking on <em>another</em> unpaid internship, hoping it will get them somewhere some day.<br><br>After struggling, I decided to get another degree in IT. I just got my first good full-time job offer from it, but I've also had way more interviews and for way better paying positions after getting this degree and moving into this field.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Welp. I guess it comes down to what you want to do. I have absolutely no interest in pursuing a degree simply because of the dollar amount attached to whatever that could come afterwards. I've chosen to pursue what I love, and I already have a multitude of (paying) opportunities in which to explore that love. The only peers I know of who have 'good' jobs post-degree (regardless of the degree) are in real estate &amp; marketing.

			<p>Hey, I'm glad it's working out for you. But it's much easier to say that you don't care about career opportunities and pay BEFORE your student loan payments are due and you are actually out there trying to get a full-time job. I said the exact same thing. Trust me. At 21, I couldn't imagine ever needing more than $15/hour as long as I was working at say a publishing house. In my late 20s, $15/hour sounds more like poverty wages.<br><br>I also came to realize that the related career opportunities weren't actually all that appealing anyway. There are a decent amount of PR jobs... but you are writing corny press releases for corny products. Or news articles about what some dumb student athlete did. Not writing reports on the schools of literary criticism or ancient greek literature.<br><br>The thing is too, that Creative writing is free and reading Chaucer is free. You can have that be a part of your life without college.<br><br>Maybe you're infinitely more talented than me, and that's great, and you'll probably do great. But I do think, as someone who had a very good GPA and has a relevant Master's degree, I can speak to the fact that it is not worth it to major in English. Ultimately, going to college, instead of just reading books at the library, is a financial investment.</p>		</li>

			<p>My guess is that you probably don't work in public relations, marketing, or organizational communication (the areas comm grads work in), or really understand those fields, so I wouldn't say you are a good authority on hiring in those fields. My Master's helped me get more interviews that some of my peers with only a related bachelor's degree. It was mentioned as a positive during most interviews I've had for those types of jobs.<br><br>It's just that it's a brutal race among many people for a small number of shit-paying positions.<br><br>The field is so over-saturated that a Master's isn't viewed as &quot;we have to pay this person more&quot; or even as something special. Rather, it's viewed as &quot;almost half of our applicants have Master's, so we can easily set that as the standard.&quot; Especially  non-profits, universities, other educational institutions, and some bigger companies; all of those tend to have a hard-on for advanced degrees. <br><br>My only point was that I know the value of &quot;communication&quot; to the corporate world, and I understand the job market demand for it. I freely admit that the Master's was useless, but it was actually less useless than my undergrad in English. I couldn't even get out of retail with my BA in English. My friends with only a BA still can't get out of retail. Then I couldn't get more than a $20/hour part-time marketing job with my Master's. <br><br>But both fucking sucked, which is why I'm warning people against majoring in any of those majors.<br><br>Finally, as I said in my post, I went back and got a second bachelor's in Information Technology (I only had to do courses in that major), and I don't even list the master's on my resume anymore. And I have so far had a ton more success and opportunities with that degree. But I could have gotten to where I am for a lot less money if I just picked the right major the first time.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah. It's the combination of intense xenophobia and extremely strong patriarchal societal norms. Men are to be treated with respect, which cancels out the xenophobia to some degree. But women are often treated as barely more than sex objects, which just exacerbates the xenophobia.<br><br>Japanese women are starting to rebel against this by not accepting the traditional Japanese housewife role. Though that's having the rather terrible effect of radically reducing the birth rate in Japan. Did you know they sell more adult diapers than baby diapers, there?

			<p>No we aren't.  I think the difference comes down to how dating goes.  A lot of Japanese guys don't seem to be interested in relationships with foreign girls and this might cross over into other areas.  On the other hand a lot of Japanese girls like foreign men, at least for a little bit.  There are a lot of dance clubs that will not let in foreigners (men or women).  <br><br>Racism is also pretty prevalent in other areas, but unlikely to be felt until you have been here a while and are working on deepening your relationships in your community.  One of the big problems that people have is that a lot of Japanese businesses that will consider hiring you will do so because they perceive you (rightly so) as weak.  You don't know your rights here and you don't know where to go if you need help.<br><br>I've been here a long time now and if you are just staying for a year or two then you'll probably have a good time, but most (not all) of the people I know who have been here long term are not very happy.  Opportunities are very restricted, even if you speak Japanese.  <br><br>Trying to start your own business if you aren't married to a Japanese partner is damn near impossible.  You used to be able to do your 10 years, get permanent residence, and then be good to go.  However, a few years back they made some stealth changes to the law that make it much harder to get now.  Your other options are to put up about $50,000 US and offer full time employment to two Japanese citizens (investor visa) or get Japanese citizenship (no dual citizenship allowed).  So if you want to do something like start your own English school you're probably going to be out of luck.<br><br>The advice I give to young people that are interested in coming is to only plan on doing a year and then leave, or come to do some kind of IT or engineering, something where your job experience will carry over to life outside of Japan.  <br><br>Putting in 10+ years here and then being denied permission to start your own business really sucks, and if you've been teaching English the whole time, the prospect of going home to a tough job market is very daunting.</p>		</li>

You will see them dressed relaxed, but it's still stylish shoes/jeans/shirt, etc. And their hair is perfect --male or female.<br><br>As a woman I had to learn that I could show off my legs, but I had to cover up my chest and usually wear sleeves (unless I was in a beach area or wearing a classy dress with thin straps --even then I'd have a coverup). <br><br>I had no problem since I'm a dress kinda girl, but man do Americans stick out wearing relaxed jeans and white tennis shoes. They sometimes will refuse service in restauranst/bars/Izakaya because A, you're not really dressed right, and B, they don't know English. But if you're dressed well and speak a little Japanese it will open a lot of doors.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's odd. I wonder if it varies by region. <br><br>In Tokyo, my impression was always that everyone treated a female foreigner like a goddess. I've had people come up to me and ask if they could touch my skin/my hands and arms. Cars would slow down to stare at me in some places etc. <br><br>It was odd, very surreal, but the looks people gave you were some odd mix of fascinated awe and almost intimidated in some cases.<br><br>Maybe it changed. It was some years ago. </p>		</li>

They pretty much loved her over there, but she practically had to flee her employer as it was borderline indentured servitude type situation.

			<p>Yup, had the exact same experience. Majored in linguistics with a minor in Japanese, went over to teach English. Stayed 3 years and left very, very bitter. The first year was great, but after becoming more fluent I started realizing some of the deeper context of how people treated foreigners and women. Sadly, a gaijin will always be a gaijin, JLPT2 fluency or not. The groping on the train certainly didn't help, either. </p>		</li>

			<p>ehhh....i'd say it's the limited career opportunities. I was an expat in korea for awhile and making it big in asia long term is hard....unless your an expat exec or a high indemand artists, your treated as temporary. You get to a point where you need to decide if this life is your life forever...basically become japanese, raise kids there, become a citizen, etc.......for expat employees it's a bit easier to avoid this or transfer out. English teachers not so much.<br><br>After awhile, you get tired of it and start whining like crazy. As far as not being liked....eh...sounds like an excuse.....unless she doesn't have the hots for asian or japanese dudes. That's a real long time deal breaker for many females....the pool of expats is super small, many like asian girls, and usually are on temporary assignments.....if your biological clock is ticking: 24 year old english teachers looking for asian poon aren't gonna cut it.<br><br>The white women with the hots for asian guys I knew.....LOVED IT....many aren't ever leaving.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Well, I'd say she was a full member of the community... She didn't have an English teaching job, she had a &quot;normal&quot; full time job there, worked for some Japanese company, she speaks completely fluent Japanese. It's hard to explain, she's sort of adopted the Japanese speaking manner, tone of voice and everything, even from the accent you can hardly tell it's not her native accent (an actual Japanese person could probably tell, but it's very close). I think all of these make a difference - the more &quot;Japanese&quot; you look, act and sound, the more you'll fit in. She's white so she'll never be seen as actual Japanese, but it seems like she has everything else down.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; I'd say she was a full member of the community...<br><br>Has she tried to start her own business?  Has she ever encountered a situation where she was being treated differently than a Japanese national and dared to question it?  <br><br>I do all those things you mentioned.  Being a part of the community is not about your effort and ability, it's about their willingness to accept you.  I didn't start to run into issues myself until I had been here for about 8 years, and then only when I started trying to break out of the gaijin reservation (start my own business).  It's also important to understand that it doesn't really come from most of the people you interact with in your day to day life.  For the most part it comes from the bureaucracies (government and other businesses). </p>		</li>

			<p>If you want to go work in Japan either have a special skill set that's internationally valuable (IT, Computer stuff, Business, etc.) + Fluent Business level Japanese or go the ALT (English teaching route).<br><br>Here's the catch though, ALT's are bottom of the barrel when it comes to foreigners working at Japan. You get paid like crap, treated like a background cardboard or sometimes tape recorder, and there's basically 0 vertical mobility in terms of career unless you start your own eikaiwa.<br><br>ALT jobs are basically &quot;I want to take a year or two off and stay at Japan while getting paid&quot;.

I can't believe you did not involve the police especially when money is involved. If there wasn't a police report, then there wasn't an accident.<br>You scammed yourself.</p>		</li>

			<p>How did you bargain them down? You have zero leverage... they basically said they would kill you if you didn't pay right? And you took that as a legitimate threat, right? What did you say to convince them to lower the price of your life?...</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, the violence was implied, by their coarse language and demeanor. They never actually said they would beat the crap out of me but they knew I would assume that, I guess, and I did. As for how I bargained it down, I suppose we both knew that I could have battened down the hatches and insisted on having my insurance handle it, which would have been a pain in the ass for them because we both left the scene without any evidence. Or I could have started asking for a receipt from the shop or whatever. Bear in mind, the amount I offered was (and is) a decent chunk of change. I told them I had 90k available and asked if they could let me off with that. I suppose it was risky for them to hit me up for more - otherwise I might have sought someone else's help, like a lawyer or whatever, who would have told me I was being a fucking idiot, and in that case they would have gotten nothing. </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm tired of this nonsense regarding Yakuza, so here is the true truth!<br>I'm an Iraqi who has lived in Dubai, Brazil, Japan and other countries and I've always befriended gangsters in all of these countries.<br>Yakuza is NOT criminal organization in the sense that we see in other countries.<br>Their code of conduct prohibits stealing, selling drugs and hurting people!<br>Their income mainly comes from:<br>1- Getting married to Filipinas and other east Asian girls in order to grant them visas so that they would work in &quot;snack bar&quot;. <br>This is not prostitution and mostly what they do is allow some old guys to touch them and get drunk while the guy pays 500$+. Prostitution is very rare or none existent in Japan.<br>2- Nope, they don't sell drugs. They sell bath-salts, which as you might already know, are designer drugs which are in the grey area of the law.<br>3- They don't really hurt people! I mean I've seen many foreigners beating the shit out of Yakuza members. They are intimidating to Japanese because simply the average Japanese citizen is scared of everything! Nobody talked to me in my city simply because I had a tattoo, which is a sign of being a Yakuza, although I've NEVER hurt anybody!<br>This brings us to their most important source of income: they simply become a part of the board of directors in a big company, once they join a meeting all partners would be so scared of them (for no apparent reason!), and they'd either leave the company or pay a huge amount to the new Yakuza partner in order to sell his shares!<br>There are no weapons in Japan, no homicide, almost no drugs or prostitution.<br>These crimes are mostly done by the tiny foreigners community.</p>		</li>
