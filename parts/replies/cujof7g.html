			<p>Contracts aren't normally legal (at least in the US) if coercion or threats of violence are used to make people sign them, but I get your point.</p>		</li>

			<p>Obviously you can't prove it's been signed under duress...and in fact if you even mentioned such a thing, there would be retaliation.<br><br>You might as well be saying &quot;the Yakuza can't do X because X is illegal&quot;.  Yeah, so what?  They will do it anyway and if you don't want to get hurt, you're probably going to have to go along with it.</p>		</li>

			<p>There was an incident in Japan few years ago where business leaders grouped up to stand up to the Yakuza.<br><br>The government encouraged this and told them to put stickers on their business windows to show that they were business standing up to Yakuza.<br><br>Lot of people got stabbed by Yakuza.<br><br>The stickers were gone quickly thanks to Yakuza.<br><br>Kitakyushu Yakuzas are still very stabbystabby Yakuza.<br><br>Please stay away from Yakuzas particularly at Kitakyushu. <br><br>Yakuza.</p>		</li>

			<p>(potential stupid question alert) Wait, so if Yakuza is an organization that pays taxes and all that, are they a company? And if so... Are they a public company that one could invest in?</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm pretty sure they're privately held companies. But they are known to buy small amounts of stuck in large public companies and cause problems at the general shareholders meetings... This is done by a specialized class of yakuza called <em>sokaiya</em>. There are also yakuza who specialize in liquidating the assets of bankrupt companies, called <em>seiriya</em>. </p>		</li>
