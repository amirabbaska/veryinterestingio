<p>-when I was like two or three, my mom was in the garden doing some garden stuff and I was playing around her. </p>
<p>-Then I came up to her, holding a huge slug and fiddling with it, with it wiggling in my hands. </p>
<p>-My mom screamed</p>
<p>-I panicked too and threw the slug away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read (in a scientific page, if I recall correctly) that cats are afraid of cucumbers <strong>when</strong> they are snuck up on them. Similar when you turn around and there's someone else that wasn't there before, and you jump because you weren't expecting someone to be there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the more likely reason. People who just assume that it is specifically because they think it is a snake are wrong to me. Sorry but I'm pretty sure you don't speak cat and it's definitely not just cucumbers that cause them to freak out when placed behind them sneakily. Literally almost anything will scare almost anything when properly snuck up on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So my cousin used to have meltdowns over any bugs including flies and lady bugs. Even if they just flew kind of by and went away. </p>
<p>To my knowledge my aunt and uncle are fine with them. She was always kind of a dramatic child so maybe someone was spooked once and it stuck ? Does it work like that ? Maybe her baby sitter freaked out at a spider once and it just sky rocketed from there. </p>
<p>If it's so easily ingrained why is it not equally easy to unlearn ? </p></div>		</li>
