			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for saying this.  It's so demotivating sometimes being a military member when both sides are making poor assumptions as to who we are and what we stand for.  No, I'm not a fascist baby killer (heard that quite a few times) and no, I'm not here for you to thank just so you can go home and be proud you &quot;support&quot; a veteran.  As our representation grows smaller every day, people's understanding does as well.  As I tried to explain to my peers who were against the war in Iraq at the time I joined, I didn't join for a President, I didn't join for a party--I joined because I believe in the system we've created and the good will of the American people.  And you bet I will fight back if either of those things are truly ever threatened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>This</em> what I was trying to explain.  But parc120, there are a lot of people who just don't get this.  And it's not only the soldiers on active service.  There are million upon million of discharged veterans who consider that oath to be still in effect and binding, <em>after we left the armed forces.</em>  And those people will fight, if necessary, to defend the Constitution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. When I was in the Army, I didn't know anyone who would ever follow an order to attack civilians. There'd be a mutiny if someone tried. Now as a veteran, if that happened then I'd find some other fellow veterans who also wanted to defend the Constitution and fight for that if it was necessary. There's a lot of civilians with training who would do the same too, and you can take that to the bank.</p></div>		</li>

Doctors confirmed the killing of an 8 year old girl by these monsters. If you have no one in the military who opposed this, why would they oppose shooting at American &quot;terrorists&quot; who will be demonized with the same propaganda before a coup attempt?</p>
<p>In any case the sociopaths in the military who love to kill and murder will all side with an authoritarian, and they will be from combat positions. Most of the dissenters will probably be from non-combat positions. So in the event of a coup, you have hardened killers vs less combat hardened people which isn't a great situation for those fighting against a coup.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Recent Republican leadership has adopted a scorched earth policy regarding politics. They will do anything in their power to win, consequences and country be damned. They refused to work with Obama on anything, and then leveled the charge that he was a do nothing president.</p>
<p>McConnell filibustering his own bill once he found out Democrats liked it was a great example. This &quot;win at all costs&quot; mentality is unprecedented in our Congress.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot of confusion among people about what exactly an executive order is, or what it can do. The President is the head of the Executive Branch, which is charged with enforcing the laws of the United States, but also to do so within the confines of his oath of office, which requires him to preserve and defend the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>There are tons and tons of things that are part of the Executive Branch, to the point that it's easier to list what's <em>not</em>. The Judicial Branch has the SCOTUS, the Circuit Courts of Appeals and Federal District Courts, as well as several lesser known courts of limited jurisdiction like US Tax Court and Bankruptcy Court (some of which are actually Article I courts, which gets confusing, but they're budgeted as part of the federal judiciary); as well as the Office of Probation and Pretrial Services, the US Sentencing Commission.</p>
<p>The Legislative Branch has the CBO and GAO, the Government Publishing Office, the Library of Congress, and the US Capitol Police.</p>
<p>Practically every other federal agency you can imagine (I left off a few, but not many) is part of the Executive Branch. Postal Service? Check. Military? Check. FBI CIA DEA BATF&amp;E USMS NSA NGA DSS USSS USPP DIA USBTA and USFS? All of those, yes, except the USBTA, which I made up. (US Bait and Tackle Administration, anyone?) Add to that NASA, NOAA, the IRS, the Treasury and Bureau of Printing and Engraving, the Office of Personnel Management, the Smithsonian, the EPA, the Federal Reserve Bank (it's complicated, potential nitpickers! Don't bog down on this one!), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the GSA, Social Security, the SBA, the FDIC, and, fuck it, Amtrak.</p>
<p>And there will be likely 100 more that I'm forgetting.</p>
<p>The President runs all those things. They are all part of the Executive Branch. Assuming it does not violate federal law (either by being illegal or unlawful by the authorizing legislation), and assuming there's budget for it somewhere, he can call up any of those people and ask them to do basically anything. He can direct policy for those departments, broadly speaking and within those limits.</p>
<p>Those are executive orders. What we think of and refer to as Executive Orders are when the President does that in writing. <strong>There is no question that the President has the authority to issue executive orders.</strong> It is literally his job. If he can do it in the person, if he can do it on the phone, if he can do it in a box with a fox, then he can do it in writing. Article II of the Constitution vests the Executive power of the United States in the Office of the President. This is the notion of the &quot;Unitary Executive&quot;&mdash; that the President has the power to control the entire Executive branch.</p>
<p>The question is how <em>strongly unitary</em> the Executive should be, and how much authority the Congress has to interfere with his decision making. Guess who thinks the Executive should be weakly unitary? Congress? Guess why. It would give them more power. Guess where the bitching about Executive Orders always starts. Congressmen spewing talking points about how the President is making himself a dictator. People need to stop taking that as literal concern and start viewing it as the inter-branch power play that it is.</p>
<p>This is not new. The Democratic-Republicans complained about it during the Washington administration. It flared up under Nixon, and was also a common talking point during George W. Bush's presidency, and obviously we all know the moaning and gnashing of teeth about Obama's executive orders.</p>
<p>The real question is whether the orders violate the law in some way, and whether or not they're consistent with constitutional principles. How dictatorial were Obama's executive orders <em>really</em>? Well, his successor is revoking them by the dump truck load, so... not so much!</p>
<p>What should concern people is whether those orders contravene their constitutional or civil rights, and whether they reflect the kind of country they want to live in. They should be concerned about whether or not the courts uphold the legality of those orders, and what the Executive's response is if they are struck down.</p>
<p>I was much more concerned about the DHS refusing to halt enforcement of Trump's immigration order despite a stay being issued by a federal court than I was by Sally Yates refusing to enforce it. An Executive Branch that will not abide by court rulings that it disagrees with erodes the rule of law and puts the US on a collision course with a constitutional crisis unlike anything ever seen in the modern era. The last time something like this happened, you got the Trail of Tears. Say what you want about Nixon, but he resigned from office rather than provoke a constitutional crisis.</p>
<p>Executive Orders aren't the boogeyman, but people should look at what they do and the implications of how they're enforced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really great info. Also, people commonly say that the frequencies of executive orders are increasing with each successive administration, but that isn't true. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_executive_orders" target="_blank">Taft - Truman averaged around 200 executive orders per year in office, while Carter - Obama is averaging around 40 per year with the trend line going down</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, I always figured &quot;executive order&quot; meant something qualitatively different then &quot;exercising the power of the office in writing&quot;, just by how much the discussion seemed to concern themselves with the fact that they were issued at all. American political discourse is <em>so</em> weird from the other side of the pond. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, I absolutely agree with you. The sinking feeling I got in my stomach when I heard about what DHS did (refusing to obey court orders) was palpable. I literally wanted to throw up. That terrified me far more then anything else that has happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are complaining about bare-knuckle politics.  If you were to poll the Up Eastern, Ivy League Establishment, they hate Trump, and would have voted for Hillary.  This is because there is virtually no difference between the Establishment Republicans and the Democrats.  They are flip sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>But Trump went directly to the people that the 1% have been ignoring and being contemptuous of all along--the millions of people who live in &quot;fly-over country.&quot;  Those people want their country back, and they are serious.  Their politics and social mores have changed very little in the last twenty-five or thirty years.  Democrat or Republican, they are sick of the freak show on the coasts, and the major parties dismiss them at their peril.  <em>Look at the red/blue election map.</em>  <em>That's</em> why Trump is president.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a coastal versus heartland thing. It is urban and rural.</p>
<p>If I'm being frank, I don't understand what they think Trump can really do. He isn't going to stop the progress of automation and I don't see how he's going to reverse the trend of younger Americans moving out of the countryside and into the big cities. And generally speaking, when people move into larger cities they are exposed to groups of people they wouldn't have otherwise interacted with. There is a reason that big cities tend to be socially liberal.</p>
<p>The thing that's funny about this, is that lessening of regulation has actually increased the flow of money out of rural America and towards the big cities. They're voting for the exact same people that are slowly killing their towns.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Republican congress of 2010 on has been the most cynical, dirty, footdragging, gerrymandering, rule-playing congress in recent history. I do believe there are equivalents on the Democrat side but once again the false equivalency is that &quot;well they all kinda do it&quot; which simply is not true. They have recently done several unprecedented things such as stall Obamas SCOTUS nomination, etc., being 100% willing to tank the country to ensure an electoral win.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Alternately, Congress was forced to impede unilateral executive action because &quot;Obama&quot; (I really hate when people pretend it's all one person) undermined them with Executive Orders.</p>
<p>I don't entirely agree or disagree with either position, but you need to be aware of how heavily your bias is showing in what's objectively a stalemate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the problem is it was not an objective stalemate. They stated their intentions to the media and insiders very simply and plainly. As a party they simply decided not to work with him as a matter of principle. After nothing got done they could point to the nothing and go &quot;Look, the party in power isn't accomplishing anything!&quot; </p>
<p>The same story was confirmed multiple times by multiple sources. The new generation of Republicans in congress essentially used every single dirty trick at their disposal to make sure they won even the smallest battles. Trump just exemplifies the &quot;no moderation&quot; wing of the party that is now the philosophical and symbolic lead of the Republican party. Socially or fiscally liberal-leaning Republicans are tarred and feathered in the right-wing media until they no longer have a say. </p>
<p>And yes, I am biased, and in the realm of information there are far greater crimes than having an opinion. The joke idea that the truth lies somewhere exactly in the &quot;balanced&quot; middle of left and right in America is an oft-repeated segue into childish simplicity. If a the Right say 2+2=5, ad the Left say 2+2=7, it does not make true that 2+2=6.</p></div>		</li>
