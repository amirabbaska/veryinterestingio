			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Just about every tissue is composed of two main parts: the resident cells and the environment they live in, called the extracellular matrix. In most soft tissues the extracellular matrix is continually replaced by the resident cells as the proteins it is composed of (usually it's mostly type I collagen) degrade over time (even tissues with very low cell turnover, like the heart, do this).</p>
<p>In the case where part of the liver is removed or destroyed, these cells (primarily fibroblasts, another major type of liver cell) would lay down new extracellular matrix as part of regenerating the liver. </p>
<p>A similar process occurs as part of scar formation in many other organs when they are damaged, but with the liver you get healthy new liver tissue instead of scar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also interessant to note: in future* liver transplants, the matrix and liver cells can come from different donors.</p>
<p>A special washing solution is pumped through the liver, washing away everything but the matrix, leaving a white husk <a href="https://media.springernature.com/full/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nm.2170-F1.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a></p>
<p>Now the blood vessels and cell matrices can be implanted with healthy donor material to regrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Initially alcoholic liver disease presents as a fatty liver, which is largely asymptomatic aside from occasional discomfort due to the enlarged liver. Over time the liver then becomes inflamed, which causes damage by itself and makes it more difficult to properly regenerate. Both of those stages are reversible if consumption ceases. Eventually you get cirrhosis, which is where scar tissue replaces the liver tissue, and that is permanent. Generally speaking, consuming about 80 grams of ethanol per day for 10-20 years is what is required to develop cirrhosis. In the case of hard liquor, that is about a half pint per day.</p>

<p>A typical dry martini has 47ml of gin (2.5oz), 15ml of vermouth (0.5 oz). Gin (Beefeater, at least) is 47% ABV and vermouth is ~15% ABV (happy coincidence on those numbers), for a total of 24.34ml of ethanol.</p>
<p>At 0.79g/ml, that's 19.2g of ethanol, so let's round that up to 20 just to be easy.</p>
<p>So four martinis a day. For a decade.</p>
<p>I drank four martinis last weekend and could barely stand and threw up in the toilet. Alcoholics are goddamn serious about their drinking.</p>
<p>(Oh and that means the total amount of beverage in four martinis is 12 fl oz, or 3/4 of a pint).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The alcohol causes damage to liver. So when the body heals the damage it leaves behind scar tissue and over time the scar tissue builds up and prevents the liver from functioning. And yes the liver can be permanently damaged being repair through repeated consumption of toxic substances like alcohol. This is why people need liver transplants even after they stop drinking. The liver is an incredible capable of repairing an astonishing amount, but it had its limits. Cool fact when livers are harvested they are cut into as many as 16 pieces. This allows for more people to get a transplant. And that 1/16 of a liver will grow to a full size liver.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To answer your question, the enzyme that metabolizes alcohol generates toxic oxygen radicals as by-products. Those damage hepatocytes. </p>
<p>The liver has a remarkable capacity to repair damaged tissue, as has been stated. But its first line of defense is for hepatocytes to replicate to replace damaged tissue. If you continue to drink a lot, the new hepatocytes die as well, impairing regeneration. The dying hepatocytes release pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate the division of another cell type called stellate cells, that form scar tissue. The scar tissue can restore tissue integrity, but it can’t perform the functions of a hepatocyte. So over time the increasing loss of hepatocytes and increase in scar tissue means the liver isn’t able to perform critical functions, like removing ammonia from the bloodstream (ammonia is very toxic to neurons), synthesizing blood clotting factors, metabolism, and detoxification. Thus heavy drinking can ultimately lead to liver failure. </p>
<p>We don’t know what determines whether the liver recovers. Some people drink for 20 years and function fine, while others die of cirrhosis. There are some genetic components that have been identified, but mostly we don’t know. Cirrhosis generally refers to a liver that has been damaged “beyond repair”. So yes, and this is considered to be irreversible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Will we were talking about livers but, the answer is generally yes. This is because cell and DNA replication are incredible good at not causing mutations. If I remember correctly there is only one mistake every 10 billion  nucleotides. There are somewhere around 3 billion in each of or cells so that's one error in every three compete DNA replications. however, your cells also have proofreading proteins that go along and fix the vast majority of those mistakes. Next, the likely hood that a mistake will lead to any noticable effect is very small as well and to top it off the likely hood that a bad mutation results in cancer is also small. Finally, your cells also have self Destruction protocols for if certain proteins detect the cell isn't working correctly, the enzymes dicer and slicer (seriously) destroy the cell and in the process release sodium hydroxide as well to make sure everything is dead. So technically yes it would increase the number of mistakes but not the likely of causing mistakes. But DNA replication and the few mistakes that occur there in are not what causes cancer. There are chemicals called mutagens and carcinogens and these chemicals change the DNA and greatly increase cancer rates. Also radiation works by causing mutations in the DNA as well. So yes technically more replication does mean more chances for cancer but other organs that come in contact with radiation,carcinogens and mutagens get cancer and those are the lungs/mouths because of cigarettes. and skin from sun radiation. Hope this answered your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the proper statistic is 1 in 100 million, after proofreading is done by DNA polymerase 3 and polymerase 1 fills in gaps. However, most nucleotides in the genome are introns meaning they are not expressed. As a result of this, one can have thousands of errors that do not change the proteins made by the body simply because they occur in introns and not exons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Importantly, this IS NOT true. But it should be, for the reasons you mention. Liver cancer is not very common, and lots of interesting research is being done to figure out why, given its cells propensity to divide.</p></div>		</li>
