			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, some languages have words that are close enough to words in your language that you don't need to look them up or have enough context that you don't need to know what the word really was (the pc can parse some stuff without the emulator doing much work).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on which two languages we're talking about as a lot of them have a fairly significant amount of overlap. Most notably Italian and Portuguese and to some extent Spanish</p></div>		</li>
