			<div class="markdown"><p>There are definitely places that light will never reach, assuming that the expansion of the universe holds at a certain distance the other object is moving away from us faster then the speed of light (bending spacetime is the only thing that can go faster than the speed of light), so the light will never reach that point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no evidence that photons have a nonzero mass, no.  Furthermore, photons <em>must</em> be massless in a realization of the Higgs mechanism, so the discovery of the Higgs boson more or less confirms it.</p>
<p>Experimentally, there is a super small upper limit on a possible photon mass, but even in principle it is not possible to measure with infinite precision, so assuming photons actually are massless, it will never be proven by a direct measurement of photon mass, regardless of how good technology ever gets.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>
