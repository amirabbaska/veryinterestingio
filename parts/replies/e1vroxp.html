			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good points, but will just mention that it is not as easy as people think to verify virginity. Which makes sense, after all if a culture places high importance on virginity, people would want to think it is easier to verify than it is. </p>
<p>But the hymen for example can tear from many different things, as most girls who have been horse enthusiasts can tell you. And blood during the first time isn't a guarantee, because it's more likely to be a lack of lubrication due to nervousness and inexperience, rather than anything absolutely needing to get torn just to have sex. </p>
<p>Fun side fact regarding rape in ancient cultures: there's an ancient Sumerian story of the goddess Inanna where she was raped by the gardener Shukaletuda in her sleep. But rather than being a narrative where she was defiled or broken by the act, Inanna was wronged and went on a massively destructive quest to enact vengeance on the gardener. It was only when she accepted, by the help of the sky god Enki, that she shouldn't pursue Shukaletuda for revenge, but rather for justice, that she was able to find him and execute him for his crimes.</p>
<p>Which is a really cool way to illustrate that not all cultures necessarily viewed women's bodily autonomy the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This AND the hymen doesn't  look the same or &quot;behave&quot; the same in all women. It doesn't totally cover the vagina except very rare medical conditions (that result in blood  building up in the uterus because it can't pass normally during menstruation). It can look very different from woman to woman and cover more or less surface area.
If a woman is aroused and uses lube the first time she has sex, it's unlikely that she'll bleed because the hymen can &quot;stretch&quot; out of place instead of breaking.</p></div>		</li>
