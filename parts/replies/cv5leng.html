			<div class="markdown"><p>Then what exactly accounts for a computer making completely nonsensical blunders?</p>
<p>For example, using a queen to attack a protected pawn that can capture it, where the queen's <em>only</em> threat on the board is to capture the pawn? That's obviously a purposefully bad move that's worse than what a computer set to look at a minuscule number of plys (1 or 2) would make. In other words, computers on easy seem to make mistakes that even a computer that is set to be &quot;not as good&quot; by lowering the number of variations it looks at wouldn't make</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds more like a bug.  Anything less than 6 pieces can be proven via egtb's.   Technically even 7.  But with hardware being so fast now adays and so few pieces the search tree can get very deep quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you misunderstood my question so let me rephrase.</p>
<p>A lot of the answers in this thread simply say to lower the time a computer is given to calculate, or cap the number of variations it can calculate (essentially) and then it chooses from the smaller, likely inferior subset of moves. <em>However</em>, my understanding is it will still choose the one it evaluated most highly from this small subset. In games that I've played with computers and seen computers play, though, this doesn't seem to be a full explanation because I don't think some of the moves computers make can be described <em>only</em> as that, as in, there is more that goes beyond the explanation of &quot;less time&quot;.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make in my original example was this: if it IS the case that the computer still chooses what it evaluates as the best variation, no matter the amount of time it is limited to, then why do they not make the best one-move threats every move? If you let me expand on my original example, let's say theoretically there are 10 white and 10 black pieces on the board and the computer is playing black. In this position there are hypothetically 100 legal moves for black, and he chooses to attack a pawn protected by another pawn (not passed, not near the king) with his queen on a square on which it has no other purpose (does not control any additional squares, and threatens no other pieces on the board) and it can be captured by the aforementioned pawn. There <em>has</em> to be dozens of single moves in the position that have greater threats than this one (in other words, it can't be that the computer evaluated this single move most highly), yet it's the one the computer chose. It's just a hypothetical example but I've seen it and had it happen many times in games. What is the cause for this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never created a strong engine. I was mostly interested in opening theory and egtb's.  Keep in mind those who tinker in computer chess almost never do it all the time.  I would go a couple years before it would spark back up again and I'd get back into it.  Then there are times I would do it almost obsessively for 6months to a year. </p>
<p>Even did a stint working on Go as that is still in the semi-early ages but there has been A LOT of progress the past 2 years.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bruce force but heavily pruned.   Neural networks really never took off, maybe for refining the evaluation function. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose the thing about neural networks is that they never really become any better than the examples that train them. </p>
<p>I built a back-propagation neural net back in 1992 that could learn how to play rummy and I heard they could give good games of backgammon too but chess is a different beast altogether. </p></div>		</li>
