<p>My in laws would stuff cigarette tubes (with filters) with pipe tobacco when they raised the price to $9/10 a pack. Thankfully they both quit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 is only true in the US though both menthol and regular cigarettes have menthol.  &quot;Menthol&quot; just has a lot more.</p>
<p>3 is only true of good pipe tobacco.</p>
<p>4 is highly debatable because of #3 above however pipe tobacco tends to be safer simply because it's not meant to be inhaled.</p>
<p>5 we don't have an answer for yet though probably true</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question from a social cigarette smoker. Cigarettes give our bodies an effect after inhalation, I wouldn't smoke if it wasn't for the inhaling part, so what is the point of pipes (and cigars as far as I understand). Do they have any effect on people, do they taste good, what is it? Genuinely curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You absorb a lot of nicotine with a pipe, regardless of inhalation. I have smoked blends that will make a cigarette smoker nauseous, there's just that much nicotine. Same with cigars, which you also don't inhale (normally).</p>
<p>Pipe tobacco does taste good though. Some people smoke aromatics, which are usually flavored with something like honey or vanilla or cherry flavoring. I never liked that though. English blends, which are my favorite, use a blend of several tobaccos but the most notable is Latakia. It is cured in a way that makes it smokey, similar to smoked paprika. </p>
<p>There are also Virginia blends, which are more hay like you might say. And Virginia Perique blends, which can be a little earthy. </p>
<p>There are others, but they all have nuances and nicotine levels. And of course you can't talk about pipe tobacco without pipes. Some are ornate. Others are rustic or art deco. But a lot of enjoyment comes from just collecting these pipes.</p>
<p>And finally, the ritual of pipe smoking is much beloved. When you light a cigarette, you just pick it out of the pack, flick the lighter, and puff away. But with pipes, you carefully pack the tobacco. Not too tight as to cut off airflow, but not so loose that it won't stay lit. Then you light a match (although I do use a pipe lighter when a pack of matches eludes me) and char the top. You tamp that down to make a sort of bed of coals. Then you light another match and finish lighting the pipe. </p>
<p>It's a nice little experience that takes you out of your day and that's part of the appeal. </p></div>		</li>
