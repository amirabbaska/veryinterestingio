			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question. This is complicated though as nature does a great job of finding new equilibria.<br />
The best answer here would be that it would cause a new equilibrium, not return it to its original state. So, you'd be shocking Hawaii into a new, third state of nature. Who knows if it would be better or worse than it's status quo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, it can be pretty hard to selectively kill only one type of organism. Sure you can genetically engineer mosquitoes to produce sterile offspring, but that's probably way more expensive and time consuming than just dumping a bunch of pesticides. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually Google is doing so right now with its Science division Verily. They are partnered with a Mosquito Abatement company on CA and are working together on a program called Debug Fresno. </p>
<p>To answer your question: no reason exists as to why not if they are non-native to an area and are considered invasive. The program I mentioned is building the technology to sterilize a population in a given area that they are considered invasive. By means of infecting males with Wolbachia. In particular this program is targeting the Aedes aegypti.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There's definitely not <em>no</em> reason. One reason the removal of non-native invasive species still needs to be considered carefully is that, in the time they've been there, native or other invasive species may have adapted, and suddenly removing the target could have unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Like, imagine a hypothetical area that was lousy with West Nile. That tends to have a devastating effect on crows that eat infected carrion. So when we eliminate mosquitoes, we might expect the crow population to return to normal. But what if the crow population is less resilient than something else that eats carrion, like skunks? So we don't return to the original ecosystem, we now enter an ecosystem that carries no mosquitoes, just as few crows, and a ton of skunks. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean it's not viable, and not something that isn't regularly considered in the management of invasive species, but it's definitely a little more nuanced than &quot;There's no reason to not interfere.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't Wolbachia already in them somehow? Because when mosquitoes transmit heartworms, one of the ways to weaken the heartworms is to give Doxycycline to kill the Wolbachia that lives in a symbiotic relationship with the heartworm. (Am a vet tech) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the risk there is that you eradicate a food  source. Consider that there are animals that eat mosquitoes and their larvae; even rely on them. Humans just can't predict the ecological effects. If you remove a primary food source of say, frogs, what happens then? Do the frogs die out? Or do they start eating more of another food source, thus  impacting other species? Really, we just aren't smart enough to accurately predict what will happen, and if there's a risk of the impact being catastrophic then it's just unsafe to do it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As somebody pointed out below, the itching is actually caused by a histamine release in response to the mosquitos saliva. You could certainly genetically engineer a human to suppress the histimine response, but it would likely not result in a viable human (histamines are a critical part of the immune response). </p></div>		</li>
