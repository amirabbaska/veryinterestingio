<p>Looooong time before I learnt any different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what he/she's getting at, is that in many countries (such as Japan and India) a bidet is often built into the toilet seat. So you don't have to get off the seat to clean yourself.</p>
<p>In India we often also have little hand showers hanging on walls next to toilet seats instead of bidets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a bidet sorta 'integrated' into the toilet. It's a small pipe sticking out of the toilet bowl aimed at your butthole, <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Bzh7PzBUGSw/Se2_2fFimzI/AAAAAAAAALU/lOCczZIf6K0/s400/Taharet+Muslugu.jpg" target="_blank">like this one</a>. The pipe itself is short enough and placed far back enough to never touch your butt though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about climate. Wiping when you're sweaty and sticky will turn into a mess of paper maiche attached to your ass. In a colder climate with air conditioning that doesn't happen as much. Most countries with bidets are just hotter. Too hot to use paper. It's Not across the board accurate but it's pretty close</p></div>		</li>
