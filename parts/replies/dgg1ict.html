			<div class="markdown"><p>Palm oil itself isn't damaging, it's the methods used to harvest enough to meet the ever increasing demand.  I know what you were saying, but the plants themselves aren't the problem which was more relevant to the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For real though, the consumtion and production of palm oil go hand in hand, and has huge environmental (and social) impact. From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Palm oil cultivation has been criticized for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation in tropical areas accounts for an estimated 10 percent of manmade CO
2 emissions, and is a driver toward dangerous climate change.</li>
<li>Habitat destruction, leading to the demise of critically endangered species (e.g. the Sumatran elephant, Sumatran tiger, the Sumatran rhinoceros, and the Sumatran orangutan.)</li>
<li>Reduced biodiversity, including damage to biodiversity hotspots.</li>
<li>Cultivating crops on land that belongs to indigenous people in the Sarawak and Kalimantan states on the island of Borneo and the Malaysian state of Sabah.</li>
</ul>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's <strong>not</strong> the harvest methods. </p>
<p>It's the clearing of land to make vast monocropped areas of oil palms with nothing growing under or around them, the entire native forest destroyed (along with the wildlife), vast road networks and terracing to access the oil palms, erosion from those roads, and the importing of workers who, in many cases, take whatever remains in the little bits of surrounding forest.</p>
<p>One of my conservation jobs was in areas where this was/is happening and I've driven through and flown over lots of these areas.</p>
<p>It is absolutely not the &quot;methods used to harvest&quot;.</p>
<p>It is everything <em>before</em> that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Indonesia one of the big issues is that the fires can ignite the immense tropical peat bogs (they dry out part of the year and can catch fire easily) and they basically just slowly burn until the rainy season starts. You can't really put out a peat fire unless you divert a river into it and they'll burn underground as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>things like water consumption</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you should clarify that water doesn't get consumed. Fresh water is being used in the process of producing foods and then is no longer considered fresh water. The water doesn't disappear. It is either not fit for drinking anymore (because it gets tainted with solvents for cleaning or fertilizer), bound to the food (many fruits and vegetables have high water contents) or vaporized (mostly via animals).</p>
<p>My point is, the water isn't gone, but since the total supply of fresh water is largely constant, dedicating more fresh water towards production of food can be a serious problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no of course the law of conservation is assumed. But consumption of water means potable water being expended, as water for consumption is the cornerstone of human existence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Naturally.</p>
<p>That's usually assumed in water consumption.  Of course the water itself still exists, but if you can't drink it or use it then it's not very helpful to humans. </p></div>		</li>
