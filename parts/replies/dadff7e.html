			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the reason for mirages on a hot road. The air right above the road is super-heated and causes light to bounce off and hit your eyes at a certain angle. This is why you can never catch up to the mirage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's my attempt.</p>
<p>Light can change direction when going from one material to another. The air that is heated is rising up in currents through the colder air. This hot air is considered a different material to the colder air and so bends the light. As the currents move about the bent light moves as well giving the wavy effect.</p></div>		</li>
