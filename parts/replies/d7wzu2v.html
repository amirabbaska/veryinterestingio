			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just an anecdote, I have nothing of concrete fact to share </p>
<p>One morning I woke up to a call from my dad. He was out of breath and panting. Our dog got out and he had been chasing him all over the street for 5 minutes at a sprint. We lived by the turnpike, our dog was never outside without a leash, and my dad has heart issues and is overweight. He needed help. I SPRUNG into action, after being awake 10 seconds. Sprinted outside, sprinted down the street, ran up to dog, helped catch dog. However after that energy burst / adrenaline rush, I was so physically ill I had to lay down. My vision blacked out, I nearly threw up, I was laying there on the street just like, in bad shape.</p>
<p>I've always thought about this when having to jump up and do somethig quickly. I know nurses / doctors / firemen / etc have to do this stuff for their job so there's probably no harm, but it was so weird to experience! </p>
<p>TL;DR: Don't wake up and immediately go sprinting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I know exactly what you had because I experienced exactly the same thing.  It was most likely a near-syncopal event (you almost passed out) caused by a sudden drop in blood sugar.</p>
<p>When you wake up in the morning your body is already low on blood sugar because you haven't eaten for a while.  Suddenly springing into extreme cardio exercise made your body suddenly start to burn what little sugar it had and since it didn't have enough, you felt like shit.</p>
<p>I wondered what it was for years until my current girlfriend explained it to me.  She's a medical tech.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:  Some have pointed out that if you don't suffer from blood sugar problems then it was most likely just caused by a sudden lack of enough blood in the brain.  Either way, in general terms, you suffered a near-syncopal event by going from a state of rest to a very sudden state of heavy activity.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know. We actually know very little about sleep. I had a study done while in the coast guard working catching smugglers. We asked a bunch of questions but they didnt really know anything concrete. But we were expected to wake up immediately and preform complex tasks and not sleep for days. I'm actually struggling with insomnia now. Whenever I start falling asleep I get an adrenaline spike. </p></div>		</li>

<p>(which is not as cut and dry a process as it may seem, ask anyone with sleep paralysis!)</p>

<p>Not just that, buit also things like sleep apnea. A wakeup during &quot;normal hours&quot; of say 6-8am can lead to a half day of headaches, drowsiness, nausea, disorientation alongside lost productivity. Having ones sleep cycle disrupted 1-3 times++ per hour every night is no all that much fun. </p>
<p>Hell, even a mild case can be cripling to a persons ablity to live and do things.( I suffer from it)  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, even before you get into long term issues with the cardiovascular system and brain, it's terrible for how you actually feel. I hope you've managed to control your case with a *PAP or dental appliance!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my first experience with sleep paralysis the other day. I had woken up, then fell back asleep for what seemed like a long time but was actually only 15 minutes. A noise outside woke me up the 2nd time, and I was trying to open my eyes to see what the noise was but couldn't. I could feel my whole body and was trying to move but no matter how hard I tried I nothing happened. I stopped trying to move after a while and relaxed, then it felt like I woke up again, even though I thought I was already awake and completely aware of my surroundings. My eyes hurt from trying to open them, it felt like when you close your eyes really hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never had sleep paralysis, but it's always fascinated me.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is helpful at all, but I just want to ask one thing.</p>
<p>You know how people watch scary films, because they enjoy being scared sometimes?
Well, is it possible to enjoy sleep paralysis? Like, if you just experienced it the same way you'd experience a scary film (bloody terrifying but enjoyable in retrospect), wouldn't it be quite fun? </p>
<p>Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible, particularly for those of us who are interested in lucid dreaming. I had sleep paralysis once but actually enjoyed the experience because I knew what was happening. Sure, I had shadow people standing at the foot of my bed and I couldn't move, but it was still kind of cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had sleep paralysis a couple dozen times in the past few years, and while it was terrifying the first few times, I've since reached a point where I can identify it, stop fighting it, and kind of savor the rest of the ride.
Incidentally, I'm the sort of person who really enjoys roller coasters.</p>
<p>With that said, considering that sleep paralysis causes my brain to scream incoherently at me about the criminals breaking into my room, I must be pretty stupid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had sleep paralysis for a while now, mainly only when I'm severely overtired. The first time it was scary as shit. Once I realized what had happened, the second time was easier. Now I've hit the point of enjoying it, because I can't get up anyway. Might as well go back to sleep. If I have to, I can work my way out of it, but it takes too long. Faster to go back to sleep and wake up properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I lie down on my couch and take a nap, I get it hardcore. I feel helpless and time moves so slowly that I worry I am not breathing. I force myself back to sleep just to be sure my automatic breathing mechanism kicks in, while trying to suppress the worry that I will never awake</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. The good news at least is that was almost certainly a freak occurrence as a result of rapidly re-entering REM sleep and then being suddenly roused, so unlikely to be repeated. </p>
<p>That description of opening your eyes though... damn.</p></div>		</li>
