			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a big difference here is simply that outside of the US, people grow up seeing nudity. Here in the US, despite the fact that clothing trends leave little to the imagination, nudity of almost any kind is seen as erotic. And when nudity is seem in TV/movies here, it's typically erotic. </p>
<p>Even breastfeeding in public is somewhat taboo. I work as a nurse, and you wouldn't believe the number of patients who get nervous about me cleaning them up or needing to assess a more private area because it's related to their diagnosis and plan of care. It's been ingrained in our heads here that nudity shouldn't be public, and it's difficult for people to shift perspectives when they were raised with certain cultural norms. </p>
<p>Honestly, I think we'd have less problems if we could normalize nudity, to some extent. Maybe porn addiction and teenage pregnancy would decrease, who knows. Rates of breast feeding would increase, I imagine, since it wouldn't be seen as taboo.</p>
<p>With that being said, change needs to be gradual. People don't react well to having something bashed over their heads. Slow, logical change tends to work better. My generation (millennials, as much as I hate to call myself one) are less concerned with nudity than our parents generation, I think. We're somewhere in that process of slow desensitization. </p>
<p>It went the same way with violence. It progressively became more and more graphic in TV/gaming. Gaming played a big part in it, I think. I mean goodness, Saw. If we can watch Saw, I think that speaks to how desensitized we are to violence... I think we're a little TOO desensitized to violence, quite frankly. I've read several studies about exposure to violence, particularly in children, and it's convinced me that we'll be incredibly careful about what channels/shows/games we allow our children to experience. </p>
<p>Although I'm comfortable seeing nudity that is not sexual on TV/in movies, I do think that nudity in erotic scenes (even just partial nudity), should carry a mature rating. It could be triggering to some. My husband struggled with a porn addiction for years, and we avoid erotica/sexual nudity as much as possible in TV/movies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really gives one perspective when you see your grandparents naked sagging bodies weekly. Shows what is waiting all of us. There is nothing sexual about nudity itself, it has to have a special context to make it so. For people who really have never seen nude people who you have non-sexual relationship with, i can easily picture just seeing partly naked body bringing huge emotions, positive and negative.</p>
<p>The whole attitude is different and Finnish people are not generally uninhibited or extroverts, people do not walk around naked all day but in fact, wearing sweatpants to pick up mail is just about &quot;allowed&quot;, otherwise you should dress properly, wearing pajamapants in 7/11 is what hobos and crazy people might do....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't personally avoid nudity in my family, but I know plenty of people who do. Our friends' 5 year old daughter was really confused when she saw my wife changing my son. She thought everyone had the same equipment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I still lived with my parents, they even walked through the whole home naked. They had their clothes in a closet im the bedroom, so the easiest way was to go naked from the bathroom to the bedroom. It's not that unusual here. (Some people do it, some don't.)</p>
<p>If you go swimming in the wild (a lake, a river ...), it won't surprise you to see naked people either.</p></div>		</li>
