			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your concern. This is likely a moving target. Early versions of gene and cell therapy are currently very expensive. This is in part because the technology to &quot;manufacture&quot; the treatments remain cumbersome and difficult to scale. We and others are working very hard – in the lab and with industry – to find way to streamline these manufacturing processes so that engineered cells can be generated much more rapidly, flexibly, precisely.... and, we hope, much more cheaply. These steps are critical to scaling up the use of CRISPR-based products to treat a wide-range of human diseases around the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. There is a lot of work ahead, but I hope that CRISPR will expand the range of effective treatments for disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add some to the official response... It has been patented, in some ways. Patents are complicated, and the details of what is and isn't covered are going to be constantly reevaluated as tech moves forward. Some early patents tried to cover broad swaths of gene editing technology, but it's my opinion that new variations of CRISPR-based tech will overtake the old, broad patents. </p>
<p>Currently the Broad and Editas ($EDIT) are in court with the UC schools and Intellia ($NTLA) and have been for quite some time. Rulings have favored the Broad with patents on gene editing in humans for therapeutic use using CRISPR (obviously the patent is more specific than my paraphrasing). I believe there is space for new, highly specific, and highly engineered version of CRISPR-Cas. However, they may have to pay a royalty to the &quot;original&quot; inventors.</p>
<p>NOTE: Both parties in the current patent disputes explicitly allow all academic use without any licenses. They appear to intend to prosecute only for industrial uses.</p></div>		</li>
