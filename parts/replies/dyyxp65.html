<p>If you're getting close to the limits of the bees' tolerance of temperature, you may want to put a roof above the hive that's a few inches or more above the hive. Then it's always in the shade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely white paint isn't clear to IR? It does't just stop being opaque at 700nm? Doesn't the inside of the coat of paint reflect much of the the IR radiation from the painted substance straight back into it? The painted substance would conduct heat into the paint, which would give off its own IR?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Nope, white paint (and paint in general) is quite opaque to (i.e. absorbs) IR. That's exactly why it works as an effective emitter (absorptivity = emissivity).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Doesn't the inside of the coat of paint reflect much of the the IR radiation from the painted substance straight back into it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dominant mode of heat transfer into the paint is likely conduction, not radiation. Because a typical paint layer is so thin, even relative to a sheet metal roof, you can usually consider the substrate and the coating to always be at basically the same temperature.</p>

<p>Yep, exactly. </p></div>		</li>
