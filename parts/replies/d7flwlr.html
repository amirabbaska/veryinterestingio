			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah, thanks.  I wouldn't use it scientifically, but I feel like &quot;pint&quot; is a reasonably well understood volume of beverage.  Is that not the case?</p>
<p>Edit: dang, if you ever want a bunch of people replying with the same information over and over for a long period of time, write something like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The less formal and more ambiguious &quot;pint&quot; was probably better here - since it covers a wide range of skinny vs obese people.</p>
<p>If you want to say &quot;half liter&quot; it implies something so specific you probably need to also say &quot;for a 140 lb person&quot; (or whatever that is in metric).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The pint was standardized in 1824.</p>
<p>The pint is more modern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm reading the Elon Musk book, and his company SpaceX chose to launch closer to the equator <del>for this reason</del> (edit - apparently there are better reasons for launching from closer to the equator - TIL). I was wondering how much of a difference it actually made. Seems like .7% isn't much, then again, I'm not paying for rocket fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also because the equator move the fastest so by launching from there, you gain the most delta v which means you don't need as much fuel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not delta V, just V. Delta V is change in velocity, and being at the equator doesn't give you any additional <em>change</em> in velocity.</p>
<p>You could word it as requiring less delta V to achieve orbital speeds, though.</p></div>		</li>
