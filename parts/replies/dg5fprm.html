			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. I'm always afraid of deleting an asset, even if it shows no results when I search the code base for its name, since sometimes the code uses reflection to find an asset, or has the asset name generated in runtime through string concatenation.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's sort of speaks to a few possibilities depending on the game developer; amateur developers, smaller dev team, rapid delivery deadlines, or just a general lack of organization. Teams focused on scalability and repeatability likely won't do this as much. Don't get me wrong games are enormously complex, but regardless of what your developing; games, front-end, back-end it doesn't matter... good schema, workflow, and code pattern/module documentation during development solve these issues. It takes more energy to have a high level of organization but depending on the goals it can have some great benefits. </p></div>		</li>
