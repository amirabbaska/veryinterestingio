			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! </p>
<p>Elephants get cancer at more or less the same rate as every other mammals that has been examined, so it seems there is not a 1:1 reduction in risk for each extra copy of p53.</p>
<p>Whales, at least those with genomes that we can check, don't have extra copies of p53...which means there are many ways to evolve a reduced cancer risk...and we are trying to figure out what those way are!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly suggest you investigate the work being done by Dr. Van de Walle from Cornell. She gave a seminar at my university in which she talked about the role of the secretome in tumorigenesis. More specifically why horses and cows can be resistant to tumorigenesis but not dogs or cats.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very possibly the mechanism of cancer avoidance is different in whales. It is different in naked mole rays, which live for decades, where p21 is the overactive tumor suppressor gene that protects their cells from becoming cancerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard the naked mole rat's cancer resistance was due to excess ECM component secretion that traps cells and prevents them from being able to proliferate and become tumors.</p></div>		</li>
