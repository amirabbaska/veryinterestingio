			<div class="markdown"><p>This would be better memorized by both increasing your understanding of what they do so you attach more meaning to each one and by using them more so it reinforces the connections. It's like any other vocabulary, just learn the nuance and use it in a sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, people have used memory mnemonics to memorize dictionaries and arbitrary information like a string of 100,000 random numbers.</p>
<p>But, you also have to understand that memorizing is not understanding. Itâ€™s like a reference notebook you have in your pocket. So, you could memorize all of the commands, but still might not have any idea how to troubleshoot connectivity issues with a VPN tunnel.</p>
<p>But memorizing can also help you to have many concepts at the ready, which can help you wrap your brain around more complex concepts more efficiently than if you had to, say, go back and re-read an entire chapter in a book to refresh yourself on some supporting topic.</p>
<p>Check out the book <em>Moonwalking With Einstein</em> for a good, entertaining intro.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in audit while studying for the CPA exam and the section on audit gave me so much trouble until one day, instead of getting bogged down by all the exam buzzwords, I went &quot;wait a minute, what do you do all goddamn day?&quot;. When I switched from playing the buzzword game to putting things in terms of my job, the test was suddenly so much easier and clearer. </p></div>		</li>
