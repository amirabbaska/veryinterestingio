			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that these two scenarios are extremely similar, possibly even identical in their mechanics, but what's interesting is that with black holes we exist 'outside' of them, whereas with the universe we exist 'inside' of it. I don't think we will ever be able to know the answer to this question for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because all of space and time are expanding outwards from the point of singularity. Which the point is not a single spot in space, but basically, the big bang happened everywhere at once. Cooled, condensed, and expanded to the point where we now have more &quot;space&quot; around us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A singularity doesn't actually make sense. The math before and at the moment of the big bang doesn't make physical sense. But mostly, the math results in division by zero which is an invalid operation. Therefore, we know that hypothesis is flawed in some way.</p></div>		</li>
