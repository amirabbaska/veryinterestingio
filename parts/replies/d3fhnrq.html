			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, when men fail at suicide they can expect the aftermath to be humiliating, to receive shame and condemnation rather than support.  So not only do they have a big incentive not to attempt it if they can't succeed, if they do attempt unsuccessfully they're probably far less likely to admit it was a suicide attempt.  Other people who recognize that reality are probably also more likely to go along with that and pretend it was an accident, even if they know or suspect otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only speak from experience but I thought of suicide for probably years before I got close, it was a daily thing and I gave a significant amount of time to the method. </p>
<p>Most people don't suddenly come down with depression in a day and randomly commit suicide, like you said its a drawn out process. For me depression was my burden, and the solution was either to tough it out or take the &quot;easy&quot; way out with a one and done method. Most methods employed commonly by women were wiped off the short list fairly quickly because they lacked the success rate I was looking for. </p>
<p>Seems to match with other guys, its anecdotal but yeah in my experience you've got the guy part down perfectly. </p></div>		</li>
