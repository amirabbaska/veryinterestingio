			<div class="markdown"><p>I had never considered it would be plant hormones that do the signalling for germination. But that totally makes sense. Do we know what those hormones are? And can we artificially synthesize that hormone and bathe the seeds to produce speedy, controlled germination? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously this area of botany needs much more research, definitely possible.</p>
<p>Wonder if it's been done for some incredibly long germinating seeds, like 3+ months. Germinate thousands of seeds, crack open a determined amount every day, crush them, and run analysis on the presence of a particular hormone to determine their change throughout the months. Repeat this process for absolutely every hormone being released during the process of germination and voil√†, a beautiful, chemical representation of what germination is on the atomic level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting, thank you.  I can see that production of hormones is the ultimate process.  I am not sure how the production takes months instead of days (or hours), given that seeds generally shouldn't be exposed to much light when preparing to start growing/germinating.  </p>
<p>If the seed were sitting on top of the dirt, I can imagine that one unit of hormone gets released every light/dark cycle when temperatures are below X degrees.  After a set units of hormone are released, rising temperatures signal appropriate conditions to begin growing.  That makes sense.  But most seeds require being under the dirt, sometimes several inches under.  Seeds in the wild would also be covered by leaf litter, snow, etc.  So I am not sure how much light/dark cycles play a role.</p></div>		</li>
