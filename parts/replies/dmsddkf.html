			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very important. Do you know why industrialization was slow going? <em>We had slaves</em>. As Manu Saadia <a href="https://twitter.com/trekonomics/status/906634929907277824" target="_blank">just put it</a> on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hero of Alexandria invented a steam engine in 1st century AD. Didn't pick up b/c of slavery in the Roman Empire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And while for a long time, it was believed that Hero's engine never went past the &quot;toy&quot; phase, there's newer evidence that steam engines were used to operate the city gates. We could do real work with it. But it never caught on, because you could just make <em>people</em> do the work for you. Why invest in capital when you can literally own labor?</p></div>		</li>
