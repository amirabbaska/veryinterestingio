			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there would always be friction between fibers of the cloth, creating a dampened spring motion. The acceleration stretches the cloth much like a spring, and it would slightly crumple and re-stretch until it came to rest once that acceleration ends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is a force acting on the cloth, but it's an internal force.  The bits of fiber that were near the mount point are stretched, and so they pull at both the mount and the outer end of the flag, bringing them closer together.</p>
<p>As /u/cdcformatc said, there is a lot of internal friction that will eat up the energy fairly quickly.</p></div>		</li>
