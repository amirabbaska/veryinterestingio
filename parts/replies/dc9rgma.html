			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this answer.</p>
<p>Side note having nothing to do with anything, just reminded by your remote starter comment: just read an article about a guy who got a $128 ticket for warming up his car in his own driveway for seven minutes while he was inside the house. Apparently it is a violation to leave the keys in the ignition, running, and unattended. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's that way here in CO, however it's a moving violation and therefore does not apply on ANY Private property, only on public roads, so driveway is not an issue. I tried to find the ordinance related to that ticket in Michigan, but came up empty. Thankfully cops in most cities here don't give out tickets unless they're hungry for revenue, like Aurora.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that depends on local laws. Where I currently reside, not a problem, but previously in another state, Definitely illegal. Also differs between public and private property. </p>
<p>I've done it in for years. I'd rather let my car warm up from the inside and let it defrost, than to stand outside in the freezing cold scraping ice from the windshield. And once I'm done, drive in a cold car.  However, I do drive a manual so I'm not worried about my car jumping into gear and moving on its own as I never park it in gear. </p></div>		</li>

<p>He was ticketed for leaving the car unlocked, running and with the keys in it. If you had remote start, it could be locked and with no keys in, thus no ticket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I feel like you're the only guy that <em>could</em> have answered the question but you didn't. OP said MOST cars have it on the rear, and wanted to know why they don't on the front. Why is it rare to have it on the front?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually not in the HVAC department, so I couldn't give you a straight answer. If I had to guess, it would be due to the serviceability of it and the cost. Something like this wouldn't be included standard on a non-luxury car since a large chunk of the market would never use it. This means it would either have to be lumped into the winter package, increasing its price, or just a standalone option.</p>
<p>Think about who buys a Range Rover. These consumers typically have no issues putting the thousands down to custom order their car. </p>
<p>Now picture the typical consumer shopping for a Toyota or Ford. They're going to shop around dealership to dealership looking for a good deal. They're not going to custom order a car. The dealer isn't going to order the option on this car since the price increase would probably drive away more consumers than bring in.</p>
<p>This really only makes sense to have on high end cars due to the customer base.</p></div>		</li>
