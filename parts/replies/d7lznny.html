			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading this study! So fascinating, and it completely upends the popular conception of how DNA relates to the &quot;identity&quot; or ontology of a given organism. I think it will take quite some time for this new model to filter out into the popular consciousness, though. Like, years or decades. Unless some really spectacular current event draws attention to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it upends that much at all. Twin studies have been done for decades, including identical twins (monozygotic, MZ), fraternal twins (dizygotic, DZ), adoptees of the same age, and peer groups of the same age. These include batteries of tests from physical differences to personality, preferences, aptitudes, and even habits. From these we have good estimates of what contribution genes have to traits, what contribution common environment has (parenting, household, school, etc.), and how much is uncorrelated/random. </p>
<p>It's very clear that genes contribute to a lot to some traits (like intelligence), and much less to some other traits. On average it appears to be about 50% genes, 40-50% random, and 0-10% common environment. It's not the genetic component that is so controversial, but the common environment results, particularly for parents who think the way they parent has a big effect, and for social scientists who fall on the &quot;social constructionist&quot; side.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the &quot;popular conception&quot; is that you mean, given this existing controversy, and the public tendency to reduce it to a &quot;nature vs nurture&quot; argument. (&quot;Nurture&quot; implies &quot;common environment&quot; like parenting and schooling, which contributes little. It's more like &quot;nature plus random, with a little nurture thrown in&quot;.)</p>
<p>This new study appears to be consistent with that. It's fascinating and points to interesting new mechanisms, but it's not really new in impact on our understanding of &quot;identity&quot;; it potentially provides a clearer mechanism for what happens to cause the &quot;uncorrelated/random&quot; components. </p>
<p>Also, as with all science, one study isn't very valuable; we need to see repeatable results and more detailed interrogation before concluding anything. But you are right that this part will take decades. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Our brains contain a surprising diversity of DNA. Even though we are taught that every cell in our body has the same DNA, in fact most cells in the brain have changes to their DNA that make each neuron a little different.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The findings, published September 12, 2016 in the journal Nature Neuroscience, may help explain what makes us each unique–why even identical twins can be so different from one other, for example–and how jumping genes can go awry and cause disease.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The position of the muffin in relation to the heat source affects the temperature of the tin surrounding the muffin and in turn this affects the baking process. Whilst the effect can be minimised using movement, temperature of the heat source is not constant over the baking period and neither is the temperature of the air in the oven. Same applies to human cells, kinda cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but the point is that, generally, DNA contains the same set of genes regardless of what the cell does. It's not like cells throw out all the muscle genes once they become a neuron. It could theoretically still express muscle-specific genes, it just doesn't because of regulation and silencing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very thorough answer, but couldn't some differences simply be a result of usage? I have known identical twins that were very different in the area of their mouth because one took spanish in gradeschool and one spoke french. They both continued doing so through college level and the had a distinct difference in facial muscles since they had worked them in such disparate ways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point! And yes, you are right. I was assuming the OP was referring to things we might normally associate with our genome. But, muscle modification due to behavior and so on also can affect our appearance. Some people do use different facial expressions, or just by varying personalities, they can just look different.</p>
<p>I think it's a great point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was an amazing answer, well worth the read! I still have some questions about epigenetics though. How does the epigenetics 'know' what gene to make more active and what gene to make less active? Is one gene going to be less active because it has been less active? You eat less, thus less proteins are produced, and since less proteins are produced, your epigenetics learns to create less? How would it differentiate between proteins you need more when you are hungry from proteins you need less when you are hungry? Is there a kind of natural selection within the body that kills cells that produce more than what your body can sustain and thus selects for an epigenetics in cells that produce a reasonable amount for what you need at that moment?</p>
<p>Well I guess my question is just what mechanisms makes the epigenetics 'decide' to behave the way it does?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fantastic question and also a very &quot;deep&quot; question that I find hard to put into words that I bet an Evolutionary Biologist would be able to answer much better.</p>
<p>With that being said, I will try. But, the first thing you must understand is the perspective of the complexity of the cell. Think of it like this... Think of one of the most advanced feats of technology we have accomplished as humans. Personally, I think of the Space station, and I think of our rocket technology, and the space shuttle, and the tens of thousands of brilliant scientists and engineers that went into this project all across the world. Well, guess what, I still think the Eukaryotic cell is more complex than all of that combined.</p>
<p>First, you are right, they don't &quot;know&quot; what gene to make more active. So, going back to the big picture here before I answer your question, I think even if you understand this principle, others reading may not. The question I ask is this, how does a protein work? What gives a protein any kind of function? They don't have brains. They don't know anything. They are just a glob of molecules floating around and bumping into things. The answer is simply, their shape. Let's say one protein is shaped a certain 3-dimensional way and it is just floating around. Well, this protein is mostly useless lets say. However, there is this one notch in it that if this other protein bumps into it, it gets lodged in because their shapes now fit together. Only the shape of this other protein will fit. Sometimes this is assisted by the charge of the molecules of the protein and the affinity they have for each other which can make the &quot;bumps&quot; more sticky and more likely to occur.</p>
<p>Ok, so you had 2 different proteins bump into each other and now they are stuck together. Note, this is a very simple example. In the real world a single reactive protein can be so incredibly complex with many many binding sites for regulatory molecules and so on. Now, they are stuck together, sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanent. This gives the new mega protein a different chemical signature. Its overall chemical charge might change. It might go from polar to non-polar and flip inside out, or maybe just one end of it changes. All of a sudden this protein now has a new shape. Lo and behold this newly shaped protein just happens to fit into another site which might do something. New shape means new function.</p>
<p>But, none of the proteins &quot;know&quot; what they are doing. They aren't thinking. They are just moving around. How did this all happen then? Well, you were right when you mentioned a &quot;kind of natural selection.&quot; Once upon a time, things were a bit less complex. But, through random probability, things bumped into each other billions and trillions and quadrillions of times, many things happened, most ended up useless, but occasionally, rarely, something useful occurred. Something that made the cell more lean, or gave it an extra function that increased its chance of dividing or something. The cell doesn't &quot;want&quot; to necessarily do certain things. It's not thinking. However, if something makes the cell more likely to survive, like a novel change to something that now requires less energy to do the same thing, there is a good chance that cell thrives and outcompetes the others and eventually outlives the others and becomes the dominant, most-populated cell.</p>
<p>DNA is so complex and the signalling pathways created that you are literally looking at billions of years of accumulating novel changes. Somewhere along the way, who knows how long ago, but some cell was under stress, then a random mutation occurred, or outside trauma, or any number of things, we will never really know, but all of a sudden, rather than submit to the stress by being in overdrive, and dying after X amount of time, it saved it. So, let me give you an invented, but simple example. Let's say cell is producing at 100%, but then high-stress situation occurs, nutrients are low for an extended period of time. Cell continues to still function at 100%. It isn't thinking, it doesn't &quot;know&quot; it is in high stress. It just has molecules bumping around. Billions and trillions of cells go through this and live and die. However, let's say 1 cell in a high stress environment has a novel mutation where all of a sudden just by random evolutionary luck (Note, there were likely millions of other mutations that occurred in other sister cells over the years and nothing happened, since most mutations do not bring increased fitness), this cell however, produced a new protein, that just by random dumb evolutionary luck happened to be a certain shape, which just so happened to bind to a certain regulatory part of the DNA, which just so happened to cut cellular function to 50% when in a high-stress environment.</p>
<p>Think of it this way. This new protein, coded on the DNA, is in some region that is packaged away so it never transcribes, however, in a high stress environment, loss of nutrients, all of a sudden proteins keeping the DNA all together are not coming as frequent and some of it opens up, and this region of the DNA can now be transcribed. Wow, you now have a protein that only is activated in a high stress  time, and by random dumb luck, it also happened to be an inhibitory protein that cuts the function of the cell, and all of a sudden now this family of cells, with this new protein are living 2 days whilst all the others are only living 1 day. Then, they end up in a climate where the loss of nutrients is usually only about 36 hrs, so now the old genome slowly gets wiped out whilst the new genome with the new protein becomes the dominant one. No thinking involved, just random evolutionary luck of the molecules, of which there were likely millions if not billions of useless previous other mutation in sister cells. They happen a lot more frequently than people realize.</p>
<p>Now, imagine this simple process going on for billions of years. All of a sudden it starts to make sense how some of these things can come to be, even without an active brain to guide them. All of a sudden you begin to realize that wow, the cell really is freakin insanely complex. I mean, there will be one protein that activates 30 other proteins, which all have sub-signaling activities, and then nested loops and other regulatory pathways that evolved over time, and noise buffers built in to the signalling pathways and so on and so on.</p>
<p>So, it's not that in epigenetics they &quot;know what gene to make less active,&quot; it's just that it just so happens to be when a cell is under certain conditions there is a domino effect, and millions and billions of years of accumulating these random events happened to create things that become &quot;conserved.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, what this means is that there are certain DNA functions that have evolved that are so useful, if they were to break, the cell would likely die off or not reproduce as easily as before, thus they become conserved. Many proteins are the same across species. Many are the same even from plant to animal, they are just so critical for certain cellular processes and for life to occur, they are <em>conserved</em> and survive. Some evolved events in regards to DNA methylation were conserved because it increased the likelihood of that cell outliving others, likely meaning it will reproduce more frequently or easily, thus eventually becoming the dominant genome. Hope this helps a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could read your stuff for hours.  So interesting!</p>
<p>I like how you have a data and computational perspective on this. Your mention of loops really hit home for me.</p>
<p>I wonder about the examples where researchers have programmed &quot;life&quot; experiments where the code some rules and let the program run to simulate some of this.  </p>
<p>Can one of the challenges to AI kind of have to do with the fact that the information is somehow less densely stored at all?  Life is not equivalent to AI but If DNA is encoded in 4 bits and Binary in 2 does that give any sort of hindrance to simulations?!</p>
<p>I realize that might not be your field of study per se, but it seems evocative that biology has a 4 bit encoding with billions of years (or maybe quickly in a million or so for unicellular) to evolve into life and we are trying to work on AI that has GHz timescales with only two bits.</p>
<p>This idea might be a bit hard to unpack but that seems like something to me.</p></div>		</li>
