			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing happens whenever I use stimulants for my adhd. Nicotine, caffeine, amphetamine, they all tell my body that I've got shit to do, and will heavily suppress my appetite. On the other hand, the sedative antihistamine that I take at night makes me compensate for all I missed eating during the day. Sometimes I eat half of my days calories between 8 and 10 pm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might've guessed it, but that doesn't have much to do with actual hunger. Hunger is when your body craves energy; nervous snacking is your body craving pleasant stimuli. Eating just becomes one of many ways to try to find comfort in a measly attempt to ease your discomfort. That's why feeling full doesn't mark the point where you want to stop eating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body has 2 main types of states : fight or flight as previously described and &quot;sit and digest&quot;.</p>
<p>Both are controlled by hormones</p>
<p>If you're stressing out about something your body starts producing the flight or fight hormone which feels really uncomfortable and makes you worry.</p>
<p>In that situation some people start eating because it triggers the release of the &quot;sit and digest&quot; hormone which makes your body relax and feel better by overruling the fight or flight hormone.</p></div>		</li>
