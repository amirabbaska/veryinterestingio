<p>The Liberal Party in Australia is called that way because they are economically liberal. They are laissez faire capitalists, believing in open and free markets and minimal government intervention in business. The party who leans towards lower taxes, less red tape and restrictions on companies etc. Freedom from government ... that sort of thing. This aligns them more with the Republicans in the US. But that's liberalism to us, or rather, economic liberalism. But they aren't socially liberal. They are conservatives on that front.</p>

<p>That is exactly what the Republican Party is here in the US.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah so you can see my problem when explaining politics in Australia to people here in the US. The Liberal Party of Australia is not what Americans think it is unless I explain this :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a bit more nuanced in Australia as well because the parties are based on how the economy should be run, they're not so united when it comes to policies outside of fiscal policies. So you end up with a right wing traditionalist Catholics wing in the Labor party and socially progressive members of the Liberal party. That's also not taking into account of the traditionally agrarian socialist National party which is in an coalition with the Liberal party.</p>
<p>This veering way out of ELI5 territory though.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep absolutely - it's complicated. It leaves people like me who are relatively centrist in a bit of a pickle sometimes. Decades ago I used to vote Coalition before they jumped the shark and went all neoliberal and socially regressive.</p>
<p>I actually lean a bit their way in principle in terms of believing strongly in individual liberties. But I can't vote for them now. Their stance on environmental issues is particularly galling to me - why oh why isn't there a party out there that actually respects what experts and scientists tell them? I don't see how you need to deny climate change to also be economically liberal: there's potentially huge business in new forms of energy and Australia could be a world leader. Why did they rip up the FTTP NBN when anyone will tell you that jobs and the wider economy this century are going to depend more and more on the ability to push huge volumes of data around? It's insane. But this is off topic for this sub... :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a better explanation than most.  It is easier to focus on the party base belief structure than in the liberal, conservative, or progressive title.  People often find themselves supporting opposing parties in different countries because they do not understand the stance of the party.  They just assume liberal and conservative are universal concepts.  Since each country has grown in different ways, different structures and values may be considered conservative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not twisted in the u.s it just describes social liberalism instead of economic liberalism.  In the u.s liberalism means the freedom to be who you like and mmke your own decicions about life. Conservative is similarily a social description about norms and customs. You are right that our liberals are economically liberal but i could say your liberals arent socially liberal as well.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but historically (as in ~100 years ago) the word 'liberal' was used only to describe economic matters. Starting around the time of FDR, Americans started to use it for social matters instead (substituting it for the word progressive).</p>
<p>When I say 'twisted', I mean it has changed meaning in the US over the last century, but hasn't changed meaning elsewhere, leading to a disconnect. We don't use the word 'liberal' in relation to social policy.</p></div>		</li>
