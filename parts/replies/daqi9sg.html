<p>Some people like the term &quot;borrowed life&quot; when talking about viruses.  They don't have their own metabolism (and thus life), they have to steal it from somewhere else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_letter" target="_blank">Chain letters</a> are probably the best analogy for viruses I know of. A virus particle <a href="http://sciencelearn.org.nz/var/sciencelearn/storage/images/contexts/fighting-infection/sci-media/images/virus/298120-1-eng-NZ/Virus.jpg" target="_blank">consists</a> of a protein shell encasing genetic code in the form of DNA or RNA. Some viruses, though not all, also have an envelope around the protein coat that is made up of the same kind of fatty membrane that our own cells are surrounded by. On the outside of the virus, either jutting out from the envelope or from the protein shell directly, are small proteins (called spikes in the picture) that can bind to cells in order to be absorbed by the cells. The DNA/RNA in the middle contains instructions to produce more — lots more! — of the viral proteins, the ones making up the shell and the ones required to bind to cells.</p>
<p>A chain letter works in pretty much the same way. It arrives in a form fit for travel, typically an e-mail though it might be an SMS or an actual paper letter. This is analogous to the protein shell. It's often got something to draw your attention and make you read it, like a headline. This is analogous to the &quot;spikes&quot; binding to cells making them absorb the virus. And finally, the contents of the letter are instructions that tell you to send it forward to a dozen of your friends or something like that. This is analogous to the DNA/RNA segments inside the virus, which are taken as instructions by the protein-producing ribosomes in our cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Didnt want to hijack top comment with this question but picked yours. How do viruses fit into the theory of evolution?  Did viruses evolve from bacteria/single cell organisms in the primordial soup or vice versa? </p>
<p>Edit: Wow didn't expect my comment to produce such a discussion. Was really enlightened by alot of said comments. It seems to be one of life's great mysteries. The fascination of viruses is what led to the question and by all means I'm not an expert on said debate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is thought that viruses have appeared mutiple times in the tree of life. At the very base of the tree you have three types of (single celled) organisms; Bacteria, Archaea (together forming the Prokaryotes) and Eukaryotes. The latter evolved to form much of the macroscopic life we see today such as plants and animals, as well as fungi and algae. </p>
<p>Viruses are specfic to these branches in the tree of life. So bacterial viruses cannot infect archaea or animals for instance, and vice versa. </p>
<p>As for their origin, viruses appear to be the replication mechanisms of cells that have somehow &quot;broken out&quot; of their original cells. Seeing as bacteria can exchange DNA amongst themselfs (without reproducing) or even take up DNA fragments floating around in their environment (a proces called lateral gene tranfer) it might not be hard to imagine still functional reproductive proteins from a dead cell being taken up &quot;hijacking&quot; the replication mechanisms of cells they come into contact with, eventually evolving into viruses.</p>
<p>This also explains the specificity of viruses, as viral proteins derived from bacteria are only compatible with the replication mechanisms of bacteria. The lack of viruses that can infect life forms across any of the three major branches may indicate that viruses have arisen after bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes split off from their common ancestor, so quite some time after the &quot;primordial soup&quot; state, although I can't remember much specifics about the time frame.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Out of the three major branches of the tree of life Archaea are the only ones that are never pathogenic (as far as we know now, but very little is known about Archaea).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a <em>very</em> complex question. There were probably some form of viruses before cells were even a thing. But DNA-based viruses would probably not exist when life was still based on RNA. Viruses and 'classical life' most likely have a very long relationship with each other, and not a single event that separated them.</p>
<p>Life is basically a very successful self-reproducing system. Sometime, it happen that a subset of that system is able to reproduce itself (and only himself, not the rest of the original system). It then begin to reproduce on its own, in the sense that it can reproduce itself many times while his host only does that once.</p>
<p>This kind of separation that is the birth of a virus probably happened many times. Retrovirus have information for RNA reverse transcriptase, the protein that converts the RNA information back into DNA. This whole protein doesn't make sense if the cells around the virus are not based on protein to function (as they were very early in life).</p>
<p>As an aside, the primordial soup is kind of a outdated view on early life. While many description of early life are educated speculation, the primordial soup is really based on too many assumptions and is slowly getting rebutted by Occam's razor (and IMHO reeks of weird mysticism).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vice Versa. I remember reading there was evidence that Viruses are thought to be older than bacteria, potentially being produced from the complex array of self-replicating molecules formed in the primordial soup even before the first living prokaryotic cell was produced.</p>
<p>It's a difficult topic though, because modern viruses require a cell to hijack to replicate, so the chicken and the egg head scratcher applies here. But it's possible that some early, very basic virus like bunch of molecules were produced entirely randomly and because they were never alive to begin with, just floated around until one day cellular life began and viruses slowly developed an 'evolutionary advantage' to hijack those cells for their resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. And they can evolve so rapidly (and with so many mistakes) that describing a single &quot;strain&quot; of virus can sometimes not make sense itself. Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_quasispecies" target="_blank">quasispecies</a> and the cool gif it has for more info.</p>
<p>Basically, yes, thinking of them as malicious code is quite accurate in many cases. Sometimes they can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_toxin#Origin" target="_blank">benevolent</a> (depending on your perspective) as well!</p></div>		</li>
