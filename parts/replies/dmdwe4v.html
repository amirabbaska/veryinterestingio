			<div class="markdown"><p>They both change, but it's proportional. If a 1 GHz carrier gets shifted by 1 Hz, the data rate will also be shifted by 1 ppb. However, this can usually be ignored because it is so small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little confused by how that would be possible. The modulating source won't increase how fast bits are sent just because the receiver sees an apparent increase in carrier frequency</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't actually done the math to make sure this is correct - but I think it is. To get a doppler effect you're moving towards (or away from) the transmitter. So if you are moving towards the transmitter, you reach the end of the message sooner than you would have if you were in the same place.  So in essence you see the packets closer together as you move towards the receiver, and the time between the start and end of the message is shorter. Bits are transmitted at the same rate, but you're intercepting them sooner if you're moving than stationary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole signal gets stretched or compressed in time. This affects the carrier and the modulation. Usually it's only major consideration for the carrier as the carrier is a significantly higher frequency than the modulation. </p>
<p>They only way to affect the carrier without affecting the modulation is to demodulate, frequency shift the carrier separately, then re-modulate. But this is not how RF signals propagate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you only recieve faster when you move towards the transmitter. The signal is not sent any faster. If you move past the router you recieve the signals slower though.</p></div>		</li>
