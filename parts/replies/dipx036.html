			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually secondary drowning. Dry drowning is a bit different..</p>
<p>Your vocal cords, which sit at the top of your airway, are quite sensitive. In dry drowning, water hits the vocal cords which causes spasm - otherwise known as laryngospasm. In basic terms, the vocal cords snap shut in a protective reflex which seals off the lungs. In reality, the victim suffocates rather than drowns - no water enters the lungs. </p>
<p>Secondary drowning, which you have described, is an inflammatory process where irritation occurs due to water actually entering the lungs (which it does not in dry drowning). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It tends to happen in younger children more than adults. The response is physiological. You're body really isn't great at distinguishing between something it should be able to handle and something dangerous. </p>
<p>It's a similar reaction as allergies. It's automatic and you really can't control it.</p></div>		</li>
