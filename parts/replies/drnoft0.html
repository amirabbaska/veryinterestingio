			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to add onto this part in particular:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Well the data is “modulated” onto RF spectrum! Don’t want to get too technical… but you basically encode 0s and 1s onto a RF wave by altering the “phase” and/or “amplitude” of the wave… There are actually rules for this (see DVB-S2 or DVB-S2X). Anyway, the data has been modulated onto a physical signal, and the big dish on the gateway transmits that towards the satellite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same principle is used for fiber, ethernet, coax etc. It's a physical signal where the digital data is modulated onto whatever medium the transport requires (electricity for ethernet, light for fiber, etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same principle, yeah, but massively more complicated to do on a satellite. Wireless is already tough compared to wired, but satellites have a really frustrating problem in selecting the frequency band. The issue comes with the fact that higher-frequency signals give you more throughput but are more susceptible to atmospheric effects (rain-fade), so the higher your frequency, the more bandwidth, but also a less reliable connection. That's why your satellite TV (Usually around the C to Ku bands) gets unreliable when it's rainy, but your GPS (down in the L band) doesn't stop working.</p>
<p>So, you wanna cram as much data as you can into the lower-bandwidth, lowest-possible frequency range, but that also means your error rate starts to increase depending on how you achieve that. This isn't acceptable, both since telemetry info is often sent through the same system and because customers like their connection to work. That's when you get geniuses coming up with new ways to do this encoding.  For example, QPSK and 8PSK (Quadrature/8 Phase-Shift Keying) lets you cram the same amount of data as other methods into much smaller bandwidths, without increasing the rate of errors. These got their start in satellite comms, but they're starting to be used more commonly in things like WIFI and Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Anyway, just wanted to add to your addition. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the risk of failure. Insurance is all about the probability of failure and the cost of failure. You find that magical number and charge a little more. If the failure probability is 50% and the cost of failure is $100 million, then your insurance is gonna be north of $50 million. If the failure probability is 0.1% and the cost of failure is still $100 million, then your insurance is gonna be north of $100k. These formulas are of course much more complicated, but these are simplistic examples to show how insurance rates work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insurance costs drive a lot of reliability engineering and testing, reliable builders and launchers are cheaper to insure than the less reliable companies.  Even specific designs can slide the costs into more or less if it's say a copy of a proven design vs something newer and not as well proven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on the financing part (the &quot;big loan of hundreds of millions of $&quot;): smaller companies can use a type of financing called project finance in order to pay for an expensive satellite. </p>
<p>With this structure, the owner could borrow 80% of the cost of the satellite. This means the owner &quot;only&quot; needs to put in 20% of the satellite cost. Lenders provide funds because 1) they are comfortable that the future revenues from the contracts the owner has will repay the loan and/or other customers can be easily found; 2) all revenues are held in an account the owner can't touch until each loan payment is made; 3) if the owner defaults, the lenders will take control of the satellite (possibly including the contracts with customers) and can sell it to another operator to recoup the loan; 4) if the satellite manufacturer is late in completing construction they'll pay penalties that are enough for lenders to receive loan payments during the delay; 5) if the satellite construction is never completed there is a penalty from the manufacturer that will repay the loan entirely; 6) there is insurance on the satellite that will protect lenders' loan. </p>
<p>Owners may use this type of financing because they can borrow a large portion of the construction cost, they can still pay themselves any profits left after making the loan payments, and if something fails then lenders can't come after the owner for any more money (called &quot;non-recourse&quot;). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, it's basically a loan with the satellite as collateral, and a few provisions to make sure the lender is paid first.  I know that's a massive simplification, but it just doesn't seem too far out in terms of financing.  Which, I guess, is why it's called &quot;project finance&quot; instead of &quot;satellite finance.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Project finance is a discipline of finance that traditionally applies to large infrastructure, such as power plants, airports, toll roads, mines and refineries. But the same structures can also apply to other types of assets like satellites and electricity smart metering. </p></div>		</li>
