			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been suspended for taking a different route than most students to school (wherein I drove past the front entrance around the block, got the best parking). A police officer saw me drive past the school, and not into the parking lot, and pulled me over for skipping school. I was on my way to school, had never skipped, had a friend with me who I brought to school every morning on the same route. Police officer wrote a report that he caught me leaving school property and I was lying. Then I was told I had to sign what was basically a written confession, and acceptance of my 3 day after school suspension as punishment. I adamantly refused to sign, because it was not true. My friend refused once, we both got yelled at, friend said screw it and signed and took 3 days after school suspension. I continued to refuse to sign the paper saying I was skipping school, so then I was told to sign a new paper accepting the punishment of 7 day out of school suspension for insubordination. I asked what my insubordination was, and was told it was my refusal to sign the first paper. I wound up spending a week at home out of this whole debacle, and all I did was try and go to school, tell the truth and be called a liar, refuse to lie on a written document, and raise concern about intimidating minors into signing things. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a &quot;fight&quot; in the middle of one of the intersections of the hallway one morning on my way to 4th period, I caught a glimpse of the action and someone basically placed two action figures of Batman and Wolverine in the center and were backing people up out of the way and yelling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would the police pull you over? Since you were driving a car you were at least in High School, that means that that a class could've easily been cancelled or not scheduled at all at that moment. When I was in High School (the Netherlands) we went to the mall often, when we had no class or even if we were skipping. And if we'd run into police it was no problem. Absences were handled internally, if you skipped a class you had detention worth two classes. One to 'replace' the skipped class and one as punishment. The department of education is informed of all absences, permissible or not. But they only act when it gets out of hand.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not how high school generally runs in the US. School is scheduled from 7:30am-2:30pm (or something close to that) and you are expected to stay in the building the whole time. Some schools do have an &quot;open campus&quot;, which means seniors are allowed to leave for lunch, but that's it. Other common reasons you may be allowed the leave at a different time: you are in a vocational program for half a day and drive yourself between schools, you are dual enrolled at the local community college and leave to go to class there, you are a senior that needs fewer credits to graduate and leave to get to hours at a job (confirmed by the school). Attempting to leave the building without permission otherwise is a punishable offence (detention, etc).   </p>
<p>Classes don't get &quot;cancelled&quot; unless there is a school event or assembly you are supposed to attend. If a teacher is out that day, a sub runs the class with an assignment that was left for them.by the usual teacher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had police who were assigned to the school for just that purpose (Chicago suburbs, Illinois, USA). Many schools have truancy officers, who are often school employees not actual police, but we had a truancy officer who was. They job was to report you to your legal guardian and the school. School attendance is mandated by law, and the relevant protective agents of a minor are the school and the parents (or other legal guardian). My high school also happened to be one of the nation's 100 largest schools, so it was useful to have an actual peace officer as well as school employed security guards there. Busting a kid with drugs or a weapon was a fairly common occurrence, so having a person who could actually make an arrest there was a handy perk. The purpose of the truancy officers were to catch and report truant students, but it was also just convenient to have police on campus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can agree on both sides. Got in a few fights. Got suspended. Taught everyone a lesson. Also got suspended for telling a teacher &quot;you don't have to be a dick to the kid&quot; for sarcastically praising a kid for bringing his F's up to D's at the end of the year. I was just supporting a classmate, ended up getting a 5 day weekend for it. Parents didn't get it, but didn't hold what I said against me.</p>
<p>Fast forward 6 years, I would kill for that extra time off. If only goofing off at work earned me days off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also an educator, there's other factors that play into suspension that act as a deterrent to students.</p>
<p>One is the inconvenience of the child being at home during the day. Many parents work or have other duties and they can't always find time to manage a child at home on suspension. It's also a direct way of having parents take responsibility for that child, which is sometimes the biggest problem leading to behaviour problems in the first place.</p>
<p>The second benefit to suspension as a deterrent is removing a child from their friendship groups. While some children hate school, they find school important for socialisation. I've had students admit the only reason they come to school is to be with their friends. Take that away, have that child removed from their friendship groups, hurts them greatly. Students have also admitted that they fear time away from their friends because it hurts their relationships. That child becomes an outlier if they miss time with their friends too much.</p>
<p>I agree with you that suspension is often overused. Our school is reluctant to use it. Often we try to use internal suspensions where the child is still being engaged in learning but away from friend groups and negative influences. This often works well and is a good deterrent. </p>
<p>That said (and I'm probably going to be heavily criticised for this) but my opinion is that there's a high correlation between engaged parenting and engaged students. When the parents aren't engaged, there's little the school can do to effectively change a student's behaviour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In your first point you say that you are forcing the parents to take responsibility for their children. You also say that the children that are most likely to receive suspension are those that come from a lacking environment. Are you not making the situation worse by forcing the child and parents to deal with a suspension in those situations? And in those environments isn't it also more likely that the parents will take a more 'Aint got no time for yo suspended ass.' mentality, having the kid end up home alone for a day or more?<br />
The internal suspension however seems like a good middle ground. You still take away some of the more enjoyable parts of school while still getting them the education they need. And you don't put responsibility in a possibly bad place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no magic solution. If there was, this would be easy. Having the child out of school forces the parent to engage. Sometimes it's not easy because some parents don't want to be part of their child's education, while other parents are genuinely busy working to support that child. But having the child out of school means their behaviour needs to be directly addressed by the parent. Yes, in some cases the parent just won't care. But we hope that the parent will be inspired by the suspension to intervene and take action to help manage their child's behaviours.</p>
<p>However, in all honestly, sometimes the only benefit of a suspension is to get that child out of the school for a few days to give the teachers (and students who are trying to learn) some breathing space. It changes classroom dynamics and helps teachers get back to their teaching instead of spending time on behaviour management. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Because some people are very touchy about parenting skills. Especially on anonymous websites where people are quick to anger. I expected a barrage of comments defending absent parenting.</p></div>		</li>
