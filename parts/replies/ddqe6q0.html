<p>Reclaimed is on-site; Recycled is from another area... is that the difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall that iron slag is an excellent mineral additive to concrete in a similar way as fly ash, but it was relatively expensive compared to fly ash. </p>
<p>RAP and crumb rubber (recycled tires) are both excellent recycled products for HMA if that's what your town is looking for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well our issue is it was paved once before with a slag based pavement, but it has deteriorated quite terribly in some areas. We're hoping to accomodate bicyclists, but with conditions as they currently are you have to carry your bike over some areas. We are hoping the new paving will not break down so terribly.</p></div>		</li>
