			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add to this comment, since I relate a lot to it. To clarify, I went to the doctor and we were never able to exactly identify the cause, if it was a gluten intolerance, allergy to wheat or yeast, or what, but we treated it like a gluten intolerance.</p>
<p>After I came back from living in Korea for a year and a half, I began eating bread products like crazy again. I didn't eat much bread while in Korea (the bread there was very different), but I did have specific symptoms whenever I did eat bread occasionally, and when I drank alcohol. Before going to Korea I ate bread regularly, and was able to drink. </p>
<p>When I came to Canada, I ate a lot of bread (but rarely drank- a bit on that later), and I developed weird symptoms that I have had before, but never made the connection. I'd get extremely tired/ exhausted, cramps, dizziness, vomiting, and fevers (never registering a temperature, but hot to touch). I had a couple of times when I was so sick I would just try to sleep off the symptoms. I went to the doctor and she advised me to monitor what I ate, but I kinda ignored that for a couple of months and just continued on. In January the symptoms got intense, and the pattern really started to emerge. I'd eat bread- get super sick (vomiting excessively- 13 times in one day on an empty stomach)- so I'd eat soup only (didn't feel like having any bread), recover, then start eating bread again then go through the same process of feeling sick again with the same symptoms.</p>
<p>Went to the doctor again and she suggested it might be a gluten intolerance or something similar, and that it could be the drastic change in diet. One thing I should note though- I had some of these symptoms develop while in Korea when I drank alcohol. At first I could drink 3 soju bottles with no problem (think weaker vodka, size of a coolers bottle), but soon I developed these fevers and vomiting that would get me sick for at least 24 hours later, even after just having 1 shot, or just a bit of alcohol (I drank other things too). Coming back from Canada I found wine did the same thing to me, and I did experience the same thing when eating potato chips that had a large amount of yeast extract as part of the flavouring. So whatever it was, yeast or gluten specifically, it's really hard to really determine. All I can say- my symptoms of fevers and vomiting and feeling exhausted were very real and really affected me for a long time, just like a gluten intolerance rather than celiac (which would cause immediate symptoms, rather than a delayed appearance of symptoms).</p>
<p>The strategy the doctor came up with for me was to go gluten free and slowly try and reintroduce gluten products back into my diet while also taking a probiotic to heal my gut. It's been 4 months, and I've been able to have the occasional bread-thing about once a week without any symptoms, and even had a glass of wine recently and had  minimal symptoms (felt a bit feverish). </p>
<p>For me, I am tired of some people claiming that I was wrong for treating it as a gluten intolerance because it &quot;doesn't exist&quot;, or jumping the gun and say I should go to a doctor to get a professional opinion when I asked about going gluten free. But my symptoms were severe and real, and like I said, although my doctor and I treated it as a gluten intolerance we weren't able to identify exactly what it was. But going gluten free helped, and I do find /u/p3tunia 's explanation of the microbiome really applied to my situation. If anything, even if you don't think gluten intolerance is a thing, at least it has been able to give celiacs and those with similar allergies a lot more options when it comes to gluten free products. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thought with a lot of it is if you don't eat something for a long time, and then binge on it, your going to get sick.  I had a friend that had no food problems, decided to go gluten free for a few months, and proceeded to freak out when she ate pizza and got sick.  Well no shit you got sick you haven't eaten a pizza in 6 months and just ate 4 slices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine there is also an increase in diagnosing or recognizing the disorder.<br />
My granny has celiac.  She had been sick all of her life and no one knew why-- they just assumed she was 'sickly' and the nuns at school would feed her oatmeal to try to help her put on weight.<br />
Once she started having kids they told her it was stress.<br />
She ended up in the hospital a few times but they didn't know what was wrong. Eventually, around her late 20s (I think, probably around the early to mid 1950s) she was omitted to the hospital for several months. She was basically dying. But they had this new specialist and he thought he knew what it might be. He ran a bunch of tests on her and a few other people in her ward and told her she had celiac. I imagine if he hadn't been there she would have died.<br />
My dad also didn't realize he couldn't eat gluten until he stopped for a few months and then try to eat it again. I guess he just thought feeling like that was normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is anecdotal, but my sister has been diagnosed with gluten intolerance <em>and</em> celiac disease. </p>
<p>my wife has recently started baking bread from unprocessed stone-milled flours, all of which include the germ. It is also grown in a controlled environment without pesticides (whether or not that makes a difference, i don't know) and no additional chemicals are added. The mill, i guess, gets away with this because they are so small and are able to guard against pests by working on a made-to-order basis and never keeping large stores. Anything stored is vacuum packed.  </p>
<p>My sister is able to eat my wife's bread without any issue. </p>
<p>edit: Recieviing TONS of pm's. The name of the mill is Barton Springs Mill, <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/lifestyles/food--cooking/barton-springs-mill-turns-ancient-grains-into-fresh-flour/aEt3RE7xYbG9Se7gPNGG5H/" target="_blank">here is a nice article about them</a>. You can look them on facebook or find their webpage through google. They are new and still experimenting with everything. The owner is definitely incredibly passionate about what he does and has been incredibly encouraging for local professionals and amateurs alike. </p>
<p>edit 2: i'm not a doctor. I don't know anything more about my sister's medical conditions. This was purely anecdotal information. additionally, the specific bread was a whole wheat sourdough </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow.. that's REALLY interesting. I hope that one day a study will be done based around this idea. </p></div>		</li>
