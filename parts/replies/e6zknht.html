			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question and interesting physics problem! </p>
<p>Force, as you know, can be expressed as mass x acceleration. </p>
<p>It can also be expressed as the rate of change in momentum, if mass is constant. In other words, f = m a = m d(v) / dt = d(p) / dt.  But momentum overall has to be conserved. This makes it a little more intuitive - if momentum is imparted on the surroundings in one direction, then the object must acquire the same amount of momentum in the other direction.</p>
<p>So the question boils down to: which approach imparts more directional momentum to the environment?</p>
<p>This is where the problem gets really fun (if you're into fluid mechanics) or really fucky if you haven't done that shit in school yet. There are two <em>major</em> competing factors (neglecting drag).</p>
<p>Efficiency! Moving small amounts of fluid at high speed into a surrounding medium is not the most efficient way to transfer momentum. Moving large amounts of fluid at low speed into a surrounding medium is a more efficient way to transfer momentum. The reasons deserve their own science post and I won't go into them here.</p>
<p>Thrust! One important takeaway of the momentum equation is that the amount of thrust you get depends not just on how much air you move, but how fast the air around you is already moving. The force you can exert on the environment decreases to zero as the speed of the air you're blowing into the environment approaches the speed of the air around you. </p>
<p>This is why, if you're curious, commercial jets appear to have huge engines and military jets appear to have itty bitty ones. The commercial jets are all about efficiency and power at a certain speed. There's a wee jet engine (relatively - it is still huge) in the commercial jet engines powering a gigantic fan that moves shit tons of air just a little faster than the cruising speed of the plane. The air on the side that just goes through the fan and not the engine is called &quot;bypass,&quot; because it bypasses the jet engine, and this air accounts for most of the thrust.</p>
<p>Military hardware is powered by jet engines of a similar size, but that bypass very little. These jets put out a much narrower column of much faster air. This is very inefficient compared to the big commercial jets, <em>but</em> they can keep accelerating up to a much higher airspeed. (Also, being smaller, harder to shoot.)</p>
<p>Don't get me started on drag or issues at Mach today please. That shit's hard. </p>
<p>Anyway, leafblower problem - the umbrella, depending how it's shaped, could push a large amount of the air backward and give you <em>more</em> forward thrust than you would obtain by merely pointing the leafblower backward. This, of course, would depend very much on the shape of the umbrella and a lot of other things. What happens mechanically is that a high-pressure zone (a stagnation zone) would form in the umbrella, and air would shoot up, out along the sides, and backward, imparting forward thrust. </p>
<p>But the amount of thrust obtained would depend on your forward speed and on the size and shape of the umbrella. Here's where I could see a very evil fluid mechanics question being written for some undergraduate. One you reach a certain speed, the umbrella is no longer able to impart more forward thrust. At that point, the backwards leafblower might still be able to push you, even if it's less efficient. </p>
<p>Long answer. Phew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how reverse thrust on an aircraft works. You cannot turn the engines around or make them operate in reverse. But you can deploy a metal umbrella behind them to redirect the thrust forwards. This saves on wheel braking meaning better braking during wet conditions and less brake wear. It also means you can allow less time for the brakes to cool back to safe temperatures before your next take off.</p>
<p>It’s generally not used to reverse from the aircraft gate because of the risk of the engines ingesting foreign object debris (“FOD”) blown off the tarmac.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which, just to clarify, isn't to say that reverse thrust is <em>never</em> used to back an aircraft. As a crew member on military cargo aircraft, there is many scenarios in which we use reverse thrust to back the aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just saw a story about the F-35, and while it was mostly about how they are increasingly over buget, they had a nice close up of how the reverse thrust (I would guess used to slow the aircraft on landing). It reminded me of the same principle they have used with jet skis. </p></div>		</li>
