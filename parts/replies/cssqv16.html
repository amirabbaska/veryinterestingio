			<div class="markdown"><p>In larger, commercial walk-ins, especially freezers which optimally run at -10°F, we use what's called a vent relief port. This allows the pressures to equalize and break the vacuum quicker. It can be especially scary for some people when a door closes behind you in a freezer and gets stuck due to said vacuum.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first time this happened to me, it scared me shitless.. I thought people were intentionally holding the door closed. After about 15 seconds, the temperature had stabilized to where I could shoulder the seal open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked in some walk in freezers which purposely have a large leaver to open the door from either side. Pulling the lever cracks the seal and then you can slide the door with the handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't from the warm air cooling and shrinking.  The seals often have a thin magnetic strip to help them want to seal. The effect of the cooling air would be air sucked around the seal not pushing the door closed.  Until the seal happens the pressure on both sides of the door is equal, pressure differentials come from isolated systems like after the seal is made but not just before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When this happens, I don't grab the handle to open the fridge door coz it's too hard and when you have ornaments on top of the fridge, they usually shake and I'm afraid of them falling unto me. Instead, I stick my index finger anywhere on the seal and pry it open and usually the whole door just opens up. Works every time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My fridge has a small pedal below the door which you step on to open the door initially. It's always really hard to open the door without using that pedal, not sure if that's due to a good seal or an intentionally lower pressure inside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this explains the large refrigerators at work. This sometimes happens when I can't reopen them for a few seconds. I always thought there was some kind of lock to prevent constant rapid opening of the door. I didn't know why it would need this feature, but I thought it was a necessity for large refrigerators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure they do as part of normal operations. Those big heavy duty -80C for cells and other research stuff get insta-locked once you shut it. If you forgot to do something and need to reopen it again, better go do something else for a few mins.</p></div>		</li>
