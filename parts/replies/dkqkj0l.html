			<div class="markdown"><p>You should be paying payroll taxes on tips, so I disagree with number 3.  I fully realize that severs don't claim all the money they make, because it would result in more taxes.  Meanwhile the business isn't concerned, because if they did report truthfully the business would pay more in payroll taxes.</p>
<p>So one one hand if tips were eliminated payroll taxes would go up, but that is because a lot of servers are not accurately reporting their tips, and a lot of businesses are therefore not paying the correct amount in payroll taxes.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a valid argument.   IMHO, servers are doing themselves a disservice by not reporting all of their tips because they are shorting themselves out of employer contributions to their medicare, social security and unemployment.</p>
<p>This is self correcting though as more and more people move to credit cards as their primary payment method.   Servers can't hide credit card tips.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I was a delivery driver all of our orders were added up at the end of the night, credit receipts deducted (including any tips on the credit receipt) and then we just handed in what was owed any money left over was our total tips for the day.  I never declared a credit card tip we didn't differentiate them at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At my first job I was a waitress working third shift at Denny's. I always reported 100% of my tips. The other servers would scoff at me and tell me I was an idiot and then only put in maybe 5-10% of what they actually made (an average night was between 10-60 dollars). I would mention what they were doing was tax fraud and then get daggers stared through me. Needless to say I wasn't popular with the staff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you feel about tip pools? I'm currently bartending at a place where the entire FOH shares a tip pool. All tips go through management and are then distributed by hours worked on a weekly paycheck. However, the severs make an ass-ton more than the bartenders, sometimes upwards of $500 on a weekend night. But, after the tip pool share they may only have grossed 150/200 of that. Basically, we all hate the tip pool, it's not a transparent method of getting us our money and we just have to trust that owners/management aren't dipping into it. Nor do we know what we've made night after night until paychecks come out. Even then, if we want a daily breakdown we have to hunt a manager down, hope they aren't busy and then be shown the numbers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former waiter here.  There's nothing stopping a waiter from reporting 100% of their tip income, which would accomplish what you describe.  It would result in higher taxes to the waiter and the restaurant, with the trade-off being slightly more money in unemployment situations and higher SS benefits.  I think if you asked 100 waiters if that's what they want, 99 of them would say 'no'.</p></div>		</li>

But if you're talking about a career Captain or Bartender, the amount of social security and Medicare benefits that person is missing out on really adds up. Plus, many people aren't aware of how all that jazz works, so they get to a decent retirement age and then realize they have no social security benefits. Bad news.

You might be making $20 per hour average, but you're only getting paid $11 from the business (Washington state where I live does not permit an employer to pay less than minimum to tipped employees). Anyway you want to get a loan for whatever it is you want to get a loan for, and the bank only sees you reporting tips +wages of $13 an hour, and they say &quot;You're only making  $26,000 per year, and you want us to lend you  $200,000 for a house?

<blockquote>
<p>With the tipping system in place now, the highest value, most talented and hardest working employees are directly compensated by making a percentage of their higher gross sales and they are directly compensated for working the toughest, highest volume shifts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have proof for any of that, other than &quot;personal experience&quot;? Because it sounds like a load of bullshit that there is any correlation between &quot;hard working&quot; and high tip. People are very bad judges of how hard someone works, and they usually tip the pretty and nice female waitress more, even if a grumpy ugly dude might have worked even harder. Here's a <a href="http://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1156&amp;context=articles" target="_blank">study</a> that has shown that the relationship between service quality and tipping is tenable at best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you eliminate tipping and raise the price to $12, customer B will still come and probably still tip while customer A has been eliminated from your market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is still an example of <em>you</em> making a profit on your servers back. If customer A came and paid 0% tip, your servers were effectively underpaid for serving them, while you still make your profit. It's not in their interest to have customer A in the first place. It's only in your interest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(decreasing volume and the need for labor)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How about we pay everyone under 1$/hr! Cuz that'll be sure to increase the volume and need for labor. I mean it will also basically drive people into slavery, but hey, at least you got your margins, don't you?
Sorry, but the &quot;decreased volume&quot; argument is bullshit. It's not worth preserving jobs, if the jobs don't pay enough to make a living. Preserving the jobs at all cost is again in the interest of the businesses, not their employees.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And don't tell me I have to do additional hours of payroll acrobatics with fluctuating hourly payrates based on demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will tell you, though. If there's more work on weekends, hire more people on weekends. If there are some &quot;quiet times&quot;, rotate the people around who want that. It's <em>your</em> job to give your servers fair compensation and fair working hours. You are letting your customers do your job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tips are federally protected wages. I can't touch that money. It must go to the tipped employees. If I raised my prices and eliminated tipping, that money is now MINE to do with what I please. There are plenty of operators out there that would just slide some of that money into their pocket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wages are federally protected wages. You're basically saying &quot;yeah I'm a nice guy, but look at all the other evil employers! That's why I need to pay them less.&quot;, and in the process you are making them less secure. People need a fixed income, based on hourly work time. It puts them in a really precarious situation if they depend on money that may or may not come, depending on what lipstick they wear and how a guest might feel on that particular day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tipping system creates higher wages, lower operating costs and a less expensive dine in experience for customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been thoroughly debunked. The system creates lower operating cost and better income for you, with adverse effects for the customers and the servers.</p>

<p>The study you linked was based on the customers, but I think /u/t_p<em>h</em> 's point is that, from a server's POV, <em>they</em> are less likely to give outstanding service if their pay remains the same no matter what, which goes in conjunction with his point about servers prefering to work on Mondays rather than Fridays. </p>

<p>People are pretty decent judges of what does and does not constitute good service.

<p>The highest tip rate employee is male, bald and in his 40's.   He's really fucking good at his job.  The worst is a late 20's attractive female.   The difference in their tip rate is significant.   Again, anecdotal and perhaps an outlier.

<p>They are not. Peoples experiences are highly subjective, and depend on a myriad of factors that has absolutely nothing to do with anything that the servers do. Had a bad day? Bad experience.

<p>Again, your bills, your maintenance, your inventory - not theirs. It makes a profit for you, while they are getting paid less than if you just paid them a regular, fair amount of money. The &quot;chance&quot; of maybe getting a tip at another table is bad compensation.</p>

<p>It was an example. Your argument against paying your staff a fair and livable amount of money becaue it will decrease the number of jobs is literally centuries old.

<blockquote>
<p>More people work on the weekends. Less work during quiet times. Some staff prefer quiet times or do not want to work weekends.</p>

<p>Well perfect, so you got it set up already. So why don't you hire an appropriate amount of people for a higher workload, instead of relying on your customers to compensate your overworked employees?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you want my staff to make less money?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it only looks like less money when you don't consider the effects on society and the labor market.
Sure, if you were to change your policy alone in the current system, your staff may or may not make less money. If the entirety of the system were to change, they'd make more money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with many of your points. However, I have known people (I mean seriously, almost all of reddit is anecdotal, for sure that's one of the major reasons I even come here!) who have stated specfically that they tip attractive waitresses at a higher rate.</p>
<p>OTOH, my SO, who is an attractive waitress, hears <strong>(READ: fields a significant amount of complaints)</strong> from some of her male counterparts that she gets tipped far greater than they do. Of course, they aren't figuring the experience factor in here (25 years and a hard, reliable worker to boot). When you compare them to the lazy, attractive female workers, I find that it typically balances itself out.</p>
<p>&quot;Grumpy ugly dudes&quot;, as u/fat-lobyte puts it, typically aren't the hardest working <em>tipped</em> employees. They are usually in the dish pit. Grumpy people do not try very hard to be good at what they do, and thus the argument is fairly invalid.

<p>Don't define hard-working as an opinion on the quality of exact work they do in this case, but more as a measure of quantity. The servers who work more hours, sell more food, and run more tables have higher gross sales and thus more income. If you take more tables you get more money.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It's true that non-tippers are a bummer, but they are still rare enough that ON AVERAGE wages for servers are really good. It's some of the best entry level pay you can get as a young adult, but it's physical with long and inconvenient hours. Customer A does still help negligibly as they DO help keep the business open and you still earn your measly hourly wage. Yes it's underpaid, but it;s not zero-paid. And in a practical sense doesn't come up often enough to be a problem.</p>

<p>Yeah, but in REALITY this would be much more difficult and lead to more hardship that could ultimately be more dangerous for the employees. Restaurants ALREADY trim staff for Monday lunch and load up for Friday nights; what he was talking about was paying a higher hourly wage on Friday nights when sales are high, Vs. a lower wage on Monday lunch, which is insane and would create all kinds of staffing, discrimination, and financial nightmares. You didn't actually address his point, he said, &quot;fluctuating hourly pay-rates&quot; (which is what was relevant to his original point linking wages to gross sales vs. time worked) and you talked about scheduled balancing. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Wages are federally protected wages, but you missed his point: in a traditional system it is ENTIRELY up to the employer what percentage of income the business gets is given out in wages. AFTER the call is made the money is protected. Tips are completely out of the employer's hands; when the business booms and you make extra, they can't pocket that bonus for themselves like hourly jobs do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This has been thoroughly debunked. The system creates lower operating cost and better income for you, with adverse effects for the customers and the servers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is way too situational and regional to be &quot;thoroughly&quot; debunked. Besides, this is an entry-level, non-educated job, it would be fair to pay this job out at minimum wage (we are assuming minimum wage is livable; the fact it isn't is another American problem entirely but also for another conversation) The fact is, most servers make MORE than minimum wage ON AVERAGE over the course of their year AND guess what? If they don't, and an employee's tips combined with the employer's direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour do not equal the Federal minimum hourly wage, the employer must make up the difference.</p></div>		</li>

We shall rescue you from your evil overlords and pay you a &quot;living wage&quot;.  Let's say, two times minimum wage!  </p>

<p>I won't any more. If what you're saying is correct, and bartenders/waitresses are vastly overpaid for their efforts through the current tipping system, I can do my small part to correct that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In every case of &quot;why does it work there but not here&quot;, the answer is always &quot;because a support structure exists there but not here&quot;. You could just abolish tipping overnight, but then you'd need to adjust other areas such as payroll taxes, worker's attitudes towards work, and other legislative/cultural concerns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I made more delivering sandwiches for jimmy johns than my sister made teaching high school biology in Arizona.</p>
<p>People who make tips, and are good at their job, should be making just as much, if not more than the managers. When you factored all my earnings together I made more than the GM of my store. </p>
<p>You won't get any complaints from a server about the tip culture here. Only downside is lack of consistency but even a slow night at a good restaurant should net you like $15 an hour </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you are using &quot;good&quot; to mean that outliers can make well above the average, fine-- but that's not meaningful for a discussion about whether tipping provides more money than not-tipping at a national scale. </p></div>		</li>
