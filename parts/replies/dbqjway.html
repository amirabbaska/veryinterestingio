			<div class="markdown"><p>The probability would eventually hit zero (in the case for a particle having more energy than the sum total of all the energy in the system as a whole - an impossible state, I would think)... This isn't really relevant to anything, just an interesting (to me anyway) observation.</p>
<p>Actually wouldn't that mean that relatively speaking, there would be a zero probability for almost all values of energy, being that you have a finite range [0 - sum total of energy]where the probability is nonzero, and an infinite range (sum total of energy - infinite energy)?</p>
<p>I don't know. Just a silly thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that the probability would eventually hit zero for an isolated system, but in the real world there's no such thing as a truly isolated system. Also note, however, that the Boltzmann distribution is derived with the assumption that the system comes to equilibrium by being in contact with an effectively infinite heat reservoir, which is why it gives non-zero probabilities for all possible energies. In reality no system is at true Boltzmann equilibrium, but the differences are often far to small to be measurable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sum total of everything that exists (whether that be the universe or the multiverse, or whatever other term we eventually coin for the sum total of all existence, assuming such a thing beyond our universe actually exists) would be an isolated system (since by definition there would be no other things which it could interact with)... But at the same time there's no reason to suggest that the laws of physics that we've observed in this universe would necessarily apply to such a thing to begin with, so that observation becomes both trivial and profoundly useless to this topic.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm being super nitpicky in this topic, and I'm not trying to be, but it's just how I analyze subjects I don't really know all that much about. I appreciate you're putting up with me all the same.</p></div>		</li>
