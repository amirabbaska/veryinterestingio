			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that also one of the theories as to how Salmon know how to get back to their birth stream? Does that make their GPS all kinds of fucked up? Like when apple release maps? They're just running into random lakes and heading to the UK when theyre from missouri?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting idea! I'm not sure, never read into salmon migration beyond knowing we don't know the mechanism by which they do it. I'll have to check </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wondering now if they could they track shark populations that are already tagged to assist with predicting weather... Like if all the sharks haul ass out to sea, do we need to buy milk and bread and hunker down? Hmm....</p>
<p>Edit: The 'milk and bread' during storms is a well known joke across the southern states &amp; also has been used in sitcoms and by weather/news reports. I thought that would wrap up the overall statement as obvious satire/sarcasm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i mean yeah, probably. but a weather sattellite can measure changes in air pressure on its own.</p>
<p>Although, a network of cyborg sharks with long-range radio equipment guarding the Americas against all manner of nautical threats <em>does</em> sound amazing...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sharks actually create the sharknado themselves. They gather in great numbers (ranging from tens of thousands to even millions in some cases) and then begin swimming in circles in perfect unison. They start slow and gradually increase their speed until the sharknado is eventually formed. Some sharks remain submerged in the ocean itself, while others take flight. Those that remain within the ocean then actually guide the sharknado towards the intended target. Once it makes landfall, well, you know the rest. It's believed that sharks began doing this in order to feed on migratory birds. Just be glad that around 90% of sharknadoes occur in the middle the ocean, far from any land mass. </p></div>		</li>
