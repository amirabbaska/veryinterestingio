			<div class="markdown"><p>By chance. Genetic mutations can cause changes in the behavior. If the &quot;new&quot; behavior is advantageous, it will likely spread more often. It's possible that the first ant colonies to have eaten the fungal blooms resulting of this process were somehow more successful than other colonies, making them reproduce more and standardizing it along the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think through symbiosis. The ants started just eating the leaves, then a fungus infiltrated their stores of food, which the ants eventually grew accustomed to, and now the fungus is the main source of energy and not the leaves. Meanwhile, the ants allow the fungus to flourish. The two evolve hand-in-hand and fine tune their relationship</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, I don't know. From what I understand the honey bee (apis mellifera) and stingless bees found in Latin America (Meliponini) are the only ones that can make honey on a large scale. Bumblebees only make enough for themselves to survive. The ones I'm looking at bees in the  Osmia genus (mason bees) just lay eggs in a tunnel from dead wood and pack it full of bee bread (gathered up pollen packed tightly with bacteria) for food. They do not make honey. There are some interesting questions the Osmia genus and their relationship to flowers could raise like: Are flowers a way of transmitting the bee microbiome to other bees?   </p></div>		</li>
