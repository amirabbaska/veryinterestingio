			<div class="markdown"><p>In our research, we found that grocery bags were often a focus for recommended climate actions by government documents and science textbooks. For example, one of the [high school science textbooks] (<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/SCIENCE-10-Tom-Dickinson/dp/0070722226" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.ca/SCIENCE-10-Tom-Dickinson/dp/0070722226</a>) we analyzed says “making a difference doesn’t have to be difficult” and provided the example of switching from plastic to reusable shopping bags to save 5kg of CO2 per year. However, [our study] (<a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta" target="_blank">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta</a>) found that this is less than 1% as
effective for saving greenhouse gas emissions as a year without eating meat. While reducing [plastic waste that ends up in the oceans] (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768" target="_blank">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/768</a>) is an important environmental issue, our study shows that individual choices to eat a plant-based diet, avoid flying, live car-free, and plan smaller families make a much bigger difference for the climate. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was shocked at the amount of plastic bags used at Walmart or similar stores when I moved to the US from Germany. Many supermarkets/grocery stores in Germany don’t offer plastic bags at all but instead offer reusable bags so the customer has to either carry everything in their arms or buy a reusable bag. I think it’s up to the major supermarkets or grocery stores to collectively change their habits in order to see a significant change in pollution from plastic bags, but that is highly unlikely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is as important culturally as it is numerically. If we see plastics as disposable, we continue to cycle them quickly through our resource streams and litter the environment with them. The effect on wildlife and landfills is long-term and systemic, in turn affecting plant life and atmosphere.</p>
<p>Paper, by comparison, creates more GHG and takes more energy to produce, but requires no oil (necessarily) and produces no durable waste. It's only helpful to consider GHG output if we also include other metrics as well.</p>
<p>One effective way to gauge the impact of waste is in the amount of time it takes to break down and reintegrate into the food chain. For paper, in a matter of days or weeks it will compost into available carbon (if composted -- not landfilled, where it makes more GHG). Plastic will take decades to centuries to reintegrate, if at all. Some plastics won't break down until yet-to-evolve microbes adapt to digest them -- and we don't know what they would excrete. Possibly toxins. It's not a good wager.</p>
<p>For this reason, it's best to (1) reduce dependence on so-called disposables, (2) reuse these items, despite the social stigma of being &quot;cheap,&quot; and (3) choose recyclables that are low-impact (compostables, metal, and glass are best -- plastics degrade when recycled, release toxins, and have to be mixed with new plastics to be reformed into new goods).</p>
<p>Most of all, we need to put our needs before our wants -- balance before convenience. If there's something we should make more convenient, it's sustainable choices. This is the foundation of a stable and healthy living system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What regions was this study aimed at? Were these suggestions considered reasonable for places like the US, or is it meant more for urbanized, densely populated areas?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrocarbons (coal, gas, oil)  are locked up within the earth, until it is accessed, and not normally a part of the ecosystem, exception being some methane pockets; once used, it doesn't turn back into oil.  Vegetation grows, dies, and decomposes or burns (both release CO2), and grows again, so there's balance.  This is why growing trees is simply not enough, but it does help.  Pants utilize carbon, but it's still being used, we need to find a way to remove it, or lock it up long term.</p></div>		</li>
