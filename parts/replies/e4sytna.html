			<div class="markdown"><p>My ex-husband does this! He takes cancer tissue from dogs and humans and implants them in a mouse host. They then test various cancer treatments on the mouse until they find one that the cancer responds to. </p>
<p>Disturbingly, the cancer often outlives its mouse host and must be xenografted multiple times until a proper treatment is determined. </p>
<p>Fortunately for us? It seems that only certain cancer cells are able to be passed along in this fashion. There is a lot of evidence to support the idea of a cancer stem cell, and in my ex-husband's lab, they have tested and shown that only those &quot;stem cells&quot; seem to grow in their mouse host. Other cancerous tissue dies/fails to multiply in a new host.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cancer stem cells is a fragile theory. It has been disproved (in part) by very solid tests.
We know that almost every tumor tissue contains stem-like cells, but not every tissue survive the xenograft procedure. There are many factors that can influence the xenograft. In any case only stem cells tissue does not exist for what I know so the tissues that survive have for sure differentiated cells.
This is a super interesting topic. I would love to read some papers from your husband's lab. Working in xenograft is amazing, I hope I'll have some to test soon.
Anyway mice for xenograft are immunosuppressed otherwise the tumor would (almost) never survive, therefore is very unlikely that a tumor could survive from human to healthy human. </p></div>		</li>

<p>He mainly studied why a particular testicular cancer was suseptable to chemotherapy. Just while researching that he came upon other interesting finds on the cancer strain he was researching. He is now currently studying why a different cancer medication works. I hope this is helpful!</p></div>		</li>
