<p>No but seriously - let's say it diiiid exist - could it still be possible? mathematically speaking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2012/popular-physicsprize2012.pdf" target="_blank">2012 nobel prize</a> was given to a team that made a reflective surface that reflects light in a 2.7cm cavity for over 0.1 seconds (at speed c). This amounts to 1.1x10^9 photon reflections per photon absorbed. Thus a 1000GW source on such a source would only provide 900W of heat energy which is less than that of a kettle and could be managed with insulation while providing 1000 pounds of force which could probably kill you.</p>
<p>tl;dr the reflective material exists</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldnt that reduce the force because the momentum of the photons is being redirected somewhere else instead of being put completely into the target?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Momentum is a vector. The photons, in turning around, will impart a greater impulse on the body...</p>
<p>Consider that a photon going toward the body has some positive momentum--in bouncing off with the same momentum in the opposite direction, it has gone to the same magnitude of momentum, but negative. The difference is two times the initial momentum, and that is the impulse imparted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of newton's third law (for every reaction there is an opposite but equal reaction). You actually impart more momentum by having the light bounce off instead of being absorbed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the photons are actually being &quot;redirected&quot; when they get reflected. I'm pretty sure they're being absorbed and reemitted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  In fact, there are several 1-petawatt lasers currently being used in research physics, and there are supposed to be 10-petawatt lasers in the near future.  The catch is that they only shoot for a few femtoseconds at a time, otherwise they would consume a gargantuan amount of energy.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Pulses from NIF's 192 high-powered lasers, in a journey that originates more than 100 meters away in the master oscillator room, race towards the target bay with incredible precision. When they arrive at the center of the target chamber, they deposit up to 500 trillion watts of power for 20 billionths of a second on an eraser-sized capsule containing a target the size of a BB</p>
