			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides, nature does abhor the vacuum of space, and given a long enough time scale all the matter in the universe will eventually become equally distributed across it in a attempt to &quot;fill&quot; it. It's just that that timescale is so unimaginably long that for all intents and purposes space will always be a vacuum</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, how would this happen, exactly, given the existence of gravity?</p>
<p>Because I don't have any knowledge of Earth dissipating away because of the vacuum surrounding it...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's a very good point. Bound gravitational states as well as bound electromagnetic states are quite hard to break up in order to achieve a homogeneous distribution of matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes will eventually evaporate due to hawking radiation.</p>
<p>Objects like stars and planets might disappear as a result of proton decay, which will eventually turn all protons into radiation.  </p>
<p>Although some theories predict that proton decay exists, there is currently no experimental evidence for proton decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Entropy and the fact that eventually matter will be so spread apart and non-reactive (due to lack of proximity of other matter to interact with) that the universe will be a cold, dead place if the current expansion of the universe continues (we have no reason to believe the longstanding trend will change).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually the universe will become completely flat, with all matter/energy perfectly evenly distributed due to entropy. This isn't due to the vacuum of space alone, but more due to the fact that energy imbalances exist, and nature wants to balance those imbalances. Which it does by perfectly evenly distributing all the energy in the universe. This is called the heat death of the universe. </p>
<p>Of course all that assumes it doesn't just implode first</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't be so sure about that. Our current model of Universe Expansion result in an uneven distribution of matter through space in infinite time because space expansion would accelerate faster than light.</p></div>		</li>
