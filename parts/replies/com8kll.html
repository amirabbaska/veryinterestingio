			<div class="markdown"><p>For a long time, we didn't. You just quoted objects' velocities with respect to something else. For objects within our own galaxy, you reported (and often still report) the objects' velocities relative to the sun, known as their Heliocentric velocities. For more distant objects, astronomers usually report galactocentric velocities, where the center of the Milky Way is treated as &quot;at rest.&quot;</p>
<p>Defining an absolute reference frame is hard. In fact, if one of our assumptions about cosmology is correct (homogeneity) it should be impossible. However, the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background allows us to define a local velocity reference frame. If you were moving with respect to this frame, you'd see the CMB as slightly hotter in one direction and colder in another! So by subtracting off the dipole moment of the CMB from your velocity observations, you can transform velocities into this frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relativity tells us that space by its nature has no preferred rest frame, but if you fill space with stuff, that stuff could have an average &quot;at rest&quot; frame.  Our universe is one example where this is true, and we can measure the &quot;average at rest&quot; frame through the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) which is the remaining, all pervasive, dimming light from the big bang. If you are at rest relative to the CMB, it will look the same in every direction. If you are moving relative to the CMB, it will be blue-shifted in one direction and red-shifted in the other due to the Doppler effect.</p>
<p>When we measure the CMB from Earth, it indeed has this exact redder-in-one-direction, bluer-in-the-other structure. <a href="http://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_cosmo_fluct.html" target="_blank">here's a NASA link showing it</a></p>
<p>Then we just infer that we are moving in the &quot;bluer&quot; direction at about 600km/s relative to the CMB to account for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation, but this raises a question for me:</p>
<p>Does that mean there is a center? If you follow this gradient would you come to some point where it radiates from?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I found it interesting that our entire galaxy is moving at around 1,000 km/s!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we assume some planet X is moving at v = 100km/s relative to Earth, then the Lorentz factor turns out to be about 1.00000006 - this means that if we take the age of the Earth to be 4.5 billion years old, then we would see X about 270 years behind us.  Moreover, the immense distances to planets dictates that light take many, many years just to get here, and we are effectively seeing them in their past.  If we assume X is about 100ly away, then this adds to our running total of about 370 years!</p>
<p>But the interesting question is would that 370 year gap make a difference in the detection of intelligent life?  If X were inhabited by humans, the answer would be yes because 370 years ago, we'd barely discovered calculus and elementary physical theories.  However, intelligent life sprouts up so quickly and unpredictably on astronomical timescales that 370 years would be extremely insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe.  So unfortunately special relativity is a terrible explanation of the Fermi paradox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a theory or talk somewhere that life may be common in the universe. The problem is that they flourish within time scales so minute that two intelligent species may never be close enough in proximity or time to discover each other. </p>
<p>Even if it were possible for them to traverse the interstellar distances may end up becoming extinct or running out of resources. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I may be wrong about this, but doesn't gravity affect the passage of time more than speed? Or is it simply easier to get nearer to large gravity wells than it is to get up to &quot;relativistic speeds&quot; that would have similar effects?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity and speed both affect the passage of time. There's no way to definitively say which affects it more, since it's hard to compare a gravitational acceleration to a velocity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it more feasible though to look at gravity?</p>
<p>We can travel to a planet like Jupiter and observe the differences with Earth much easier than we can ever come close to travel near the speed of light or even a fraction of it.</p></div>		</li>
