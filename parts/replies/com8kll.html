			<div class="markdown"><p>If we assume some planet X is moving at v = 100km/s relative to Earth, then the Lorentz factor turns out to be about 1.00000006 - this means that if we take the age of the Earth to be 4.5 billion years old, then we would see X about 270 years behind us.  Moreover, the immense distances to planets dictates that light take many, many years just to get here, and we are effectively seeing them in their past.  If we assume X is about 100ly away, then this adds to our running total of about 370 years!</p>
<p>But the interesting question is would that 370 year gap make a difference in the detection of intelligent life?  If X were inhabited by humans, the answer would be yes because 370 years ago, we'd barely discovered calculus and elementary physical theories.  However, intelligent life sprouts up so quickly and unpredictably on astronomical timescales that 370 years would be extremely insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe.  So unfortunately special relativity is a terrible explanation of the Fermi paradox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a theory or talk somewhere that life may be common in the universe. The problem is that they flourish within time scales so minute that two intelligent species may never be close enough in proximity or time to discover each other. </p>
<p>Even if it were possible for them to traverse the interstellar distances may end up becoming extinct or running out of resources. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I may be wrong about this, but doesn't gravity affect the passage of time more than speed? Or is it simply easier to get nearer to large gravity wells than it is to get up to &quot;relativistic speeds&quot; that would have similar effects?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity and speed both affect the passage of time. There's no way to definitively say which affects it more, since it's hard to compare a gravitational acceleration to a velocity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it more feasible though to look at gravity?</p>
<p>We can travel to a planet like Jupiter and observe the differences with Earth much easier than we can ever come close to travel near the speed of light or even a fraction of it.</p></div>		</li>
