			<div class="markdown"><p>I was homeschooled, so despite living in America, I had trouble figuring this out for the longest time. This is how I remember it:</p>
<p>Freshman = newest, like fresh food was made recently, so it's newest</p>
<p>Senior = oldest, senior to everyone</p>
<p>Junior = second oldest, juniors are younger than seniors, and the names go together</p>
<p>Sophomore = between Freshman and Juniors because that's the only option left. While I understand the etymology of the word itself (&quot;wise fool&quot; in Greek or something), I have no idea how the name relates to the grade level.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's because after you've got a year under your belt you think you're hot shit and you know all this stuff that you didn't know when you were coming in as a freshman (that's the &quot;wise&quot; part).</p>
<p>But then it turns out you still know nothing and your acting like you do is making you look the fool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Huh, TIL.  I guess it means that they are wiser than a freshman but still have ways to go in their education.  It kind of makes sense that they are placed where they are.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Wise fool&quot; means when someone feels wise, and thinks they've learned, but are still foolish and need to learn more. It's sometimes used as an adjective, &quot;sophomoric&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
