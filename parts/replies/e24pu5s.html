			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a story that I read in grammar school about a rich Japanese man who lived with his grandson on a hill and owned huge field of rice, and a town at the foot of the hill, where his workers lived. The man was respected but not really liked.</p>
<p>One day, after the harvest, when the rice was drying in sheaves, the villagers were preparing for a celebration. The old man felt an odd sort of earthquake, not very strong, but spongy and rolling.</p>
<p>He ordered his grandson to get him a brand from the fire, and immediately began to set the sheaves of rice ablaze. The fire soon attracted the attention of the villagers, who ran up the hill to try and put it out, but the man would not let them. His grandson was crying, saying that the old man was crazy, and had burned the rice on purpose. The townspeople, who had intended to buy and eat that rice, were furious.</p>
<p>But the old man pointed out to the sea, and as they watched, a tsunami rolled in and destroyed the town. But all of the people were safe at the top of the hill among the ruins of the man's rice field. </p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>It's similar to <a href="http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/134/stories-from-around-the-world/5221/the-burning-of-the-rice-fields/" target="_blank">this one</a>, except the version I read made more of a point that the townspeople resented the man's wealth, yet he sacrificed it all to save them.  </p></div>		</li>
