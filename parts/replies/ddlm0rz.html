			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. That is a great explanation. I have always known that it is a complex language, but your post somehow made it hit home just how complex it actually is... Thanks for taking the time to post such an in depth explanation, I really appreciate it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to what I said about typing Chinese, transcribing spoken Chinese for any dialect is tricky! For example, in Mandarin, the most popular way to romanize it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin" target="_blank">pinyin</a>, but there are other systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo" target="_blank">zhuyin</a> that manage to do it with non-Latin letters. Since inputting Chinese characters is so dominating by pronunciation-based entry, you can often just type pinyin in a lot of Chinese search engines and apps and you will find them anyway.</p>
<p>Another layer of complexity is what other threads have touched on: Chinese characters are used in a lot of different regions with different dialects as well as different countries. In a sense, the written Chinese language has resemblance to Norwegian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokm%C3%A5l" target="_blank">Bokmål</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_German" target="_blank">Hochdeutsch</a>, since many Germanic languages bear deep regional varieties and yet have a standardized written form. Like different Germanic dialects, Chinese dialects differ in possible consonants, tones, and a bunch of other phonological features. Certain dialects are so different that their mutual intelligibility is very low. For instance, I speak Mandarin, and can only understand 10% of Shanghainese if I strain really hard.</p>
<p>Due to historical word-borrowing, many Chinese phrases have similar pronunciations between different dialects and languages. Take the phrase 簡單 (&quot;simple&quot;). It is composed of the two characters <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=%E7%B0%A1" target="_blank">簡</a> (&quot;terse&quot;) and <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=%E5%96%AE" target="_blank">單</a> (&quot;single&quot;).</p>
<ul>
<li>In Mandarin, it is pronounced <em>jiǎndān</em> (the accent marks denote tone)</li>
<li>In Cantonese, it is pronounced <em>gaan2 daan1</em> (the numbers denote tone)</li>
<li>In Japanese, it is pronounced <em>かんたん</em> (<em>kantan</em>)</li>
<li>In Korean, it is pronounced <em>간단</em> (<em>gandan</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the same character can be written in several different ways! The character I mentioned before, <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=%E5%96%AE" target="_blank">單</a> (&quot;single&quot;), has a few other variants if you look at the database page it links to, under the variants section: 单 and 単. These variants either come from different historic styles of scripts, or a modern simplification process done by the PRC government. The first kind has some similarity to English words that were borrowed twice, e.g. <em>jail</em> and <em>gaol</em> are the same word, but the first one came through Old French <em>jaiole</em> and the second came through Anglo-Norman French <em>gaole</em>. The second kind is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences#Historical_origins" target="_blank">American English spelling reforms</a>: for example, <em>thru</em> is the simplified spelling of <em>through</em>, and both are accepted to mean the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not &quot;less.&quot; There is almost <em>no</em> correlation between the appearance and the pronunciation. </p>
<p>In some cases, the appearance of a given element has something to do with the pronunciation, in other cases, the same element in the same position does not.</p>
<p>The written and spoken languages are, effectively, two separate languages, with pinyin the only &quot;bridge&quot; between them, as it indicates the established standard pronunciation of the given written character.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a theoretical basis there is no correlation, but over 90% of Chinese characters are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character_classification#Phono-semantic_compound_characters" target="_blank">phono-semantic compounds</a>. So I can infer that 清 is pronounced <em>qīng</em> and 晴 is pronounced <em>qíng</em> with some level of accuracy (the tone may be wrong) simply because the right-hand side of both of those characters are 青 (<em>qīng</em>). Sure, if you try to further decompose 青 itself, there is no information on the pronunciation, but knowing how to pronounce Chinese characters is not a process that involves memorizing flat lists.</p>
<p>To extend your analogy, the written and spoken language may be two separate languages with pinyin being the only &quot;bridge&quot;, but there is a similar bridge between simpler characters and more complex characters. Just as more complex characters are composed of simpler characters, most of the time a character's pronunciation can be easily guessed from one of its parts, hence the folk wisdom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youbian_dubian" target="_blank">youbian dubian</a>. This principle works in varying capacity in other languages that extensively borrowed Chinese vocabulary. For example, I was asked the pronunciation of the character <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=%E9%8F%83" target="_blank">鏃</a> in Japanese. I didn't know off the top of my head, but I knew 家族 (&quot;family&quot;) is pronounced かぞく (<em>kazoku</em>), so my guess of そく (<em>soku</em>) was very close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely is not a purely phonetic system, but most linguists agree that written Chinese has some degree of correlation between appearance and pronunciation. It is not a purely pictographic writing medium, which is what a system would be if there is no correlation between appearance and pronunciation. I think something like 80% of characters contain a phonetic component, so at the very least the pronunciation is hinted at in the character.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The example I like to use the example of 青，清，情，请, and 猜. They all have the same phonetic component (青), but while 4 of these have the same root pronunciation (qing, although with different tones), the last character (猜) has a completely different pronunciation (cai1). </p></div>		</li>
