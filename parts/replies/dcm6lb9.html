			<div class="markdown"><p>Sauce?  </p>
<p>Edit: Didn't think I needed to put a /s. Come on guys! Thought it was obvious someone would post sauce of a gang-bang in the teller line at BoA with loan officers in the background writing totally legit mortgages to the cameramen and boom operator while the branch manager is getting a golden Trump shower over at the vault. Guess I should be more specific next time</p></div>		</li>

<p>I met Ron Jeremy about 15 years ago. he was doing his S&amp;M side show at the time and hit my local venue.  He was loading in as I was buying tickets for a concert later that month.  Literally ran into him at the door &quot;You're a big guy&quot; he said to me and my response was a stuttering &quot;You... you are&quot;  and he interrupted with &quot;Yup, Nine and three-quarters, Tell your friends&quot; </p>
<p>My habit when going to shake someones hand is wipe palm on pant leg and extend arm.  &quot;Usually people wipe their hand after shaking mine&quot; </p></div>		</li>
