			<div class="markdown"><p>Could this be a form of &quot;visual tinnitus&quot;? Tinnitus often presents following hearing loss. The idea is that cortical remapping and changes to certain oscillations result from the lack of input. In other words you are hallucinating the sound. Tinnitus also seems analogous to phantom limb pain following amputation.</p>
