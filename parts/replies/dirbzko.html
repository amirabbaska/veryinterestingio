			<div class="markdown"><p>A parabolic mirror should indeed produce parallel rays of light, which decay like sunlight. Silver umbrellas used in photography sort of have this effect, to some extent. The problem is that they can't really be made beyond a certain size. So if you want to simulate the entire sky (and when you want to simulate sunlight, you have to simulate the sky, too), there is no way to use a parabolic reflector that size. For the sun as a point source, yes, but for the rest of the sky, no.</p>
<p>You can also use &quot;egg crate&quot; light diffusers or some sort of grid to block out any light that isn't parallel. But again you can't put these on very large surfaces.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: As a side note, objects lit by the sun reflect that light, and because it is a reflection, it becomes as new light source that is affected by the distance rule.  There are lots of considerations to take into account regarding artistic light interpretation and I believe it's why some artists are considered geniuses because of their ability to calculate and recreate, with paint or other mediums, the countless ways light changes in a believable manner.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes it's important to note this - for example, a white frost placed on a window will act like a nearby light source, even if the sun shining through it is a distant light source. Diffused objects act as a new light source (such as a white wall) whether we shine light through them or reflect light onto them, while shiny objects, such as a mirror or a reflective kettle, will preserve light direction.</p>
<p>We actually often use mirrors to increase the distance traveled by light to make it look more natural when there isn't enough space in the studio.</p></div>		</li>
