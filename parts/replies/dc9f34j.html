			<div class="markdown"><p>How come nobody has addressed the other sources of CO2? There are many natural sources of CO2, including trees, the oceans, etc, as well as man made sources that do not include combustion of fossil fuels, such as cement plants. My point being that barrels of oil burned may account for (and I don't have actual numbers here) less than 50% of the CO2 actually being released. Thus minimizing the oil fields burning even more. Perhaps the spike you are looking for is more like a 3-6% spike, which would be very difficult, if not impossible to detect.</p></div>		</li>
