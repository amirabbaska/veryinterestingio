			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Dick</em> <em>Tracy</em> generally seems to fit the description of a Neo-Noir film, except for the morally dubious central character.  All the villains, the seductive women, the shadowy alleyways and seedy nightclubs, Tommy guns, police cars, everything fits the theme. You could even say he has a few flaws, but not necessarily corruption or ethical shortcomings.  I seem to remember him as a 100% uncorruptable good-guy, similar to Eliot Ness from <em>The Untouchables</em>.  Also, the movie has the comic book style that is somewhat at odds with the Noir genre.  I should watch it again; it's been a lonnnngg time.  I wonder how other people grade this movie in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would classify both of these as gangster rather than noir.</p>
<p>Gangster movies were their own genre and became particularly popular during prohibition when colorful gangsters flourished in real life.  Not only did the noir genre largely grow out of them, the glamorization of crime in gangster films was one of the reasons for the Hays Code to begin with.  It is not surprising there are a lot of similarities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that's sort of the end of Neo's moral ambiguity, wouldn't you say?  Once Neo says, &quot;I know kung fu...&quot; that's it for the noir.</p></div>		</li>
