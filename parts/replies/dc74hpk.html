<p>Have you ever stood in front of a camp fire?<br />
Did you notice how if you looked at it, your face got really really hot, but as soon as you turned away, it got cooler?   </p>

<p>It's similar with the Sun in space. Surfaces towards the Sun get very hot (200+ Celsius) due to all the radiated heat being absorbed, but can't shed any because there is no air for conduction. Yet in the shadows, temperatures drop below -100.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Convection is heated air flowing up and <a href="https://scioly.org/wiki/images/thumb/1/11/Convection.jpg/300px-Convection.jpg" target="_blank">away from the fire</a></p>
<p>Yes, in this case, convection would happen, but unless you're standing above the fire, you're not feeling it.</p>
<p>If you meant to say conduction (the air near the fire being warmed up - there seems to be a bit of confusion on this thread about that), the fact that you don't feel the heat on your face anymore once you turn around proved that that's not the case.</p>
<p>The side facing the fire will always feel much warmer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't really assume for conduction, but I understand that my misconception came from my belief that the heat felt would be due to a moving fluid (the air current induced by the temperature differential by the fire and it's surroundings). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are standing next to the fire, no. Hot air will rise as another commenter has said. In your normal everyday life, convection is the dominant way heat is transfered (your radiators, food that cools, your house etc) but as soon as the &quot;hot&quot; temperature goes up an becomes large enough, radiation will quickly start to dominate, especially in an object such as a wood fueled fire. A flame is orange mainly from particles (usually coal) that radiates away energy as they glow, they are hot enough to glow in the visible spectrum. In devices such as coal, oil or biomass fueled boilers, radiant heat is the dominant heat transfer mechanism in the firebox. The big flame is cooled by water cooled walls without touching them. A certain degree of transfer is convection, but radiation will be the dominant force. </p>
<p>The rate of transfer is proportional to the temperature to the fourth power(~T_high^4-T_low^4)  which is the reason an object such as a vacuum thermos is very efficient at isolating, while a fireball at 2000K is very efficiently cooled by radiation alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean that earth would cease to support life if a series of cataclysmic events occurred between the sun and earth reducing the number of celestial bodies that could participate in the heat transfer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand your question, you are asking if the sun had fewer bodies it could transfer heat to, would the earth get more. The answer is no. The sun radiates energy (in the form of light, etc.) in all directions regardless of whether there is something there to absorb that heat or not.</p>
<p>There is a tiny bit of subtlety here as other bodies technically reflect or remit light back making the sun hotter. But this is negligible.</p></div>		</li>
