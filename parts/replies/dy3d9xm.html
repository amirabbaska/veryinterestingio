			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming eigen values are coming up in the context of modal analysis - i.e. the shapes that a circular geometry makes when it vibrates. If that's the case, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration_of_plates" target="_blank">here's how that's done</a>, specifically the Free vibrations of isotropic plates section and Circular Plates subsection.</p>
<p>You're not finding the eigen values of a circle, so much as the eigen values of the transfer function or Lapacian of a circular profile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what the above is referring to would be a matter of considering the operator-eigenvalue problem in a circular domain where the operator is the Laplacian. In practice then you'd solve the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical-polar co-ordinates, probably by separation of variables, with what ever boundary conditions (that hopefully work).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bubble_conjecture" target="_blank">double bubble conjecture</a> was only proved in 2002. It's fascinating that so many seemingly simple but long-standing problems are only now being solved, in part due to advancements in computational power.</p></div>		</li>
