			<div class="markdown"><p>iÂ´m interest on this... I want to know, how accurate is it? when people say a dog is smilling, or if there is enough information about dogs showing &quot;emotional tears&quot; and other gestures, that we as hummans recognize as the expresion of an emotion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no doubt that animals including dogs become sad. The challenge is knowing when sadness becomes a clinical problem that we might call depression in humans. Currently I do not think we have any valid instruments to know when a dog might be depressed versus sad in a normal healthy way.  That being sad I have no doubt your dog missing you when you are away.  We know dogs can remember social relationships like their own mother for years: Hepper, P. G. (1994). &quot;Long-term retention of kinship recognition established during infancy in the domestic dog.&quot; Behavioural Processes 33: 3-14.</p>
<p>There's evidence for cognitive decline in dogs in general as they get older. I have an older dog, Tassie, who is 8. I make sure he stays stimulated by playing cognitive games with him (we try all the new Dognition games out on him), and I also feed him Purina's Bright Mind, which has a compound called MCTs that seem to help. The most important thing is to make sure your dog gets the right exercise, food, mental stimulation, and love. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cried so hard reading this. </p>
<p>I didn't see my dog for 3 months and then she passed away. She was only 4. </p>
<p>Prior to those 3 months she and I never spent more than a few hours away from each other. Every damn day. All I could think about was when she was dying if she was thinking of me, if she was scared, if she was sad, if she felt pain, if she was depressed for those 3 months, if she understood I was going to see her again. I just wish I could have been there with her.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but I wish dogs didn't feel emotions like being sad because I really did not want her to suffer.</p>
<p>I'd always looked forward to the way she would look when she saw me after coming back home. Meh.</p>
<p>I don't really know what this has to do with your comment, I guess just the fact of mentioning that dogs can get sad made me realize she was probably sad I wasn't around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cognitive psychology professor says that there is little evidence, given the amount of research to suggest that humans have any benefit from playing mind games like lumosity. I didn't check out your website but how are these games more beneficial than lumosity type games?</p></div>		</li>
