			<div class="markdown"><p>I could understand that but according to employment rate website it defines it as: The employment rate measures the number of people who have a job as a percentage of the working-age population. </p>
<p>Which counts out elderly and children. Does that mean roughly ~30% of working age people in the US are disabled, students, or not looking for work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably a big one. Accoridng to this article (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/us/number-of-stay-at-home-mothers-in-us-rises.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/us/number-of-stay-at-home-mothers-in-us-rises.html</a>) there are 10 million stay at home mom's and then add on the stay at home dads. That's probably about 5% of the population counted for the Labor Force study. Which, I'm actually surprised it's that low of a percent of people that are stay at home parents. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically correct, the only modification I would add are what are called discouraged workers. Essentially this are people who have given up on finding work. They may not fall into the other categories but would also be a part of that missing gap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US DOL has only a lower age limit, not an upper age limit, for &quot;working age&quot;.  The OECD uses a different definition, but that is not the definition used to tabulate the US data, unless you are using a  source which retabulated the data under their own definition.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty common misconception. Employment numbers don't come from people filing for unemployment. It comes from an extensive survey (~100,000 people) that the government runs every month. &quot;Unemployed&quot; according to the official unemployment number means &quot;has not been paid for work in the last month, but has looked for paid work in the last month&quot;. It doesn't matter if they qualify for unemployment benefits, how long they've been employed, or if they've ever had a job, only that they're looking. </p>
<p>The survey results also include numbers on people who would take a job but aren't looking, and on people working part time but want to work full time but that's not the number the newspapers quote.</p>
<p>You can read more about the survey on the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm" target="_blank">Bureau of Labor Statistics website</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are not counted in the unemployment rate. They are however reflected in the labor force participation rate, which is the percentage of working-age adults who are employed. The inverse of this rate gives a broader unemployment metric which includes those who've given up looking for work.</p></div>		</li>
