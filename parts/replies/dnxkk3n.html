			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;100% native&quot; is an important point, and is very subjective. Is a Saxon in England native? Is a Roman in Spain native by now? How about a Greek in Sicily or a Jew in Poland? People have been migrating and mixing irregularly for all time, so the best you can get to 100% native is &quot;I stopping keeping track&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Either ethnic Brits are by most reasonable definitions native or they are not together with Native Americans. Both are mixed populations.</p></div>		</li>
