<p>For context, the moon is 384,400 km from earth. So that is very close indeed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, is &quot;vaporised&quot; the right word? Does the comet's material make-up turn to vapor? Or does it go through some other type of chemical change where it no longer exists as its current state / elements / etc? If the sun breaks it apart even down to the sub-atomic level, what happens to all that.... &quot;stuff&quot; that used to be the comet?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The material that's ablated from comets near the sun is all removed due to heating, not chemical processes. Comets are mostly made of water ice and heating water to a high temperature will not get it to thermally decompose. There are some more complex compounds that could degrade or react - I don't know about that - but they're not the majority.</p>
<p>Also you might still call it vaporisation if some of the comet were thermally decomposed but ended up as a vapour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes vaporised is the perfect word. No there are no changes in elemental composition. The surface of the sun is hot but not that hot fusion only occurs deep in the star where pressures are super high. At the outer edge of the sun the pressure is much lower than even the air on earth. No way is it going to fuse, It could be ionized and then ejected as solar wind or fall into the start to wait for the star to go nova. Only the hydrogen atoms have any real hope of being transmuted ever but they will have been part of the star for millions of years before they make it down that far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light. It's somewhat &quot;fuzzy&quot; because it's all fluid but in comparison to the size of the whole Sun it's a pretty thin layer, maybe 100 km thick.</p>
<p>EDIT: To put it another way, the photosphere or &quot;surface&quot; of a star is the layer from which virtually all the star's light is emitted out into space.</p>
<p>The same idea is used to define the &quot;surface&quot; of the gas giant planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the sun produces an enormous atmosphere which envelopes all of the orbiting bodies in a powerful current of plasma, reaching out and pressing against the magnetoshere-ionospheres of nearby stellar bodies, forming a warped bubble terminating at a considersble distance into the vast ocean of interstellar material.</p>
<p>The Voyager craft passed through this boundary already. Besides, we are already quite literally touching the surface of the sun, as much of the electromagnetic radiation produced by our local luminary easily penetrates our bodies when our planet turns to face the source of the energy dense dielectric phenomenon in the sky.</p></div>		</li>
