			<div class="markdown"><p>Also we tend to vastly underestimate the force we are about to experience. If you tense up, your head will (for instance) whiplash anyway. The force of an impact is so great-even at low speeds- that our muscles cannot overcome it. So it not only whips your head back and forth, but first tears all of your tense muscles- THEN whips your head around anyway. This is true even at low speeds like 30mph</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. This is not eli5 but force is rate of change of momentum, which is why the longer the time, the sum might be a lot of force but it's distributed through time. Hence how a trampoline or safety net works. Also bit of kevlar (most is distributing through area)</p></div>		</li>
