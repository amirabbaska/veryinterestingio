			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. The demon core incidents leave me wondering; did they not realise how hilariously dangerous the stuff they were working with was? Or were they just reckless / disregarding of the dangers due to wartime urgencies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If my understanding of the personalities involved is correct it just came down to hubris more than anything.  This was a group of the smartest people playing with the most powerful physical phenomenon ever discovered.  I think they genuinely thought they could handle any possible risk associated with the core.</p></div>		</li>

Step 2: Give him a screwdriver...&quot;), but there were a half dozen other people standing around watching him, it's not like he just went rogue. <em>Someone</em> in that room of nuclear scientists should have had enough brains to stop him.</p></div>		</li>
