			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I took part in a study as an undergraduate (and got paid 50 bucks!) that essentially was us having many unfiltered high res shots taken of our face as well as a questionnaire and a blood sample (for cortisol and testosterone for males).   </p>
<p>Men who have a non-stressed but aggressive dominant facial expression and forehead region, along with symmetry are deemed more attractive than other mens facial features.  </p>
<p>Women who have a non stressed facial expression along with high cheekbones and smaller pronounced forehead region are deemed more attractive.  </p>
<p>Apparently a strong man and an eager healthy woman are evolutions preferred recipe for creampie love. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the whole stressed thing - people have mirror neurons. They activate when you perform an action and when you watch another person perform that same action. </p>
<p>It's what probably lets us empathise with others. For example, a study I learnt about a few weeks ago (studying psychology, don't have link to it but would be able to find an author/year) found that smelling a disgusting smell would activate the same region of your brain as watching someone else pull a disgusting face or also smell a disgusting smell (the activation was in the Insula if anyone's interested in knowing). </p>
<p>Aka seeing some stressed out probably activates your mirror neurons so that you &quot;feel&quot; stressed out too. That's probably putting it too simply, but you can see why you wouldn't be attracted to someone who is stressed looking because of this. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! Last weekend I dropped a
120 lb speaker on my big toe. As I was gritting my teeth in pain and icing it, my friend was describing how she broke her toe playing soccer. As I listened to each new detail, a fresh surge of pain would surge through MY (already in considerable pain) toe. I wonder if this is the same phenomenon. I've had similar responses in my own body in the past when someone described an injury but not nearly as intense. It was just crazy how with my own injury, her describing hers sent INTENSE pain through my body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh that's interesting. They should make an experiment for this - maybe receiving mild electric shocks while someone tells them about how much it hurt when they got it done? Would be cool.</p>
<p>Well whenever anyone tells a story about their genitals getting hurt, a lot of people have a kind of physical reaction to it. For me it's never actually pain, but something else I can't describe well. Maybe this is similar to what happened to you? </p></div>		</li>
