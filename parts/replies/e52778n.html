<p>That's what I always assumed too, until the day I moved from Colorado to Alabama (for work reasons). Suddenly it was the opposite problem, and even worse, windshield wipers were totally ineffective</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For moisture on the outside of the windshield you need the heat the windshield beyond the temperature outside. To do this here in Florida, I turn off the AC (because it cools the air) and turn my windshield defogger on high heat. It's a bit uncomfortable for a couple minutes, but once the windshield is clear I turn the AC on, switch to cold air, and turn off the windshield vents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Older cars without AC will just use heat to warm up the glass. There is usually a heater unit that warms up the air by transferring some heat from the engines cooling system. Then a blower fan will move that air around, and ducting/vents direct it towards the windscreen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which sucks because it takes a while for the engine to heat up during winter. It helps if you have a diesel, as they usually come with electronic heaters to help get the engine up to temp, and many cars allow you to use said heater as an auxiliary cabin heater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a pickup that would take a good 30 minutes to get up to temp.  I ended up buying a <a href="https://www.harborfreight.com/12v-auto-heater-defroster-with-light-60525.html" target="_blank">12v heater/fan/light combo</a> that pointed at the windshield in front of my face.  Gave me an 8 inch square of clear glass to see through.  Was good enough to get to work and back, at least.</p></div>		</li>
