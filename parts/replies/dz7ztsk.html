			<div class="markdown"><p>Do note when speaking of swords, serration is a liability. In case of swords, the energy and alignment behind a slash creates the necessary interface between blade and material to permit cutting. A serrated blade will bunch up clothing on the other hand, leaving the sword stuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I see. Very interesting isn’t it? Something so simplistic has so much explanation behind it. I wonder who came up with the idea of serration, and why they thought to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally serrations weaken the blade against impacts like you'd find in a sword fight. This is why you shouldn't use those machetes with a saw blade on the back. Each notch in the metal acts like a &quot;tear here&quot; notch that you'd find on plastic bags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also a matter of most bread having a crust that’s relatively hard, and a center that’s soft and spongey. If you apply pressure to the crust, the center just gives. If you remove the crust, bread is easily cut by any knife. Tomatoes are kind of similar, but much less so. You only need a decently sharp blade to cut tomatoes. Some foods are hard to cut because of density and adhesion, like cheese, where a wire is often the best tool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your knife can't cut through a tomato or bread then you're using a dangerously dull knife. You don't need the sharpest of sharps for them.</p></div>		</li>
