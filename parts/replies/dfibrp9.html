The skin on your face is much thinner than it is on your arm so without sebum, foreign bodies would have a much easier time entering your body through the pores on your face.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The purpose of the oil secreting glands is to create an acidic barrier near sensitive areas that kills bacteria. It is meant to keep us healthy! </p>
<p>With modern hygiene, it does not have the same function. We wash the oils off too often for it to work properly. </p>
<p>Edit: &quot;but why the face? Whhhyyyyyy?&quot;</p>
<p>My stab at it: you can't make an oily acid barrier on your hands. Everything would be slippery, and you would just rub it all off anyways.</p>
<p>Your face has eyes, a nose, a mouth, all the easy entry points for foreign bacteria. It needs the acidic mantle the most.</p></div>		</li>
