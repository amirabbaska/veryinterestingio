			<div class="markdown"><p>no, it answers the question. the objects hit each other then dive inward and the only objects left remaining are those rotating in the same direction because they are less likely to hit each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My problem with all these demos of how gravity works is that they always display it on a flat plane of spandex. I don't see the universe as a flat plane so it's hard to imagine what's technically happening with the curvature of space in 3 dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But stable orbits work perfectly with the model. If you looked at a stable orbit of an object, and tilted your perspective so that it's perfectly level, then any point you choose on that orbit would vary by 2 dimensions. Basically, it's flat! Why bother representing it in 3 dimensions? </p>
<p>Now, gravity can be extremely concentrated or sparse, resulting in gravities that have varying slopes. A black hole has a massive slope (rise over run, or change) because its so concentrated and small. The moon is small but very sparse, so it has a very small gravitational slope. Representing gravity as the 3rd dimension illustrates this slope perfectly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sure, but the basic concept will still apply. If objects collide they will lose energy which makes them fall towards their local center of mass. This will apply to objects rotating in different directions and also objects in spherical orbits. Many objects orbiting in various planes will not be as stable as objects rotating in a single plane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that example is that they're using gravity to explain what gravity is. It's actually a really bad example that people continue to use.</p>
<p>The reason the ball sinks in the spandex is because gravity, which doesn't work well to explain what gravity actually is or how it works. </p></div>		</li>
