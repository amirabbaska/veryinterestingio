<p>The machine shows a tally of votes at the end, not the order.</p>

<p>the machine shows what you pressed. You have no way of verifying that this is recorded correctly. If you make a mistake, there is no way to correct it.</p>

<p>This is wrong, you can easily have a screen showing the candidate after choosing and requiring you to press confirm.</p>
<p>This also invalidates point 4.</p>

<p>There have been several instances of large districts only having a single machine, which led to hour-long queues</p>

<p>This is just straight up bad planning, you know the number of voters in the section so you can predict how many machines you should need.</p>

<p>Yes you can, lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The machine needs to record all the votes on paper, in case the result is challenged in court. The better machines also show this paper to the voter, which would allow them to indeed verify their vote has been recorded correctly. Why not all machines do that, I have no idea.</p>
<p>The screen showing your selection is not proof that the vote has been recorded this way. It is easy to build a machine that shows one thing and counts something else, and only a full paper trail and hand-counting from the paper trail would catch that ­— but then you don't need the machines.</p>
<p>The &quot;bad planning&quot; has been a major issue in several elections now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure you can, and the machine can be programmed to display that screen while simultaneously recording a vote for the other guy. There's no way for the average voter to know that their vote was recorded correctly without implicitly trusting the machine to do it right. With a paper ballot, the voter can literally stand in the voting place all night and never take their eyes off the box so they know that the piece of paper they put in there is the one that is counted</p></div>		</li>
