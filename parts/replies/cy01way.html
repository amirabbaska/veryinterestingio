			<div class="markdown"><p>Your mechanicals part is a little incorrect, mainly because you leave out the writers aspect. Mechanicals in that sense are based on reproductions, not sales. If your label prints 1M records and doesn't sell a single one, they are still on the hook for mechanicals. That is the 9.1 cents. If the writer is also signed to the label, that rate is often lowered under a controlled composition clause. These are paid out by HFA.</p>
<p>The recording artist mechanical is what you're talking about, which are paid out by the labels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True w/ manufacturing. You are right in that as a writer you can be subjugated to an artist's controlled comp clause as well, good legal definitely tries to prevent that :) Also legally on digital the full statutory rate is required unless an alternative agreement is in place (so I am told)..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, not sure if it's a legal thing, but I think most lawyers get out of controlled comp, like you said, for digital because how the hell do you measure reproductions? There's literally infinite reproductions available at all times hah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on my personal experience it seems the first use licensee (the label that puts it out) will usually account directly, HFA is great because you can get a compulsory license without dealing with the original rights holders. /u/MuzBizGuy is very knowledgeable here, maybe he can jump in and drop some knowledge here..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 99% sure the first use mechanicals, especially if they are reduced through controlled comps, are paid directly to the publishers from the labels. Otherwise you're just losing points on an unnecessary middleman.</p>
<p>If it's not a controlled comp though, even if it's the first use, I think pubs would still make you go through HFA, unless there's a deal to reduce that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that buying songs (itunes, etc.) gives the artist very little, and where they earn most of their money is in concerts. Is that true?</p>
<p>If we like a particular artist and want them to get as much of our money as possible, are there little things we can do? Eg does requesting songs on the radio, watching/sharing music videos on youtube (monetization?), etc going to help? Or do the big bucks mainly come out of corporate decisions which one or two consumers will have almost no impact on?</p>
<p>It's interesting that y'all get a raw deal on streaming services, because that's my favourite way of listening. I can't be bothered having to buy each song and sync it to my phone and have to use that device to play. With streaming, I can play whatever I want on whatever device, and I get to discover cool new music. I always thought y'all would be paid a fair share and it sucks that they're skirting artists like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The purchases generate a lot more than the streaming does for writers. I love the idea of streaming because it makes music consumption into a long-tail form of income instead of these big flashes in the pan.. but the percents just need to slide away from the labels and more toward the creators a bit :)</p></div>		</li>
