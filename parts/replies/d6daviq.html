			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same feeling about this video because I don't want to undermine science's credibility but I think the point that science is robust in the face of these problems is pretty powerful. There's a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/08/03/researchers-may-have-finally-found-an-antidote-to-biased-thinking-about-science/?utm_term=.0aea234680c4" target="_blank">recent paper out about science curiousness</a> that suggests if we all are more science curious we will have less polarization to the two extremes you mention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you're joking (or at least I think you are), but this comment is exactly the sort of argument that some people would/will make - if we can't trust the results, how can we trust the results of a study that says we can or can't trust the results???</p></div>		</li>

<p>The amount of made up data I've seen over the years is ridiculous.</p>
<p>I don't believe anything i read until a neutral party has replicated it or it makes it to human trials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it possible to just judge the paper specifically rather than dismissing it until a neutral party replicated it or it reaches human trials? </p>
<p>It seems  too broad of a brush to use. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to say that teaching people real, modern science in school is the only way to get them to truly understand how it works.</p>
<p>How come we teach such intricacies as author's intention versus a literary works own symbolic power (intended or not), already in middle school, but we don't teach real science from this decade unless you take a high-level course at University?</p>
<p>I would urge anyone interested to take a look at Columbia Universities required intro course, &quot;Frontiers of Science&quot;, for an example of how such a course can be run. In it, students learn actual &quot;Frontiers&quot; of science, while not needing almost any background in math/science. They get to explore these dilemmas we are discussing here, and don't just blindly fall into the Anti or Pro-&quot;science&quot; camps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would focus on the field involved.</p>
<p>For instance, the climate folks got their shit together in a big way because of all the push-back.  There are lots of meta-analyses, lots of attention paid to statistics, and conclusions tend to be more conservative.  It does actually help strengthen the field in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>I'd trust almost nothing about nutrition, at least at the level of 'you should/shouldn't eat ___'.  Pharma stuff is also very suspect because of the incentives involved.</p>
<p>Beyond that, if reading some pop science, find the article they're referring to.  If it's hard to find, that's a bad sign from the get-go.  If you do find it, read the abstract!  It's not that hard, promise.  There will be some bits you don't understand, but it's still much better to read what the actual authors have to say.  If you're still interested, skip straight to the end of the paper and read the discussion section; this part will discuss the results in something much closer to plain-English.  The authors will usually also talk about some strengths and weaknesses of the work, areas that need attention, and how it fits into the context of their field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell your anti-science family and friends to look at anything that's been scientific consensus for more than 5 years, and judge science based on that rather than on popular media headlines about 'new discoveries'.  If you pick up a high school science textbook, that stuff's going to be correct (albeit simplified).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might not be good enough.</p>
<p><a href="http://heterodoxacademy.org/2015/12/30/is-stereotype-threat-overcooked-overstated-and-oversold/" target="_blank">Stereotype threat</a> was accepted orthodoxy for two decades.  Even now, its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat#Failures_to_replicate_and_publication_bias" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> has pages of information explaining it and a small section at the end pointing out that might be complete crap.</p>
<p>It's way harder than it should be to find good information.</p></div>		</li>
