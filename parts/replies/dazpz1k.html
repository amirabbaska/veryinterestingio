			<div class="markdown"><p>“Alright,” said Ford, “imagine this. Right. You get this bath. Right. A large round bath. And it’s made of ebony.”</p>
<p>“Where from?” said Arthur, “Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>“So you keep saying.”</p>
<p>“Listen.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>“You get this bath, see? Imagine you’ve got this bath. And it’s ebony. And it’s conical.”</p>
<p>“Conical?” said Arthur, “What sort of…”</p>
<p>“Shhh!” said Ford. “It’s conical. So what you do is, you see, you fill it with fine white sand, alright? Or sugar. Fine white sand, and/or sugar. Anything. Doesn’t matter. Sugar’s fine. And when it’s full, you pull the plug out… are you listening?”</p>
<p>“I’m listening.”</p>
<p>“You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls away you see, out of the plughole.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“You don’t see. You don’t see at all. I haven’t got to the clever bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?”</p>
<p>“Tell me the clever bit.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you the clever bit.”</p>
<p>Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit was.</p>
<p>“The clever bit,” he said, “is this. You film it happening.”</p>
<p>“Clever.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the clever bit. This is the clever bit, I remember now that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then thread the film in the projector… backwards!”</p>
<p>“Backwards?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit. So then, you just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?”</p>
<p>“And that’s how the Universe began is it?” said Arthur.</p>
<p>“No,” said Ford, “but it’s a marvellous way to relax.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This motel room analogy has always bothered me. If you had an infinite number of rooms and all of them were full then you would have no spare rooms to move your guests into. Every new room would be filled by the infinite number of people you had staying there.<br />
The only way to do it would be to temporarily have a larger number of rooms (double the size of infinite) in order to accommodate the infinite number of old and new guests. Since you can't have larger than infinite, how does that work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't double infinity because that is simply infinity as well. But you can perform operations on every member of the set of infinity, much like I've done with the motel, and the results are perfectly valid. Any finite number, no matter how large, can be doubled, so we can always make room in the hotel as long as everyone moves at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider the case where it's just one guest. The new guest tells the guy in room 1 &quot;Hey, this is my room now. Move on to the next one.&quot;. Then that guy does the same thing to the guy in room 2, and so on. No matter how many times this goes on, there's always a next room for the displaced guy to go to. Meanwhile, room 1 is now vacant and the new guest can move in.</p>
<p>Now, as a practical matter, this whole process would take an infinite amount of time. But we'll assume we have some sort of time fuckery to speed that up. After all, we had to get the original guests into their rooms somehow. The real point is that at no point will this process assign two people to the same room, nor will it fail to assign someone a room.</p>
<p>A similar thing applies to the infinite number of guests. Instead, every guest leaves his room and walks down the hallway to the room with twice the number. The new guests are then placed into the empty odd-numbered rooms, which can be done while the old guests are moving (even if the hallway only has room for 1 person).</p>
<p>Now, the point of this isn't fancy ways to rearrange guests (though that is starting to intrigue me). The point is to illustrate counterintuitive properties of infinite sets. After all, it seems clear that there are fewer even numbered rooms than all rooms. And yet we managed to fit all of the original guests into just the even-numbered rooms. It's possible for two infinite sets to be the same size even if it seems &quot;obvious&quot; that one is larger.</p>
<p>But make no mistake: some infinite sets <em>are</em> larger than others. But explaining that is a little more involved, and is hard to do with the hotel analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, I have a problem with statements like &quot;some infinite sets are larger than others&quot;. It seems to me that would only be the case if you accept a definition of infinite where it is somewhat finite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as if you're trading time for space. You trade the time of all those people that have to move, so you get more space.</p>
<p>Perhaps an easier way to understand is this variation of the story.</p>
<p>You have the infinite hotel and all that jazz, but then a new guest arrives. So what you do, you tell the person in room one, to move to room two and tell that person to move to room three and so on. Then you put the guest in room one. What happens is, there is always one person without a room, except the person without the room keeps changing. </p></div>		</li>
