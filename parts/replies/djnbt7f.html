			<div class="markdown"><p>Coral polyps live as a symbiote with zooxanthellae algae, which photosynthesize and produce carbohydrates for the polyps. When temperatures get too high, the algae starts to produce free oxygen radicals (which is harmful). The polyps have no choice but to expel the algae, which causes the coral to lose color (algae are responsible for coral color) and lose an important food source. This is known as coral bleaching.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching</a></p>
<p>Edit: A lot of people don't seem to understand that modern corals have never experienced a dramatic climactic shifts like the current one. The current climate change is causing a temperature shift at 10 times the rate as any of the temperature shifts of the Pleistocene epoch. Natural selection doesn't work that fast for complex organisms. Additionally, reef-building organisms have gone extinct at multiple points in Earth's history -- modern corals are not the only organisms to have evolved the trait of reef-construction. </p>
<p>Edit: Corals don't always die from coral bleaching, but they can be significantly weakened and susceptible to pathogens. Corals do recover from bleaching, but bleaching does show that temperatures are becoming unlivable for corals. </p>
<p>Edit: As u/BornAmidstSaltAndSea pointed out, corals will die from starvation and necrosis if the algae do not return. As average marine temperatures rise, there will be prolonged bleaching, and algae will not return to the symbiote fast enough to prevent the polyps from starving. Combine that with ocean acidification, invasive species, marine pollution and disease, and you'll see why a majority of coral species are headed for extinction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is important to remember &quot;coral&quot; isn't one species, there are thousands, each with their own biological requirements. When you see stories about large scale bleaching events it is usually in an area known as the <a href="http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/coraltriangle/" target="_blank">&quot;Coral Triangle&quot;</a> or the Great Barrier Reef. In these areas there is very, very little temperature change throughout the year (1-2 degrees C in average air temp), so the animals in these areas are adapted to survive at that temperature and struggle outside of that range. In pre-industrial Earth, a rapid warming event meant 2-3 thousand years to go up 1C. Over that time there were species that went extinct and new species that came in to take their place. The issue today is that we are on pace to see a 1C rise in the next 50-100 years. The corals do not have time to adapt to these rapid changes and that is where our problem arises. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coral are diverse, and polyp size varies dramatically between species (1mm to 25cm). In most cases corals are colonial; meaning a group of polyps that have multiplied, grown and work together to maintain a singular skeleton. Picture an apartment block that work together to sustain each other, and grow their building (skeleton) so more polyps live with them. </p>
<p>This is a axial polyp that's about 2mm in size, you can also see the smaller radial polyps growing around him.

<p>There are heaps other vids on this channel that could help put coral ecology in context. Including how coral bleach, eat each other, and compete for space.</p>
<p>As for the Zoox part of your question. It lives in just under the tissue of the coral. This gives it protection and in return the symbiont (zooxanthellae) provide up to 90% of the coral food source.  Losing the symbiont means that coral can starve, and their immune system functions at a lesser rate. Leading to infection and disease, increasing the chance of mortality. </p>
<p>Hope this ends up helping.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the polyps are the microscopic animals that construct the calcium carbonate shells, so I guess it's the part you can actually see. But technically, both the polyps and algae form coral as a symbiotic organism</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you purge the algae from the coral, that makes space for other harmful microbes to take over. The coral's natural microbiome (the combination of microbes living in its internal ecosystem) protects it from harmful microbes just by virtue of occupying the space and using the resources. Think of it like a neighborhood. If houses become abandoned then anyone can move in. It's better to have houses filled up with benign people (microbes in this case) rather that you know won't be a negative influence on the neighborhood, than it is to have abandoned homes that a potentially harmful person (microbe) could move into. If there is no space or food for the microbes, they are less likely to settle down. </p>
<p>This is the same with other animal, including humans. Our bodies are covered covered and filled with microbes. Some of them contribute by performing specialized tasks like breaking down food in our intestines, but an equal number of these microbes are neutral. Neutral microbes don't do a job, but are good because they help shield you from harmful microbes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice summary! You touched on it, but I would just add that they will die from bleaching through starvation (if the symbionts do not return), and in some cases rapid necrosis. Starvation is the primary cause of death after the coral has bleached. Disease and bacterial infection are secondary causes. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That still doesn't answer the question.  How did these symbiotes survive for n-million years through ice ages and water-world earth with regular rapid temperature spikes and drops of 5-10^o and suddenly they're dying off to the human generated one?</p>
<p>Are we applying additional stressors?  Is the anthropocene extinction simply more rapid onset so they don't have time to adapt?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most species of coral did die out. As /u/Toxoplasma_gondiii mentioned, organisms faced with climate change have 3 options: Move, Adapt, or Die, and the speed with which changes are happening right now make moving and adapting more challenging than in most previous extinction events. Additionally, coral and other organisms that build carbonate structures like mollusks are facing a one-two punch of increased temperatures and increased CO2 levels in the water, which causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification" target="_blank">ocean acidification</a> and literally dissolves their shells and skeletons.</p>
<p>Coral is a sessile (stationary) life form, and those are particularly vulnerable to climate change because it's much more difficult for them to move to a healthier range. The trend since the dawn of marine life on our planet has been for a smaller percentage of organisms to be sessile as time goes on. Before the Permean extinction (the biggest one, 252 million years ago, during which 96% of marine species died out) about 66% of marine life was sessile, and after that had dropped to 50%. Before the K-T extinction (the dinosaur one 65 million years ago) 50% of marine life was sessile; afterwards, that had fallen to 33%. </p>
<p>The reason all coral hasn't died out (yet) is that there are some areas of the ocean that are relatively insulated from changes even during a major extinction event, and afterwards the survivors go forth and multiply across the Earth like they've got some sort of biblical mandate. After the Permean extinction, where 96% of marine species went extinct, it took only about 10 million years for the number of marine species to rebound. All those empty ecological niches cause a boom in species-building. </p>
<p>10 million years is a blink of an eye in geological terms, but in human terms it's 2 to 5 times as long as we've been around, depending how you count things. We don't have the technology to wipe out life on Earth, or even to cause more than a hiccup in the grand scheme of things, but we are definitely capable of making this place inhospitable to a lot of species adapted for current conditions, including ourselves. Environmentalism isn't really about protecting the Earth. It's about protecting ourselves from what the Earth does in response to the sorts of stimulus we're giving it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Previous climatic shifts happened over much much longer time frames as in tens of thousands or even millions of years. In previous times of change, they likely had time to just shift range and build reefs closer or further from the equator. This time , it's too fast from them to shift range. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have an amazing diversity of coral reefs right now, but that hasn't always been the case. During those times you mentioned corals did die off, in many cases dramatically. </p>
<p>Through adaptation (over a long time) and migration, they survived in small ecological pockets, until tempertures/environmental conditions stabilized, or returned to a more productive state. In which time they would begin to migrate, and recolonise newly favourable coastal habitats. </p>
<p>Corals can tolerate large daily temperature increases (up to 8 degrees Celsius). These usually return to normal (26 C) quite quickly (daily). Its when these increases don't return to normal that we end up with coral bleaching. How long it takes to stabilise (weeks/months) influences the severity of the bleaching event. As the climate warms these events are predicted to last longer, particularly during El Nino cycles. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
