			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not always true. Some have delusional bdd where they see things that aren't real, but most people with bdd see the 'flaws' correctly like anyone else would, but it's the emphasis we put on that flaw and the obsession surrounding it that's the issue</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's on the OCD 'spectrum' yeah. But it's obsessive behaviour linked to appearance, and the rituals are often used to try and alleviate the anxiety about how we look. Many people with BDD also have a diagnosis of OCD, so they are closely linked in many ways</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a note I would recommend not combining 'just' with OCD. In context, it's clear that you meant it as &quot;a variation or subset of OCD&quot;, but from my understanding of it, it's pretty disturbing, because even without diagnosis people with OCD are <em>fully aware</em> that they are behaving irrationally and will often try to hide or downplay their obsessive behavior because they know it's not normal, they just can't stop.</p>
<p>I have ADHD, and while it's not quite the same, there are times when the impulses literally override rationality and normal decision making. Having that be a more constant state rather than as a conditional trigger that can sort of be bargained against or bribed when approaching that condition sounds... a bit terrifying to be honest.</p></div>		</li>
