			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting, thanks for your explanation! It's pretty damn true in my case- I spoke English with one of my family members at home but not others, growing up English was learnt predominantly in the academic sphere so I know how to, for example, explain biology in English in a flow but can't in Chinese, it's not until when I moved country that I learnt socialising in English hence develop my emotional part for the language. So I've always known it HAS to do with my exposure and development linguistically. Your case of someone having fairly equal exposure to three languages since birth, but still preferring different languages for different expressions proves a strong point. </p>
<p>But then I noticed lyrics in Chinese love songs vs love English songs- how Chinese lyrics convey a lot more and paint a much fuller picture with fewer words, which led me to found a similar difference in actual literature (the classic novels), and I wonder if in this case the actual linguistic difference would play a part, or if it's just because of my exposure I have a better emotional connection to the Chinese language! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't explain about music, but one thing that is interesting is there is a linguistic reason that Asian tend to be better at math. In English, explaining multiplication or exponents is confusing. Three times three is nine; but times is also the word for the numbers on a clock. In Chinese, 9 is three threes which is much simpler to understand. Just small linguistic changes do dramatically affect the way that children learn. Personally, I don't find Chinese a romantic language partially because of the limited words, the romantic languages tend to explore love more effectively to a western ear. Thank you for sharing your experiences, I lived and taught in china (shanghai area) for three years but none of my students were as advanced as you so I was curious about some of these areas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For people who are fluent in sign, do they think the shape of the sign when thinking or the movements to make it? Like when I close my eyes I can see the shape of letters/characters in the languages I speak, but in sign there isn't really written version. So I am curious if sign users would think differently than in shapes?</p></div>		</li>
