<p>Let's say a vibrator costs $10 to make. The company usually sells for $20. You get one for free - to you, it's a savings of $20, but to the company, it's a loss of only $10. It's risky, but people are creatures of habit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the way that retail works, if it costs $20 in the store, then the store got it from the wholesaler / middleman / shipper for $10, who got it from the manufacturer for $5, who it actually cost $2 to manufacture.   The markup is simply staggering.  Giving them away is relatively cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, though this also begs the question of <em>who</em> is giving them away. If the retailer is, then for them, it still costs $10, which means it's still a $10 loss for them.</p>
<p>But yeah, the actual cost of products are ridiculous that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then remember that the $10 loss is also a tax write-off as a business expense. So the loss gets reduced by the corporate tax rate. Same way I can give $10 to charity, but it really only costs me $7 to do so because of tax write offs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the vast majority of the branded cases, it'll be the manufacturer. The retailer who sells multiple brands will more probably give out blanket discounts on a certain product category.</p>
<p>Also don't forget that even if their original manufacturing cost is low, they still need to pay for transport and the people to hand them out for free (or postage), so all in all it's not THAT cheap. It's just cheap compared to other traditional forms of marketing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why large companies try to be vertically integrated, and a great look into economies of scale. If they can do everything from harvesting, shipping, manufacturing, and selling the product in store, and sell at significant enough volumes, you could charge literal pennies for your products and still see a profit, or at least see a breakeven point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, I was talking to the owner of a boutique sex toy company and he gets each unit for $25, QA state side gets rid of about 30% of them, and then they sell wholesale for about $75. The consumer price is $109. Everyone makes money. </p>
<p>This company gives away a ton of their toys to people who are hard (pardon the pun) into the scene and usually go back for more multiple times. </p>
<p>Giving away demo units to the right crowd is a great way to get them to spend real money on the final product. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Demo units, factory seconds, test units, ect. It seems like most people don't realise that company doesn't sell every item that comes off the conveyer belt, in addition to the fact that products have inbuilt markup, because that's just how sales work. Demos/factory seconds/test units tend to be kind of &quot;last resort&quot; to items that are just straight up offered for giveaways, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add, also, a manufacturer will make said vibrator for $5, sell it to a distributor for $10, who sells it to a retailer for $13, who sells it to a customer for $26, which means to say they can provide up to 4 x free vibrator and if it results in one sale, the supply chain breaks even.  </p>
<p>Also, if a customer got a defective vibrator, much more cost effective to send a $5 new one than refund them $26.  They may again become a walking advertisement for you via word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>My company gives away 20 - 40 samples per week to interested customers through social media , they are worth their weight in gold.  </p>
<p>The reality is the samples are only a fraction of the cost of the shipping to customers (they cost us 0 from manufacturer but around 20 cents of freight costs, and shipping costs $2.67 to send 4 oz through first class USPS) and the cost of the whole thing only need result in the sale of one bag of treats or one bottle of oil for us to be in the black for having sent them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s important to note that the point you address in your first paragraph is the exact reason Amazon and Tesla and other up and coming business are doing so well. They are going straight from manufacturer to the consumer. Tesla specifically is bypassing the Retail (dealership) model, and Amazon is partnering up with most companies and getting products at wholesale pricing, or usually manufacturer costs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, actually Amazon doesn't get them from us at any price at all.  I love Amazon because here's how it works with them:    we send off bags of our 21 oz treats directly to FBA, they're listed on the website for $16.99.  Amazon stores them in their warehouse and charges us deeply discounted shipping rates to get it there.</p>
<p>Once it arrives, it's now listed on Amazon as for sale.</p>
<p>When it sells on Amazon, Amazon charges us an additional $6 to fulfill the product.  That leaves us with $11 which is paid to us after completion of the sale.</p>
<p>In that way, Amazon actually gives us a lot more than retailers expect, (we sell to retailers at $6.45 vs.$11) but they also take no risk for themselves -- if the product doesn't sell, it doesn't sell.</p>
<p>And while Amazon doesn't account for the Lions share of the consumer​ market still, it's worth noting the difference in complexity of achieving a classic distribution network vs. providing the products on Amazon themselves.  </p>
<p>The former takes years of attending trade shows, developing relationships with key people who are in charge of purchasing decisions at distributors (at large distributors this is sometimes a committee of people), offering concessions, discounts on ISOs and free shipping on volume, etc. etc. </p>
<p>And then if they place an order and stock is low, it causes an issue, whereas if they don't place an order when you think they will, it also causes an issue (product perishability)</p>
<p>Now, compare all that to Amazon.   You make a listing, slap some labels on the side of a few boxes, take them to UPS.  (Or in our case now, UPS comes to my warehouse every day anyways)</p>
<p>Amazon doesn't care if your stock is low.  It will throw another listing up at the top of it's search bar instead.  </p>
<p>And if your sales are slacking and you're worried about perishing product, throw on some Amazon PPC to bump the listing all the way to the top for high converting keywords.</p>
<p>Not to mention as a brand new product, Amazon PPC let's you put your stuff in front of an audience of millions.  There are precisely no distributors that take on a totally untested product like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We not only have a social media person reading every message we get (his name is Awantha, he lives in Sri Lanka and I hired him on upwork) but he is also outreaching to 11 new Instagram dog celebrities per day to offer samples to as well.</p>
<p>In that way we not only convert interested people who are following us on social media into customers, we're also identifying and sourcing new prospects.</p>
<p>Not only do many of the Instagram dogs themselves become repeat customers, but their followers too will become repeat customers.  </p>
<p>And then they'll continually share about the product line, converting even more of their followers.</p>
<p>We base whether to offer samples (either from a request or  from our outreach) on how many followers they have.  The sweet spot is 10k - 50k.  That's enough followers for a review to be effective, but not too many followers that they expect monetary compensation for the review.</p>
<p>Using only social media advertising I've grown Kronch from nothing into a nation wide brand worth close to a million and a half bucks.  Not a single magazine ad, TV ad, billboard... All that crap is expensive and ineffective.</p>
<p>Social media is a frictionless environment to connect directly with the people. The cost and effectiveness of truly meaningful social media promotion is unparalleled.</p></div>		</li>
