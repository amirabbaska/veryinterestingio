			<div class="markdown"><p>The unintuitive nature of the problem goes away when you consider that while there are only 23 people in the room, there are actually 253 unique pairs of people in the room.</p>
<p><em>edit</em>  /u/midtek is correct that each trial is not independent, which also needs to be accounted for to calculate the exact probability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The solution might be less surprising if you realize there are 253 distinct pairs, but you would still be no closer to finding that 23 people really does solve the problem.</p>
<p>The 253 pairs are not statistically independent, and so it doesn't really help at all in solving the problem to know that there are 253 pairs. I think it is a bit misleading to point out that there 253 pairs, particularly to those who don't understand the mathematics behind the problem to begin with. I think there is a very strong temptation for laymen to treat the pairs as 253 independent trials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, more generally, the number of distinct groupings of M objects in N objects is (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient" target="_blank">Binomial Coefficient</a>):</p>
<p>N!/M!/(N-M)!</p>
<p>Where ! is the factorial (i.e. 4! = 4*3*2*1). So for pairs M=2 and you get N!/2/(N-2)!. Now by the factorial definition, N! = N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)(...), which can be written as N! = N(N-1)(N-2)!. So you can write the equation as N(N-1)(N-2)!/2/(N-2)! = N(N-1)/2, as /u/Midtek pointed out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My Probabilities professor countered the initial skepticism by having a couple of doubting students work out the inverse, namely: &quot;Imagine a room where everyone has a unique birthday. What are the chances that new people walking into the room also have unique birthdays?&quot;</p>
<p>In some ways, its easier to wrap your head around that question. Everyone but the least logical in the class jumped to the Pigeonhole Principle and declared that the chance is 0% for any group over 365 people, even if they are hand-picked. For a group of 180 people who are hand picked at the start, the chance of the 181st having a unique birthday is ~50%. Imagining the 181st through 190th person walking into the room and having completely unique birthdays is less than the chances of 10 heads-up coin flips in a row. That's really small. About 0.1%.</p>
<p>So, aim lower. Hand-pick 60 people with unique birthdays and invite ten more people to walk in. The 61st has a five-in-six chance. The full string of ten being unique is like rolling a die ten times and never rolling a one. Now, that's easier than 10-heads, but the math is still familiar and it works out to ~16% chance of having them all be unique. So, the tipping point has to be less than 60, as well.</p>
<p>At that point you've convinced yourself that the number is actually pretty low and its not shocking to do the math and find 23 as the 50% mark. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My prob/stat professor did it more simply, he had us all enter our birthdays and look for a match.  With a 45-50 person class he had damned good odds, and nothing helps skepticism like a demo.  He said he has never failed to find a match, although he was a bit nervous about the small(ish) class size. </p>
<p>After that we did the math to prove it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Chance of coin flip: 50% heads</p>
<p>Probability of heads as decimal: 0.5<br />
Two flips = 0.5 ^ 2 = 0.25 (25%)<br />
Five flips = 0.5 ^ 5 = 0.03125 (3.125%)<br />
