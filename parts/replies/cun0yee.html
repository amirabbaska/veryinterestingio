			<p>The unintuitive nature of the problem goes away when you consider that while there are only 23 people in the room, there are actually 253 unique pairs of people in the room.<br><br><em>edit</em>  /u/midtek is correct that each trial is not independent, which also needs to be accounted for to calculate the exact probability.</p>		</li>

			<p>The solution might be less surprising if you realize there are 253 distinct pairs, but you would still be no closer to finding that 23 people really does solve the problem.<br><br>The 253 pairs are not statistically independent, and so it doesn't really help at all in solving the problem to know that there are 253 pairs. I think it is a bit misleading to point out that there 253 pairs, particularly to those who don't understand the mathematics behind the problem to begin with. I think there is a very strong temptation for laymen to treat the pairs as 253 independent trials.</p>		</li>

			<p>But that means the chances are higher than with independent samples. So if the layperson assumes there are 253 independent samples and thus finds it plausible that the probability is &gt;50%, the aid &quot;23 people = 253 pairs&quot; served its purpose <em>despite</em> and not <em>because of</em> an inaccuracy.

			<p>You are right to some extent. <br><br>It just gives an arbitrary impression that it has an increased chance of that to happen because 253 &gt; 23. But as /u/Midtek/ pointed out, it won't help you solve the problem or find the real % of chances 2 people shares birthdays. <br><br>And as /u/N8CCRG/ said, this can lead to false conclusion at some point, because of inaccuracy. Since people could think &quot;Oh, there are 28 people in the room, so there are 378 pairs. That's more than 365, so some people HAVE to shares their birthday.&quot; When in fact, these pairs of people are unrelated to the actual birthday problem.<br><br>So the aid &quot;23 people = 253 pairs&quot; only helps because people are misinterpreting the number and what it does represent. It isn't a good aid, since for the aid to work, it needs that the people you are talking to doesn't understand statistics and probability. And worst, by giving them that hint, you lead them to a bad way to solve the problem on their own.<br><br>EDIT : Removed a part leading to more confusion.</p>		</li>

			<p>How would you figure out how many total possible pairs there are. If there are 253 pairs couldn't you just do 253 / (total possible pairs) and have that = 50.7%?

			<p>To find the total number of pairs just use the formula n choose k, or n!/(k!(n-k)!). In this case, n=23 and k=2.That equals 253 total possible pairs for 23 people. However, as stated above this has nothing much to do with the probability of having 2 people share a birthday.</p>		</li>

			<p>And if <em>k = 2</em> it's written a lot easier as <em>n(n-1)/2</em>, or <em>(n^2 - n)/2</em> which is the same thing. So we get 23Â·22/2 = 253.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fully agree with you.<br><br>In fact, I would like to add more numbers to support your point.<br><br>Let's say 2 people met on the street, and asked each other their birthdays. The probability that they have different b'days is 364/365. Let's say the pair &quot;WIN&quot; if they have the same b'day.<br><br>Consider N such pairs of people (each pair is unrelated to the other pairs). The probability that NONE of the pairs WIN would be (364/365)^N<br><br>For a single pair N=1, the probability that they don't win is 99.7%  <br>If you take N=50, the probability that no pair wins is 87%  <br>If you take N=100, the probability that no pair wins is 76%  <br>If you take N=150, the probability that no pair wins is 66%  <br>If you take N=200, the probability that no pair wins is 58%  <br>If you take N=250, the probability that no pair wins is 50.3%  <br>If you take N=252, the probability that no pair wins is 50.1%  <br>If you take N=253, the probability that no pair wins is 49.95%  <br><br><br>So here we can see that the probability that atleast one pair WIN, crosses the 50% mark at 253 pairs.  <br>This is the same number of pairs as in a party of 23 people, which supports awningmining's point greatly.  <br><br>It seems to show that the fact that the pairs are not independent, doesn't seem to change the probability by much.</p>		</li>

			<p>While it's a good approximation, it's not the real answer.<br><br>As an example is the extreme case where we have 366 people. They must share birthday. 366 peoples creates 66,795 pairs. (364/365)^66,795 &gt; 0. It means that with your formula, there is still a chance they don't share a birthday, which is impossible.<br><br>For reference, the real answer is :  <strong>(365! / (365-n)!) / 365^n</strong><br><br>which, as an example, would result for n=5 to : (365x364x363x362x361)/(365^5 ) = 97.29%. So there are 2.7% chances at least 2 people are sharing birthday.</p>		</li>

			<p>I agree with you too..

			<p>this is entirely correct. <br><br>However, with 23 people there are 23 <em>independent</em> events in which birthdays are not shared. this is the key to solving the problem.<br><br>the situation where nobody shares a birthday may be called &quot;Q&quot;.

			<p>the situation is idealised.<br><br>Also, at the top I should have said that when 23 people are counted in one by one and their birthday is checked, this test is independent each time. I guess its assumed that the people are otherwise unconnected and nobody was born on Feb-29th etc.<br><br>I was also unclear about the fact that in computing Q specifically, the case where nobody shares birthdays, it is mandatory that by the time you get to person 23, no matches have been found. Its actually a very particular outcome. All the other multitude of possible outcomes have been grouped into the situation called P.<br><br>while any 2 or more people having the same birthday turns out to be quite likely, it is vanishingly unlikely that all 23 people have the same birthday, which corresponds to all 253 unique parings sharing the same birthday. The point is that &quot;P&quot; groups together a large number of unlikely outcomes, where only 1 or more of them has to occur to be in the P situation. There are also many unique triples, quads, quints and so on that could share a birthday, all the way down to 23 (i think) ways to have 22 people out of 23 with the same birthday. P represents the sum of all these scenarios.<br><br>Q requires one specific thing to happen which as it turns out has about 49% chance of happening.<br><br>the person I was replying to has explained succinctly why the 253 unique pairings that exist are not independent tests, so I wont repeat that.</p>		</li>

			<p>If you have 3 people A, B, and C.  There are 3 unique pairs.  They are dependent because if A and C have the same birthday and A and B do not have the same birthday, then we can infer that B and C do not have the same birthday.  Rather than B and C being some unique trial that could have either outcome, which would have implied they were &quot;independent trials&quot;.<br><br>Maybe the flaw in the thinking is coming from the fact that pairs are unique but the people comprising the pairs are not unique?</p>		</li>

So it will add up x, which ranges from 1 to 22. So you get 1+2+3+...+22, which gives you the result.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's a combination. It's actually 23!/[2!<em>(23-2)!] which ends up reducing to (23</em>22)/(1<em>2)  or 23</em>11, which gets you the 253. </p>		</li>

			<p>I still don't understand... Could you please explain what you mean when you are talking about unique pairs? So the first person has 22 possible partners - I get that. But what does the rest mean? How does knowing that there are 253 unique pairs help you grasp the probability more intuitively?</p>		</li>

			<p>The &quot;253 unique pairs&quot; thing he was talking about was ultimately not correct, but it does make this &quot;paradox&quot; seem a bit less crazy. The reason is that there are 253 possible pairings of 23 people and 365 days in a year, so there are 253 chances for them to be the same. 253 chances seems much less paradoxical than &quot;23 people&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>And, more generally, the number of distinct groupings of M objects in N objects is (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient" target="_blank">Binomial Coefficient</a>):<br><br>N!/M!/(N-M)!<br><br>Where ! is the factorial (i.e. 4! = 4*3*2*1). So for pairs M=2 and you get N!/2/(N-2)!. Now by the factorial definition, N! = N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)(...), which can be written as N! = N(N-1)(N-2)!. So you can write the equation as N(N-1)(N-2)!/2/(N-2)! = N(N-1)/2, as /u/Midtek pointed out.</p>		</li>

			<p>To find someone with <em>your</em> birthday is clearly a 1/365 chance, because the date is specified and we all know how many dates there are to a year. So yes, finding someone with your birthday is a completely different question.</p>		</li>

			<p>My Probabilities professor countered the initial skepticism by having a couple of doubting students work out the inverse, namely: &quot;Imagine a room where everyone has a unique birthday. What are the chances that new people walking into the room also have unique birthdays?&quot;<br><br>In some ways, its easier to wrap your head around that question. Everyone but the least logical in the class jumped to the Pigeonhole Principle and declared that the chance is 0% for any group over 365 people, even if they are hand-picked. For a group of 180 people who are hand picked at the start, the chance of the 181st having a unique birthday is ~50%. Imagining the 181st through 190th person walking into the room and having completely unique birthdays is less than the chances of 10 heads-up coin flips in a row. That's really small. About 0.1%.<br><br>So, aim lower. Hand-pick 60 people with unique birthdays and invite ten more people to walk in. The 61st has a five-in-six chance. The full string of ten being unique is like rolling a die ten times and never rolling a one. Now, that's easier than 10-heads, but the math is still familiar and it works out to ~16% chance of having them all be unique. So, the tipping point has to be less than 60, as well.<br><br>At that point you've convinced yourself that the number is actually pretty low and its not shocking to do the math and find 23 as the 50% mark. </p>		</li>

			<p>My prob/stat professor did it more simply, he had us all enter our birthdays and look for a match.  With a 45-50 person class he had damned good odds, and nothing helps skepticism like a demo.

			<p>so if i rolled a 365 sided die 57 times, there's a 99% chance that it will land on the same number twice?<br><br>edit: so i've thought it out and it makes sense to me now, it finally clicked. <br><br>lets say you're on roll number 40, now instead of having a 1/365 chance of getting the number you want, you have a 40/365 chance of getting it, because you've already got those past 39 rolls banked as possible matches. and then for the next 17 rolls your odds keep slowly increasing like that. by the time you're on the 57th roll your odds are something like 1 in 7. <br><br>so starting at the beginning you'd have 57 rolls with your odds slowly going from 1/365 to 1/7 by the end, i think. collectively that'd add up to 99% because the odds aren't so bad toward the end.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's the same. Doesn't matter if you pick your number now, or later at random, it's still one number. Provided your dice roll doesn't affect anyone else's of course. <br><br>The key is you're either matching one specific number to the set of all the other numbers rolled, or you're examining the full set of numbers rolled and then picking anything with a duplicate. For example, you could roll your die, or pick your number and then have the other 56 people roll, and not get a match to your number, but still have say 3 other people get the same number as each other. Hopefully that illustrates why having any duplicates is more likely than specifically matching your number/birthday. </p>		</li>
