			<div class="markdown"><p>As a lawyer, sometimes random people I have never met and will never see again ask me at functions what type of law I practice. If I am bored sometimes I will respond &quot;Third Amendment law.&quot; Inevitably people don't know the 3rd Amendment, so I respond truthfully that the 3rd Amendment says &quot;no soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.&quot; In response to their puzzled look, I explain &quot;when soldiers come back from overseas, sometimes they move into random people's houses like they live there and we need to go to Federal Court and assert the homeowners 3rd amendment rights to get them to leave.&quot;  The reactions are quite enjoyable, with the most common reaction being &quot;wow, I never realized that was really a problem&quot; at which point I nod up and down and typically walk away to get another drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only mitigating factor in this automatic VP promotion is the person still has to meet the rules for the office, so they have to be a natural born citizen, at least 35 years old, and a resident within the US for 14 years. Granted it's very unlikely that any VP would not meet these requirements, but it does add a caveat to the whole system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The VP is regulated by the same rules in the Constitution as the president, so the concern would instead be for the Speaker of the House, who doesn't have the same rules. Right now we have three people in the line of succession who are ineligible for being born elsewhere, e.g., Canada.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, who are they/were their parents also foreign? If their parents were American, they'd still be eligible, since American parents (in almost all cases) pass on their citizenship to their kids who are born abroad (which is one of many reasons why the birther movement was a pile of horseshit, and Ted Cruz was eligible to run for President, despite being born in Canada). </p></div>		</li>
