			<div class="markdown"><p>on this point... when i was in college i didnt have a lot of spare cash, so i ate sparingly.  i learned in my bones what the phrase 'being hungry' meant.  i was focused, driven and well motivated.  i use that approach sometimes when i lift, i let myself get a little hangry before i go in.  </p></div>		</li>
