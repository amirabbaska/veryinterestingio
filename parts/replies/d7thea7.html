Basically the story goes that you buy other peoples old stuff, repackage it and sell it as your own. Wait for 3 years and then sell first batch of your own stuff.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Want to know something sad? There's only one cheesemaker in the village of Cheddar that still makes traditional cheddar.</p>
<p>It's expensive, because the milk's unpasteurised and requires a lot of working by hand.</p>
<p>They also age some of the cheese in a cave. </p>
<p>Most people eat the supermarket pasteurised stuff - it's a log way removed from the original!</p></div>		</li>
