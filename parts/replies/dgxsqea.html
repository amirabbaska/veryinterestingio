			<div class="markdown"><p>Was surprised this explanation wasn't the top post, since it is literally one of the first examples used in university when learning about water absorption bythe body. </p>
<p>If you drink just water, you will absorb water normally by osmosis. If you drink water with a certain ratio of glucose and sodium added, you will absorb water by both osmosis and these active transport gates, which requires a combination of all three molecules to function. Therefore hydrating you faster.</p>
<p>This is perhaps less of an issue for sports, but is used extensively by health organisations like the WHO to treat diseases like cholera. Cholera deaths are mostly due to dehydration due to the incredibly dehabilitating diarrhoea, meaning any liquid you drink goes straight through you, with greatly reduced time for water to be absorbed by osmosis. Adding glucose and sodium means water can be absorbed by two methods, and much faster, saving a huge number of lives during epidemics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably not the top post because it is not explaining LI5 - it's explaining at a university level. What's a GI tract? Sodium channels? Coupled transport gates?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fine - your body actually absorbs water better when there's a little sugar and salt with it.</p>
<p>This is the 100% absolutely correct explanation, as taught to us in medical school. /u/Dex2Dex nailed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My apologies. My intention was not to be obnoxious, rather, this intro tends to be the easiest way to catch readers' intention by indicating that my opinion is different than all the ones posted. Otherwise its easy for people to skim and assume everyone is agreeing with the top comment. Ill take the judgmental looks any day if it means people wont be misinformed :)</p></div>		</li>
