<p>Conversely, baby teeth would never be big enough or numerous enough for adult use and would probably break or wear away too quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, adult teeth actually begin forming right away, but take a really long time to develop. Baby teeth are smaller, with much thinner enamel and develop much more quickly. They're really just place holders for the adult teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Most (but not all) mammals have two sets of teeth. The first set comes in around the time the should be moving from milk to other foods, but the jaws are still too small for the size and number of the adult teeth. Baby teeth bridge the time between coming off the mother's milk, and the jaws being big enough to allow for the adult set to start coming in.  </p></div>		</li>
