			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of sterilization at the factory is to prevent anything infectious from the factory getting to your home. The factory likely services globally, and if a virus or bacteria from that part of the world (or along the way in transit) found it's way to a part of the globe with no natural immunity from that strain, and someone wipes their sensitive parts with infected paper, you now have an outbreak.</p>
<p>Think of it in a similar manner to gauze and other medical implements; in that they are sterilized during manufacture so as not to introduce anything new and unknown to a wound you're trying to treat. Same goes for tissue paper, suppositories, tampons, etc., anything that touches sensitive skin or mucous membranes has to be sterile to prevent infection.</p>
<p>As for getting re-infected as soon as you hang it on the wall, that is very true, but by and large, those are going to be germs that your immune system is familiar with. It's also a primary reason to close the toilet cover before you flush to help minimize the effluence of germs when your toilet &quot;sneezes&quot; during flushing. You can also get a cover or caddy for your TP that protects it from germs until needed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless you can produce evidence that manufacturers are actually doing this, the simplest explanation is that sterilization of toilet and tissue paper is not at all intentional - just a side result of the manufacturing process. I'd even go as far as to say that most toilet paper probably isn't entirely sterile. Just take a look at a manufacturing plant and you'll see they aren't taking the necessity precautions. Furthermore, most packaging is totally insufficient to maintain sterility during transportation.</p>
<p>Maaaybe suppositories and tampons are sterilized. Certain types of medical gauze and absorbent pads are definitely sterilized but these come off a carefully designed assembly line, are put in special packaging and are clearly marked as sterile.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You ever squeeze a package of tp to slowly push the air out,then let go and look at it all sucked-in? If air can get in, it's not sterile.</p></div>		</li>

<p>etc, etc.  Yes, biocides are used in the manufacture of all paper, but you select from a different set when it'll be used on people, both because of allergies and because of efficacy.  Also, there are FDA regulations on the operating points and temperatures for sterilization that they don't care if you violate when you are, say, producing newsprint.</p></div>		</li>
