			<div class="markdown"><p>US healthcare is expensive, but not because of doctors having to pay lawyers because they've been sued for malpractice. That can be expensive, but it doesn't happen nearly as often as the public believes. I know several doctors who have only been sued once or never at all. </p>
<p>The reason US medicine is expensive is because the money is basically a game. A hospital charges an outrageous fee for a procedure because they KNOW it won't all be paid. The insurance company will negotiate to pay a certain percentage of it. For example, if a hospital charges $100 for a $100 procedure, the insurance will only pay $10 dollars and refuse to pay the rest. So the hospital charges $1000 for a $100 procedure, and the insurance negotiates to pay $100 of that $1000, which is what that procedure actually costs in the end. It's messed up.</p>

<p>Edit: my point in mentioning that I know several phsycians that haven't been sued isn't that they did or did not have to pay for legal fees (which they wouldn't because of insurance), it's that malpractice lawsuits aren't as rampant as many people believe (though, yes, malpractice insurance is still expensive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Healthcare lacks most of the necessary requirements for an efficient free market, so competition doesn't work to drive down prices. The market is about as far from having perfect information as you can get - the service providers themselves can't tell you how much some procedures will cost and consumers often have little choice if which provider they use. It is completely irrational to expect free enterprise to fix the problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hard to test your theory when it's not a free market. Lurking variables include the artificial restriccion of supply through licensing, government approval needed for schools, and government approval needed to build a new hospital. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm.... I'm actually curious. How does the insurance company get to negociate what it pays and why is this not the case in other countries? Any relevant examples/experiences are more than welcome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I train customer service reps for a health insurance company in the North Eastern us. For the most part doctors (or the groups they belong to) get to choose which insurance they are going to accept, and when they contract with an insurance company they negotiate rates as a part of the contract. </p>
<p>This is not without exceptions. Medicare (federal insurance for those over 65 or those who have certain disabilities) also sets standard rates that providers have to accept if they want to see Medicare patients. Then, Medicaid (state level insurance typically for low income/children/frail elders) sets their own rates at the state level. </p>
<p>So potentially you have a doctor who could get paid 5 different rates for 5 patients getting the exact same service because each patient has a different insurance. </p>
<p>It's bonkers, and really incentivizes health Care provider to prefer some patients over others because they will get paid more. </p>
<p>Medicaid programs are also very different in each state. We're really lucky in New England to have some of the better Medicaid programs, but you could live in a state where the Medicaid program is terrible.</p>
<p>Edit to add: one of the major problems in the US is that we don't regulate the cost of health Care overall to a large enough extent. So if you have good insurance your coverage could be free, and the person after you might pay $500 for a cast or bandage that is made of $2 worth of supplies. </p>
<p>The cost of medications is also out of control, and our Medicare program is set up so that seniors can only get about $4000 (a but less) worth of medications in a year before they fall into a coverage Gap where their costs sky-rocket. </p>
<p>When some medications are $1000/month or more, this turns into a real problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct,
Also what's keeping the cost down in France is that the medical prices are set by the government and are fixed.
Hospitals must be sustainable with that money, no negotiation involved.
I also believe that the almost free medical education allows docs to be paid less than in the US, so that changes things quite a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really..doctor pay isn't at all the reason for high US costs..It all comes down to instance and pharmaceutical companies. Drugs cost a shitload to research, and we are the country where they make they return on that investment. So while other countries can get drugs much cheaper, we are the ones subsidising that basically. Plus all the politics involved. It's a fucking mess. Oh also there are legal blocks to negotiation. It's either drug prices can't be negotiated or something. You'd have to look it up im too lazy to do it for you lol.  but it's pretty fucked up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about lawyers in the US is propaganda. In reality, malpractice costs are a few percent of the total cost of healthcare, at most. Certain specialties have higher malpractice insurance for various reasons, but overall the cost is small. And it could be brought down a lot if doctors would actually enforce some discipline on their profession, but they largely do not, which results in astronomical medical error rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is absolutely not true.  I'm an accountant and have a few doctor clients across different specialties, and they can easily pay 10% of their income in malpractice insurance.  That's a huge expense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing in your post contradicts what I said. In fact, I specifically stated costs can be higher for some specialties. But here's the thing: malpractice insurance can be a significant expense for individual doctors without being much of overall healthcare spending - and that is the case. It is absolutely the case that it's only a few % of healthcare spending.</p>
<p>Even for those specialties that pay a lot for malpractice insurance, they still make quite a bit of money. There was some concern a few years ago because for specialties like OB/GYN the cost became too high, but even that was a result of insurance company losses in the stock market and not really any rise in malpractice costs.</p>
<p>That said, the current malpractice system is not perfect. It doesn't serve doctors or patients very well. Only 10% or less of patients who are harmed actually get any compensation. And it can be very adversarial for doctors, when it really doesn't need to be. I would design something totally different if it were my preference, but I don't trust anyone calling for reform to do anything but decimate the system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What we commonly call <em>mutuelles</em> can be of two kinds :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>regular, private, for-profit, commercial, capitalist corporations, usually part of a good old insurance company</p>
</li>
<li>true mutual funds, which are self-owned non-profit corporations and where the board is elected by the clients  (here called members), in a manner maybe similar to the credit unions in the english-speaking worlds.</li>
