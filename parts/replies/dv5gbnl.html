			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that not all chips are as hyperbolic as Pringles, but I think calling most chips flat (in a geometric sense) is a mistaken. They're not super hyperbolic but they're usually slightly hyperbolic and almost never elliptic.</p>
<p>I looked at Lay's, they have a slight hyperbolic shape, judging from both memory and he image on the bag. Not a lot, like pringles, but slight. Same with Utz which I just ate. I've never seen even a slight elliptical shape to potato chips. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Lays (or any other chips) that I've eaten have never had a pronounced hyperbolic shape, and were mostly flat except for the really big ones. For most, it's probably random, due to imperfections in the potato.</p>
<p>Where you <em>do</em> see a shape, it could possibly be because when it is immersed in oil while cooking, one side cooks and expands before the other, leading to that curve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it hyperbolic, or catenary? If catenary, it might be the result of the center of the chip somehow being more buoyant as it fries, with the edges on the major axis hanging down, which pushes up the edges on the short axis. I wonder if the shape you're noticing disappears when chips are fried in zero gravity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A catenary is a 2D plot of the hyperbolic cosine function. The OP refers to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraboloid#Hyperbolic_paraboloid" target="_blank">hyperbolic paraboloid</a>.</p></div>		</li>
