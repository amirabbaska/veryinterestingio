			<p>&gt; But it make sense for a fish to evolve a photosensor on the top of your head to help manage your sleep pattern. <br><br>Hate to nitpick, but the eye wouldn't be evolved for a purpose. The trait would have evolved through natural selection, and the fish would have used it in that environment, but the eye didn't evolve so the fish could manage its sleep pattern. You may not have meant it the way you typed it, but I felt like this is such a commonly misunderstood quality of evolution that it needed to be corrected.</p>		</li>

			<p>I could have said : But it make sense for such photosensor to give an advantage to some fish and stay in the genetic makeup.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Wow if this is true it is very interesting because a lot of the mysticism around the &quot;third eye&quot; in humans (entirely a spiritual idea) is related to ideas like dreaming and OoBE (out of body experiences).<br><br>Since this third eye was located where your brain managed sleep patterns it is loosely related to dreaming. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Some prehistoric fish and early tetrapod apparently had a third eye socket<br><br>Not true. There is a larger foramen but no socket and no true eye....there is no lens and none of the complex morphogenesis you see in eye development.</p>		</li>

			<p>The eye socket is made of foramina. 2 If i remember, but i'm not sure. Anyway, the prehistoric fish had opening and that's all that I was saying. I never said they had true eyes did I? We can't know that because eyes are tissue that doesn't fossilise. (Maybe some rare exception of eye fossilisation exist, but it's not the norm). Did those fish and early tetrapid had only more developed photosensitive cells, simple eye, or a more complexe eye I don't know and I don't know if scientific have an answer about that yet. Like I said, not much is left about prehistoric soft tissue.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;The eye socket is made of foramina.<br><br>No, it is not. The eye socket is what you get when skeletal progenitor cells from various sources work their way around the developing eye and lay down skeletal tissues around it.  This includes the prechordal cartilages of the braincase as well as dermally-derived bones of the orbital margin. Induction of the eye itself also occurs very early, when neurulation has not yet completed. This is absolutely not the case with the pineal organ. <br><br>A well-developed pineal organ is itself present in a lot of modern &quot;basal&quot; fish, including lampreys, paddlefish, etc., as well as some modern reptiles. In no case is it an &quot;eye.&quot; In no case does it develop like an eye. In no case does it induce the development of a visual cortex in the brain to process visual input. In no case does it induce the formation of a lens placode. Best case scenario, you have a translucent scale that overlays it allowing unfocused light in.<br><br>I think you've made a huge conceptual jump from a pretty basic observation (many Paleozoic animals had a conspicuous pineal foramen) to some really crazy speculation (that this means they had an eye there and that the pineal gland is a vestigial eye). There actually is really good embryological and paleontological data to show that your interpretations are demonstrably wrong, period, end of story. It's okay to be wrong, but don't double down on it when someone points out that this is the case.</p>		</li>

			<p>Wikipedia isn't always right, and this is a case where wikipedia is oversimplifying the similarities to the point that it is incorrect.<br><br>There's only one recent treatment of tuatara pineal histology, and it's based on histological study of a single specimen. This is because tuatara are endangered and, as a result, getting access to tissues for study is very difficult. The aforementioned histolgoical study shows one H&amp;E-stained histological slide at low magnification of the pineal, and a second at higher magnification showing the so-called retina. All in all they show that there are cells with similar morphology to photoreceptor cells (not a shocker) in the pineal organ. That's about it. They don't show the &quot;lens&quot; (which is a thickened section of neurectoderm rather than a true ectodermal lens) and they note that the &quot;retina&quot; is not inverted as it is in true eyes. They try to draw an analogy between a patch of mesenchyme that fills the parietal foramen and the cornea, but the cornea is stratified squamous epithelium, not mesenchyme. So really, all we know is that there is light-sensing capability (which we already know) and that pineal morphogenesis is totally different from eye morphogenesis (again, we already knew that), although there may be similarities between the pineal and some sort of primitive optic vescicle like structure (i.e. a light-sensing outpocket of the brain without any sort of image formation and processing). <br><br>The idea that the pineal organ in any of these animals had image focusing capabilities and was associated with image processing capacity within the brain is ridiculous.</p>		</li>
