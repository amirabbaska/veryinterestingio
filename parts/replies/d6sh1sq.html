<p>Hate to nitpick, but the eye wouldn't be evolved for a purpose. The trait would have evolved through natural selection, and the fish would have used it in that environment, but the eye didn't evolve so the fish could manage its sleep pattern. You may not have meant it the way you typed it, but I felt like this is such a commonly misunderstood quality of evolution that it needed to be corrected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/do-fish-sleep-with-their-eyes-open/" target="_blank">&quot;The simple answer is yes! They are sleeping, and they can sleep at any time during the day or night. Fish do sleep with their eyes open, because they donâ€™t have eyelids (except for some sharks) to close!&quot;</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to study behavior of fish because it's hard to study an specific individual for a long time in the wild. It is true that some fish doesn't seem to sleep at all, but plenty of them have sleep-like behavior and even more of them are either Diurnal or Nocturnal. They might not sleep in the same way we do, but they might be more active in a period of the day and less active in another period. More active when food is more available and less active to conserve energy. They could potentially (never study that in specific) still need their pineal gland to manage their active/inactive cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow if this is true it is very interesting because a lot of the mysticism around the &quot;third eye&quot; in humans (entirely a spiritual idea) is related to ideas like dreaming and OoBE (out of body experiences).</p>
<p>Since this third eye was located where your brain managed sleep patterns it is loosely related to dreaming. </p></div>		</li>
