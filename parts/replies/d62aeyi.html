<p>Watch the whole thing. The part where he shows his intelligence is towards the end, but the first 2 and a half minutes are important in order to establish context</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crows are incredibly smart. They can remember faces of multiple researchers, to the point where the scientists would need to wear masks to avoid being attacked when studying nests and counting eggs, because the crows know they're going to be bear the nests. They are also capable of constructing (albeit extremely rudimentary) tools to make collecting food and nest-building easier. Crows are awesome </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some duck species will &quot;adopt&quot; ducklings from other adults after they drive them out of the pond. The ducklings care for themselves and mixing in adopted ducklings ensures a lower chance of their own ducklings being eaten if a predator snatches a random duckling. So to the ducks it may not matter which ones are theirs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This spring I saw a mama duck leading 28 day-or-two-old ducklings.  I don't think there is any way that all of them could have been hers, but they appeared like one happy family.</p>
<p>I have also seen a rooster who thought he was a duck (or thought the ducks were chickens).  He maintained a harem of ducks, led them about, and even tried mating with them.</p></div>		</li>
