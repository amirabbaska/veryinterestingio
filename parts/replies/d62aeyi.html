			<p>There's also the issue that it's quite possible that Alex was an unusually smart parrot.

			<p>It could also be that they exhibit forms of intelligence we don't usually study. For example, pigeons have spatial intelligence that can surpass humans (they've been shown be able to more quickly identify rotated variants of shapes than people can, and are able to remember physical locations far better than we can). If researchers are basing intelligence only on ability to count and learn language, then it excludes a lot of potentially intelligent species. </p>		</li>

			<p>Not a majority but most mammals at least have a sense of self. Maybe not in the same way humans do. But in the most primal sense they understand &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;. <br><br>Sentience is the most basic form if intelligence.

If humans were interested enough to constantly train animals then animals would possibly pass this knowledge on to their young instinctively. <br><br>We would essentially be doing what theoretically an alien race would do to a primitive species on another planet but on our own.

It's present in young children who can barely count, babies without language, and many animal species, likely because it's useful to know which is more, even if you don't know exactly how many more.<br><br>100 grains of rice versus 1000 grains is an easy approximate number system judgement because that's at a 10:1 ratio. Even 100 vs 200 is pretty easy at 2:1. But 100 vs 150 (2:3 ratio) gets harder, and 100 vs 110 (10:11) is really hard, even though 1 vs 11 is easy (1:11 ratio with the same 10 grains difference).</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, so can certain birds (see other posts on this thread), but human researchers and non human animal researchers are notorious for crapping on each other for under/over estimating qualities of nonhuman clades (respectively, within each group).<br><br>So I'd say that as a human researcher, &quot;you're just dismissing nonhumans as is typical&quot; :-P</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, when I replied the guy above it said that maybe it was like telling that 100 grains of rice was different from 1000 grains of rice. Cept he said 100 was more.  ... am maybe they just wait at the tunnel till after all the ducklings come out and then a little longer just in case they missed one.  Do they get mad if you make one disappear before they all come out or are they like eh, I must have them all and go on? </p>		</li>

			<p>I seem to recall the study included removal of balls from the hidden containers and the chicks still reliably went to the container with the most remaining balls. <br><br><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7975260.stm" target="_blank">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7975260.stm</a></p>		</li>
