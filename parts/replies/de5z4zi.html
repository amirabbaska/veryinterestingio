<p>Almost, but not quite. At my group, we say &quot;Carry the message, not the messenger&quot;. It's fine to say &quot;Someone at my group said....&quot;, but not OK to say &quot;Bill at my group said...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yea, so how does court ordered AA attendance work?</p>
<p>Edit: I know, it is on the attendee to report. So you are telling me they can all just lie and there is NO WAY AA could verify because, sorry, PO/Judge/Prosecutor, we simply don't keep records. HA HA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically when you're court ordered to AA/NA, you have to bring a paper that one of the homegroup members would  sign or you have to describe in a note book / journal what took place during the meeting or what the meeting was about.  Yes people can and do lie about their meeting attendance and they get away with it.  It really has to do with how much a person wants to be sober.  I'm not sure about other cities but the one I live in, skipping and lieing about meetings will get people jammed up if their court ordered since there's a pretty good chance the PO has other clients that attend the same meeting.  No they won't say &quot;oh yea so and so wasn't there&quot;  but if two clients come in saying they attended the same meetings but both describe the meeting differently, chances are one of them didn't go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right... which clearly makes it not &quot;Anonymous.&quot; I always ask for more secular... <em>medical</em> treatment options for my clients, but sometimes that judge has a hard on for AA, and I always laugh about how not-anonymous the forced attendance is.</p></div>		</li>
