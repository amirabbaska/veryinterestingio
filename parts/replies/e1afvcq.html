			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially cells that are undetermined in their role in the body. So in your bone marrow you have hematopoietic stem cells which divide and change into all the different “blood cells” depending on different signals they get from your body. That’s just the basic gist of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precursor cells are also called progenitor cells. They are the cells from our bone marrow that go through differentiation and maturation to become the red blood cells we see in our blood stream. Think of it as a cell lineage. </p>
<p>Here they are listed in descending order from stem cell (in bone marrow) to red blood cell (in blood stream)....</p>
<p>&quot;Hemocytoblasts&quot; (Stem cell for all blood cells, platelets, and mast cells) ---&gt; &quot;Common Myeloid Progenitor&quot; (differentiates into red blood cell, certain white blood cell, or mast cell lineages) ---&gt; &quot;Proerythroblasts&quot; ---&gt; &quot;Basophilic Erythroblasts&quot; ---&gt; &quot;Polychromatic Erythroblasts&quot; ---&gt; &quot;Orthochromic Erythroblasts&quot; ---&gt; &quot;Polychromatic Erythrocytes&quot; (also  called &quot;Reticulocytes&quot;) ---&gt; &quot;Erythrocytes&quot; (red blood cells, as we commonly know them from our blood). </p>
<p>Moving along (sorry if any of this is confusing)...</p>
<p>&quot;Erythrocytes&quot; are the only one of these cells found in its majority in the blood stream. &quot;Erythrocytes&quot; do not have a nucleus and DNA (in mammals, at least).</p>
<p>The precursor cells are everything listed before &quot;Erythrocytes&quot;. Presursor cells have a nucleus and DNA and are found in the bone marrow. About 1% of &quot;Polychromatic Erythrocytes&quot; are found in the blood stream where they are then called &quot;Reticulocytes&quot;. The remaining 99% of &quot;Polychromatic Erythrocytes&quot; are found in the bone marrow. Increased &quot;Reticulocytes&quot; in the blood can be a sign of your bone marrow responding to anemia (low &quot;Erythrocyte&quot; levels or low hemoglobin levels). Other precursor cells are found in the blood if a person has certain types of bone marrow cancer.</p>
<p>Key for prefixes, root words, and suffixes.</p>
<p>&quot;Baso-&quot; means &quot;foundation/base&quot;, but can also mean &quot;blue color&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;-blast&quot; means &quot;immature&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;-chromo-&quot; means &quot;color&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;-cyte or -cyto-&quot; means &quot;cell&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Erythro- or -erythro-&quot; means &quot;red color&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;-genitor&quot; comes from &quot;-genesis&quot; and means &quot;develop/create&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Hemo-&quot; means &quot;blood&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Ortho-&quot; means &quot;proper/correct&quot;, but can also mean &quot;straight&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Pro-&quot; means &quot;before&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm a veterinarian. All of this information is true for dogs, cats, humans, and many other mammals.</p>
<p>Don't mean to confuse you, but birds have &quot;Erythrocytes&quot; that are nucleated and do have DNA. Bird &quot;Erythrocytes&quot; are elliptical (shaped like a flat American football) rather than biconcave (doughnut shaped) like that of humans/dogs/cats. Llama &quot;Erythrocytes&quot; do not have a nucleus or DNA, but are elliptical in shape, like birds. Little differences like this are what make veterinary medicine challenging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Packed RBC transfusions are leukoreduced, but they do still have very small numbers of WBC's in them (relatively speaking, they can still number in the millions/unit).  Current filters remove 99.99% of WBC's, but the 0.01% left over is not ignorable.</p>
<p>This is why we still have to irradiate pRBC's when they are given to people at high risk of graft-versus-host disease: to inactivate the WBC's still left after leukoreduction.</p></div>		</li>
