			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not 100% correct but it's on the right track.  Humans also have an all-or-nothing muscular response.  The difference is in the amount of nerves going to muscles and how many muscle fibers each nerve controls.  Humans have a lot more gray matter and more brain power dedicated to motor control then primates.  This allows us to recruit less muscle fibers at one time which gives our nervous system a much larger control over how hard our muscles contract.  One example of this was a study that showed some monkeys have no golgi tendon organs in their hands.  These proprioceptors automatically relax muscles to prevent injury to tendons or muscles when a contraction is too much for a tendon to support.  Interestingly enough hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine can reduce the action of this protective proprioceptors.  These are the cases we hear of people lifting cars off of kids.  Additionally, we respond very poorly to pain compared to other species.  Pain is yet another signal that tells our body to stop doing what it's doing and it's very hard to ignore.</p>
<p>We are capable of super strength within our muscles.  Our bodies are kind of lazy and like to do as little as possible in order to survive. They respond well to training and the best trained can lift incredibly heavy things.  The problem is that when they are not trained the adaptations they would have received such as increased bone density and stronger tendons are not there and maximal muscular contraction can cause serious injury.  One of the links below shows broken bones as a side effect of electrical shock and it's because are muscles are over-stimulated and the protective effect of our nervous system are ignored.</p>
<p>I don't have a source for this part but iirc the idea that primates are four to five times stronger than humans was based in early 1900's study where researchers couldn't get the primates to actually use a dynamometer so they assumed the Monkeys were 4 to 5 times stronger because they didn't seem to be trying with the tension they were pulling.  Later studies put chimps at 2 times stronger then humans pound for pound.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically we respond well to pain, because it keeps us from getting injured. </p>
<p>Although things can get messed up and you may end up in positive feedback loop and get the condition formerly known as RSD (CRPS). But that isn't a common response, it usually works well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So if a person injected themselves with epinephrin and norepinephrin could they lift more than normal/with greater ease? How would we perform this experiment?</p></div>		</li>

I guess I can troll my professor now when we meet about my capstone project </p>
<p>Edit: In all seriousness this is a theory based on observation and known physiology.  Researchers are trying hard to confirm or refute it but there are dozens of different things that are going on simultaneously which makes it very hard to determine the effect of a single component.  There are currently studies going both ways but the hardest part of doing a proper test is that someone may get hurt and the specific nerves need to be measured during that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, when you lift that much weight your blood pressure skyrockets. Your brain fights this by constricting blood flow to it. When you drop the weight, your blood pressure can drop precipitously within a second. If it drops too quickly, the blood flow to the brain won't go back to normal quick enough, and you can pass out from the momentary lack of adequate blood flow to the brain. </p></div>		</li>
