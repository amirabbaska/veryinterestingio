<p>I think you meant to say the opposite, that humid environments are more likely to have languages with complex tone. Case at hand: Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The article you linked also references another study. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3680446/?report=reader" target="_blank">That study</a> shows that ejective consonants are more prevalent in high altitude areas due to lower pressure and therefore lower effort to produce them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I've made that mistake while writing. As you said, more complex tones appear in more humid environment, which seems to be also more logical if we think about string instruments. If a string is not stretched, you cannot get the tones. Editing that now. I cannot read the article you sent now, but that seems also quite interesting and will look at it too. Thanks for pointing it out. ^^</p></div>		</li>
