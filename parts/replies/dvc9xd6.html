			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a light oil that goes into the engine, it causes the first engine runs to be exceedingly hot, sometimes over a 100 Celsius above a normal engine start. It's also nasty stuff, it feels like someone dumped vegetable oil over the entire engine. Very sticky and it smells terrible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is clearing preservatives and getting the engines to run at max efficiency a requirement before a given MQ-1/MQ-9 is greenlit for live missions or are the benefits too miniscule?</p>
<p>Also given the plane has been worn-in already, could a pilot liftoff immediately after engine start up and gain max acceleration (for example during an emergency)?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually have a ground test stand where we can run the engine to ensure things like propeller blade angle, torque settings, fuel flow, and to ensure all preservatives are gone. Until we ensure all engine functions work within limits the plane doesn't leave the ground. Things like this don't usually happen every flight though, we usually do these heavy ground checks during scheduled inspections.</p>
<p>For the second question it gets a little more in depth. Firstly, we actually have to let the aircraft engine warm up before we go full throttle after engine start. This is because cold oil is thicker and will destroy the inner workings of a motor if too much pressure is built up. This process usually only takes a couple minutes though, so even in emergencies we can get a plane off the ground very quickly. </p>
<p>Secondly, the MQ-1 has no real electronic engine control, so if the pilot goes to max power too quickly or for too long it will over-temp or blow up several parts and the motor will seize. This is because the throttle attempts to do what the pilot asks and dumps far too much fuel in far too quickly, this situation is especially common in excessivly cold and hot weather. </p>
<p>Thirdly, the MQ-9 actually has an electronic engine control that inhibits any lead foot commands from the pilot. The pilot can slam the throttle forward and the engine will respond as quickly as possible in a safe and sustainable manner. This is a massive benefit, we've lost many a good MQ-1 Predators too over zealous pilots.</p>
