			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on how the car is held in place. Hit it on the right angle, with it's gears in neutral and you might just push it. In fact, a friend's father was struck in the head by a wrecking ball, and while it severely injured him, he survived, because much of the ball's force translated into momentum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And as far as your friends father, that is the point he is trying to make.  Smaller objects will be damaged less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. It's not just the size. It's the relative density and freedom of movement. You guys just don't seem to understand physics that well. Take car accidents for example. Some people survive crashes at 200kmph. Some people die at 2kmph. If the energy from the impact is translated one way, the pedestrian gets knocked over, and hits their head. If it's translated another way, it turns into momentum, throws them over a traffic light into a tree, where they're brought down, alive by the fire brigade.</p></div>		</li>
