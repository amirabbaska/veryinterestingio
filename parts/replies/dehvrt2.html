			<div class="markdown"><p>this is false, or at least for it to be true would require immense pointless finetuning. The Planck scale is the natural scale for commutators of spacetime geometric observables; different theories can disagree on the details of these commutators but they cannot really move them away from the Planck scale (unless they bring in some sophisticated machinery), simply because of dimensional analysis.</p>
<p>There is a <em>lot</em> of theoretical evidence for the significance of the Planck length in quantum gravity, even remaining agnostic on the actual completion. In the article I linked I sketch a couple arguments for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why other scientists (deservedly) rag on string theorists. The Planck length significance , despite what you said, is NOT settled science, not even close. Not even testable with current technology.</p>
<p>Yet any layman reading your reply above would get the opposite impression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His point about the commutators applies to 'conventional' relativistic quantum mechanics, you don't need to use string theory to prove that some very weird things are probably going to happen at the Planck scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the point I think is severely misunderstood is that &quot;the Planck length has no significance&quot; is an extremely strong statement. It means that there exists an UV fixed point for gravity. The <strong>theoretical</strong> evidence (outside, as I said, of string theory) is strongly against this. The opposite, itself, is very natural, and a very innocuous claim. It seems normal to me that a quantum theory of gravity (= geometry) has quantum geometric observables, and the commutators are non-zero, and they should be of order ~ Planck area simply by dimensional analysis. It would be <em>abnormal</em> if it were otherwise, and then you need to bring to the table a reasonable mechanism (and a motivation) for these commutators to be either zero or to be pushed to another scale.</p>
<p>Of course, if your point is that theoretical physics is pointless by default, then ok.</p>
<p>(By this, by the way, I don't mean that exactly the Planck length specifically is a fundamentally relevant or significant quantity - nobody claims this. Of course it is meant that it is to be understood as an order of magnitude. Also, the Planck scale might be shifted by a series of effects, like extra dimensions, but what I'm saying about it should remain correct.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very clear that our current theories of physics don't make consistent predictions if you think about plank scale physics -- they can't be right! </p>
<p>Whether the new physics is at the plank scale (ie: our current theories work all the way until they stop even making sense) or some scale before that is an experimental question. But there must be new physics somewhere there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also known as &quot;pretty flimsy evidence&quot; in every other field of science other than string theory.</p>
<p>EDIT: Look, I'm not totally discounting it, I'm just saying let's be honest about what we're talking about here. You're repeating all of this as if it's settled scientific fact when it is not. There is a <em>lot</em> of theoretical evidence that the Sun revolves around the Earth. There are mathematical models out there that make it work. But we know from observations that that's not the case.</p></div>		</li>

<p>that's not true. whether sun goes around earth or earth goes around sun is a matter of perspective. one description may be mathematically easier, but both are equally correct. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back during the time of Copernican Astronomy this was definitely the case. I think if people understood that there is a divide in what theoretical physicists consider good evidence and what experimental physicists considered good evidence, there would not be nearly as much confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a particularly important point about quantum gravity. Quantum gravity has an &quot;uncontroversial corner&quot; of predictions <em>all</em> possible QG theories must agree on, the semiclassical, or one-loop, regime. This is because gravity is actually renormalizable to one loop, it's from two loops onwards that it has problems. And so there are a bunch of things that we know about QG that we have a high degree of certainty about independently of the actual complete theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Planck length is just Newton's constant of gravity rewritten in particle physics units. I think you would agree that Newton's constant has physical significance (ie: it sets the radius of the earth's orbit around the sun).</p>
<p>You are however correctly pointing out that it is definitely not a minimum length for exactly the reasons that OP pointed out.</p></div>		</li>
