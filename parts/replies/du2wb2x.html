			<div class="markdown"><p>At sea level, there are about 5 x 10^19 atoms per cm^3 - and half as many molecules since most of the air is N2 or O2. Our atmosphere mostly consists of molecules, while in space there can be molecules, atoms, or ions (or any mix thereof) depending on local conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 atom/cm³ doesn't sound like much in comparison, but there are also countless trillions more of cm³ of space, than of our atmosphere.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what would win, our atmosphere, or all the space between Earth and Mars?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our atmosphere consists of mostly nitrogen gas and oxygen gas. These are molecules, consisting of several atoms (2 atoms in this case). But each atom nitrogen atom/oxygen atom is also a lot heavier than a hydrogen atom (14 times &amp; 16 times respectively).</p>
<p>So it depends on how you count. If you compare the number of particles (molecules), then there is about 2.547x10^(19) particles/cm^(3). If we instead focus on the number of atoms, we would have to double that to 5.094x10^(19) atoms/cm^(3). Lastly, if we're interested in doing a mass comparison and convert all the atoms in the atmosphere to hydrogen atoms, then we end up with 7.351x10^(20) hydrogen atom mass equivalents per cm^(3).</p>
<p>This is calculated for a global average temperature of 288.15K (15^(o)C) and sea level pressure of 101325Pa (1 Atm).</p></div>		</li>
