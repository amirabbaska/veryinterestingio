Obviously comparing surface temperature to geothermal temperatures would depend on the location though (the equator has more heat from the Sun than the poles).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note this is only true for the crust, where heat flow out is conductive. In the mantle, where heat flow is mostly convective, the heat is much more efficiently removed, so the increase in temperature is 0.5 C per km.</p>
<p>Using your example of 25 C per km, the core at 6,731 km would be 159,275 C! Much too hot. It's closer to 6000 C in reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget auto compression. Air temperature rises by roughly 1° C for every 100m you descend below sea level due to a phenomenon known as autocompression. I used to do ventilation engineering in an underground copper mine and they get hot once they get deep. La Rhonde in Canada they cool the air twice before it reaches the bottom of the mine and it's 30+°C there at the face. So in the winter they intake freezing air, warm it to go underground, cool twice, deliver to face and expel to surface where it forms constant snow clouds at a height of about 60m</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you think about it, if heat from the sun were constantly flowing into the ground everywhere, the Earth would be constantly getting hotter, and it isn't.</p>

<p>It could very well if the Earth were tidally locked (and cloudless), but it wouldn't heat up forever. It would reach an equilibrium rather quickly, as the surface emits more and more radiation with increasing temperature. (Power~Temp^4)</p>
<p>More specifically, if we ignore atmosphere, and all other factors that are a bitch to calculate, the radiative heating would have to be equal to the (local) radiance, which varies. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we find that the average 341 W/m^2 would result in a rather chilly surface temperature of <strong>278K</strong> (roughly the melting point of water). The maximum radiance is 1120 W/m^2 , with an equivalent temperature of <strong>375K</strong> (roughly the boiling point of water) and the poles would ever slowly <em>approach</em> <strong>0 K</strong>. Between those two points is a wide zone that would be perfectly comfortable to humans, barring the whole no-atmosphere thing of course. A pretty mundane-ish temperature all in all; no molten rock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I fully understand your first paragraph but how would approaching 0 K be a consequence to removed 'radiance-delay' factors? If the earth receives sunlight more directly and the core gets so hot that it has to radiate the heat back more immediately, how would the core not be significantly heating up the poles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you're actually right: it wouldn't really approach <strong>0</strong>K, that was too liberal a statement on my part. But the heating of the soil would take <em>long</em>. <strong>Very long</strong> as you get to significant depths (&gt;100 meter), due to how heat transfer in solids works. It would reach equilibrium at a couple kilometers depth with the geothermal heat already there, and only a tiny, tiny portion would be transferred along the horizontal. Because the change in radiance along the surface is also very low, the effect of heat conduction <em>through</em> the surface would amount to <em>almost</em> nothing, though not 0, no. The background radiation alone would keep the poles at a minimum of 3K, so it would end up slightly warmer than that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An average square meter of the Earth receives on average 341 watts of solar power. Of this, about 161 watts is absorbed at the surface.</p>

<p>Curious about this number. I've gone outside and measured it on a sunny day at about 1000 W/m. Is that an average over a period of a year? Or the average of all the earth at one point in time? Or something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the average over the entire earth over the entire day.  It peaks out at 1340, but half the planet is in the night side, so that cuts the average in half right there.  The slant angle of the sun during daytime accounts for the rest -- turns out that the average insolation across the globe is 1/4 of the peak value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this value is much too low as well. Certifications for solar panels are conducted at 1000w/m2 with areas in closer to the equator receiving more like 1300. For example, peak solar insolation for a city like Toronto would be ~1100W/m2 with an incidence angle of 0deg.</p>
<p>They may be assuming that the average value is 341 due to declination and tilt angles?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cduke23" target="_blank">cduke23</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! It’s important to note that the certification is at standard test conditions of 1000 W/m^2 @25°C and an air mass of 1.5. That’s note going to be a real world condition mind you as solar panels often run at 40-45°C when illuminated and under load. The air mass is important as well but I don’t think I can explain that well. Point being: the current of the module is directly proportional to the insolation and the voltage of the module is inversely proportional to the temperature. I.E.: high altitude, long &amp; bright sunny days coupled with low mean temps are best (think winter in Denver vs summer in Phoenix). </p></div>		</li>
