			<div class="markdown"><p>It is mostly self written. Sometimes we have a big team only to develop the software, for example the software which comes with the instrument or for the data reduction. But the data analysis, codes are mostly developed by individual scientists. For sure, we benefit from the pre-written  packages in our codes. The engineers who work on developing new instruments for the telescopes use more of tools and modeling softwares .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you advise undergraduates who want to involve themselves in research to learn code? The way you said it makes it sound like itâ€™s almost a requirement..</p>
<p>Thank you for the Q&amp;A</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure it is a requirement for an observational astrophysics. Maybe a small group of theoretical astronomers do not program, but programming skills are generally very important to contribute to today's astronomy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but as a research student in psychology, many of our experiments are written in python (specifically a branch of python developed solely for psychology: PsychoPy)</p>
<p>While it's possible to have someone write it for you, it's much more convenient to write it yourself (and helps avoid confusion or miscommunication).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for fun: how's code quality? We don't get proper software development classes in a physics master in my country, and many phds end up writing erratic code only they understand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thx for this, it motivates me that learning coding because it is interesting for me is a great thing even if Im in biomedical research</p></div>		</li>
