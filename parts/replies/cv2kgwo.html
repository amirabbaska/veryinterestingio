			<div class="markdown"><p>Clothes are cut in stacks with a die. So even though they say they're the same size, each piece of fabric cut in one stack will be a slightly different size. Add in the slight changes in seam allowance for each pair, and you get several articles of clothing that say they're the same size that are all slightly different. </p></div>		</li>
