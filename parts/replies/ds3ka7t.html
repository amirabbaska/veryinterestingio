			<div class="markdown"><p>To pile onto what you said about guidance, generally its onboard gyroscopes - think of these as old school accelerometers that you have in your fitbit or your cell phone that can detect when and how you move. If the analogue computer in your missile knows where it starts from... and it knows where its going to... and it knows how much and in what direction its been moving, getting close enough to the target is actually pretty simple. And we're talking nuclear weapons here, so +/- a few hundred meters is &quot;good enough&quot;. </p>
<p>Another form of guidance is stellar. Literally comparing sightings of stars, the time of year and date/time. The SR-71 spy plane had an astral navigation unit. </p></div>		</li>
