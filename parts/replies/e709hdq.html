			<div class="markdown"><p>After using something relatively heavy for an extended period of time (like a chainsaw or weed whacker), I'll have strong tremors when I try holding something like a glass of water.</p>
<p>Is this what you guys are talking about?</p>
<p>Are these what are called essential tremors?</p>
<p>(I know the feeling of muscles shaking <em>during</em> a heavy use. Just want to clarify this post is talking about after usage, correct?)</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, maybe that's more of a vibration thing. Idk just wondering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one answered your essential tremor question, but no, muscle tremors are not essential tremors.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_tremor" target="_blank">Essential tremor</a> is a neurological disorder similar to Parkinson's, so the tremor in essential tremor is coming from the brain, not the muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically it’s central nervous system fatigue that causes them to shake. </p>
<p>Muscles require a signal to contract; through nerves that directly innervate muscle fibres. The frequency of the the signal to contract becomes lower and as such the muscle is unable to hold a constant contraction, which results in a very rapid contract-relax-contract-relax type pattern that looks visibly like shaking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had heard that it was the brain 'learning' the optimal time to fire each muscle fibre group.  For an exercise that is done frequently, the brain already knows when to fire.  But for using muscles in new ways, the brain has to figure out the best timing.  That's why when you start working out, you get a lot better quickly without actually gaining any muscle mass.  Your body / brain is just getting more efficient use of what it has already.</p>
<p>Or is this all nonsense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is 100% the correct answer to the question.  If someone works out by lifting weights, the first gain in strength comes from cns coordination and not muscle cross section/size.  If your muscles are shaking it's explicitly due to the nervous system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Fast twitch&quot; and &quot;slow twitch&quot; refer to type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers, of which there are several subcategories, each having different properties that collectively make a trending spectrum of fiber types, based on things like type of energy metabolism, force per cross sectional area, contraction speed, fatigue rate, etc. Generally speaking the type 1 (slow twitch muscle fibers) are oxygen-using, contract slower, fatigue slower, and have less force per area than the type 2 (fast-twitch) fibers. That being said, it is not a perfect categorial system as type 2a fibers (considered between type 1 and type 2b on the spectrum) actually has a greater force per x-sectional area than 2b.</p></div>		</li>
