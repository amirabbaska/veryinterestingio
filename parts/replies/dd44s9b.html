			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, check out this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TdC28CH.jpg" target="_blank">diagram of the canal</a>. Not having locks would simply drain the higher-than-sea-level lake in the middle and result in a dry canal. </p>
<p>While there is a 9 1/4 inch difference in the sea levels between the Pacific and Atlantic canal entrances, that would just result a west-to-east current in the canal, but only if the canal were at sea level the whole way. The locks are there to get the canal over a mountain and back down again, not to fix a difference in the ocean sea levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a fair number of boaters on it as well, Even a cruise ship. </p>
<p>Given how isolated all the locks were when first built, I think it is a more impressive project than the Panama canal. Visit Jones lake lock, and think about building that dam in the middle of now where, with no all weather roads to transport anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tides, differences in gravity, temperature. There are tons of variables that affect sea level, the fact that is is within about 10 feet all over the globe is actually quite impressive. That's 10 feet out of 8,000 miles or 4,000,000 feet, which is nothing.</p></div>		</li>
