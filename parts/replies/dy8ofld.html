			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect what you are really getting at is &quot;how far back were humans basically the same as modern humans&quot;...eg, leaving out things like lactose tolerance in Europeans and high altitude tolerance in Tibetans and increased salivary amylase in farmers, and other small adaptations to whatever environmental conditions people are in.</p>
<p>That's a tricky question to answer because we can't just take a time machine back to interview prehistoric people.  </p>
<p>For that, instead you probably want to know about the archaeological record concerning behavioral modernity  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity</a></p>
<p>This is basically when people start showing examples of fully human traits like burials, art, use of more diverse natural resources, and more complicated tools.  There's a lot of debate about the point, but most people put it before 50000 years ago but after 150000 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. I looked it up and the answer seems to be that scientists cannot extrapolate the data to determine where a bottleneck may have significantly altered human DNA. They do know humans 2 million years back were making sophisticated tools (which may be a marker for language development) , and that there have not been any significant genetic changes from 50,000 forward. So your answer is somewhere in between those numbers, but probably a surprising distance closer to 2 MYR than you might expect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't be the child's DNA, it would be their immunities. Europeans built up a lot of disease immunities through agriculture and then came to America carrying those diseases. It wasn't a matter of genetics, but lack of exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you expand on that a little bit please? I was under the assumption that major diseases like the Bubonic plague did actually result in DNA-based immunities (albeit in a rather small population). So, theoretically speaking, a lack of several millennia could be the cause of immune deficiencies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, depending on how far back you go and what part of the world you'd take that child from, you would also find more severe cases of inbreeding (due to a much smaller general population at the time). So, chances would be much higher than today to have some other form of biological defects.</p>
<p>Add to this the lack of millennia of genetic selection pressure that this child (and its DNA) simply skipped and I'd wager you'd find a child most definitely less equipped to compete in today's society.</p></div>		</li>
