			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. Let's have, if we can ideally, 5× &quot;we&quot;.</p>
<p>Is there a trend of an increasing educational gap:</p>
<p>• globally?</p>
<p>• in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country" target="_blank">developed countries</a> overall?</p>
<p>• in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country" target="_blank">developing countries</a> overall?</p>
<p>• in Europe/EU? (depending on what data can be found)</p>
<p>• in the US?</p>
<p>Any of the 5 would be great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also depends on how you measure education. Are we talking about the quality of basic education or whether people get academic degrees? Both decide how educated a person will be, but they're not necessarily related to each other.</p></div>		</li>
