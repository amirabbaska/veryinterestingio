			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand a bit:</p>
<p>Optical storage gets the spelling &quot;disc&quot; from &quot;compact discs&quot; which are so named because they were developed in part by Phillips, which is based in Amsterdam.  The British spelling is favored, because that's the one that Phillips employees knew.</p>
<p>Magnetic storage media (hard disks and floppy disks) were developed primarily by IBM, an American company.  Therefore, the &quot;disk&quot; spelling was favored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty interesting and definitely provides additional context. Aside from that the other context that immediately comes to my mind is the <strong>disc</strong>us throw, which is pretty damn ancient but definitely didn't originate in America. </p>
<p>I honestly struggle to think of other contexts where disk is commonly used in America nowadays though. When I bought my last dog frisbee it was spelled &quot;disc&quot; there too, so I'm wondering if disk is still more common in America since CDs popularized the 'disc spelling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS is the answer we were looking for.  <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CD-AUDIO_logo.png" target="_blank">&quot;compact disc digital audio&quot; </a> of the CD craze of 1990 is where the &quot;disc&quot; over &quot;disk&quot; started gaining traction.  And Philips, notoriously, collected 10 cents for every &quot;compact disc&quot; logo that appeared on a product bearing one inside, or player capable of playing one.  They controlled the patents and therefore had complete control over anyone selling a player or disc (for quite some time).  So, it was literally up to them how America perceived this new product.  &quot;Disk&quot; stood no chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were called diskettes because they were actually more than just the flat cylinder. There was the packaging around it that made it possible to handle and use.</p>
<p>A CD, by contrast, doesn't need a package. It's rigid enough to hold on the edges and robust enough to survive a few smudges and fingerprints anyway.</p></div>		</li>
