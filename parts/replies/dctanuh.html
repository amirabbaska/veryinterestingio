			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. I used to daydream on the bus and I'd lose track of what was happening around me. I'd still be fully alert but I wouldn't be able to tell you who had got on at the previous stop for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont agree with this entirely. I dont think I'm special by any means, but during long drives I will often get lost thinking of chapters for my novels. Plot points, interactions, settings, visually imagining them, et cetera. I'm the one driving, and while I do this I sort of only focus what's happening in my head. I've never had a wreck, nor have I missed a turn. I've drove a four hour trip lost in my novels the whole time and ended up stopping in the driveway at my destination wondering how it happen, yet in retrospect I can recall seeing glimpses of signs and landmarks that I hadn't processed when it happened. </p>
<p>If that isn't multitasking, them I dont know what is. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Some questions to ask:</p>
<p>Do you pass these landmarks often? Are you <em>sure</em> you recall seeing them just then, or from a previous trip?</p>
<p>Were you focused intently on thinking about your novels when you had to merge lanes or watch for pedestrians? What about if you didn't know the route?</p>
<p>Do you drive the same vehicle all the time? How experienced of a driver are you?</p>
<p>My guess is if</p>
<ul>
<li>you had to report to someone when you passed one of these landmarks</li>
<li>you were driving someplace new</li>
<li>were just learning how to drive</li>
</ul>
<p>then you wouldn't be able to focus on the task of literary introspection as well. As I've mentioned in other comments, the point of practice is to be able to do things automatically, to free up resources so our brains can attend to other matters instead of the thing we've already done 100x before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trip I had take was to Mississippi from Tennessee one summer, and up until that point I had never been before. I plotted the route pretty thoroughly as my GPS cord had broken. I was visiting a friend who rented a lake house on a lake. So it wasn't subconscious memory leading the way.</p>
<p>I have a few different cars, but the one I used for that trip was my main go to. However, I used this trip as an example. For my work I drive cross country a lot and use rentals as well. I frequently have this happen even in those situations. </p>
<p>I am only 27, but the incident I listed was fresh out of high school. I was almost 19 then and had had my license since I was 16. However, I did grow up driving cars around a farm. A five speed jeep samurai actually. I would roll it for fun. </p>
<p>I dont think my brain operates the way everyone else does however. I've always been able to speed read and type. I dont pronounce the words on screens or pages as I read. I frequently text and drive as well. Sounds dangerous, but I'll read a message and respond without ever taking my eyes off the road. That could be listed as just being familiar with my device, but I also steer with my knee while watching the road. I've also eaten a burger, sent a text, drove with my knee, and held onto a drink cup while shifting manual gears. </p>
<p>I think my olfactory senses dont need mental faculty to be able to process the information. Sort of like when I read. I see things and just understand, which allows me to divert my mental processes elsewhere. I actually watch tv and listen to music quite frequently when I'm working on my papers.</p></div>		</li>
