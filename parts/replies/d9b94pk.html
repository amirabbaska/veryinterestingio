			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation, but it makes me realize the 'shortcut' analogy is actually really good here. Perhaps a better word would just be 'route'. </p>
<p>In software, we have a similar concept (Graph Databases) wherin connections are achieved by finding a series of nodes with the corresponding information (i.e. I know person a, person a knows person b, and person b knows person c).</p>
<p>In this example, I can be connected with person c because persons (node) a and b are active. If a person d were to be introduced that knew both myself and person c, that would be a 'shortcut' to person c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have recently begun using a trick I learned to help with those tip of the tongue moments.</p>
<p>When a person cannot quite remember something I ask them a question they definitively know the answer to, such as their birthday or favorite color. Almost every time after doing this the person is able to recall the answer to the initial question. It was explained to me that doing this reduces the pressure/stress on forcing the recall and allows the brain to search for the pathway without the stress element which can hinder recall. </p>
<p>Is there any scientific truth to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard analogies from introduction courses stating this, yes: That when looking for information in the wrong places (i.e. tip of the tongue), looking &quot;harder&quot; won't help since you're already looking in the wrong place.</p>
<p>However, I'm not sure asking questions about well-known, specific knowledge will facilitate retrieval or help guide the retrieval path in the right &quot;direction&quot;. Memory is really complex, and even the simplest objects and concepts can be percieved and remembered in different ways.</p>
<p>For example, if you encode (memorize) the object piano as either i) a musical instrument; or ii) as a heavy object, hints will have different effect if you're experiencing a tip-of-the-tongue-moment with that specific word. If you encoded 'piano' as an instrument, the hint &quot;heavy object&quot; will have no effect. The same is observed if participants have encoded the word piano as a heavy object: &quot;an instrument&quot; will have no effect on retrieval. However, if encoded as instrument, and given a hint as instrument, retrieval is facilitated, as the associative connections between the object and the attribute described in the hint will help the word/concept fire in the memory network. </p>
<p>This effect is called encoding-specificity (google for better explanation), and shows that we cannot generalize all the memory effects discussed here :) ...just to complicate things further, hehe</p></div>		</li>
