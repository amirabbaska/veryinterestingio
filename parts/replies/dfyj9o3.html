			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's ended up having the reverse effect of what they wanted? They've ended up making people vote for policies/people who are trying to close down borders and increase security, making it harder for terrorists to.. terrorize? I'm guessing that wasn't the intended plan...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually that's exactly what they want. Even if you dismiss the reasoning behind the politicians' choice to close borders and such (which can range from naive to brutal prejudice depending on where you look), it gives them ammunition. It's almost always been useful to terrorist groups as propaganda when things like increased security go into effect; sometimes made worse by the individuals responsible for the changes having less-than-reasonable biases.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at these people. While you are in danger or in need of help they shut their door. They cover their ears when they hear you cry. They close their eyes when they see you suffer.&quot; For people in a chaotic state or under threat of death, the propaganda they can get blasted with is intense. You should never underestimate propaganda, especially from people who are willing to kill in cold blood for their ideas.</p></div>		</li>

<p>while it may not have been their initial goals, it weakens the international bonds that keep organisations like them in check. </p></div>		</li>
