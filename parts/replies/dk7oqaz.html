<p>the male never knows if the child is his.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read a pretty good book that discussed that topic at length.  Pretty fascinating stuff.  It never really dawned on me that modern man is probably the only organism in history to ever have the ability to know that a child is his with 99.99% accuracy due to DNA testing. Seahorses would be a good counterpoint, so maybe there are others?  But the woman will always know 100% that it's her DNA she's caring for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is exactly the point. Some felid females can even abort at will if the find a better mate during early pregnancy. In others cases males hang around a while after mating just to make sure. </p>
<p>However, for the four species which go through menstrual cycle, the males never know. The only visible sign of a female being fertile (28th day) comes at a time diagonally opposite to the ovulation (14th day). Some suggest that this drove humans to form society; the males willing to hunt on behalf of the females to keep them close for the whole month ensuring paternity, whereas females specialized in multitasking and developing finer skills to care for the baby.</p></div>		</li>
