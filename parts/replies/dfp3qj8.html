			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I wonder if the random variation component of evolution by natural selection is driven by viruses, which could help to explain the sudden punctuated equilibrium we see periodically as some epochs develop slowly while others experience an almost explosive rate of change and speciation.</p>
<p>Maybe the slow periods have something to do with factors that decrease viral communicability and the fast periods have something to do with factors that increase viral communicability.</p></div>		</li>
