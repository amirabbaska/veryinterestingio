			<div class="markdown"><p>You've already provided half your answer. There are a lot of people who think giving the condemned a sense of euphoria on the way out is a bad thing. There are some who would even go so far as to saw quick and painless is a negative.</p>
<p>Coming from the other side of the issue, a nitrogen hood has unfortunate similarities to gas Chambers which had an absolutely horrendous public perception that was quite possibly deserved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Toothbrush mustaches have a bad public perception, but it's not like facial hair does anything.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's about the nitrogen hood rather than the gas chambers. As in; depending on your views the hood <em>deserves</em> to be compared to the gas chambers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some states still use gas chambers though, so I don't think there is <em>that</em> much resistance to that method.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On a serious note, it's very messy, and since there's a hole in the head now, it will continue leaking till you drain it because corpses arent buried while standing...</p>
<p>That being said, gassing should be the only way, no mess, and with the right gas, e.g. replacing air with nitrogen, no pain either.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to look at Sweden.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But I suspect the answer is a combination of lobbies for the drug and that the method of death is just too tricky and not politically motivating (=votes) enough to get any real change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a super eli5 democratic theory legislation MUST be within the acceptable distance for all sides of an issue adding up to a majority. What you have is a compromise that is better for both sides than letting their opponent win, but a compromise is impossible if its outside of an acceptable distance from their view. To simplify it lets say you just have For and Against. People against the death penalty do not want to pass any legislation approving the death penalty. That is outside of their acceptable range. People against the death penalty don't care about making the experience pleasant. That is outside of their range. What you end up with is a venn diagram but the circles do not overlap and this compromise is in the middle unsupported by all sides. This is what makes controversial issues difficult, very often the middle ground is unacceptable by either side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was replying to you wondering about why nitrogen isn't the choice. My answer is that nitrogen, if indeed quick and painless, or any other quick and painless method of execution, cannot be chosen by a society that exectues people, because any such society is not going to be very humane in the first place. While I recognize that reality is often much more complex than that, and I probably should have added a /s somewhere, my main point still stands, and while being an opinion, isn't suddenly less valid just because we wouln't be debating the meaning of some word.</p>
<p>While one might say that the guillotine was a humane method of execution during the French Revolution, I wouldn't personally call it a very humane method, however that is of course just my opinion as well. It certainly seemed like a very humane method compared to other methods of execution of the time, which were probably meant to cause as much pain as possible. Any method we use today is still just a guillotine of our time and will probably be seen as an atrocity in the future.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm up for execution being elective, but getting rid of death as an option for those convicts on life sentences is inhumane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you lock up somebody who killed 20 people. They did it because of voices in their head, because of some extremist ideology, or just because they felt like murdering. They spend 20 years in prison. During that time, they stop hearing the voices, stop believing in their extremist ideology, or in general just become somebody else entirely. After you execute the prisoner, you are essentially increasing the death toll of the sickness they had from 20 to 21. So now you helped the sick person commit another murder with a 20 year delay. It's even possible you have the wrong person, but after 20 years you might as well have.</p>
<p>Death sentences are going to include an almost indefinite locking away period because you really don't want to kill innocent people so the process is complicated. What you end up with is arguably even less humane as it includes both a life sentence and execution at the end.</p>
<p>Of course euthanasia should be provided for all who consider themselves to require it, but prisons shouldn't have conditions that make people want to die. That's just a good way to ensure that the person you release out of there is going to be bringing a lot of issues with them instead of being a productive member of society.</p>
<p>Of course you will feel differently if you think people don't change over time.</p></div>		</li>
