			<div class="markdown"><p>The foot traffic thing is what makes me wonder.  At my college it seems everyone uses cards.  There's a gas station across the street from my building and people frequent it for sodas, chips, etc.  So I'm sure the owner gets lots of business from students but unsure as to how much of it ends up as profit from the small card purchases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas stations hedge on those things by charging much more per unit on those bags.  </p>
<p>I wager they charge roughly the same for the bags and small bottles of soda as a grocer will charge for the full size version.  </p>
<p>We don't notice it because we're used to paying so much for the smaller versions, but it's not unusual for a 500ml size soda to cost 1.99 or 2.50, while the full 2L costs $.99 at Kroger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true.  I can come close to buying a 12 pack of soda from a grocery store for the cost of two 20oz bottles at a minimart.  But I guess they call them &quot;convenience stores&quot; for a reason.  The savings on a twelve pack isn't always worth carrying a few cans of soda in my backpack all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. </p>
<p>Every transaction has multiple components of cost, and one of them is a per-transaction fee. </p>
<p>If you have 25 cent per transaction fee, that's a big bite out of a $5 transaction, and almost nothing out of a $100 transaction.</p>
<p>If you had $20,000 in $5 transactions, that would be 4,000 transactions vs $20,000 in $100 transactions it would be 200 transactions. Without taking any of the other fees into account, you'd pay $50 in per-transaction fees on the 200 transactions (200 <em> 0.25) or $1,000 in per-transaction fees on the 4,000 transactions. (4,000 </em> 0.25.)</p>
<p>This is also why it's crucial to be set up correctly for your average ticket size. You can negotiate with processors so that if you have a lot of small transactions, you can get a low per-transaction fee in exchange for a higher percentage. For example, PayPal's micropayments pricing is 5% of the transaction total and a per-transaction fee of 5 cents. That's actually much better for small transactions than a 2% fee and 30 cents per transaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, as I understand it most plastic-based transactions also include a $.25 (or so) flat &quot;interchange&quot; fee.  I forgot to mention that part.  Doesn't matter for big box stores generally, but for convenience store sand grocers it can take a bite out of profits (or eliminate them entirely). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These flat swipe fees can really bit into your profits for low cost items.  I have had people try to pay for $0.16 of copies with a card.  At that point I will just give them the copied.  Cost me more to run the card than the purchase is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The per-transaction fees actually vary quite a lot. It's not a standard 25 cents, and it's actually typically imposed in multiple places. (At the interchange level and the markup level.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, got it.  That explains why the small shops often require a minimum purchase.</p></div>		</li>
