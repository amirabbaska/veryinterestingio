			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the detailed comments completely ignore reflected light. If moonlight was strictly black body radiation, we would not be able to see it, just as you can't see a pot of boiling-hot water in the dark (at 100Â°C, the moon's surface temperature).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.lumec.com/newsletter/architect_06-10/the_sun_the_moon.html" target="_blank">color temperature of moonlight</a> is actually 4000K (sunlight is 5800K), so we could theoretically start a fire with a large enough lens and a very small piece of tinder. Whether or not this could actually be done practically is debatable. </p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight" target="_blank">moonlight</a> is apparently 1,000,000 times fainter than sunlight (other sources say brighter). Assuming we can start a fire with sunlight using a 1 square inch lens, we would need an 83' x 83' (25m x 25m) lens to do the job. Using a Fresnel lens and accounting for losses, it would probably need to be larger than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a large lens the image of the moon formed by the lens is proportional to the size of the lens. So it wouldn't make the light any more concentrated.</p>
<p>What you would need is to focus light on a piece of material that is effectively white at infrared wavelengths but is dark at visible light wavelengths, so that it absorbs moonlight without radiating more heat than it absorbs, even when it becomes hotter than the moon (edit: if suspended in the vacuum so it's not losing heat other than by radiating it).</p>
<p>Other possibility is that you can use solar panels and charge a battery over a very long time and use a car cigarette lighter. But that's cheating.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you assuming that the geometry of the lens is fixed as the size changes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the moon image gets smaller, the light gets more concentrated, otherwise where does the excess light go?</p>
<p>You have to balance two different things. The amount of power you collect will be determined by the size of the lens. Since the moon is 400-500,000 times dimmer than the sun, that's the size you have to work with. The next thing is power density. This will effect how hot you can make the tinder. Pretty much any lens will work, but the shorter the focal length (higher the magnification), the closer the tinder can be to the lens. Really large lenses, though, are going to have long focal lengths to keep weight down and reduce aberrations that limit your resolving ability and thus the power density. </p>
<p>Technically, a 60' x 60' Fresnel lens could do the job (this assumes you can start a fire from the sun with a 1 sq&quot; lens). </p>
<p>Edit: your idea for selective absorption/radiation would allow less light power to be used over a longer period of time, allowing the accumulation of energy, which causes an increase of temperature. Combat uniforms often are coated with IR-reducing chemicals for night-time combat, so that might work.</p>
<p>Edit2: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> says 1,000,000 times dimmer, so 83' x 83' is needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you can't focus all light from the moon onto one point with one lense. Else you could get infinite temperature by just making the area smaller and smaller. </p>
<p>At some point you get a tiny bright image of the moon and no matter which direction you move the lense the image will not get smaller. So there should be some maximum for the temperature you can achieve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are three important points which bring you to OPs conclusion...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Light emanating from the moon isn't a &quot;mirror reflection&quot; because the sun's light is (mostly) absorbed by the moon and re-emanated.  This is important because the re-emanation is a product of the Moon's surface temperature (in the IR frequency range).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light from any point on the moon is emanated in all directions (again, unlike a mirror).</p>
</li>
<li>Light hitting a lens can only focus light beams that travel exactly in parallel. IE. Light coming from the north pole of the moon, and light coming from the south pole of the moon, which both hit the same input side of the lens, will NOT focus on the same point (which is why lenses form pictures of their source light, not perfect points). </li>
</ol>
<p>I hope that makes it more clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading the two articles linked from there I'm almost entirely convinced that &quot;no&quot; is the right answer, but I'm still not quite sure I understand the reasons for that, and if the simplified explanation aren't actually wrong (a wrong explanation can produce a right answer).</p>
<p>So I'd like someone to answer these follow-up questions:</p>
<p>If the moon were a perfectly reflecting smooth sphere (specular reflection), would we then be able to do it, to achieve the Sun's temperature at the focus of a sufficiently large lens?</p>
<p>On one hand, I think that the reflected image of the Sun would be just as bright (per surface area) as the Sun itself, so the same argument &quot;yes you can actually ignite a paper by focusing the light of a distant star&quot; should work, the Sun just appears distant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the answer to the above would involve a very large lens/mirror array, to the point where applying it to the moon as seen from the Earth might necessarily involve something comparable to the size of the Moon itself at least.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm asking is: what exactly is to blame for the impossibility:</p>
<p>1) The Moon's actual size and therefore the proportion of sunlight it catches.</p>
<p>2) The Moon's perceived size from the Earth.</p>
<p>3) The fact that the Moon is a diffuse rather than specular reflector.</p>
<p>4) The Moon's low albedo.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, that's not the problem. After all, you can set a piece of paper on fire using just a small hand-held magnifying glass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) The Moon's perceived size from the Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, that's not the problem either. If the image is smaller, that just means that the area you can heat up is smaller too. (Ignoring diffraction)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3) The fact that the Moon is a diffuse rather than specular reflector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the big one. The diffuse reflection means that the Moon's reflected light is much less bright than the Sun. The total flux is the angular size of the object times the brightness. By magnifying the Moon we can try to compensate for the low brightness by increasing its angular size. But because the image of the Moon can't be bigger than the full sky, there's a cap to this magnification, and this is too low for us to ignite anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4) The Moon's low albedo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would be a problem if the Moon was a specular reflector. The absorbed sunlight is remitted as blackbody radiation in all directions, and when the Moon is in thermal equilibrium, as much power is emitted as is absorbed. So this absorption/remission does the same job as diffuse reflection does. So low albedo also reduces brightness, but only if you're not already a diffuse reflector.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>That's weird, when I reflect (heh) on it. The brightness of the moonlight would be the same, the temperature on the moon (after applying albedo correction) would be the same, the way it spreads the sunlight everywhere would be the same even (like, if you get far enough that it looks like a point source). And yet, that little change makes all the difference... are you really really sure?</p></div>		</li>
