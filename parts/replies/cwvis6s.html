			<div class="markdown"><p>Frequency responses are not as simple as I described - a series of beats produces a very pure tone, but most real sounds are actually formed from an overlay of a bunch of different signals (say, the sound produced by horse hair vibrating a metal string + the echoes in the wood chamber of a violin). If we were to draw the impulse as a shape, a pure tone might look like a sine wave. A real instrument might look more like a mountain range, with large, dominant peaks and smaller secondary peaks. These smaller peaks give the sound its unique &quot;timbre&quot;. So, if we vibrate our membrane to produce this more complex shape, we can reproduce this sort of timbre.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and this is why bit depth and to a lesser extent sample rate matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is not really explaining this well at all, tbh.</p>
<p>1) Your eardrum is a single vibrating membrane, as well.</p>
<p>2) Consider your eardrum as a device that measures air pressure, and just imagine a graph drawn out that shows the pressure over time.  You'll get something that looks like what we think of as a sound wave.  There's a law in mathematics that any timeseries like that can be broken down into an infinite combination of sine waves (sounds at a particular frequency), and you can combine any number of sine waves into a single time series.   Your ear does the former, and the speaker does the latter.  </p>
<p>As far as timbre, what you're actually generally hearing are harmonic overtones.  When you pluck a string, it doesn't just create a particular frequency.  You get a frequency, plus 2 times that frequency, plus 3 times that frequency, on to infinity, with each multiple contributing less and less to the overall sound.  Different musical instruments have different overtones -- some might have only evens or only odds, or they'll fall off at a different rate, etc.</p>
<p>Your ear tends to combine harmonic overtones into a single sound, and a sound with lots of them (like a violin) sounds very rich and full, while something without them sounds very simple and small.</p>
<p>There are also other subtleties like detuning, where you have multiple instruments playing at the same time with <em>slightly</em> off frequencies, so it sounds like a big group of things playing together.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the way it vibrates. A note is a nice smooth vibration (like what you'd see from the pistons of an engine). A tone is a square wave, so the speaker moves from one extreme to the other as quickly as possible, pausing for a moment between. A &quot;buzzing&quot; sound is a triangular wave. It steadily moves from back to front and then resets as quickly as possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How many ms or frequency cycles does it take to register as a tone rather than an impulse?</p>
<p>I.E. If I took a sine curve at an audible frequency, say 1000hz, how many times must I repeat it for it to sound like a tone? Is it by ms or cycles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I decided to run an experiment on myself. When I came back, I found that /u/captain_vhdvhd provided a real answer. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xzmMUv3.png" target="_blank">This</a> is the shortest tone I was able to perceive. One wavelength shorter and it became just a beat/click/chirp. I tested myself with a frequency of 500Hz and I needed at least 14ms (7 cycles) to register the frequency. This seems to line up with the linked pdf.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried doing the experiment myself and got similar results. I'd say the result IS surprising, especially with the long durations on the low tones.</p>
<p>The brain is using more than five times the time to figure out the low frequency compared to a high frequency. With measurements differing around 50ms, I'm surprised that we don't experience somekind of &quot;audio lag&quot;. I perceive both tones instantly, yet one of them is undefined for a relatively much longer period than the other. The brain must be syncing inputs with quite a delay.</p>
<p>Maybe that's the reason to why we can't hear lower than 20hz? If we can't manage to analyse it before we're onto the next &quot;frame&quot;, we just hear the impulses?</p></div>		</li>
