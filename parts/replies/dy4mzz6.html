			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically your immune system decides that it’s going to start attacking whatever your new allergy is. You’re exposed, the body responds and creates B cells that produce antibodies to the substance. Then next time you encounter it, you get an allergic reaction. I’m not really sure why you develop new allergies to things you’ve been exposed to before though honestly. The immune system is complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your thymus regulates T cell's (which are required for B-cell activation) and basically sorts out what immature T cell is going to be, either a CD4 (helper) or CD8 (killer), any immature T cells that react to your own antigens are either re-purposed or killed (there's certain conditions , but I can't remember right now). As you grow older your thymus tissue shrinks and is replaced by lipid tissue - a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43308729" target="_blank">recent article</a> did talk about how exercise might actually help with reversing/halting/slowing down the process.</p>
<p>There is also the genetic factor and as we live we occur mutations, so there is also that to conisder.</p>
<p>ELI5: Immature T cells (kids) to the thymus (school) to mature. Those who fail are either expelled or re-trained. As time go by, the school shrinks and can be less thorough with the pupils - resulting in badly educated/trained kids and a decreased number of matured kids to roam about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my early 50s i started to get hives or urticaria its called. About once a month. Basically a raised rash all over that itches like crazy. Takes about half hour to start and a couple hours to finish. Then every couple years it turned into a major anaphylaxis event. I have epipens for it. You get the rash, then once my face and another time my hands swelled up. Then you collapse and black out. Coming to, you cant get up as your blood pressure is low and you can feel your heart at about 25 beats a min. First time this happened i had to lay down for about an hour before i could get up. Silly but i thought wow thats a one off. Second time was a bit worse and prompted me to see a doc. They suspected heart prob, but all fine apart from high bp. Took tablets for that and as an aside they sent me to an allergy specialist. Long story short they think i have something called Wdeia which is wheat dependent excercise induced anaphylaxis. Ive eaten wheat all my life and still can. However, if i combine it with certain other things, like having a virus or illness, asprin, alcohol or excercise it can kick off an attack. So if i have had wheat and im gonna do something physical, no alcohol. If im feeling like ive got a cold, no alcohol or wheat. Apparently alcohol helps the allegen in wheat pass through the gut wall which it usually cant.</p>
<p>Luckily over the last two years since my last major attack im not even getting a rash. Perhaps its the bp meds somehow or my watching for the combination that might set it off. It can apparently get worse after each attack.</p>
<p>So why get this in your 50s? Apparently you csn have an illness or virus that can modify your immune response so that things that were fine in the past make your body want to fucking kill you.</p>
<p>Allergy to me isnt a good word.  People think its for wooses that cant go near grass or get itchy if they eat the wrong thing. Its so much worse. You can be fine one minute and a few moments on have near zero bp and heatbeat and in total collapse and if unlucky your body is also strangling you. Allergy is too weak a word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a related note, as I understand it, it's not the flu virus that kills you, it's your body's self-destructive defense mechanisms, like fever, inflammation, and vomiting. So what would happen if we didn't have such a severe reaction to the flu? Would the virus itself eventually kill us? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flu can absolutely kill you. It kills cells in your respiratory system, so eventually your lungs will stop functioning properly and you'll suffocate. Or, apparently, it might get into your brain and start killing brain cells.</p>
<p>You're right, though, it's usually an overactive immune response <em>or</em> a secondary infection that happens when your immune system is too overburdened fighting the flu.</p></div>		</li>
