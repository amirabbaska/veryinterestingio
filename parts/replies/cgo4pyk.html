<p>As to the nails, it really depends on how the hand/finger is preserved. If just the bones are found I am not sure there would be any reason to assume the existence of nails.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, plenty of them did! Here're a couple of examples, <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/The_Childrens_Museum_of_Indianapolis_-_Psittacosaurus_skeleton_cast.jpg" target="_blank">psittacosaurus</a> and <a href="http://www.dinosaur.pref.fukui.jp/dino/dic/Oviraptor.jpg" target="_blank">oviraptor</a>. For something like <a href="http://www.myjurassicpark.com/edmontosaurus.skull.jpg" target="_blank">edmontosaurus</a>, where it has a bill in the front and then only chewing teeth in the back, (almost) everyone reconstructs them the same way, <a href="http://www.walkingwithdinosaurs.com/suploads/dinosaur-details/dinosaur-edmontosaurus/large-dino.png" target="_blank">with a bill and then cheeks for chewing.</a></p>
<p>For something like diplodocus, though, with <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ltN-AGWmRaQ/TBAzHmCYB9I/AAAAAAAAADQ/olFSGKuJ-Lk/s1600/Dscf0532.jpg" target="_blank">teeth at the front and no molars at all,</a> it's a bit less clear. It doesn't have a beak. Maybe it had lips, maybe it didn't. Maybe it had skin covering the sides of its mouth, maybe not, since it apparently didn't chew. There were even some in the late 20th century who <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/files/2012/11/Knoll-et-al-2006-Elephas-Diplodocus-compared-350-px-tiny.jpg" target="_blank">hypothesized that it had a trunk,</a> since the openings in its skull for its nostrils were on its forehead like an elephant, but this has been pretty <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/03/20/junk-in-the-trunk/" target="_blank">heavily dismissed</a> since.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That just made me think... How would we know elephants had a trunk without seeing it on them alive?</p>
<p>They don't have bones in their trunks do they?</p>
<p>EDIT: Acutally I think I found a link to another thread about that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for posting that sauropod article.  I just wanted to say that I'm always amazed by the depth of which things are studied.  Even things that some would consider trivial, such as whether or not sauropods had trunks, are investigated with genuine depth and vigor.  Makes me proud to be a human.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moisture retention, for one.</p>
<p>Lips and cheeks make eating more efficient, but they are also pretty much vital if you have salivary glands. Think about how dry your mouth was one time when you slept with your mouth open because your nose was stuffed up, only now your mouth is that dry (or worse) all the time! If the food you eat is primarily wet, then lips aren't as beneficial, but if you need moisture to process your bites, lips are going to be a must.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lips also open up the abilty of sucking milk from a nipple/teat. That's why almost all mammals have them (or the other way around: having lips made mammals possible).
Mammals without soft lips (for example dolphins) have special techniques to deliver the milk (dolphins spray it directly into the baby's mouth at relatively high pressure).</p></div>		</li>
