			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's not an actual forced agreement, but I wouldn't call it &quot;based on some loose terms&quot; either. Trump backing out may not look like much to the US itself, but keep in mind that the entire world will be affected by US factories' pollution. Second-world countries like India will see this as an argument; &quot;Why should <strong>we</strong> be polluting less if the second largest polluter in the world - the US - does not?&quot;
Not to mention that - even though the United States are massive - an increase in pollution <strong>will</strong> affect you too, on a large scale.
Hurricanes, floods, more extreme weather, eventually maybe even droughts in the inland areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is still the massive damage done to the US's image. Why would anybody ever make another treaty with the US when a few years from now some crazy populist can get elected and kill the treaty out of spite for his predecessor?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a voluntary agreement. There are no penalties or sanctions levied against those who violate it or decide to back out but the whole initiative could fall apart if major countries do.</p></div>		</li>
