			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a great description of these thoughts: it isn't your brain saying &quot;you should do this&quot;, it is your brain saying &quot;Can you imagine if you did this? Wouldn't it be terrible? Don't do that thing! I will keep reminding you!&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really comforting to think of these thoughts that way. Thanks for that. I never really understood why I had them but it makes sense now why they're related to anxiety. The more anxiety and/or depression you have, the more likely your brain will think about these things I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a similar vein, it does no good to think &quot;don't get in a wreck, don't get in a wreck&quot; because the brain isn't thinking of NOT WRECKS. It's visualizing wrecks. You're actually making the problem worse and the wreck more likely.</p>
<p>Also, kids tend to dream about animals and fire. As we get older, elements of our lives and workplaces and experience gets thrown in... But regardless of topic, dreams are the brain's way of practicing for stressful situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally normal!  Everything from murdering your parents to raping cute girls to robbing your friends because they left money on the side, to jumping off the 3rd floor balcony in a shopping mall, because you can ...... It's all fucking horrible to think, and makes you cringe afterwards .... but don't worry about it .... as long as you do actually cringe afterwards ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As aragorn18 pointed out, there thoughts are universal, the only difference is how often they appear. I think it is also connected to your mental stage. Sometimes I feel depressed and these kind of thoughts pop in my head more often. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to add, if you feel compelled in some way to follow them, if they're very common, if they take the form of voices of images, etc... seek help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard a theory(well, conjecture) that's is a self-test for your brain to make sure you're still thinking properly. Like a &quot;Think of something horrible. Did it shock you and make you think it's horrible? Good, everything is working fine&quot; sort of thing. </p></div>		</li>
