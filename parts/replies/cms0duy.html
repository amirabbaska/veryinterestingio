			<div class="markdown"><p>The first time I took QM, I didn't quite understand Dirac notation (or QM as a subject, which my teacher told me was a good thing).  Then, I took a second QM course in grad school after taking a math methods course the semester before, and I started toting my Linear Algebra book with me when doing problem sets.  I ended up taking two more quantum courses, including density matrices and a lot of entanglement.  Linear algebra was definitely the key to having any idea what was going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had taken linear algebra, but I didn't connect them.  My math methods course did, because it was to show us how math concepts were useful for physics, rather than to just show us math like my linalg class had been.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing happened to me, I partially blame for the wide spread use of Griffith's Quantum Mechanics book as the standard textbook. Everyone seems to praise it but the fact that it doesn't go into the formality of Dirac notation really irks me. Like you, the first time I took QM I was extremely confused about what the wave function was and how it was different from Dirac notation, and why do we use Dirac notation sometimes and wave functions other times. Extremely frustrating to a beginner. </p>
<p>That being said, I think Griffith's EM and PP books are masterpieces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing was stopping you from seeking additional sources. Griffiths is excellent as a first treatment, to get you familiar with the methodology without a ton of the underlying mathematical framework. My undergrad used that for one semester then moved on to a more rigorous text for the second semester. </p>
<p>There's a ton of good quantum books out there and blaming a textbook for not being prepared for quantum at a graduate level is a little unfair. Grad school is where you have to shore up the places where you may have had a weak background. You may need to do more than a class requires.</p>
<p>Sakurai and Balentine come to mind as decent follow up books to griffiths.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum Mechanics is applied <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis" target="_blank">Functional Analysis</a>. This is a special kind of Linear Algebra that can study vector spaces of functions on different spaces. Many applications of Functional Analysis rely on trying to do the generalization of diagonalizing a matrix, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theory" target="_blank">Spectral Theory</a>, on these infinite dimensional spaces. Spectral Theory is easy in the finite dimensional case, but in Quantum Mechanics it's not always so straight-forward and takes the form of finding the eigenstates for an operator. But many other tools that are not just Linear Algebra are needed. Fourier Analysis, for instance, plays a huge role in Functional Analysis but not so much in vanilla Linear Algebra.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Quantum Mechanics is applied Functional Analysis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is such a mathematician's answer.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad answer, just a different take than what a physicist would say, which would be to use the model insofar as to make predictions testable by experiment. It's easy to fall into the trap of emphasizing the mathematics over the physics, which only trivializes the point of devising a mathematical model in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not understanding the context in which you work is also a trap to watch out for. It's probably more dangerous to back away from additional knowledge because of you're fear of becoming a String Theorist.</p>
<p>Knowing Functional Analysis can only help you understand Quantum Mechanics better. </p></div>		</li>
