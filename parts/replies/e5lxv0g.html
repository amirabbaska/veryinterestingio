			<div class="markdown"><p>But why? Correct me if I'm wrong, as I assume you would know more than me, but it's my understanding that the differences in spelling came about relatively recently (after the Revolutionary War) when standardized spellings were adopted with the advent of widely available dictionaries. Basically, my understanding is that the differences came about due to different conceptions of what standard spelling should be versus a concerted effort to &quot;simplify&quot; the language. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it?  It was my understanding that there are many spoken &quot;Chinese&quot; languages such as Cantonese and Mandarin.  Can someone correct me if I'm wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is true. I'm not experienced enough in the whole situation to really comment on how this interplays with writing (but I believe most writing happens in Mandarin regardless of the spoken language). But as for the spoken language, &quot;Chinese&quot; is essentially a language family pretending to be all a single language. Like as if speakers of Spanish, Italian and French all decided to just claim they're speaking &quot;Romance&quot; and denied that variation existed.</p></div>		</li>
