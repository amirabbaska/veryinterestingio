			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I think when people talk about the difference between an animal and a human interacting with speech, they're talking about having some understanding of the concepts behind the words versus a rote memorization or 1:1 association.</p>
<p>The parrot may have made some association between &quot;I'm leaving&quot; and making the &quot;Goodbye&quot; sound however if you just put your shoes on and walk out the door it won't say &quot;Goodbye&quot; unless you specifically teach it that. It doesn't understand what the meaning or purpose of &quot;goodbye&quot; is. It doesn't understand why it's saying it.</p>
<p>Which would put it on about the level of the most basic chat bot. It doesn't 'understand' what you're saying in any meaningful way. Its vocabulary is a one-to-one mapping from input to output. </p>
<p>A dog, on the other hand, will make some associations between the words and the world. Saying &quot;let's go for a walk&quot; or &quot;get your leash&quot; will get them excited and running for the door because they understand that those words tie to a concept. Similarly, if you just pick up their leash and go to the door they'll probably react to the same. They have some understanding of how the world works, and their understanding of language ties back into that.</p>
<p>You can teach your dog phrases and combine them and they can understand. If your dog knows how to &quot;go find&quot;, teaching them the name of their &quot;ball&quot;, &quot;rope&quot;, &quot;plushie&quot;, etc will allow you to tell them to &quot;Go find your ball&quot; or &quot;go find your rope&quot;. You can teach them to &quot;go find&quot; and the names separately, and they're able to make the connection. If you have a really smart dog, you can say &quot;go find <namefornewthing>&quot; and even though they don't recognize part of the statement, they understand the concept of fetching something and can deduce that they're to bring you the unrecognized item.</p>
<p>You can teach a dog what a ball is, and even if you replace their ball with a different ball, they'll still understand that you want them to fetch that thing you play with them with that you throw.</p>
<p>When you tell them &quot;go find <person>&quot;, you don't need to separately teach them that people can be found. They understand that to &quot;go find&quot; is to seek out a thing.</p>
<p>To me, that shows a level of understanding of the concepts behind your words deeper than simply reacting in a 1:1 manner.</p>
<p>So for your friend's parrot... It's on the &quot;just recognizing sounds&quot; end of the spectrum. It has no recognition of how goodbye is supposed to be used. It's nothing but a sound which prompts a direct reaction. It has no understanding of the context of your words.</p>
<p>To a dog, the words work more similarly to humans and can actually be tied to a concept which can expand and evolve which they can use to make intelligent decisions and deductions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my friends parrot does understand. Maybe not the way a dog or human does but it does. I'll give another example. He makes a certain whistle when my brothers plays with him. Only my brother. My brother lived in Florida for a few years and hasn't seen the bird again until recently. Sure enough he recognized my brother and made the whistle. Now again the bird may not fully understand the words but there is definitely some thought process going on in his brain that says oh look it's my friend, let me say hi to him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parrots are interesting. The only animal in all of documented existence to ask an exisitential question was a parrot. This parrot was taught shapes and and colors and could recognize them interchangably. If you tried to trick him he'd get angry at you. Also if he was bored of you asking the same questions he'd start answering them wrong <strong>intentionally</strong>. One day he finally asked the question &quot;what color am i?&quot; to which the answer was gray.</p>
<p>No animal who has ever been taught to communicate has ever asked a profound question such as &quot;what color am i&quot; prior to this one parrot. It's unfortunate he died very unexpectedly with no discernable cause as he was the greatest link we ever had for communicating with animals. No parrot has ever came close to him, yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love my friends bird. No matter what people say I know he understands on some level the words he's saying. He remeber faces of people even if he hasn't seen them in years. He won't say goodbye when you show up but hello. He does mimic certain words, like I'll say I... Love... and he'll say you but other words like goodbye are exclusively used when you leave. If a bird uses a word correctly, in the correct context, I don't think it's just mimicking but understanding. At least on a very simplistic level. Humans essentially mimic the same way but because we are much higher up on the brain scale we have more cognition.</p></div>		</li>
