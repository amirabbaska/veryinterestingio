			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, it wasn't that huge a place, just a local processing plant for the fishermen of the area, so maybe at most 20-30 people processing. We were only a dozen but it wasn't peak season.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in a large fishing city, and have worked in fish houses via electricians. Yes there is a big room full of people cutting fish. It is skillful (and horribly smelly) work. Around here it is mostly done by Guatemalan immigrants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can speak to this one though! I spent a summer working in a fish factory while I was in college. </p>
<p>We had main teams, each of 60 people or so. </p>
<p>First we had a team that would intake the fish from the boats and have a line that would cut off the head and suck out the guts. </p>
<p>Second was my team, we split the body in half and fillet the fish. We removed excess fat on the bottom, fins on top and even used tweezers to remove all the little bones. </p>
<p>Third was a team who took the fresh fillets and packaged them up and flash freeze for shipping. </p>
<p>This was all on one giant snaking set of conveyor belts. It was cold and we worked 16 hours a day. But it was fun. I'm never going back.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I find it hard to imagine a filleting machine that could do it better with less waste.</p>

<p>Sometimes throughput and efficiency are more important than minimizing absolute waste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd assume it would also depend on the end product for the fish.</p>
<p>If it's salmon, cod, or other 'fillets' that are destined for end consumers or supermarkets, doing it by hand provides professional appearing cuts with minimal waste.</p>
<p>If it's a fish like albacore or yellowfin that's destined to be canned on a much larger scale than 'fresh' fish, machine processing would definitely be more efficient in relation to the throughput.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, and especially with farmed fish, or taking only those which will fit the dimensions of your machine. </p>
<p>This was with lots more variety of fish, so humans were the way to go, at least for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An automated machine could go faster, but yes, there would be more meat left on the bone.</p>
<p>However, it would also likely have a secondary setup to recapture that meat, it would just not be big fillets.</p></div>		</li>
