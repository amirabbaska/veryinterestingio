			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatorade" target="_blank">Gatorade was formulated in 1965 by a team of scientists at the University of Florida College of Medicine, including Robert Cade, Dana Shires, Harry James Free and Alejandro de Quesada. Following a request from Florida Gators football head coach Ray Graves, Gatorade was created to help athletes by acting as a replacement for body fluids lost during physical exertion.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's so much that it would be harder to absorb the pure water, but that if you are simply adding water to your system you are diluting the electrolytes you're already lacking, and using up the sparse glucose to process the water through your system. That's a combo that could end up causing heart failure (see refeeding syndrome for something similar.) So the sugar and salt added keep you from approaching that dangerous zone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is harder to absorb pure water </p>
<p><a href="https://www.unicef.org/sowc96/joral.htm" target="_blank">In the late 1970s, acute diarrhoea was killing around 5 million children each year. The obvious response to dehydration -- giving the child water to drink -- did not work because the liquid rushed through the digestive tract too quickly to be absorbed by the body tissues.</a></p>
<p>Also, drinking pure water will dilute your electrolytes, as you say, but low sodium will cause seizures, confusion, nausea and vomiting. It doesn't cause heart failure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats interesting that it does absorb better, I'll have to look into the mechanism behind it. Thanks for the link!</p>
<p>Electrolyte imbalance really does cause heart failure, however. Bradycardia, caused from a lack of the electrolytes needed to send the signal to beat to the heart, is an extremely common cause of death in malnourished individuals.</p></div>		</li>
