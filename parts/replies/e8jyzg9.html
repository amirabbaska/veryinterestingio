			<div class="markdown"><p>Geology has a lot of good words. Carbonate classification schemes allow you to create some wonderful terms such as biooopelintrasparite (which would be a carbonate rock with skeletal grains, a kind of carbonate grain called an ooid, grains of carbonate mud, and fragments of local rock that have been washed in, all bound together with crystalline calcitic cement).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ex: </p>
<p>friend - &quot;Hey man how was that party&quot;</p>
<p>Me - &quot; Oh you know it was alright, but they had this weird music, it was totally volcaniclastic. Killed the mood completely.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bermuda was basically a platform sitting 2km above sea level? That is really neat!! I would love to see a rendering of what they think it looked like. Any idea if something like that exists?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't have been a platform, it would have been a large ocean-island volcano, similar to how Hawaii looks today (in a few million years' time, it is possible [although not inevitable] that Hawaii could look somewhat similar to Bermuda). I've found the paper that I read about this (<a href="http://www.mantleplumes.org/P%5E4/P%5E4Chapters/VogtBermudaP4AcceptedMS.pdf" target="_blank">Vogt &amp; Jung, 2007</a>) and it's worth mentioning that trying to reconstruct the height of long-eroded volcanoes is a very inexact science to say the least, and estimates range from between 1km, to over 3.5km above sea level. Whilst I don't know of any rendering of what it would have looked like, if you look at a <a href="http://cloudfront.bernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cross-section.jpg" target="_blank">modern cross-section through Bermuda</a>, you can see how the seamount (which is much, much larger than the surface expression of Bermuda) is essentially planed off by sea level, but if you extrapolate those submarine slopes above the surface, you can sort of imagine what it would have originally looked like. And as I mentioned earlier, it would have looked somewhat similar to Hawaii because both were formed by the same basic process.</p></div>		</li>
