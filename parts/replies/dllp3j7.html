			<div class="markdown"><p>So not necessarily &quot;stronger&quot; just less likely to be flawed. I ask this because of the people who believe in the whole &quot;keep your race clean&quot; or &quot;don't breed outside your race&quot; mentality. </p>
<p>From my understanding as far as genetics go it was always good to try and branch out further with your reproduction, as like incest is horrible for offspring, and the further away from your ancestors genes the better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that &quot;race&quot; isn't a categorization that is scientific (biological/genetic)... there aren't definitions of race that can be made based solely on science, nor are the genetic variances significant or consistent enough to merit any delineation remotely in line with commonly viewed racial groups.  Simply put, race is a social construct.</p>
<p>Edit: frequency of certain genetic traits do vary across <em>populations</em>, as they would in any group where have mating bias.  But not significant in itself nor a consistent distinction along lines of perceived racial groups. </p>
<p>edit2: in case anyone wants to read more on the point.  Top is most authoritative statement to support the view representing consensus of the scientific community, the second is a pretty detailed discussion of the support for the position but is a bit technical, and third is a very digestible article discussing the point.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that is true. There will be individuals of different ethnicities that you have more genetic defects in common with than certain members of your own ethnicity. There are no hard boundaries between &quot;races&quot;, since we are all taxonomically the same race and potentially subject to the same defects. It is more important to select partners for genetic variation than for their race but since it's kinda rude to ask for a gene mapping at your first date it is generally your best bet to not marry someone from the same mountain village or the next one over, but from a genetically diverse region, be it of your ethnicity or another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll admit, I've never understood the idea of &quot;race is a social construct&quot;. I look at an Aborigine, and a Tibetan, and an Irishman, and I can see distinct differences in their features, caused largely by how much heat and cold their place of ancestral origin receive. If we're saying that there's so much overlap you can't put it into tidy categories, that's true of many areas of biology. I also understand that culture and race are separate, and a lot of times when someone hates a certain &quot;race&quot;, it's much more likely they hate certain cultural behaviors they associate with that skin color or nationality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, it's not entirely a 'social construct'. </p>
<p>There is variation between the races. Distinct differences.  Some aesthetic, some physical, others quite physiological.</p>
<p>For instance, lots of Asians are lactose intolerant, compared with Europeans.  There are some drugs that don't work well for black patients, where not providing the 'black' treatment could be considered malpractice.  Gingers need more anesthesia than the average person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well by procreating with different populations you also have a chance of inducing new defects that weren't previously present in your ethnicity. If they are recessive in nature they will still be less likely to express if the child generations also procreate with wide gene pools and not just stick to themselves obviously. In the same vein you can keep even a smaller gene pool &quot;clean&quot; to some extent by selectively breeding, but there is always a chance some unexpected defect comes up so generally it is a better idea to have variety and let the redundancy of the sexual procreation process take care of it.</p>
<p>Evolutionary this wasn't always the case (This isn't important for us humans anymore since we all have more or less the same niche and get less dependent on the environment as technology advances).   When you have a specialized evolutionary niche, that gets selected by natural factors &quot;killing off&quot; those individual animals that are less adapted to their environment by random genetic recombination, then breeding with a sexually compatible population with a different ecologic niche would slow the process. In those individual populations a large size and therefore more chances for recombination are still beneficial though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flip side of this is some mutations/traits are beneficial. Even ones that look bad at first glance. Having <em>one</em> copy of the gene that causes Sickle Cell Anemia protects against malaria (though both copies cause the debilitating disease). Cystic fibrosis has a similar relationship with tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Considering the nasty side effects those genes have under the wrong circumstances, its not hard to imagine many different genes exist which give other, more clear cut benefits, and those genes would thrive and give many benefits once introduced into a population.</p>
<p>This includes potential benefits we don't study or understand-- since modern medicine doesn't necessarily focus on the reasons somebody <em>doesn't</em> get cancer, or uses drugs <em>without</em> getting addicted. In search of solutions for problems, we focus a lot on specific causes <em>of  specific problems</em> and overlook the other side of things. Again, partly because a healthy person is less &quot;interesting&quot; and less of a concern to a doctor, unless they're an Olympic athlete or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't keep a small pool &quot;clean&quot; with selective breeding because mutations occur naturally. It's not just a &quot;small chance&quot; of some unexpected defect, its literally the basis for how evolution works. If your population is small enough that it constitutes &quot;purity&quot; of some kind, you're much more likely to all be vulnerable to the same environmental shift as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. And it's the reason why relatives procreating is frowned upon. The English royal family was having trouble with Haemophilia back when they would marry their siblings and cousins, because they were more likely to carry the genes for the same disorders. I read somewhere that most people are carriers of a number of genetic disorders, but they may be unaware of what they carry until in manifests in an offspring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On this topic, say for example we have two isolated communes of 1000 people each.  One is significantly more genetically diverse than the other.  Then say that some kind of plague is introduced to both populations with the potential to wipe out that population.  Is the more genetically diverse population more likely to live through the plague? </p></div>		</li>
