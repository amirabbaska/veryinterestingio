			<div class="markdown"><p>That is why most of common cancers are referred to as carcinomas, because they arise from epithelial cells, which are cells that line tissues, like the skin or lining of the ducts within the bowel, pancreas, or breast.  All of these cells are constantly growing and sloughing off and thus have a greater number of chances to screw up copying the DNA.  The more rare cancers, for example sarcomas, are rare because they arise from cells that divide less often in their normal state.  This principle also explains why sarcomas are generally slower growing but less responsive to chemotherapy, which works on the principle of causing cellular damage during replication, thus preferentially causing damage to the most rapidly dividing cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, is the reason for the common adverse effects of chemo. Since chemo preferentially targets the rapidly dividing cells of a carcinoma it has a hard time differentiating whats normal and whats not. So the normal rapidly dividing cells of your body are also damaged. Mainly hair follicles (loss of hair), GI tract (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and bone marrow (immunosuppression, fatigue) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good write-up. Especially that last part, that faster-growing cancers may often respond better to treatment, is counter-intuitive to most before they hear the explanation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I never quite understood (or read up about, if I'm being honest) why chemo affects everyone the way it does. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VC4-HHbvF4" target="_blank">Sci Show</a> did an episode on this very topic. Like others have said, the heart only grows for a short time and then slows down dramatically. With little cell division, cancer is unlikely to start in the heart.  However, fetuses <em>can</em> develop heart cancer when the heart is first developing and other types of cancer can metastasize to the heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tissues that have high cell turnover are more likely to develop cancers. High cell turnover is caused either physiologically/hormonally like in the bowel, breast, cervix, testicle or by repeated &quot;injury&quot; and re-healing eg: most lung cancers, skin.</p>
<p>Every time a cell divides there is a small risk of an error that might lead to a cancer happening.</p>
<p>Lung tissue actually has a very small risk of cancer and it's only really a problem because of smoking, if there was some drug people took that repeatedly inflamed heart tissues we might see heart cancer commonly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heart researcher here - while this explanation is great I wanted to clarify one (important) point. When we talk about organ &quot;growth&quot;, organs can grow in different ways. Either the cells can divide and the cell number can increase, or the cells actually can grow larger. In the heart, after you're born, [the heart muscle cells stop dividing] (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873506114001056" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873506114001056</a>) (post-mitotic) and the cells themselves increase in size - this is how the heart grows. While all cells can become mutated through one's life, it's the act of dividing and increasing cell number that causes cancer, or very specifically, when a cell divides that has a mutation that keeps it from growing beyond a certain point. In fact, in critical organ systems, to minimize the risk of cancer, the cells don't divide as often/at all, like neurons in your brain and the muscle cells in your heart. So it's not even really that the heart &quot;stops growing&quot; at a young age, it's that the heart cells stop dividing (generally) after birth.</p>
<p>One minor, esoteric caveat which is also cool to scientists like me is that cells <em>need</em> to divide or be replaced over time because they can become damaged through daily life. Because of that, increasing evidence is showing that there still is some [small, small amounts] (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/4/1446.full" target="_blank">http://www.pnas.org/content/110/4/1446.full</a>) of heart cell division during childhood (like fractions of percents) but overall as you age, by the time you die, [only roughly 50% of your heart cells will be &quot;new cells&quot;] (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5923/98.long" target="_blank">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5923/98.long</a>), meaning you're born with roughly half the heart cells you will  die with (half your heart cells won't ever change!). Anyway, just a clarification - it's the cell division that's important, because growth does happen in the heart but cell division generally doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a brain guy but from what I know, most (if not all) brain cancers tend to be from supporting cell types in the brain that do divide, like [astrocytes] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte</a>). In a lot of organs (nearly all of them), there are generally a mixture of cells - even in the heart, it's not just heart muscle cells but also cells like fibroblasts and blood vessel cells. These other cells can and do divide and are therefore (generally) the sources of cancer. I use &quot;generally&quot; because I'm not sure how many documented (if any)  cases there are of non-dividing cells like cardiomyocytes or neurons becoming cancerous - it may have happened once or twice in history but in general it's the other cell types. In fact, in the heart, the most common &quot;primary&quot; (heart originating) cancer is angiosarcoma, which is actually growth from the blood vessels and not muscle cells. Again, like glioblastoma in the brain, it's the division of cancerous supporting cells that generally causes these sorts of cancers. Another final note is that also, sometimes cancer originates in other parts of the body and ends up metastasizing in other parts of the body, which can then form tumors. In the heart, this is actually [20 to 40 times more common] (<a href="http://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(15)30630-4/pdf" target="_blank">http://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(15)30630-4/pdf</a>) than primary cardiac sarcoma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is also why heart attacks are so damaging, when cardiac cells die off they don't just come back like skin cells, but are rather just replaced with nonfunctional fibrotic material.</p></div>		</li>
