<p>When you experience pain of sorts, your brain releases a natural cannabinoid called anandamide that binds to the receptor that triggers the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters, which allows dopamine (uninhibited) to then flow freely into the brain's synapse.</p>

<p>Triggers the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters which allow the uninhibited release of dopamine...? </p>
<p>The CB1 ligands are inhibitory (as in inhibiting adenylate cyclase) retrograde signaling messengers at glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) synapses. Activation does not necessarily trigger the release of either, though. </p>
<p>While this is an ELI5 thread, I feel like exclusively attributing the effects to dopamine is just plain wrong. </p>

<p>It doesn't mimic the actual neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin (the way drugs like meth and cocaine do)</p>

<p>Neither methamphetamine nor cocaine mimic any neurotransmitter.</p>

<p>... so it doesn't cause your brain to work in reverse, which is why using cannabis in moderation doesn't appear to do any seriously long-term damage to your brain.</p>

<p>How about, pramipexole, which is designed to mimic dopamine, without any known long-term brain damage nor abuse potential?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I worded this poorly. What I meant was that when THC binds to the receptor, it stops the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters that prevent the release of dopamine.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yeah it's obviously more complicated than this but am I wrong in saying that the effects of cannabis use can be mainly attributed to the release of dopamine? That's an honest question.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Maybe not cocaine but I was taught that methamphetamine mimics various monoamines like serotonin, dopamine, and epinephrine. Maybe I'm wrong here again tough.</p>

<p>I don't know what this is. I will shut up before I say more things that are wrong. Thank you for correcting the record.</p></div>		</li>

<p>GABA is universally an inhibitory neurotransmitter, not only when it comes to dopamine circuitry. Hypothetically, if after activation you see a net increase in the concentration of dopamine, you will probably see a net increase in multiple neurotransmitters. The ratios of these neurotransmitters alone facilitate hundreds, thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of processes.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Probably. The downstream effects are complicated. If we look at THC alone, it also inhibits N-type calcium channels, implicated in neurotransmitter release and pain most importantly. THC also disinhibits A-type potassium channels, which are fairly poorly understood overall. </p>
<p>We can factor in other oddities, such as CBD not being psychoactive despite agonizing the same receptors as THC. This is probably related to the fact that THC acts as a partial agonist instead of a full agonist. </p>
<p>After factoring in whatever oddities the two 'primary' cannabinoids portray, factor in everything for the 100+ other cannabinoids.</p>
<p>It gets fairly complicated, but it is fairly safe to claim that there are other mechanisms in play, and the experience is more of a synergy.</p>

<p>It doesn't &quot;mimic&quot; them, but if we take dopamine, then not only does it cause a release of dopamine, it also blocks the reuptake of dopamine, while also inhibiting the enzyme (MAO) responsible for breaking down dopamine.</p>
<p>For most monoamines it's the &quot;releasers&quot; that are the most liable for abuse. Reuptake inhibitors follow, depending on the monoamine.</p></div>		</li>
