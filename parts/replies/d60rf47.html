			<p>I feel like at least some of this is a reason why a global flood couldn't happen and water animals survive, don't you think? If Noahs Ark happened they couldn't take salt water fish on the boat and so with all the fresh water those salt water fish would die. </p>		</li>

			<p>That would require more water than there is currently on the earth though (The ice would amount to something like 68 meters (223 feet for you americans), so it's not very realistic scenario.<br><br>The stories about that flood, and many others like it in other religions of the same area are theorized to be linked to a massive increase in sea level, which actually occured when the ice age ended and this water flooded huge parts of what is now sea. So you can say that what happened then is actually just the water going to about the same levels they are now.</p>		</li>

			<p>To add to your wonderful explanation, this:<br><br>&gt; Why is it a battle to fight against concentrations you might wonder? Particles such as salt (ions) tend to prefer to stay evenly distributed as long as there is no perfect barrier between them and the next space. <br><br>is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_pressure" target="_blank">osmotic pressure</a>. </p>		</li>
