			<p>I feel like at least some of this is a reason why a global flood couldn't happen and water animals survive, don't you think? If Noahs Ark happened they couldn't take salt water fish on the boat and so with all the fresh water those salt water fish would die. </p>		</li>

			<p>That would require more water than there is currently on the earth though (The ice would amount to something like 68 meters (223 feet for you americans), so it's not very realistic scenario.<br><br>The stories about that flood, and many others like it in other religions of the same area are theorized to be linked to a massive increase in sea level, which actually occured when the ice age ended and this water flooded huge parts of what is now sea. So you can say that what happened then is actually just the water going to about the same levels they are now.</p>		</li>

			<p>To add to your wonderful explanation, this:<br><br>&gt; Why is it a battle to fight against concentrations you might wonder? Particles such as salt (ions) tend to prefer to stay evenly distributed as long as there is no perfect barrier between them and the next space. <br><br>is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_pressure" target="_blank">osmotic pressure</a>. </p>		</li>

			<p>What about a fish such as steelhead? Aren't they able to run the anadromous cycle numerous times before dying? If so, are they undergoing the same changes? </p>		</li>

			<p>Edit: I might not remember all details correctly, and I'm currently at work so I have to take this from memory.<br><br>Returning to saltwater is essentially a reversing of the physiology that made them able to go back to the river again, somewhat linked to their sexual maturation. It's not exactly the same as smoltification, but somewhat close, but I don't remember the details. Osmoregulation (kidney function, types of cells in the gills etc), as well as behaviour (drinking seawater) is probably the same. <br><br>Species which isn't necessarily anadromous, like the steelhead tend to survive spawning more often. It's also found variation based on river and geography. It's also believed to be a good defence against bad years, as it is &quot;spreading eggs in different baskets&quot;<br>Steelhead are essentially just rainbow trout that have gone to the ocean when they're adults. Salmonids return to the river to spawn, as you probably know. But surviving to go back to the ocean depends on the species. Some, Atlantic salmon, can do this many times (interosseous), while some of the north American species of the onchorhynchus (pacific salmonids) tend to only do this once (semelparous). I'll have to</p>		</li>

			<p>I think it's impressive how ocean mammals like dolphins can survive without drinking water.  I get extremely thirsty while swimming in the   ocean.  They seem to be able to get all the water they need from metabolizing their food where as people seem to need water to metabolize their food.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Some land animals, like camels and cats, can drink saltwater. So not that hard to believe that whales can manage living there. Fish might be good at tolerating the ocean, but their kidneys are potentially far less useful at filtering fluids than mammal kidneys. This came to a surprise to me, but it makes sense as land animals like us live in much more varied environments than fish when it comes to water etc.<br><br>This is essentially because of the structures of our kidneys. Loops used for concentrating urine are longest in the desert dwelling animals, and they can therefore survive on very small amounts of water.</p>		</li>

			<p>Interesting that some land animals can drink seawater and supposedly  most whales get water mainly from the metabolic breakdown of food.  But I'm thinking that if camels and cats can drink saltwater then maybe researchers are mistaken and whales primarily get their water from drinking it.   </p>		</li>

			<p>They do drink water (hard to avoid, really). They also have very little water requirements as they don't sweat, and the air around water is usually quite saturated with water (makes for less water loss through breathing), so they don't have large requirements.<br><br>I guess it's worth to know that concentrating water to a large degree is also a energy cost to the animal, so it's not optimal for all animals to do this. The reason why cats and camels do this is probably because they originally come from arrid areas where it's good to save water.</p>		</li>

			<p>Could you explain a bit on 'Brackish' fish and how they differ from both?</p>		</li>

			<p>There's probably someone who know more about this than me, but its really just a gradient of work for the fish and the difference between the fish' own amount of ions and the surrounding water is the amount of work it has to do to (and which will kill it in the long run if it can't so it). A brackish fish is probably well developed to handle variation well if that is an occuring event where it lives. Interestingly enough marine species tend do better in salt water than in isotonic (same as their body), even though it should be less demanding on them.<br><br></p>		</li>
