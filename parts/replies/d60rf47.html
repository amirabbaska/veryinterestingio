<p>Why is it a battle to fight against concentrations you might wonder? Particles such as salt (ions) tend to prefer to stay evenly distributed as long as there is no perfect barrier between them and the next space. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's impressive how ocean mammals like dolphins can survive without drinking water.  I get extremely thirsty while swimming in the   ocean.  They seem to be able to get all the water they need from metabolizing their food where as people seem to need water to metabolize their food.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some land animals, like camels and cats, can drink saltwater. So not that hard to believe that whales can manage living there. Fish might be good at tolerating the ocean, but their kidneys are potentially far less useful at filtering fluids than mammal kidneys. This came to a surprise to me, but it makes sense as land animals like us live in much more varied environments than fish when it comes to water etc.</p>
<p>This is essentially because of the structures of our kidneys. Loops used for concentrating urine are longest in the desert dwelling animals, and they can therefore survive on very small amounts of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting that some land animals can drink seawater and supposedly  most whales get water mainly from the metabolic breakdown of food.  But I'm thinking that if camels and cats can drink saltwater then maybe researchers are mistaken and whales primarily get their water from drinking it.   </p></div>		</li>
