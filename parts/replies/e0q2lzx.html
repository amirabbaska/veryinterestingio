<p>Another big scientific problem in the movie: You're not going to replace a pressure hatch with plastic and duct tape, especially when it's shown to be flapping around indicating no pressure difference.  You can't survive the atmospheric pressure on Mars even in a pure oxygen environment.  The pressure is well below the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_limit" target="_blank">Armstrong Limit</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: I did some calculations (posted below), and it does seem possible that you could tape plastic over the airlock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, 1 full earth atmosphere inside and 1 full mars atmosphere outside means the duct taped tarp would be constantly  ballooned out due to one being 1% of the other. There wouldn't be the blowing in and out due to pressure variance, no matter the storm.</p>
<p>Could it hold. That entirely depends on the amount of duct tape and thickness of plastic. I would have to do the math but the plastic tarp may have been fine given I assume the industrial nature of the plastic. For example the plastic commonly used to separate insulation from moisture in houses could hold against a total vacuum assuming the edges were perfectly contained. The weak point would be the duct tape and dust.</p>
<p>A point to this, is that a decent thickness of plastic tarp is actually stronger then human skin under pressure. There have been 4 failures of spacesuits in NASA's history and each time the skin has been sucked to the hole and the person was fine even after a lengthy period of time in vacuum. I believe one Astronaut didn't even notice until he got out of the suit and saw the hickey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lets assume the hole was 5 feet in diameter.  It looked closer to 6 feet, but I'm trying to help make it work.  At 5 feet, that gives radius=30 inches and area=2827 sq inches.  At 14.7 psi, that gives 41,563 lbs, or 20.8 tons of force.  C=188.5 inches, so at the edge, the tape and plastic would need to support 220.5 lbs of force per inch of width.  Looking at Table 1, column E in <a href="https://ecommons.udayton.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1050&amp;context=uhp_theses" target="_blank">this study</a>, five full layers of tape should hold that pressure.  Assuming that the adhesive strength is greater or equal to the tensile strength, you would need five full widths of tape on each surface.  That would require about 50 wraps of tape half lapped, or about 4.4 rolls of 180 ft each.  According to <a href="http://www.matweb.com/reference/tensilestrength.aspx" target="_blank">this site</a>, some plastics have a tensile strength as high as 150 MegaPascals or about 21,750 psi.  Using 220.5 lb per inch of perimiter, it looks like 11 mil plastic would hold.  I guess it is could work, but it would definitely not be flapping in the breeze.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty soon I was feeling my familiar way through the thirty or so blankets and rugs Pa has got hung around to slow down the escape of air from the Nest, and I wasn't quite so scared. I began to hear the tick-ticking of the clocks in the Nest and knew I was getting back into air, because there's no sound outside in the vacuum, of course.</p>
