			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. The best way to reconcile these two is to use a surveyor. They can tell you exactly which measurements are related to one another. After that they can say what gravity goes where in quantum mechanics. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also have a gps unit which has a base station set somewhere above a benchmark of some kind (legal survey bar) with a know elevation and then just one guy wanders around with a second piece that communicates with the first. Can be done with 1 guy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's old-fashioned now. Using RTK (dgps) you can basically get centimeter-accurate measurements within 20km of a known-position base station as long as they both have a GPS signal and are in radio communication. </p>
<p>Edit: or with networked RTK, anywhere you can get a cellphone signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GPS could be used for property surveys, but it wouldn’t be optimal. Survey GPS is likely going to lose precision as you get beat buildings and under trees which is exactly what you’re looking at for a property survey. It’s usually easy enough to set up your conventional equipment on an existing property corner and hen find another corner to lock all your measurements into two known points that are already critical for the property. </p>
<p>EDIT: Continental drift isn’t terribly important since the continent is mount as one piece. For example, draw a shape on a piece of paper. Now move that paper on your desk. The shape is still the same. HOWEVER due to GPS we can now track glacial rebound, with no more glaciers weighing down the continental plate parts are starting to float back up, or tilt back down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GPS is becoming more common but in many places is basically irrelevant as the legal description of the land is based off known points that have physical markers in the ground that (basically) never move.</p>
<p>I surveyed for a while, and when we were doing GPS based mapping, we'd set up a station on a known marker. That station had a GPS in it too so any errors due to inaccurate coordinates, goofy satellites, aliens, whatever, would equally effect both the base station and our mobile station. That way our measurements were still referenced off known, fixed markers.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>GPS has about a 15cm accuracy at the best of times. That's fine sometimes, but if you're building a road, or fighting out an urban property line, you need a bit more than &quot;somewhere in this 30cm area&quot;</p>
<p>The ultramodern way is to put a base station at a known location (a survey stake, fixed marker, etc). Doing some fancy signal analysis of GPS information you can then have the base station and measuring point talk to each other and get centimeter accurate measurements. </p>
<p>Or, even fancier, you can do the same trick over cellular internet, from a fixed point hundred kilometers away.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Not really. GPS isn't accurate enough by itself to measure that. Mostly though you're not even all that interested in how far your neighbors fence is from Beijing, but how far it is from your garage. Surveying is all about relative distances.</p></div>		</li>
