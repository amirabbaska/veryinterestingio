			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking personally, I really like shaving my head regularly because I'm bald either way. But if I had the option to grow hair I'd be less prone to sunburns on the old noggin... that's about the worst thing I've encountered. Oh and I have to wear 2 hats on ski slope instead of the regular one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 19 and I noticed that one of my hairlines is a little thinner. It's always been that way. My father says it's a natural part and it's normal for your hairline to mature anyways.
There is hair loss in my family, but they lost hair at mid forties. I saw my barber and he's been with me since I was 12. He says it's normal too, and it's always been somewhat weird and &quot;cow licky&quot;. </p>
<p>The fear is still in my head that I'm going bald in my twenties though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey man, speaking as someone who was in your position: dont fucking worry about it. If you actually start thinning majorly, just shave it. It's not as scary as you might think. </p></div>		</li>
