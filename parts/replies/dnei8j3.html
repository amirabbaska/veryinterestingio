			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not body shaving in general that people are saying took root in the 20th century, but specifically the idea that all women should shave their bodies, and failure to do so was unfeminine (and by extension, that female body hair should be considered gross/unappealing). That cultural norm was invented by Gilette less than a century ago as a way to sell more razors in the US with all the men off at war.</p>
<p>Shaving has been a common practice in various times and places for a variety of reasons, of course. I'm told my great-grandparents' generation thought body shaving was for prostitutes to discourage the crabs, and proper ladies wouldn't do it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was not just for lice etc, though that was part of it.It was very explicitly done for aesthetic reasons. </p>
<p>I refer you, for example, to Caterina Sforza's &quot;Experimenti&quot; which mentions techniques for removing hair from both face and body in the same section on cosmetics. And also to the fictional work La Lonza Andalucia by Delicado, which indicates respectable women would often ask for advice on hair removal to please their husbands. Also, note that almost all nudes prior to the 20th century are hairless, indicating a cultural aesthetic preference for hairlessness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is that? The color of your body hair is determined the same way as the color of your scalp hair. When did people start thinking that it had something to do with age?</p>
<p>As for no body hair, I can see how that would indicate being... really... <em>really</em> young, but body hair comes with puberty. Some adults have much less or much more, especially particular ethnicities, but generally speaking, body hair is a sign of sexual maturity. From the perspective of attraction, shouldn't we prefer body hair just like we prefer wide hips and other signs of perceived fertility?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's false. For most Caucasian people their hair is a lighter colour when they're born compared to when they're older. <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.livescience.com/34827-towhead-blond-kids-blondes-go-dark-brunette.html" target="_blank">https://www.google.ca/amp/s/amp.livescience.com/34827-towhead-blond-kids-blondes-go-dark-brunette.html</a></p></div>		</li>
