			<div class="markdown"><p>About 10 years ago, I assembled dinosaur skeletons for a job. We made cast replicas since the original bone material is extremely fragile.</p>
<p>We usually left out the sternum, or placeholder for one since we never saw an actual sternum, due to weight issues. The framing of the skeleton was made from steel and all places connected were connected via steel. Ribs were notoriously fragile due to how thin they were. </p>
<p>Too much weight and the metal would just bust through the plastic resin we used. So to cut back on weight, we generally left that area open unless requested of us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that's fine, but there's something about actual fossils in a museum that thrills me far more than a cast ever will.  They don't look any different, especially nowadays, but I much prefer seeing real fossils.</p>
<p>I'd rather see casts than have fossils become damaged or destroyed, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to genealogy; dinosaurs are specifically descended from two Orders of animals (<em>Ornithischia</em> and <em>Saurischia</em>). Pterosaurs are descended from an entirely different Order, so they aren't considered dinosaurs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you seem to know what you're talking about- do you mind answering a question.  What is the difference between an unranked clade and an order?  The saurischia wiki mentions this debate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a little backwards, in that the Ornithischia and Saurisichia are the two main divisions of Dinosauria. However, it is theoretically possible that we could find a dinosaur that is not a member of either of these groups. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, it's more confusing to use Linnaean categories in cases like Orders. They try and fit a complex tree of evolutionary relations into a discrete system of rankings, when does it really matter that Ornithischia and Saurischia are Orders, as long as you know how they fit into the tree?</p>
<p>One commonly used, easy-to-understand definition of dinosaurs is &quot;the most recent common ancestor of Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops, and all its descendants.&quot; Tyrannosaurus is a member of Saurischia, and Triceratops is a member of Ornithischia, so it's pretty much the same as what you said. However, and very importantly, it also includes those very early dinosaurs that were around before splitting into those two major groups. Otherwise &quot;dinosaur&quot; would just be an arbitrary term composed of two random &quot;Orders&quot;, rather than the biologically meaningful group of related animals that scientists today mean when they &quot;dinosaur&quot;. Pterosaurs, as you point out, aren't dinosaurs because their ancestors split off earlier than dinosaurs' common ancestor. That said, we think that dinosaurs and pterosaurs were quite closely related in comparison to any other archosaurs.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is also why birds are considered dinosaurs. Birds evolved from Saurischian dinosaurs, making them by the evolutionary definition dinosaurs themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Dinosaur&quot; only refers to a subset of the reptile descendants, not all of them.  Crocodiles and turtles, which were contemporary with many of the most recognisable dinosaurs, are also not included despite being reptiles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What &quot;reptile descendants&quot; are you referring to? Crocodiles and dinosaurs are both archosaurs, but the ancestors of turtles split off from that lineage before dinosaurs evolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait a sec, I thought crocodilians were included in the list of extant dinosaurs <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/12/crocodile-genomes.html" target="_blank">due to their slowly evolving genome</a>. I've been telling my daughter this and want to make sure I have the right info. I guess one of the places we picked that tidbit up was from <a href="http://discoverykids.com/articles/are-alligators-really-dinosaurs/" target="_blank">Discovery Kids</a>, not sure how reliable/up-to-date they are with animal facts though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The definition of phylogenetic groups doesn't depend on ecology. Dinosaurs are not defined by being terrestrial, but by a suite of characters that they share that no other group does. Pterosaurs are closely related to dinosaurs: they are the sister group of dinosaurs meaning that they are the closest relatives that are not part of Dinosauria proper. Dinosaurs + Pterosaurs = a clade called Ornithudira, which are a group of Archosaurs that share elongated lower limbs. Some features that define dinosaurs as a group are: a modified ankle joint that is very hinge-like, a femoral head offset form the shaft at a 90 deg. angle (indicating an erect posture), a perforate acetabulum (a hole in the hip socket), and an elongate deltopectoral crest (attachment for pectoral muscles on the humerus). Any specimen that has these traits will be classified as a dinosaur. Pterosaurs have their own set of traits that define them. </p>
<p>Keep in mind dinosaurs do include some flying forms from the Mesozoic- birds evolved while non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs were still around. </p></div>		</li>
