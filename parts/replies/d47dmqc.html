			<div class="markdown"><p>About 10 years ago, I assembled dinosaur skeletons for a job. We made cast replicas since the original bone material is extremely fragile.</p>
<p>We usually left out the sternum, or placeholder for one since we never saw an actual sternum, due to weight issues. The framing of the skeleton was made from steel and all places connected were connected via steel. Ribs were notoriously fragile due to how thin they were. </p>
<p>Too much weight and the metal would just bust through the plastic resin we used. So to cut back on weight, we generally left that area open unless requested of us.</p></div>		</li>
