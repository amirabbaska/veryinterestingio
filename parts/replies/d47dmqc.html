			<p>About 10 years ago, I assembled dinosaur skeletons for a job. We made cast replicas since the original bone material is extremely fragile.<br><br>We usually left out the sternum, or placeholder for one since we never saw an actual sternum, due to weight issues. The framing of the skeleton was made from steel and all places connected were connected via steel. Ribs were notoriously fragile due to how thin they were. <br><br>Too much weight and the metal would just bust through the plastic resin we used. So to cut back on weight, we generally left that area open unless requested of us.</p>		</li>

			<p>Plumbing parts are great for making one-off structural frames - you've got a straight unit that you can cut to any needed length, and a wide variety of pre-made connectors (for pipes-to-pipes, or pipes-to-<em>whatever</em>), and they're all relatively cheap, and readily available in multiple sizes and materials.</p>		</li>

			<p>Aesthetics is one of the biggest reasons. Doesn't look as &quot;Wow!&quot; when you have a giant rod impaling it. That and you'd always have that one kid or smartass parent that would bring it up to tour guides.<br><br>On the larger skeletons, like the T-Rex, we did have little hooks we attached to the frame so cable wiring could be hung from the ceiling to help support it though.<br><br>Generally, the metal frame we designed actually went through all the vertebrae we did from neck down through the tail. But even with that support, the weight of all the plastic combined often got very heavy when all was assembled together so cutting back on weight where we could was a priority.</p>		</li>

			<p>One of the specimens I worked on before I left was radioactive. More so than what most people would be exposed to on a daily basis, but not enough to be hazardous or anything. People who work in limestone quarries are probably exposed more to radiation than what was on those bones.<br><br>/u/Ded-Reckoning is correct, chances are it was some protective coating.<br><br>I can't say what older museums used.

			<p>I wasn't aware of a Clarke et al. (2004) doing so. Is Kischlat published or was that an abstract? Weird about Novas (1992). TaxonSearch attributes it as &quot;The common ancestor of Herrerasauridae plus Saurischia + Ornithischia, and all of its descendants.&quot;<br><br>&gt; The first definition for Dinosauria was proposed by Novas (1992:60) as “The common ancestor of Herrerasauridae plus Saurischia + Ornithischia, and all of its descendants.” Saurischia and Ornithischia were joined as Eudinosauria, a taxon that never gained currency.<br><br>So in looking at THAT paper (Novas, 1992) (available here: <a href="http://cdn.palass.org/publications/palaeontology/volume_35/pdf/vol35_part1_pp51-62.pdf" target="_blank">http://cdn.palass.org/publications/palaeontology/volume_35/pdf/vol35_part1_pp51-62.pdf</a>)<br><br>On p. 60, he defines Eudinosauria as &quot;the clade including the common ancestor of Saurischia and Ornithischia and all its descendants&quot;. He attributes on the same page the definition of Dinosauria as Herrerasauridae, Saurischia, and Ornithischia to Gauthier (1986) and says he is following Gauthier in having it &quot;include the common ancestor of Herrerasauridae and Saurischia+Ornithischia, and all of its descendants&quot;. But it's never worded as how Sereno quoted it.<br><br>What is your citation for Dinosauria defined as (Allosaurus fragilis + Stegosaurus armatus)? It doesn't appear as such in Novas (1992).<br><br>Julia Clarke doesn't have a paper in 2004 with multiple coauthors. Did you mean the 2nd edition of The Dinosauria (eds. Weishampel et al.), and if so, which chapter and authors? <br><br>Langer (2004, p. 25) defined Saurischia as a stem-based clade for dinosaurs sharing a more recent common ancestor with Allosaurus than with Stegosaurus, but did not define Ornithischia or Dinosauria. I can't find that he used this anywhere else or that Novas offered a definition anywhere that used Stegosaurus or Allosaurus. I would really like the citation for this, as if there is a gap in my awareness, I would like to correct it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ranked just means that someone fit it into the Linnean system, which is a system of ranks.  To say that a group of critters is a ranked group is to say some biologist dubbed that particular group an &quot;Order&quot; for example (or a kingdom, or a genus).  The ranks, however, don't really have much scientific merit.  They are at heart pretty arbitrary and don't really reflect anything in the real world.  What one person calls a genus another might call an order.  It is impossible to say who is really &quot;right&quot; as there is no &quot;right&quot;, as it is just social convention.  <br><br>An unranked group is just a group that the people who identified it didn't bother to try to fit it into the Linnean system.  Perhaps it contained an established Order but was contained an established Class.    So, perhaps they could have called it a super order, or a subclass or some such, but this whole ranking system is all arbitrary silliness anyway so they might just not have bothered.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Since none of the groups in question except Saurischians have modern descendants, no.<br><br>Among reptiles, the only major conflicts for molecular versus paleontological data are:<br><br>1. Origin of turtles - either affinities with some fossil groups that have no living descendants or the sister to the lizard-snake-tuatara group (Lepidosauria) are supported hypotheses of their relationships based on paleontological data versus the pretty solidly supported position of turtles being the sister to the crocodile-bird group by molecular data.<br><br>2. The paleontological/morphological (traits from bones and other observable physical characteristics) tree of lizards is VERY different from the molecular one. In the molecular tree, snakes, the group which has iguanas (Iguania), and the group which has monitor lizards and their close relatives (Anguimorpha) all form a group called Toxicofera which is nested very deeply within the lizard group, whereas in the paleontology/morphology based trees, iguanians branch very early before all other lizards which are more closely related to each other and the position of snakes is very uncertain.</p>		</li>

			<p>The evidence is evaluated separately. Right now, we don't have the morphological or paleontological data to support the molecular tree in either of these cases. Whenever molecular data has been included with morphological data, it's usually done so in the form of large molecular data sets alongside much smaller morphology-based ones so the molecular data sets overwhelm the morphology-based ones or the molecular tree is already enforced over top of a morphology dataset and the purpose is to see where fossil taxa would fall in this framework.<br><br>The molecular data keeps stacking in favor of the same hypotheses in both cases, but there isn't the morphological or paleontological support for it yet. It's OK, look at mammals. Afrotheria (a grouping of elephant shrews, elephants, seacows, aardvarks, golden moles, hyraxes, etc.) was originally supported only by molecular data but slowly the developmental and paleontological data is coming forward to support it. Same for Euarchontoglires (treeshrews, colugos, primates, rodents, lagomorphs).<br><br>There is some, albeit weak, paleontological evidence to support the placement of turtles as the sister to birds-crocodiles, but it isn't very strong against what we know right now.<br><br>Right now, we just have to accept the cognitive dissonance of having competing arrangements and keep working on finding more fossils (whether in the field or in museum collections) that can help solve these problems as well as improving our understanding of the anatomy and development of modern forms for more new information.</p>		</li>

			<p>The big reason is because we have so many more characters to work with in the molecular data. We can look at sequences of different types of DNA, RNA, even protein sequences, and when those start to consistently favor one hypothesis of how animals are related, we tend to give that more weight. The problem remains for fossil taxa that we cannot gather molecular data on. We still need more robust morphological and paleontological data to place them and understand how our living groups evolved.<br><br>Here's a quote from Gould that might help:<br>&gt;Yet the discoveries and techniques of molecular biology have now provided an appropriate source for<br>recovering homology... Molecular phylogenies work not because DNA is ‘better,’ more real, or more<br>basic than morphology, but simply because the items of a DNA program are sufficiently numerous<br>and independent to ensure that degrees of simple matching accurately measure homology. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>Well, the molecular tree supports Cetacea+Hippopotami and has done so consistently since the late 1990s. Entelodonts are just dragging along with the hippopotamuses, there's no molecular data known for them. And in one matrix in particular (Spaulding et al., 2009), it's interesting that several of the other fossil groups with supposed affinities to hippopotamuses are not monophyletic. It's also worth noting that it only takes two more steps in their tree (and in a tree where the MPTs are only 57,269 steps, this is a pretty small change) to bring mesonychians into Whippomorpha. Both of these suggest to me there's a lot more work that needs done to understand how these fossil taxa fit into the Artiodactyl tree.</p>		</li>

Domesticate the bastards. I find it amusing that, at least in two points in human history, people had this exact conversation about dogs. &quot;What do you think, Mug? Do we eat them or train them?&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>To me, it's more confusing to use Linnaean categories in cases like Orders. They try and fit a complex tree of evolutionary relations into a discrete system of rankings, when does it really matter that Ornithischia and Saurischia are Orders, as long as you know how they fit into the tree?<br><br>One commonly used, easy-to-understand definition of dinosaurs is &quot;the most recent common ancestor of Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops, and all its descendants.&quot; Tyrannosaurus is a member of Saurischia, and Triceratops is a member of Ornithischia, so it's pretty much the same as what you said. However, and very importantly, it also includes those very early dinosaurs that were around before splitting into those two major groups. Otherwise &quot;dinosaur&quot; would just be an arbitrary term composed of two random &quot;Orders&quot;, rather than the biologically meaningful group of related animals that scientists today mean when they &quot;dinosaur&quot;. Pterosaurs, as you point out, aren't dinosaurs because their ancestors split off earlier than dinosaurs' common ancestor. That said, we think that dinosaurs and pterosaurs were quite closely related in comparison to any other archosaurs.<br><br>Incidentally, this is also why birds are considered dinosaurs. Birds evolved from Saurischian dinosaurs, making them by the evolutionary definition dinosaurs themselves.</p>		</li>

			<p>This definition (&quot;the most recent common ancestor of Tyrannossaurus and Triceratops and all its descendants&quot;) doesn't cover the &quot;early dinosaurs&quot; that were around before the Saurischia and Ornithischia diverged (since your cut off point is the most recent common ancestor) and all lines that arise from either of those two groups after this split would (should) be categorised into either of the two groups.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm a PhD student working on the evolution of early dinosaurs and some of their relatives. It's actually impossible, the way we've defined the groups, to have an animal be a dinosaur and not be either a saurischian or ornithischian, because &quot;dinosaur&quot; means all the animals that evolved from the last common ancestor of these two groups. <br><br>Animals that fall outside of this split are non-dinosaurian dinosauriforms.

			<p>Dinosaurs are classified based on their common ancestry. So while crocodilians are the closest non-avian relatives of dinosaurs alive today, they still are not dinosaurs themselves, because the common ancestor of crocodiles and dinosaurs isn't called a dinosaur. There is in fact a name for the group uniting crocs and dinos: Archosauria. Dinosaurs and crocodilians are both different groups of archosaurs that split off from one another long before either group came into being. Pterosaurs, which still aren't dinosaurs, are actually more closely related to them than are crocodilians, as both come from the &quot;Ornithodira,&quot; a sub-group within the archosaurs.<br><br>The fact that the crocodilian genome has evolved slowly is certainly interesting, and helps explain why they look very similar to prehistoric croc fossils, but it doesn't make them dinosaurs, since the first crocodile was not one. Conversely, I would imagine that birds have had a very rapidly changing genome since they first evolved, but they still ARE dinosaurs, due to their ancestry. No matter what crazy form the descendants of birds take in the future, they will always be dinosaurs.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's possible that ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, etc. were stem-turtles. (Meaning closer to turtles than to anything else alive -- <strong>not</strong> ancestors of turtles, though.) Not certain at this point, though.<br><br>&quot;Classic&quot; dinosaurs (i.e., non-avian dinosaurs) are stem-birds. Pterosaurs probably are, too, but more distant from birds.</p>		</li>

			<p>Turtles (as four separate OTUs: Eunoto, Pappo, Odonto, Progano) need added to the big new marine reptile matrices to see where they fall out. They were excluded from the matrix those are based on by Reisz et al. (2011) and never re-added. And Bever et al. (2015) who probably have the most characters sunk in for any given matrix that's published right now don't include hupehsuchians or ichthyopterygians (don't ask me to try to have to remember what the cut off is for ichthyosauromorphs, ichthyosauriforms, or w/e).<br><br>As far as I've seen just by playing with re-adding turtles, turtles + sauropterygians is a mutually exclusive result to Enaliosauria/Euryapsida. If turtles + sauropterygians nest with each other, Enaliosauria/Euryapsida breaks up and the ichthyosaur+thalattosaur clade sits outside Sauria. but the last time I did this, Eunotosaurus's redescription had not been published, nor all the new hupehsuchians, nor Cartorhynchus, Pappochelys, etc.<br><br>There's some weird stuff in Bever et al. (2015) that leaves me scratching my head, such as ((Australothyris+Microleter)(Mesosauridae(Eudibamus,Belebey))), a non-monophyletic Lanthanosuchoidea, etc. Also, the labile position of Acerosodontosaurus to the base of Sauria or at the base of a Sauropterygia+Testudines clade. There's so much work that needs done in terms of getting all the characters and taxa represented from these different matrices together, as well as the neglected taxa which are probably quite important such as all the non-diapsid eureptiles like the protorothyridids and many others. We probably do need to start sampling more rootward, as well, to be sure that an effect like what Wilberg (2015) described for crocodyliforms and outgroup sampling is not in play here.<br><br>There's a thesis that was never published as well that touches on how character construction and taxon sampling may also be influencing diapsid relationships, and many of his complaints seem to hold true for all the current matrices as well. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>The definition of phylogenetic groups doesn't depend on ecology. Dinosaurs are not defined by being terrestrial, but by a suite of characters that they share that no other group does. Pterosaurs are closely related to dinosaurs: they are the sister group of dinosaurs meaning that they are the closest relatives that are not part of Dinosauria proper. Dinosaurs + Pterosaurs = a clade called Ornithudira, which are a group of Archosaurs that share elongated lower limbs. Some features that define dinosaurs as a group are: a modified ankle joint that is very hinge-like, a femoral head offset form the shaft at a 90 deg. angle (indicating an erect posture), a perforate acetabulum (a hole in the hip socket), and an elongate deltopectoral crest (attachment for pectoral muscles on the humerus). Any specimen that has these traits will be classified as a dinosaur. Pterosaurs have their own set of traits that define them. <br><br>Keep in mind dinosaurs do include some flying forms from the Mesozoic- birds evolved while non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs were still around. </p>		</li>
