<p><em>Cat-allergic patients with IgE antibodies to Fel d 1 have been shown also to react to the corresponding protein of ocelot, puma, serval, siberian tiger, lion, jaguar, and snow leopard.</em>(<a href="http://www.phadia.com/fr/5/Produits/ImmunoCAP-Allergens/Epidermals-and-Animal-Proteins/Allergens/Cat-dander/" target="_blank">http://www.phadia.com/fr/5/Produits/ImmunoCAP-Allergens/Epidermals-and-Animal-Proteins/Allergens/Cat-dander/</a>)</p>
<p>Fel d 1 is primarily found in cat dander but people can also be allergic to cat saliva. </p>
<p>The most interesting part of allergies I found is that different cats can create a different response. If your cat is spayed or neutered, he/she is likely to be less allergenic. Male cats are more allergenic than female. </p>
<p>The lab community found this out the hard way. In the old days, allergy tests were made directly from animal proteins. Doctors found that tests for cat allergy were not very good, because the cats they were using to create the tests were all different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This super interesting. I've always been allergic to cats, but Highland Lynx mixed with African Bobcats don't seem to bother me much at all. Unfortunately they are unpredictable when breed and I don't personally own one. </p></div>		</li>
