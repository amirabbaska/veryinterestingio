<p>Sounds like heat would destroy many of them since many are thermosets and &quot;Thermoset, or thermosetting, plastics are synthetic materials that strengthen during being heated, but cannot be successfully remolded or reheated after their initial heat-forming. This is in contrast to thermoplastics, which soften when heated and harden and strengthen after cooling.&quot;</p>

<p>Rubber-like solids with elastic properties are called elastomers. Polymer chains are held together in these materials by relatively weak intermolecular bonds, which permit the polymers to stretch in response to macroscopic stresses. Natural rubber, neoprene rubber, buna-s and buna-n are all examples of such elastomers.</p>
<p>Elastomers are usually thermosets (requiring vulcanization) but may also be thermoplastic (see thermoplastic elastomer). The long polymer chains cross-link during curing, i.e., vulcanizing. The molecular structure of elastomers can be imagined as a 'spaghetti and meatball' structure, with the meatballs signifying cross-links. The elasticity is derived from the ability of the long chains to reconfigure themselves to distribute an applied stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to put them in one answer. You can recycle some of them but some of the recyclable have to be treated with a lot of chemicals. Basically it's hard to maintain the needed structure that they stay elastic but it depends strongly on the specific Elastomere</p></div>		</li>
