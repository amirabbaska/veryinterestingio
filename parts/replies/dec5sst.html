<p>Sand can cause wear and tear</p>

<p>Around here in Seattle, it is power washers that cause most of the damage.  You have to clean off debris and moss/mildew off of the glass so it is a pain to keep them working.  Plus unless you have great southern exposure and tracking with your panels, you don't get full output that often.  Over the past five months according to his monitoring system, he's only averaging full output for a little less than an hour a day.  That hour doesn't correspond to peak usage, so it isn't that helpful</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know why they don't put solar collectors on the outsides of the windmills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wind has a smaller footprint, allowing them to be placed in the middle of food farms.  Solar displaces alot of sunlight that would normally be used for plant growth.  Sometimes the best regions for solar and wind overlap, sometimes they do not.  Desert regions (as asked by the OP) seem optimal for solar may not be viable for wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LA is a desert. Most of the Southwest is. Phoenix is also desert. But that doesn't solve how you'd get all that power to San Francisco and Salt Lake City and Seattle, which are definitely not deserts, without major losses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That means there are 2 major cities, at a minimum, that this approach may work for.</p>
<p>The technical challenges can be overcome as well.</p></div>		</li>
