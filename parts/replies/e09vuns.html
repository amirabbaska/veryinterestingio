			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this mean the complexity in making a nuclear device is not in getting it to actually (work) mechanically, but in procuring the correct materials? As in, it's much harder to make enriched plutonium / uranium than it is getting them to go off from the sounds of it.</p>
<p>Like one method is to dump some in a shit ton of explosives and the other is to shoot some at some more. I know I am grossly oversimplifying but this doesn't seem to be overly complex?</p>
<p>Edit; Just want to say a massive thanks for all the replies, I now have some great reading materials and a much better idea of how nuclear devices are made and where the difficulty is. For anyone else who's interested this was linked to by /u/AnAge_OldProb and is really fascinating and well worth a read:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, the scientists were so confident that the gun-type device would work that they didn't even test it (enriching uranium was difficult and they didn't want to waste it). The only test was of the implosion-type plutonium device, since some fairly complicated math and engineering was needed for it to work properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did extensive testing of the implosion device because they knew that the implosion must be as perfectly symmetrical as possible or else the bomb just blows itself apart. It also proved much more difficult to manufacture. Not only were the explosives required to have very specific shapes, but it was found that inconsistencies in the explosive mixture itself (air voids) were causing problems. </p>
<p>In effect, the Fat Man bomb was the first application of explosives with scientific accuracy. If you just want to blow stuff up you don't need as much precision.</p>
<p>First they tried wrapping explosive lenses around steel tubes and detonating them. If the detonation was symmetrical then the tube would be perfectly squinched together at a point. If the detonation was asymmetrical then the tube would twist. The exact type of irregularities gave them clues to what was going wrong. </p>
<p>Eventually they set up bomb test range with a high-speed x-ray camera, so they could film the interior of the implosion bomb detonating. Pretty fantastic stuff, considering the technology level of the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gun didn't really need testing as it contained more than one critical mass of uranium - which also made it extremely dangerous in the event of a fire or ditching the plane.</p>
<p>Apart from the US, the gun design was only ever used in South Africa's nuclear bomb programme. Six warheads were built from 1977 onwards, all were dismantled round about 1989 and South Africa joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind-of - you need a sealed environment and uranium in gaseous form (or liquid, just need it not in solid), then spin it around in a centrifuge. The heavy materials gravitate to the outside and the light inside, and you separate and repeat. If you get it to 5-15% purity, you can make a breeder reactor and breed fissile plutonium. Honestly, I think the directed charges are the harder problem - the centrifuge one is mostly time based.</p></div>		</li>

An implosion type bomb isn't just some nuclear material in a pile of explosives, it's surrounded by a shell of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_lens" target="_blank">explosive lenses</a> which must detonate very precisely, and with perfect timing, to get the nuclear material to criticality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aye and it has nothing to do with the explosion itself, but simply the force wave from the explosion essentially creating a perfect collapsing sphere of uniform force with enough pressure to split the plutonium in a chain reaction.  Because it is compressed so tightly the scatter of energy from the first splits collide with other particles and reach criticality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>To calculate the efficiency of the bombs, you'd have to know their relative atomic densities, but I can't find that information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The standard way to calculate efficiency is to know that the complete fissioning of 1 kilogram of U-235 will get you 17 kilotons worth of energy. (You can calculate this from first principles knowing that every fission reaction releases on average about 200 MeV of energy and knowing the number of atoms of each in a kilogram, but we can skip that...) For plutonium-239, each kilogram that fissions releases 19 kilotons of energy.</p>
<p>So it's a trivial bit of multiplication once you know the yield and the amount of material to figure out the efficiency. If 64 kilograms yielded 15 kilotons, and U-235 fissions at 17 kt/kg, then that's 15 kt / 64 kg / 17 kt/kg = 1.37% efficiency. Low!</p>
<p>For Fat Man, that's 21 kt / 6.2 kg / 19 kt/kg = 17.8% efficiency. Over 10X more efficient!</p>
<p>And in that you can see why the implosion design is a winner in a situation of fissile material scarcity (much more efficient), and you can also see why Oppenheimer asked General Groves after Trinity about whether they ought to disassemble the Little Boy bomb and turn it into maybe 8 &quot;composite&quot; core weapons (weapons that used a bit of plutonium wrapped with U-235, which — if you can get it working — is the ideal way to deal with the fact that they had a lot of U-235 relative to Pu, but U-235 is hard to get working by itself in an implosion design because of its significantly higher critical mass). Groves said no (he said there was no time), but it's an interesting counterfactual to contemplate (<em>what if</em> the USA didn't have 2 weapons at the beginning of August 1945 but ~10 of them at the beginning of October 1945?).</p>
<p>The exact numbers can be massaged a bit, because the exact yield estimates are a range, and because in the case of Fat Man it wasn't entirely Pu-239 fissioning (radiochemical analysis has shown that <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/11/10/fat-mans-uranium/" target="_blank">approximately 20-30% of the total reaction came from the fast-fissioning of the U-238 tamper</a>), but these numbers are close enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't a high critical mass that made the uranium less efficient, it is the low probability of spontaneous neutron emission requiring them to have much more than one critical mass worth of uranium. A critical mass of HEU can take minutes to ignite. The gun design allowed them to pack together as much as uranium as possible, far exceeding criticality, thus ensuring a more timely ignition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're misreading/misunderstanding what I wrote — I am talking about if you tried to make a pure HEU implosion bomb, the higher critical mass means you need more fuel, and that makes compression hard. It's possible to pull off (China did it with their first bomb!), but it's a lot harder than using plutonium or a Pu-HEU mix for implosion.</p>
<p>Which is to say, this is a totally separate point from the gun-type situation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% efficiency for a fission bomb is an easy calculation — multiply the amount of fissile material by the efficiency of the fissile material and you're set. So 64 kg x 17 kt/kg = 1,088 kt (1.1 Mt) for Little Boy, 6.2 kg x 19 kt/kg = 118 kt for Fat Man. But these numbers don't tell you much since 100% efficiency is impossible. It does allow you to play with questions like, &quot;what if Fat Man was twice as efficient?&quot; (And indeed, it was about 4X more efficient than they expected it to be — they thought it would be about 4 kilotons before they tested it.) But other than that... not very useful.</p>
<p>As for what <em>is</em> possible, it's hard to say — not just because the numbers you need (how much fissile material is in a given bomb) are classified (they sometimes are), but also because modern weapons use a mixture of fission and fusion and so it changes it a lot. Fusion is much more energy dense (a kilogram of deuterium-tritium that fuses completed releases around 50 kt), and produces neutrons, and those neutrons can set off more fission reactions (increasing the efficiency both in the original fissile material but also in any extra fissile material that might be in there).</p>
<p>There are reports from the 1950s or so that the US managed to get pure fission weapons with maybe 50% efficiency. For what that is worth.</p>
<p>In terms of later weapons, instead of talking about efficiency of that sort, weapons designers talk about the yield-to-weight ratio, which is to say, the amount of bang for the amount of weapon weight. That's much lower than the pure efficiency of the reactions, but lets you compare various types of weapon systems more broadly. <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/12/23/kilotons-per-kilogram/" target="_blank">I've written a long article about this here</a>, and you can compare US weapon systems with my dynamic <a href="http://nuclearsecrecy.com/betas/yieldtoweight/" target="_blank">yield-to-weight explorer</a>. You can see that the really great yield-to-weight ratios are SUPER heavy weapons with HUGE yields (because they are getting a lot out of those fusion reactions). But most modern weapons are in a different part of the chart, which is for medium-ish yields (100s of kilotons) but extremely compact forms (so you can, for example, fit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_independently_targetable_reentry_vehicle#/media/File:LGM-118A_Peacekeeper_MIRV.jpg" target="_blank">a bunch of them</a> on the end of one super-accurate missile). So it's a different sort of measurement, one that is more useful as the type of weapons diversified.</p></div>		</li>
