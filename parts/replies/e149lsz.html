<p>Does this not increased the chances of the lock going into a key?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we know yet what actually triggers the fold to happen? Like how does the other protein naturally respond that way by mimicking the structure of the prion when it has no intelligence to examine it or determine what it is?</p>
<p>Edit: and what determines which is the prion, or the naughty protein? Why doesn't the correctly folded protein (correct for the organism it's inside of) cause the prion the refold itself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another critical thing prions can't do....prions can't <em>evolve</em>.  A prion is just a screwed up version of a protein that has the ability to refold properly working version of a protein into a copy of itself.  </p>
<p>But it can't refold just any protein into itself, only specific ones.  To fit your analogy, the key only fits in a particular kind of lock, and once it goes into the lock it transforms it into another key identical to itself.  Unlike with viruses or bacteria, there's no genetic information involved here to mutate...in fact, the final shape of the altered protein has more to do with thermodynamics than with information carried by the prion.  The prion just nudges it down into a more stable form.  </p>
<p>The end result of all of this is that prions have absolutely no way to deal with living creatures evolving resistance to them.  If the species changes its protein from a prion-sensitive form to a prion insensitive form, the prion is SOL.  It can't evolve to match changing circumstances like viruses and bacteria.</p>
<p>EDIT: thought of a new analogy.  The normal protein is like a piece of wood.  The prion version is like a piece of wood on fire.  The on-fire wood can set other pieces of wood on fire (turn them into prions)  but if one piece of wood burns particularly well, it can't transmit that burning ability to a new piece of wood.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, they do experience natural selection and evolution. It's just that mutation is probably so energetically unfavourable that it basically never happens. Once that happens though, natural selection should take place as usual.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What is there to mutate though? There is no genetic information.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting, how does the body deal with prions?</p>
