			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond that, consider that when water freezes it A) expands and B) becomes solid with edges.</p>
<p>If 1/10 cells rupture when they're frozen, its not a huge deal if you're freezing 10 eggs and only need 1 to survive. On the other hand, if you freeze and entire person and 1/10 cells rupture, that could cause brain hemorrhaging when you thaw. Or weakened heart muscles etc etc. You need a much higher percentage to still be functioning even taking into account our ability to self repair. </p>
<p>Finally, when we froze down mammalian cells, we used a special solution that expanded less when it froze and didn't form hard edged crystals. You can't actually surround every cell in a complex animals body in this kind of solution.</p>
<p>So in top of what I first described, the likelihood of rupture is EVEN more rare for individual cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the anti-freeze like stuff delivered via the circulatory system is good enough to preserve everything that matters and some future process can restore the rest. Like, is there any part of your brain (or body) that defines &quot;you&quot; that isn't really close to a capillary?</p>
<p>Alternatively, can some sort of vitrification process get good enough to avoid all of the bad stuff that happens with freezing?</p>
<p>I think it's weird that no billionaire has declared &quot;freezing&quot; people as well as possible ahead of some crazy future immortality invention as their life's work. It seems like it should be an intermediate step on the way to brain uploading or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious -- I know some species can survive being frozen. They are all very simple biologically speaking -- plants, insects, fish... I think there's a few frogs that can too. I remember reading somewhere that they have special proteins that bind to the water and it prevents it from becoming a solid. It's <em>like</em> anti-freeze, but it isn't a mixture but a chemical bonding. </p>
<p>Would it be possible for a human to be injected with such proteins to allow them to be chilled to below freezing? Doing that would open up a plethora of medical possibilities today -- maybe being 'hibernated' in this way for the terminally-ill would give them a chance at a cure, albeit waking up many years later in exchange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fundamentally the expansion and sharp edges are only present if the ice crystals form slowly enough. If you use fast freezing techniques the expansion and edge formation are not as problematic. This is why Liquid Nitrogen is often utilized to freeze important cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What they don't explain is that, if you could instantly freeze someone absolute zero (the lowest temperature possible) and &quot;thaw them&quot; back to &quot;normal&quot; temperature instantly, no damage would be done as the water wouldn't expand and pop any balloons.</p>
<p>Little background, even when frozen all the molecules or balloons that make up your body are moving or vibrating and it's this movement that allows water to expand when freezing.</p>
<p>At absolute zero, there is no vibration of molecules meaning water doesn't expand. So if you reach absolutely zero instantly, the water and liquids in your body don't expand but all functions cease. If you returned to your normal body temperature instantly. It'd be exactly like suspended animation you see in sci-fi shows/movies.</p>
<p>edit: I should have said it is impossible to get to absolute 0. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me know when you find the technology able to freeze something to absolute zero. Bonus points if it's instantaneous.</p>
<p>(Absolute zero is, practically, asymptotic. You can get closer and closer and closer, but it's almost impossible to actually reach it. Unlike the speed of light, which actually <em>is</em> asymptotic -- you can approach it all you want, but you'll never get there. Even if you could get a system down to absolute zero, it would still possess quantum mechanical energy. Removal of this would be ... disturbing; the subatomic particles involved are located in a probability state; they're never completely still. At least, probably not.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only that's not actually possible due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle - a particle with exactly zero velocity would have a position that is a superposition of <em>everywhere in the universe</em>, so you'd lose all of the structure of the body. Not to mention it's not practically possible to freeze anywhere near that without passing through intermediate temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you wanted to instantly cool something to, say, 50 degrees F, and it started out like 100F, wouldn't you need to drop the 100F thing into something cooler than 50F? Like maybe if you threw it in a freezer that was 0F it might cool to 50F instantly? But not if you threw it into something that was 50F, then maybe it would only be 75F for example? </p>
<p>In any case I know all my numbers are wrong and BS but basically my question is it would be impossible to freeze something instantly to absolute 0 because you could &quot;throw it into&quot; something cooler than absolute 0, right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing involved I believe is also that when something is frozen fast enough the water is essentially trapped in its current state and isn't able to expand nearly as much, and just due to size differences its relatively simple to nearly instantly freeze a vial of cells throughout while near impossible to freeze a whole body in similar fashion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water expanding isn't the biggest problem when it freezes and turns to ice, the cell wall is elastic enough to not burst just due to the expansion normally. The biggest problems include that when water turns to ice the crystal structure can cause the cell wall to break open from a few different mechanical stresses. And when water freezes out side of the cells osmotic pressure can cause water remaining inside the cell to be drawn out, which dehydrates the cell and can also cause cell death.  </p>
<p>Edit: When I mentioned that the expansion of water isn't the biggest problem it's because current methods of freezing mitigate the the amount of expansion that happens in the cell by controlling the freeze rate so that just enough water is pulled out due to osmotic pressure that the expansion doesn't burst the cell. But if the cells are flash frozen then the expansion of water turning to ice is a problem inside of a cell because it can expand the cell enough to burst it.</p></div>		</li>
