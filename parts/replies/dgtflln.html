			<div class="markdown"><p>Survival results in growth. </p>
<p>The cambium (the part of the tree that makes new cells) produces a network of wood on the inner part of the tree which allows nutrients to move up and down the tree. It also produces a new layer of bark to defend itself. </p>
<p>When a tree gets to a certain height, it cannot get the nutrients from the roots all the way up to the leaves. The cambium does not respond to old age by stopping growth, so the cambium still produces another layer of wood and another layer of bark. This can go on for some time, but eventually the tree has too much mass. The tree can't support itself; either literally because it is too heavy for the underlying wood structure to support it the weight, or the tree has too much living tissue for the roots and leaves to properly sustain it. This makes it vulnerable, which ultimately leads to decline and eventually death. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why haven't trees evolved to stop growing when they get too tall? Wouldn't this be advantageous, as a tree which stops growing can live for longer and hence can produce offspring for longer than a tree which dies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taught that the cambium here in the northern regions where it freezes regrows due to freezing water introducing air into the vessel elements which creates issues in pulling water through the plants stem from roots to the leaves where it is able to be released through water vapor and oxygen (creating that water potential difference that pulls water up vs pushing). If there is no need to regrow the vessel elements due to a constant water-lock between leaves and root that is caused by freezing, does it really NEED to regrow them? Not saying that it won't anyway, but curious as to why it would keep growing if there is no real need for it and hormones such as auxins aren't being forcefully made to create new growth from the lack of water the leaves and meristems are receiving.</p>
<p>It'd be interesting to study differentials expressed genes between areas of freezing and not freezing in the same species. I only work with annual crops and generally xylem and phloem production isn't of great concern. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What if you trim the tree to keep it the same size? Obviously not a natural situation but how does it affect the tree's lifespan?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, <em>pinus strobus</em> can live well beyond 100 years of age in Canada (we manage it for 120 year cycles!). The oldest recorded in Ontario I believe is over 200, but I digress.</p>
<p><em>Pinus strobus</em> runs into height problems in old age; the tree's vascular system simply has a hard limit. It cannot push nutrients from its root high enough to fuel growth in a canopy. This causes the pine to &quot;flat top&quot;. At this point, the tree can only push limbs outwards and continue to thicken its truck and bark. Eventually, the limbs are too heavy for the tree to support and they break off and fall. This damage opens them up for complications; a sudden drop in the canopy mass means an improper ratio of root mass to leaves, stressing roots and causing dieback. It also means that the cambium would receive less energy for growth; if the cambium is starved for too long, it cannot maintain itself throughout the entirety of the tree and the tree dies. </p>
<p>Unlike the <em>pinus strobus</em>, hardwoods like <em>tilia spp</em> have the advantage of being able to stump sprout (coppice) when it has a poor leaf/root ratio. However, it is reliant on having buds set in the stump to do so. Older trees generally have less of these buds and find it harder to recover. But this where silviculture comes into play. </p>
<p>I will use <em>betula papyrifera</em> (White or Paper Birch) as an example. It is possible to cut young (10-20 years old) white birch down to encourage coppicing. The new coppiced stems can grow for 10-20 years and be cut again and they will still coppice. This process can be continued for generations. Many people do this purposely to keep a steady supply of firewood that is a great size to split. I have seen some firewood stands on farms that have been harvested in this way for over 150 years (which is far longer than a single stem from the species would live). As long as the root mass stays healthy, the tree should be able to continue this process. </p>
<p>Hope that messy wall of text helps, haha. </p></div>		</li>
