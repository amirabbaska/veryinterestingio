<p>Even hair, if you look at certain eras, was very rigid for adult women in terms of freedom of expression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'fewer options' thing cannot be understated. There were no &quot;juniors&quot; or &quot;young men's&quot; departments for clothes. Notably, depending on how far back you go, there were no &quot;department stores&quot; at all. If you needed clothes you went to a small, local retailer or made your own from a pattern. </p>
<p>Moreover, life was difficult and children often died. There was no lingering/nostalgia over childhood. Even people with relatively gentle childhoods (rare) were ardent for the full onslaught of adulthood at 16. Looking &quot;young&quot; was not a particular compliment. They did not desire nor fetishize a prolonged childhood. People went straight from high school (if they were lucky enough to get that far) to parenthood and/or a trade (usually manual labor), and they wanted nothing to do with childishness any longer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people didn't go to college if they weren't from a wealthy background, and back then, it was normal for a 19-year old to be married with children and supporting themselves in a home. Now that isn't normal because adolescence has been artificially extended through schooling and other means. There was a really good book  I read called &quot;The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager&quot; by Thomas Hine about how teenagehood is a social construct that started in the 1930's/1940's and really gained traction when the Silent Generation defined the 1950's teenager.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is it. Gramps used to say, back in the day you did everything you could to look adult. you were a man at 21 (and in many cases worked the farm or factory when you were 12 not to mention the entire generation had gone through <em>the war</em> which grows you up fast). In contrast today we idolize the <a href="https://jolenenavarro.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/chris-pratt-3.jpg" target="_blank">carefree man baby frat bro</a> vs the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable#/media/File:Clark_Gable_-_publicity.JPG" target="_blank">manly man</a>.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medical advancements and awarenesses also probably play apart, knowing about the dangers of smoking, drinking and other drugs, all of which I’d say would have fallen dramatically in use since that time. Healthier dietary practices, (obviously not across the board hence obesity) at least within celebrity communities, the people whose pictures get plastered everywhere, they work out a lot, eat super healthy and maintain a generally healthier lifestyle. Lots of contributing factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I think you said it better. I think dress only played a part of it.  I think more of it was how people were more responsible at a younger age, working either on the family farm or having more responsibilities elsewhere. People <em>wanted</em> to contribute and be grown-up/responsible, and they wanted to look the part.  Now we seem to value youth more, and people want to look young and casual, rather than older and responsible.</p>
<p>Sure, dress had a big part of it.  Kids wore clothes that were a smaller version of adult clothes, and adult clothing was more suited for adult things compared to now.  So the average person walking down the street a while ago would wear a hat and nice clothes compared to the workout or casual wear we mostly wear now (more in the US than other countries from what I can tell).  </p></div>		</li>
