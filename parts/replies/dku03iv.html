<p>this is why they tell you when riding a motorcycle to look through the curve, as when I'm riding and do so I tend to be more aware of my lane and stay more centered.</p>
<p>Could just be in my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You look through the curve mainly to keep an eye on what's coming up, so you can react accordingly, and also generally when you look where you wanna go, it's easier to follow through the curve. If you were to look straight ahead in a curve, well you'd probably go straight and crash or something, I highly doubt it has anything to do with rods or cones or peripheral vision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>took the motorcycle safety class in los angeles and they told us what my dad told me when teaching me to drive....... your body goes where you look when driving a car/motorcycle..... you look through the curve bc that's where your body will lean on the motorcycle.... wherever you turn your head or look, that's where you go.</p>
<p>granted as you get better at driving this goes away somewhat, but it's why they teach you to look where you want the bike to go..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the many YT videos of motorcycles going off the road, you will see how frequently the rider is fixating on where he does not want to go..like the oncoming lane on an outside curve...almost always draws the rider right in.
Looking deeply into turns is something every motorcycle driver should practice frequently and try to imprint as it is not the natural reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup even learned this in scouts - basic night tactics. Same as keeping in eye closed when using a light source as to retain night vision more easily in varying light conditions.</p>
<p>Sounds easier to do than it is though, looking slightly to the side of everything is weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting too that night vision goggles are actually tinted green because the eyes are more sensitive to that color.  I think it's because it's right in the middle of the visible wavelengths.  I'm still not quite sure why the color red is used for blackout/light discipline conditions, often what you see in emergency lighting or submarines, etc.</p></div>		</li>
