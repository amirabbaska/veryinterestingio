			<div class="markdown"><p>Brand name drugs exist because when they first enter the market, the  company that developed the drug gets to exclusively sell it for several years. Once that patent expires, companies can make generic versions.</p>
<p>99% of the people who buy brand name drugs (when generic equivalents are available) are idiots spending more money for absolutely no reason.</p>
<p>1% have a legitimate reason. While products have the same active ingredient and the same clinical effect, there could be difference in the non-active ingredients. If a patient has an allergy to a specific type of dye, for example, they may need the brand name product that doesn't contain that dye.</p>
<p>Also, there is a range that generics are allowed to vary within and still be considered equivalent. So, for example, if lab testing shows that the average &quot;100 mg&quot; tablet of one generic contains 99 mg and another brand contains 104 mg on average, this is still legal. For most drugs that's completely meaningless because the recommended doses are just a best guess at what works for most people anyway, and a small variation doesn't matter.</p>
<p>However, there are a few drugs where people's doses are fine tuned very specifically based on the results of lab tests, so a difference of 5-10% could actually matter. These include thyroid hormones, warfarin (a blood thinner), and some transplant meds. In that case, it may make sense to stick with the brand name product for consistency.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT FOR CLARITY</strong>: As u/Goweschon pointed out, I wasn't all that clear above about one point. Sometimes there are multiple formulations of the same drug that have different release mechanisms or other differences that make them <em>not</em> equivalent. For example, the drug mesalamine for conditions such as Crohn's is available in multiple products that release differently throughout the GI tract. Also, there are about a billion different forms of methylphenidate for ADHD and they have different release mechanisms and release differently over time. The FDA does not consider these to be equivalent and it would be illegal for a pharmacist to automatically substitute one of these products for another as a generic substitution. I'm specifically talking about generic drugs that are considered by the FDA to be equivalent to a certain brand name drug, and how there is almost never a reason not to accept the generic substitute from the pharmacy in those cases. This includes the vast, vast majority of medications. The examples I just mentioned are the exception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, for medications meant to be ingested in liquid form, there's often a decent difference in taste. Usually not enough to justify the additional cost, but for example, Walgreens' Dayquil generic tastes positively terrible and leaves an aftertaste in my mouth for about an hour that is most unpleasant. Unless it's on sale, I'll spring for Dayquil or another generic.</p>
<p>A good example of non-active ingredients having an impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also sometimes the brand name will produce the generic brand as well.  Same type of packaging, tablet shape/form etc. just different label &amp; name. </p>
<p>So they could get both ends of the market. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to some of the other replies, well composed and thought out I might add, in the U.S. (not familiar with other counties systems, so I apologize for the ignorance) if you are getting prescriptions filled, your insurance may not cover non name brand drugs, and while the copay on name brand may be $150.00, the non name brand could cost $500.00 or more out of pocket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting (but weird). For us in France reimbursement of a drug is based on the price of the cheapest available generic unless the prescriptior specify that a generic should not be used. If you want the original drug you end up paying more (and people still do it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it would be for the same reason that anyone buys name-brand stuff. People generally prefer buying things from a brand they are familiar with. For instance, with chicken, people are more inclined to purchase Foster Farms products instead of Randall Farms products even though there’s no significant (if any) difference between the chicken packages.  </p>
<p>I work in the meat dept of a grocery store and I get snooty customers all the time telling me how bad Randall Farms chicken is and that they’ll “never buy it again,” even though the chicken they’re buying from behind the meat counter is in fact Randall Farms brand. The taste difference is all in their head just because of the familiarity or unfamiliarity of the brand name. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to know that for a generic drug to be listed as a generic for a certain name brand drug, its effectiveness need only be within 25% of the effectiveness of the name brand. That can yield very different results. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehhhhhh... In theory, yes.</p>
<p>But it doesn't always work in practice.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, the inactive ingredients in a generic can cause the active ingredient to metabolize differently in an individual, which can cause BIG problems for them.</p>
<p>I'm on anti-seizure med Lamictal and for a short time my pharmacy switched generic manufacturers, my moods began to swing rapidly and I was experiencing vertigo and (of course) seizures, and I became photo sensitive to the point where standing in the sun physically felt like someone sanding my skin off (without leaving a sunburn).</p>
<p>After some extended bickering between me, my doctor, my insurance company, and the pharmacy I now have to fill prescriptions with a special note that says &quot;Not from X manufacturer&quot;.</p>
<p>And now I'm good. </p>
<p>Initially they tried to up my dosage on the bad generic and frankly the thought of what would have happened terrifies me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are certain drugs where this is a big issue - anti-seizure meds, warfarin (iirc), and synthroid (just kill me if I ever have to switch to generic). I've also had varying issues with generic vs name brand birth control pills. I'm not sure if the same issue applies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tell her that a stranger on the internet sincerely wishes her well.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take an anti-seizure as well and started with the generic. A 200 mg dose did nothing for me except cause me to go nuts where 100 mg of name brand works wonders.... not all generic is the same for everyone!!!! And it was not &quot;in my head&quot; because I started on the generic and kept raising the dose to get proper results.</p></div>		</li>
