			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that even just telling people your plans trigger many of the same pleasure receptors as finishing it, leading many projects to not starting. </p>
<p>So now I don't tell anyone what I plan on doing. </p>
<p>Which means no pleasure to counteract my depression and ennui. </p>
<p>Which means I don't start anything... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah! I’ve heard writers talk about that. They won’t tell people their stories because once they’ve been spoken, they’ve been told and don’t need to be written. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very true.. one of my friends was always enthusiastic about trying to start writing stuff, and all I know so far is he is working on writing a story.  </p>
<p>He specifically mentioned that he didn't want to try to vocalize his thoughts, or else he might just not care about writing it anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I write for fun, but I've found that I can't tell most people the story, not only because it delays my writing of it, but also because I don't want input on my unformed ideas. Too many conversations have gone something like this:</p>
<p>Interested person (IP): I see you writing all the time. What's your story about?</p>
<p>Me: This guy who goes on an amazing adventure to visit the front porch of the mayor</p>
<p>IP: Huh, that sounds pretty good, but what's the character's name?</p>
<p>Me: Gary</p>
<p>IP: I don't like that name, you should change it to something else, and maybe not have him visit the mayor... what about the mayor's uncle? </p>
<p>Me: why don't you write your own story about that?</p>
<p>IP: No, I could never do that!</p>
<p>Gary likes the mayor, OK? Go write your own fucking book.</p>
<p>I sometimes tell one or two of my close friends, who know not to give unasked for input and are great at helping me flesh out ideas, but it's hard to find those kinds of people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that having told people, even before hand, you get the adulation with none of the work. </p>
<p>I hear it a lot with dieting. If you tell your friends and coworkers that you are going to go on a diet they will congratulate you and you'll feel accomplished without doing anything. Then when you hit a wall a week in you don't have the will power to stick with it because you have already been &quot;rewarded&quot;. If you don't say anything about going on a diet, before or during you don't get rewarded until people start noticing you losing weight, at which point you've already formed a habit and don't need the adulation anymore.</p>
<p>Edit: I misread your comment as the best of both worlds and then wrote this response. Obviously I misread that and I'm not making a new point at all. Still, I'm not going to delete the post because I'd rather admit my mistake than try to hide it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's what Solzhenitzin had to say on the subject in his novel The First Circle: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now listen to the rule of the last inch. The realm of the last inch. The job is almost finished, the goal almost attained, everything possible seems to have been achieved, every difficulty overcome — and yet the quality is just not there. The work needs more finish, perhaps further research. In that moment of weariness and self-satisfaction, the temptation is greatest to give up, not to strive for the peak of quality. That’s the realm of the last inch — here, the work is very, very complex, but it’s also particularly valuable because it’s done with the most perfect means. The rule of the last inch is simply this — not to leave it undone. And not to put it off — because otherwise your mind loses touch with that realm. And not to mind how much time you spend on it, because the aim is not to finish the job quickly, but to reach perfection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope that helps. I have a printout of this at my desk, and it always reminds me that I need to invest <em>effort</em> in the last mile. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically what I wanted to say, I end up doing this because I'm a lazy perfectionist.  I feel the weight of the grind that it would take for me not to be unhappy with the result (it's a grind because the fun/easy parts are all done) and just bail.</p></div>		</li>
