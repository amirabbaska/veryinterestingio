			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I have to give CPR instructions over the phone to shitty callers. They’re forever going “oh he’s on the bed I can’t move him” and I say just roll him then. Roll him onto the floor. “Oh but he might hurt his head”. I just say it doesn’t matter and we can sort that out later. It doesn’t matter if he breaks his legs. Just get him on a hard surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but there is a difference between people who are arresting and people who are unconscious. I don't want people to read this and think if they see someone unconscious in a car wreck they should just haul them out first thing.</p>
<p>If there is any risk of spinal injury, be very sure they need to be moved before you move them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the opposite. As soon as the thoracic cavity looses it's structure, I have to use my lower back to lift myself off the chest to make sure I allow for good venous return. So now I'm working twice as hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are using the pt’s chest to ‘lift’ you back up, you aren’t allowing for maximum refilling. You are adding pressure to the thoracic cavity which will limit (albeit very slightly) venous return. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd wager the sensation of broken ribs usually comes from costochondral separation.  Well placed compressions centered on the sternum ought to create the (below linked) injury rather than actually breaking ribs unless the patient is especially frail.</p>
