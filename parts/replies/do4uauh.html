			<div class="markdown"><p>It's nowhere near as dangerous as he makes it sound. If you hold a geiger counter to the porcellain of your toilet bowl, you'll hear it tick quite a bit. Most of earth is radioactive. You absorb radioactivity every day, and you're fine. You can absorb quite a bit more radioactivity and be fine as well.</p>
<p>There are people whose job it is to work with radioactive stuff. They catch a ton of radiation, but that's okay since we know very exactly how much radiation is safe.</p>
<p>Now back to nuclear waste: Obviously, that stuff is not safe to handle on a daily basis. But still: Its only danger is radioactivity, a well-understood and exactly measurable source of danger. We know what it is, we know how it behaves, we know how long people can be exposed to it without risk.</p>
<p>Burying it deeply in granite rock is actually ridiculously safe. Yeah, it'll stay radioactive for another million years in there, but that radioactivity is never gonna reach anyone anywhere. If the barrels leak then we won't be able to have people enter the cave and check on that stuff, but it still won't be a danger to anyone else.</p>
<p>Most of earth's rock is already radioactive. Radioactivity is dangerous, but controllable (unless of course you do stupid shit like building reactors in densely populated areas which also happen to be prone to earthquakes and tsunamis). Buried radioactive waste won't hurt anyone. It won't explode, it won't magically move through thousand miles of rock to unforseeably poison people.</p>
<p>It's an emotional topic for people, and most of us have no idea about the actual danger involved. Worrying about coal makes much more sense. We burn that shit and then we breathe it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say we know exactly how much radioactivity is safe, but we have a pretty good idea.
Another factor that is often overlooked and perhaps counter-intuitive: the waste with long half-life is relatively safe to handle, because it is not emitting a lot of radiation - this is the reason why the half-life is so long. Isotopes with a half-life of days or even hours on the other hand are quite dangerous because they emit a lot of radiation in a short amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well. &quot;Barrel&quot; is not the best word, it makes you imagine a flimsy steel drum. I think the finns are ccurrently having the most sound (and most importantly finnished) approach. The system is based on storage cylinders. </p>
<p>The cylinders are cast iron which hold the fuel and provide rigidity. These are then placed in thick copper cylinders (a few cm) and sealed. The cylinders are disposed in a drilled cave 500m down, in individual pockets lined with a special clay. This clay is hard for water to move through. The cave is filled with these chambers and lastly filled with rock all the way up and sealed with concrete. </p>

<p>And I would recommend watching the documentory &quot;Into eternity&quot; for a different take on the problem. The documentory is about this site and how the designers are trying to think and plan for 100 000 years. (Questions such as &quot;Do we mark and remember or deliberatly try to forget to avoid incomplete rumours getting people to dig for &quot;treasure&quot; in 3000 years?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is about 60 years out of date or is a third world method for disposal. </p>
<p>I perform this work as a career and have for about a decade. Most of these comments are gross oversimplifications and/or misinformed on the modern processes of nuclear waste handling. </p>
<p>You have to consider that there are many different types of nuclear waste. Varying in its handling by its isotope, material, condition, how 'hot' it is, whether the waste is a fixed waste, airborne, surface contaminant, matrixed, source material, etc. </p>
<p>There are volumes, and I mean mountains of procedures that categorize, instruct, and control the waste flow into waste streams; the waste is controlled by administrative and physical procedures  all the way to its final destination. </p>
<p>Your question begs specification. Do you want to know the final destination? Do you want to know the initial handling procedure? What kind of nuclear waste are you describing? </p></div>		</li>
