			<div class="markdown"><p>Typical residential filters would in no way mitigate car pollution. They are mostly there for dust mitigation. Pollution particle size from car exhaust is many order of magnitudes smaller and would pass right through. You can buy better filters for indoor systems. But they are more restrictive as any better filter is by its nature. This increased restriction can lead to a higher strain on your AC or heating blower motor and lead to higher electricity bills, decreased air movement and more wear on the motor leading to costly repairs down the line.</p></div>		</li>
