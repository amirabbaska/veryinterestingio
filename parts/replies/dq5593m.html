			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that it's even possible to hit that asteroid hard enough to break it into parts big enough to track in the solar system. It's like saying that we should be able to chip off parts of a mountainside by firing a cannonball at it from a far off valley. It's really freaking hard and I'm not sure that we have enough firepower to do it in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's nowhere near enough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Understood.  It would require a huge amount of energy to slow down or divert a sizeable fragment.</p>
<p>Do you know if it's still moving towards us?  The article made it sound like we had a few years before perigee (closest point to Earth).</p>
<p>My thought was that small pieces (although incredibly fast) require less energy to wrangle.  If you can divert the fragments, there's a better chance of decelerating using standard techniques (like gravity-assist, direct propulsion, or impact absorption).</p>
<p>Imagine diverting a golf ball-sized chunk into the moon's surface... and getting Japan or India pick it up during their planned missions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how would you realistically perform this? At the asteroids closest approach to Earth the Moon would have been 0,008 degrees wide in the sky on the rock. Using a brute force impact the chances of anything hitting the Moon are not good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blowing it up and breaking it to pieces would be easy but then it would just be several objects exiting the solar system instead of just one.</p></div>		</li>
