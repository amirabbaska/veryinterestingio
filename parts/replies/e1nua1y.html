			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback: I used to work for a vending company that owned and managed thousands of jukeboxes for bars and restaurants, etc. Every box has to have a license that is renewed every year. A portion of the fee for that license goes to Ascap and/or BMI. These agencies are ruthless, but their purpose is perfectly understandable.
If you have unlicensed karaoke or if your tv is on a music channel and you don't have a public listening license, a rep might sit in your bar all night long, counting violations without saying anything. I heard horror stories of fines in the tens of thousands of dollars at bars that might clear a hundred bucks a night in profit. These may have been boogimen though. Never saw that myself, but the message is clear: pay your license fee, avoid trouble.
Once digital jukeboxes came along, and computers starting tracking plays automatically, everyone got a lot happier. Except the customers. Songs cost more to play now because the artists know what they're worth to us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, most people don't realize that almost any performance of music requires a license or some other agreement. Want to play the radio in your office (so multiple people can hear, your headphones don't count)? Performance license. Want to feed your collection of MP3s as hold music for your little company? Performance license.</p>
<p>I don't know if they still do this, but they (BMI or ASCAP, I can't remember) used to have a low priced option for such situations. I'm not going to say they're angelic, but they are (or maybe just were) somewhat reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the artists say these organizations are huge scams. Artists get very little from them, compared to what they have collected. </p></div>		</li>
