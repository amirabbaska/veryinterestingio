			<div class="markdown"><p>This one is of the only good answer, against the whole transistors stuff.<br />
The whole concept of &quot;why using bits?&quot; can be answered using the physical limitations, but in the end, the physical components, were created to implement the &quot;abstract models and machines&quot; of these important theories.  </p>
<p>So, in the end, to answer the question: &quot;Why using bits?&quot;:  </p>
<p>The computer is a machine that process (computation) and send information.  </p>
<ul>
<li>what is the best way to represent the information? According the information theory, by shannon, the answer is the bit</li>
<li>what kind of operation is possible to do using bits? boolean algebra</li>
<li>what is the computation power of this machine? see Computation theory, and the Turing machine. </li>
</ul>

<p>Information theory does not say that the bit is the best - base 10 works just as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. being in the ELI5, I didn't want to overcomplicate things.<br />
The Information theory, can be applied to each base. However, the base 2, was the one chosen to prove/elaborate the theory.</p></div>		</li>
