			<div class="markdown"><p>There are no quantum states in general like that. What I am suggesting is if it is bounded and localized and far away, it would be a superposition of Rydberg states. If its bounded it is a superpostion of energy eigenstates, if it is far away we restrict to Rydberg states. Taking a specific combination of these will give a localized electron.</p>
<p>Edit: A quick calculation: At 1 m from a proton the electric potential is 1.5 nV, so the electrons energy must be less than 1.5 neV for it to be bounded. This means its its momentum must be less than 2*10^-29 kg m/s. From the uncertainty principle we then find the position can be localized to around 33 microns. </p></div>		</li>
