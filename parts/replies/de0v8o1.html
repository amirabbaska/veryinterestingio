<p>Thanks, I didn't realize that was the limiting factor.  I just thought it was overall insufficient cooling properties.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't relevant for cryogenic work, but helium actually does have one of (actually I think the highest) the highest thermal conductivities for a gas.  It only really matters for things like helium stirling engines.  </p>
<p>The simple explanation is that because the particles have extremely low mass, they move very quickly after being smacked by a jiggling (hot) atom or molecule.  Then they go shooting off into the gas, or to the other side of the container.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best thermal conductivity is true at low temps but others such as hydrogen are better at higher temperatures. This is the reason hydrogen, despite its extreme volatility, is chosen to cool large turbogenerators over helium even though both have low densities, which reduces windage losses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen gas is too heavy (Therefore, freezes at higher temperatures than smaller gases), hydrogen is even lighter than Helium, but is much more unstable than Helium, which gives it a higher freezing point than Helium, due to its instability in comparison to Helium.  </p>
<p>Also, a point can be made to use abundant Hydrogen gas instead of Helium for cooling. However, the problem with that is, it's extremely dangerous to use hydrogen gas, as it is fairly combustible. </p>
<p>Second best choice would have to be Helium, super stable, one of (if not THE) the most stable molecules possible. </p>
<p>Nitrogen gas may be sufficient for simpler electronics or icecream, but nothing beats Helium in terms of low freezing point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not an expert on superconductors by any stretch of the imagination, but I do use them every week (500 MHz NMR). The main reason that high-temperature superconductors don't have many practical applications is their material properties. Generally the materials we've made that exhibit superconductivity at liquid nitrogen temperatures or above are ceramic materials with complicated doping schemes. Ceramics are great, but it's really hard to make wires of of them, or coils, or any of the other electronic components that you might want to make out of superconductors. </p>
<p>It's just a lot easier to work with compounds that behave like metals (malleability, ductility) for most electronic applications. An MRI works on the same principle as the NMR that I use in the basement of the university where I work. The superconductor is there so that the instrument can maintain a large current (generating a large magnetic field) without massive losses to resistance. This requires a large coil of wire--it's really just a huge electromagnet. It would be very difficult to make such a coil of wire out of a ceramic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've just highlighted a glaring gap in my knowledge - what is the process behind creating ceramic components?</p>
<p>I guess they're grown like other crystals and I imagine they have a large, crystalline, brittle structure. That must be difficult to make coils from and even then, I guess coil noise could be a big problem. I think I need to do some reading. Thanks for the inspiration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things get a little complicated once the goal is to produce a large magnetic field. As well as having a limit to what temperature superconducting materials can be taken and still retain superconductivity, there's also a limit to how much current you can put through them before they lose their superconducting properties, even well below the supposed &quot;temperature limit&quot;.</p>
<p>So a material that is a perfectly good liquid N2 temperature superconductor might be no good for an MRI. Likewise the materials which have been perfectly good to build 1000 MHz NMR spectrometers can't be pushed any further, so there are now efforts under way to find new low temperature superconductors to do this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, if you cool high temperature superconductors to low temperatures, their critical fields become ridiculously high, up to something like 100 T. I know that there exists a research project at the MagLab to make a BSCCO-based NMR magnet, where they aim for around 1.4 GHz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to expand, helium is actually produced on earth by radioactive decay - as opposed to petroleum which is just stored in deposits (at least on time scales that are important to humans) there is a limit to how much we produce each year.  we should be fine as long as demand does not exceed the production rate. </p>
<p>at least according to this article:
<a href="http://www.universetoday.com/75719/where-is-helium-found/" target="_blank">http://www.universetoday.com/75719/where-is-helium-found/</a></p>

<p>my guess is that we probably dont really know if we will exhaust our supply or if it is continually replenished at a rate that would make it totally renewable.  </p>
<p>while it is the 2nd most abundant resource in the universe, it might be hard to actually mine with rare exception (He3 on the moon, for instance).  it is so light that it disperses readily. i am probably wrong, but im not aware of any known and accessible helium ice deposits in our solar system.  <del>uranus has helium ice, but that might be as close as we get to 'mine-able' helium ice.</del> i miss-read an article. this is not true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The Helium reserve was intended for blimps. Feds started selling it off in 1996 when helium prices were low. 20 years later, there's a supply crisis, prices soar.
Idiots.</p>
<p>The Federal Helium Reserve, is a strategic reserve of the United States holding over 1 billion cubic meters (10^9 m^3) of helium gas. The helium is stored at the Cliffside Storage Facility about 12 miles northwest of Amarillo, Texas, in a natural geologic gas storage formation, the Bush Dome reservoir. The reserve was established with the enactment of the <strong>Helium Act of 1925</strong>. The strategic supply provisioned the noble gas <strong>for airships</strong>, and in the 1950s became an important source of coolant during the Cold War and Space Race.</p>
<p>By 1995, a billion cubic metres of the gas had been collected, and the reserve was US$1.4 billion in debt, prompting Congress to begin phasing out the reserve in 1996.  However by early 2011, the facility was still in government hands.</p>
<p>Edit: Story from 2013: The US House of Representatives voted unanimously on 25 September to delay closing the world's only strategic helium reserve, <strong>averting a potential supply crisis</strong>. But the move will not make life much easier for US researchers who are already <strong>struggling to cope with rising helium costs</strong>. </p>
<p>Your federal government at work, sell low, buy high.</p></div>		</li>
