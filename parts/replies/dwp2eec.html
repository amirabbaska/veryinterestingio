They work because your vision isn't like you can see 700 nm perfectly and then 710 nm you can't see at all... the efficiency just drops off rapidly. So if ordinarily you can't see (just making up a number here) 720 nm that's only because your eyes are 1000x less efficient at seeing it than other wavelengths. But if you filter out everything below 720 nm then your eyes adjust, and if you go out in the bright sunlight your pupils will still be fairly dilated allowing 1000x more light to come in, so you can see the 720 nm band that you don't ordinarily see.</p>
<p>The most striking things are that green plants appear shining white (because chlorophyll reflects near infrared), and that clear water like a swimming pool appears murky (because pure water absorbs it).</p>
<p>You still can't really see &quot;heat vision&quot; / thermal infrared at all, because that's much longer wavelengths for near-room-temperature objects. If you turn on your electric range so it's almost-but-not-quite-red-hot you can see it glow a little, but that's about it.</p></div>		</li>
