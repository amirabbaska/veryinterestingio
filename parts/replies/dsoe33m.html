<p>The momentum of each photon is equal to the Planck constant divided by the wavelength of the photon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm. Maybe I should have paid more attention in physics because this answer actually confused me more. </p>
<p>If the speed of light can’t change, how does it impart some of its momentum to the object it hits and accelerates?  It just changes wav length?</p>
<p>Also, completely not the same question but if light doesn’t have mass, how does gravity cause lensing?  Is it that the gravity is actually bending the fabric of reality itself so the photon has to travel on a curved path from the perspective of someone looking at it but it’s still going straight as far as it’s concerned?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, how can it be random? True randomness doesn't actually exist, everything can be traced back to a cause even if it's impossible for us to do so.</p>
<p>So...what decides their direction I wonder....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. Photons (and other massless particles) can never travel at anything other than c. Any form of energy that does not have mass <em>has</em> to travel at c as an aspect of its existence. No other speed is possible. that speed is intrinsic to its nature. </p>
<p>To 'stop' a photon is simply to absorb it its energy, transferring its energy into the excited state of an electron. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It takes significantly longer for your brain to process that your eye saw light than it takes for the light to travel to your eye. </p></div>		</li>
