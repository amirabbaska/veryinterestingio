			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add there is very little variance between healthy people absorbing foods. You may have read that some people are missing a fat uptake gene which helps them stay thin. These people do exist, but they are the abnormal group. If your body couldn't absorb all nutrients you would at the very least suffer severe deficiency problems and so the genes involved are quite heavily conserved. Usually what is left is cellulose and waste products that no-one will absorb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure this is right. I've read about it before. Most foods aren't actually tested, the energy content is calculated based on the ingredients, previous testing on those ingredients and a bioavailability value - i.e. how much of the energy is actually absorbed.</p></div>		</li>
