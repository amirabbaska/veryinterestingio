			<div class="markdown"><p>All or part. This is the insolvency exclusion and is reported on form 982 (see pub 4681). My son just went through this for settled student loans. He owed and filed as owing over 15K for 2017 (the cancelled debt was huge because of interest and penalties owed the lender). He entered a payment plan with the IRS. He later discovered this exclusion and learned he could file amended to eliminate most of that &quot;income&quot; and the taxes on it. He had to find this on his own and then refiled using HR Block so they could review and verify that what he was doing was legit. The payment plan will go poof and he actually went from owing an ungodly amount to getting a refund. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The TLDR of this is you are exempt of your forgiven debt less any positive net worth. </p>
<p>The calculation for insolvency INCLUDES your debt that is forgiven, this is why. So if you have a $300k student load forgiven and $0 net worth(not including the forgiven loan), the whole thing is exempt. If you have $500 net worth (not including the loan), 295,500 is exempt. If you have -$500 net worth (not including loan), whole thing is forgiven. </p></div>		</li>

<p>you will receive a 1099 tax form saying that you have $7500 as income.</p>

<p>Or, the companies will claim they sent you one and just dump it in the river. That way you get screwed again when the IRS comes after you with audits, late fees, penalties, and interest.</p></div>		</li>
