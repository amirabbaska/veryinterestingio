			<div class="markdown"><p>Well he did have to give interviews and memorize lines for movies and do boring stuff in between being a badass. Although it's hard to imagine memorizing lines when you are being shocked every few seconds. It's really not pleasant, it doesn't hurt exactly but imagine getting a shock about 10 times less intense than the shock you would get from a wall outlet if you grabbed some bare live wires. And having that make your muscles contract really hard and then relax. The guy was a fanatic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They tried that with my buddy after he paralyzed his arm.  He got a prescription and had to pick it up at the pharmacy.  Obviously everybody had to try it out.  I put it on my neck, cranked it up, and everything just seized up, forcing my head to turn and stay in one direction.  Nope.  Definitely not pleasant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course everybody had to try it. That made me laugh. They really suck, I would really have to want to rehab something to use one. Did it help your buddies arm though? I can't imagine it could unparalyze it but it could maintain some muscle tone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great athletes has used bullshit training methods since always. </p>
<p>Even more so the top athletes always wanting to be one step ahead  of everyone else.  </p>
<p>Also remember  Bruce Lee is greatly exegerated. People forget he used promoters to create hype around his character to increase movie appearance and job opportunities. After all his acting was lackluster and he has never proven him self </p></div>		</li>
