			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Only cumulonimbus. It needs to be able to cycle through, without going into too much detail the hail stone cycles down, then the hot upwards air draft (why the cumulonimbus cloud is so tall) sucks the hailstone back up. This process continues until the hailstone's weight exceeds the amount of lift the warm air is capable of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered what determines the size of a rain drop. If I understand correctly, the amount of time to nucleate might affect drop size? If it has more time to nucleate, it has more time to build in size? </p>
<p>I imagine there's other factors too, like temperature? If it's cooler, maybe it doesn't hold onto new water as well?l so the droplets are smaller? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got a part of it right, the other factor is how high up the droplet is formed in the cloud. Once the droplet starts falling it combined with other droplets, creating MEGADROP, or the raindrop that comes down and hits you. (My professor doesn't like the terminology I used here) but hopefully that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. And also, do raindrops swirl back up into clouds (like how hail increases in size) thus creating that 'megadrop'? </p>
<p>Edit: this question really has been something I've wondered for like 15 years so thanks for answering! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of factors that contribute to drop size. Including initial cloud nuclei size, drop size distribution, number of collisions between cloud droplets, updraft velocity, if it is a cold cloud (below freezing in parts), moisture availability, and time. Some of these impa t each other as well</p></div>		</li>
