			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone else in this thread is talking about flaws in the stimulus (CGI face) that our visual system can pick up, but you're the only one who's explaining why we have so much processing power dedicated to independently processing human faces.  An additional point to add to yours:</p>
<p>An evolutionary hypothesis for why we often absolutely hate CGI faces (that we recognize as CGI) is that we evolved to evaluate every face we see for signs of underlying problems.  CGI faces that fall in the uncanny valley look like human faces that are profoundly sick, and our bodies may react specifically with the feeling of revulsion when we see them out of an innate fear of contacting a horribly disfiguring disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just a dangerous disease, but also, probably more commonly, a dangerous underlying personality. We are so tuned to the emotions of the people around us that we've become experts at gathering and assembling every scrap of information related to the inner mental states of those around us. Someone whose emotions (as shown on their face) don't quite match what you're expecting might have some deceitful ulterior motive that you REALLY want to know about.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I'm seeing is that a lot of people in the thread think it's all about confirmation bias, which I strongly disagree with.</p>
<p>I doubt there is 30s of CGI of a realistic face that expresses a range of emotions that looks natural. The CGI where confirmation bias might occur is probably during quick shots, or where the expressed emotions aren't very dynamic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. The physical components look completely realistic but there as something still off about the eyes. You can tell he's not really seeing anything as his eyes look around the room. I suspect it might be something in the eye movement, but I'm not entirely sure.</p></div>		</li>
