			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct. The air is moving from the high pressure to the low pressure system, now imagine what happens to the air in the low pressure; more air keeps moving in, it can't go down, because there's the ground, so it starts rising. Rising air creates clouds and therefore often rain. The high pressure is &quot;losing&quot; air, which means the air is descending. This prevents cloud formation and that's why you get nice weather.

<p>as the ground gets hotter the air above gets hotter </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't get this? The ground is hot because it's <em>absorbing</em> heat. Shouldn't the air above it be colder than the areas that don't collect heat and reflect it back? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't absorb heat. It absorbs sunlight. By absorbing photons from the light it gains energy which it the releases as heat.</p>
<p>If it were absorbing heat it would feel cold to the touch because it would be taking heat away from your hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ground does heat up. When it feels warm to the touch some of the heat that was in the ground moves to your hand causing the sensation of warmth.</p>
<p>You were correct in the context of the question though. I just wanted to clarify.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No because the ground isn't absorbing &quot;heat&quot; it is absorbing radiation from the sun.</p>
<p>The air absorbs very little of this because it has relatively few molecules to get in the way.</p>
<p>Areas with a high albedo just send the radiation back out there.</p>
<p>The lower albedo areas absorb the energy and release it slowly, heating the air above it.</p></div>		</li>
