<p>Before this ruling, if a gay couple got married in a state, and then moved to a state that did not accept gay marriage, would their marriage have been nullified? How did that work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually exactly the situation that prompted one of the cases that this decision addressed. A same-sex couple got married in Maryland, but the Ohio government wasn't recognizing their marriage on official documents, so the couple brought a suit to address it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister and her wife got married in Massachusetts (I think) then came home to Ohio. They legally adopted a kid through an out-of-state agency that allowed same-sex couples to adopt. Their marriage was not recognized by Ohio and they had a host of problems with custody/guardianship and all sorts of things. Hopefully this puts all of that to bed once and for all.</p>
<p>Question: If a couple was married, then their state nullified those marriages (the issuing state, that is, not to say the state they reside in recognizes or doesn't recognize) does this ruling overturn those nullifications or will they need to go get a new license?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has not happened to anyone, so it's moot, but if it had, this would be a curious problem. I would assume you would need a new license, as is the case with bigamy if you get married before a divorce goes through (the second marriage is annulled and you have to do it again after the divorce).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I believe it was the P&amp;I part of the 14th Amendment, which declared that all states must recognize most of the constitution as inalienable. So while they could at the time ban gay marriage, they would be legally obligated to recognize married gays from another state.</p>
<p>The only exceptions to this are certain parts of the 2nd Amendment (Which mostly has been completely challenged) and the Right to a Grand Jury.</p>
<p>I think, it's been a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, the federal government would have recognized their marriage for most purposes (after U.S. v. Windsor came down in 2013), but some federal benefits still required the state of your residence to recognize your marriage. This complication is irrelevant now, but it caused some problems in the last couple years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was not clear at the time. Some thought that FF&amp;C should apply, but several states had laws on the books saying that they would not recognize same sex marriages in other states. (or so I thought).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.  There are some states that recognized the marriage and treated them like a married couple, but other's didn't.  Some states chose to treat it the same way that consealed weapons permits are often treated.  If state A issues me a consealed carry permit for my hand gun but state B does not allow consealed carry of firearms they don't have to honor my permit from state A.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. The Full Faith and Credit Clause applies to court judgments. A marriage is not a court judgment. On the other hand, a divorce or a child support order are court judgments, and thus the Full Faith and Credit Clause does apply.</p></div>		</li>
