<blockquote>
<p><strong>Other disproportionately male S&amp;E occupations include physical scientists (30% women) and computer and mathematical scientists (25% women).</strong> Within the physical sciences occupations, physicists and astronomers have the largest imbalance (18% women). Within the computer and mathematical sciences occupations, the largest component, computer, and information scientists, has the smallest proportion of women (23%). The mathematical scientists component is much closer to parity (46% women).</p>
<p><strong>In 2010, sex parity in S&amp;E occupations was close among life scientists (48% women). Within the life sciences occupations, biological and medical scientists, the largest component, had reached gender parity (52% women).</strong> The field of social sciences was majority female (58%). Occupations within the social sciences, however, varied with respect to the proportion of female workers. Thus, women accounted for slightly more than one-third of economists (37%) <strong>but more than two-thirds of psychologists (70%)</strong>. Psychologists, estimated at about 171,000 total workers in SESTAT (appendix table 3-13), was an example of a large S&amp;E occupation with substantially more women than men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of women in life science, other sciences not so much. But even within life science, there is still disparities in terms of promotions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just curious. Why is the difference in men and women in different professions bad? To an extent, doesn't it imply that women and men are naturally drawn to different jobs. I get that social stigma may keep women out of certain jobs and likewise for men. But how do you think we can separate unnatural reasons for gender disparity such as discrimination from natural ones that are inherent of the emotional or physical differences between genders. It seems that to get every profession to have a perfect 50/50 split, you would have to force men or women to do a job they didn't want. How do we know that a job that has say 70% women working in it (such as psychology) isn't due to the fact that women tend to be naturally drawn to jobs that involve more caring aspects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One question is how much of the difference is truly the person's choice in a vacuum versus how much society pushed them towards (or away from) certain things.</p>
<p>And having industries dominated by a gender certainly can make them undesirable for the opposite gender because they worry it'll work against them. Eg, I'm sure plenty of men are hesitant to get into nursing out of concern for being teased about it (eg, Scrubs did it) or otherwise looked down upon for joining a &quot;traditionally feminine field&quot;. That's despite the fact that nursing pays extremely well, often has good unions, and is in high demand.</p>
<p>And for the opposite way around, women might be concerned that an industry such as mining might have a lot of sexist ideas. Workplace sexual harassment is a very common issue for women and it's very reasonable to be concerned about it (and to expect it more from a male dominated industry). They might also be concerned that management might view them as less competent and thus less likely to promote them. Or that if they get promoted, those they oversee will not take them seriously.</p>
<p>And I should point out that for both of these examples, it doesn't really matter what actually happens, but rather what people expect to happen. So you could have a male dominated workplace that treats women great, but if women are afraid that they'll be treated poorly there, then they're probably more inclined to avoid it.</p>
<p>That kinda went on a tangent, but the point really is that people might not really be drawn to the work that they ultimately ended up in. They ended up their because society has made other fields seem undesirable. Maybe rationally or irrationally. The end result, however, is that people aren't necessarily working in the best matching field and their options can be severely limited.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why is 48% women considered close to, but not at, gender parity, while 52% women is considered having reached gender parity?</p></div>		</li>
