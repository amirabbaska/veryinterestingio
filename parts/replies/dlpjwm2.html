To your point, he's not making the highest quality with that method and setup, but I will say, wet-chemistry graphene is much dirtier and cruder than people would imagine. The standard method is to use Hummers' Method to make graphene oxide, a technique that has barely changed since the 1950s.</p>
<p>It uses a whole lot of sulfuric and phosphoric acids, along with potassium permanganate. You get an ugly brown liquid, which when you sonicate, gives you a lot of monolayer GO sheets, with a size distribution between about 100 nanometers up to a few micrometers in diameter.</p>
<p>You can reduce GO (producing rGO) to recover at least some of the graphene properties. Commonly done either by heating it in hydrogen gas (thermal reduction to make TRGO) or using hydrazine, acetic acid, etc. So, his stuff won't compare to CVD, but he could be producing stuff thats about as good as all the professional wet chem routes!</p></div>		</li>
