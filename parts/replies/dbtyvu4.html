			<div class="markdown"><p>Running a mile at a continuous pace of 4 seconds slower per 100m than a world class sprint is pretty amazing when you think about it like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is to some degree, however you have to consider that one second is the difference between being a fast highschooler and a world record holder (for the 100m).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love the people below trying to diminish this feat.  Yes, we realize that there is a tremendous difference between a Sub-10 100m and a 14 second 100m.  However, the difference with the mile WR is that 14 second 100m was repeated more than 16 times.</p>
<p>I wish there were some way to poll the population at large.  I doubt more than 10% could manage to run even a 28 second 200m.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4 seconds is a long time in the 100m.  If you lose to someone by 4 seconds in the 800m, it still wasn't a close race.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I can sprint 100m on its own in 15 seconds, 400m in 60 seconds and a mile in 5:30.</p>

<p>You can probably go mid 12s on the 100 if you take a flying start.  Which in the context of energy systems may be more relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By that same token, when I was in HS I ran track and played football. Was good for where I was but by no means a stud at either. Ran a 4.6 40 yard dash (hand timed so not the most accurate measurement) and my 400m time was just under 50 seconds. If you do the math, I essentially could maintain my top speed that entire race. Obviously it's a little off because the start is the slowest part of the race, but it's still weird to think about that.</p></div>		</li>
