<p>I honestly don't think you would have to give up your smartphone - <strong>had we kept profit margins constant.</strong>  I'm willing to bet that your two smartphones cost as much or less than one landline in 1950.  Same goes for all the other &quot;extra stuff&quot; you could possibly have.  I don't buy the stuff argument.</p>
<p>As to student loans, yes that is where your money and my money and all my friends' money is going...all those loans to get a job that seems to pay half of what jobs of the 1950s did (since we're working 80hr weeks now)...that's twisted.  But that could very well be college that's a significant destination of our extra work....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Profit margin for companies with competition isn't a willy-nilly thing. Margin is driven by things like interest, inflation, costs of new research, etc.</p>
<p>If my company could charge more, it would. We can't because our competition would undercut us. If my company could charge less than what it does it would because we'd gain more market share. We can't because we'd go bankrupt.</p>
<p>Quite honestly if you propose that we should raise wages, I can promise that businesses like the one I work for will raise their rates by exactly the amount that inflation and costs force us to. Margins will not go down or we'll starve to death. Margins will not go up or we'll wither on the vine. </p></div>		</li>

<p>cost of living 1950-2014 <a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/cost-of-living-2014-inflation-1950-vs-2014-data-housing-cars-college/" target="_blank">http://www.mybudget360.com/cost-of-living-2014-inflation-1950-vs-2014-data-housing-cars-college/</a></p>
<p>And right now the trend is to fool workers into lower wages with rhetoric, such as &quot;we have to stay strong on the market or we have to let people go&quot;</p>
<p>The main problem is that money = power, that means the more money you have/earn the more influance on policies you can have, and if you use that influance to reduce the cost of labor you earn even more, this is one of the main reasons why wages has not risen at the same rate as inflation. Another problem right now a lot of the workers in USA can not even afford to live with a tiny minimum wage, to such a degree that they have to live on wellfare as well, this will increase the taxes so the state can afford to pay the wellfare. This means companies can earn more and let the tax payers pay the rest, all in the interest of money and power. And they then use that money and power to influence politics in the direction they want so minimum wages doesnt go up, and that companies can get away with fucking over their workers.</p>
<p>Actually there has never been a better time economicly, before in the 60-70s it was an even spread between workers and the company, right now its around 95-100% to the company and fuck the workers.</p>
<p>Many think that this has anything at all to do with women entering the work force, this is false, When women entered into the work force they were given close to the same wage as men, so back then both you and your wife worked and you were very well off economicly. But with being very well off you didnt have to worry if you didnt get that raise you were hoping to get, and companies sized the moment and just didnt pay out almost any raises instead always using rhetoric such as &quot;we can not give you a raise right now, its a tough market and we have to compete&quot; So people sacrificed a part of their income to strengthen the company hoping that it would do well so they could give you that raise. Instead of going well the company went fantastic, shareholders where happy, the bosses where happy and the work force was treated like shit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think there's any fooling going on here.  If your competitor outsources to China or India you are under serious price competition to do the same.  Fact: Where something is made isn't a consideration for most consumers.  They buy the best value and that usually means the least expensive item.  The root cause isn't greed; it's the fact that global transportation is dirt cheap and someone else somewhere can do it cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure this is a point i agree on, but from where does the trend come, it comes from greed, &quot;lets lay off 2000 people, start a new place in india and rehire 2500 people at 1/5th of the cost.&quot;</p>
<p>The root cause is capitalism, always looking for a better way to earn money, in the noble goal of keeping your company strong so you can give people jobs, ive heard this in middle management at least 3000 times the last 10 years. We never hear about the 2000 workers being laid off they are a means to the end, we never hear about smaller companies forced to sell their product at less then produce cost because &quot;contracts and fuck inflation&quot; we never hear about the people the sacrificed 20 years in the company only being let go because &quot;effectivisation&quot; and now we rehire a guy that just finnished school that were willing to lie about his 2 year experience in the field to do guy 1s job to the letter.</p>
<p>You make a mistake in your argument as well, which is a huge one, that the buyer buys the product with the best price, and this is a mistake i see over and over again, first of all, tell me what the last toothpaste you bought cost exactly without looking at the recipt. You as a consumer are never going to notice a difference in a few % here and there. Most stores are cheap at a few products, those we tend to see commercials about, they sell them at below market value knowing that you dont want to go to another store buying the rest of your shit, so now you are buying potatoes, onions, shower gel, shaving products, cheese, meat, candy, socks at above market value. so their almost no profit from the toothpaste or grill or whatever it was you bought is far less then the extra money spent on other products.</p>
<p>Why do you think we get tons of commercials for &quot;buy at x 50% off here&quot; Its because they earn a lot of money just to get a consumer to their store.</p>
<p>Ofcourse us as consumers doesnt have a choice, because going from store a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h costs us a lot of time in the form of driving and finding a place to park, not to mention gas and time. Gas costs money so you often rationalize buying something at a higher cost so you dont have to spend the gas. sounds feasible sure, the problem is when you have done this for 3 products. And when you have already bought 50% of what you need most people thinks i cant deal with another store today ill just get everything i need here. All of this is perfectly well known by all stores more or less. Why do you think people buy candy at places that majorly sells gas, sure the gas might be at market value but we know that the candy or beer are far above market value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>have you looked at possibly working for the patent office as a patent officer. I have 2 friends who work for the patent office, and were making 80k fairly early in thier carrer. Both have moved up, one is being sent to law schol by the government to be come a patent layer .they had no law education going in, i dont remember what one of them specializes in, but the one going to law school on the governments dime an officer for A.I. and his original degree is in computer sciences.  there are offices in a couple of staes, not just DC area. After a couple of years it seems you can also work from pretty much any where remotely as one of them has been  living in Michigan (before the office was opened here) making east coast money.</p></div>		</li>
