			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  It's predatory. There are colleges who have programs that help these students once they're there, but those programs are few and far in between. </p>
<p>For the most part, kid ends up in debt and at a school they don't want to be at. </p>
<p>I'd also argue that public and charter schools (I've worked at both) are not adequately preparing students for collegiate studies. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup. Fellow teacher as well (public and private), and &quot;every student is able to succeed&quot; means it's your fault if you don't.  After a decade or so of this experience, students are conditioned to expect the highest of marks for minimal effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My master's program, the adviser literally was just putting me in the easy classes. I fought him on it, went behind his back. Eventually switched programs. I hated that program. My school was accepting all kinds of people who didn't meet the prerequisites. Which is fine, you can do conditional acceptance, have them meet the prereqs, and then let them into the other classes. But they weren't doing that. They were just letting them in. Professors were having to change their material and grading in order to not fail almost everyone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's their alternative? Operate at half capacity because not enough people meet their admissions qualifications? It's like when a business can't find anybody to work their most menial jobs so they decide to drop the requirements for a drug test. Gotta fill the position/ fill the class seats, one way or another. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That must be frustrating to see.  As the owner of two children I can tell you that if a teacher suggested that perhaps my kid should do another year of HS or do a trade school I'd burn their house down.  Just a lose/lose for you.  Sorry again on behalf of all overbearing parents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not even the parents' fault.  Teenagers fuck up, that's what they're developmentally designed to do.  The real problem is when a high schooler is lacking fundamental skills that no amount of retention can fix.  If an 11th grader can't read, there's not much that can be done, given time constraints from state testing. </p>
<p>If I had billions, I would pour all my money into elementary and pre-elementary education, as to make sure that every child has the fundamental skills needed to succeed later in life, even if not at the collegiate level.  Once kids lag behind in regards to basic math and reading skills by the time they're in middle school, then the uphill battle has already begun.  Sometimes kid make it out of it, but often times, and I HATE to say this, it can become a waste of resources and money. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep.....not to mention the attitude of &quot;everyone should go to college&quot; cheapens the value while increasing demand.</p>
<p>Plenty go to college unprepared and then flunk out having worst of both worlds. </p></div>		</li>
