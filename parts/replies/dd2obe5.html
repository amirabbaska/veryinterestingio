<p>This is a good comment, but I'm hopping on it to state that, unfortunately, the conclusions and description of Japanese are off a bit. The explanation of how kanji work in Japanese, and how they are used to write Japanese, is oversimplified. Kanji do not simply stand as chunks of pure meaning, nor do they have one set meaning. They are morphosyllabic characters, and are able to represent sounds and meanings simultaneously. </p>
<p>For instance, 火 does &quot;mean&quot; fire, yes, in most cases. However, in 火山 it is read as <em>ka</em>, whereas in 弱火 is it <em>bi</em> and in 火傷 the reading is actually specialized: the compound itself is <em>yakedo</em> but no parts of this reading are considered normal readings of each character (they do not appear in dictionaries that provide readings of individualized characters). Furthermore, in a word like 火曜日 <em>kayoobi</em> I guess it still means &quot;fire&quot;, but the word means Tuesday (like the Sun in Sunday means Sun, sure, but you would get odd looks stating that you are busy on the day of the sun/fire).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of reading, the ability to recognize the meaning of a kanji in Japanese will often allow little insight into your comprehension of a sentence, as multiple scripts are almost always used together. For instance, consider あたしはハンバーガーを食べたい. This sentence (I want to eat a hamburger) contains one kanji. It means &quot;eat&quot;, but you know nothing else about the sentence, including what is being eaten, if the verb 'eat' is positive, negative, or a desire, etc., if you can only read the 'meaning' of the kanji. </p>
<p>Finally, research on Japanese dyslexia has shown that kanji do present reading difficulties. For instance:</p>
<p><strong>Sato (2014) Do different orthographies share the same mechanisms of reading? A review of research on and models for Japanese acquired dyslexia</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Cognitive neuropsychological studies which used well-manipulated and well-controlled reading stimuli revealed that Japanese patients with acquired dyslexia display effects of the same psycholinguistic variables as those observed in English acquired dyslexic patients and in both Kanji and Kana. This suggests (i) that patterns of Japanese acquired dyslexia are script-nonspecific (i.e., script-independent) and (ii) that the manner in which brain disease/injury disrupts reading processes is probably the same across different orthographies (i.e., a universal basis for acquired dyslexia). Together, these two outcomes imply universal mechanisms underlying oral reading.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Fushimi Komori Ikeda Patterson Ijuin Tanabe (2003) Surface dyslexia in a Japanese patient with semantic dementia: evidence for similarity-based orthography-to-phonology translation</strong></p>
<p>Uncommon kanji readings or readings where the standard reading is changed through (de)vocalization were difficult for the dyslexic person studied, but the ability to read chains of kanji where no reading changes occurred were &quot;relatively preserved&quot;. &quot; One interpretation is that TI’s surface dyslexic reading reflects intact direct computation of phonology from orthography, but without the additional constraint from word meaning that is, in this framework, considered critical for correct pronunciation of lower-frequency words with atypical character-sound correspondences. Another interpretation is that TI’s performance reflects partially damaged lexical knowledge of whole-word orthography and phonology, coupled with spared sublexcal knowledge of character-sound correspondence rules. Whichever of these interpretations is preferred, this study offers the most detailed information yet available on the characteristics of surface dyslexia in Japanese&quot;.</p>
<p>TL:DR There are still difficulties, but it does seem that kanji prevent some issues with dyslexia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to post this. I was going to say something along the lines of kanji not being all that bad, but some hiragana or katakana characters look so similar! I have the hardest time differentiating &quot;ra&quot; (ら) &quot;sa&quot; (さ) and &quot;chi&quot; (ち) in hiragana, or &quot;so&quot; (ソ) and &quot;n&quot; (ン) in katakana. You don't even have to be dyslexic to mix those up! Especially if the handwriting isn't great. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, some Japanese handwriting is still illegible to me, even after decades of study. If you want any tricks for memorizing the kana let me know and I'll try to help, but in the cursive writing style especially it all just blurs together for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the clarification. I actually do speak passable Japanese, but I think I oversimplified it for the purposes of my comment. Thanks for the citations- they are super interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem. I come at this from the perspective of a linguist specializing in Japanese writing, rather than a someone who knows much about dyslexia, but I'd stumbled across some discussions of Japanese dyslexia before and thought I could flesh out a few areas in your comment. I was very interested in your post, and hope you found my comments useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm, diagnosed dyslexic here... I know you said &quot;80% of cases&quot;(edit: actually your other 20% part whilst I've heard of doesn't describe me, either), but this is not how dyslexia affects me and I have never had it explained like that, either.</p>
<p>I could spell fine as long as phonetic pronunciation was possible. Half my issue growing up was that people do not pronounce words properly and the other half that English (and I'm sure most languages) makes zero sense... The real problem for me was that I could not remember how to spell something. Some words remain a problem to this day and I only notice the ones even spell checkers are like, wtf I have no idea what you're talking about.</p>
<p>More characters in an alphabet would cause more problem, because it's more to remember. But symbols that stand for meaning instead of sounds might well negate that problem. My memory is the real problem, and thus why my difficulties are worse felt in mathematics where methodology is important.</p>
<p>I've been diagnosed 3 times for dyslexia. The way it's always been explained to me is that it, along with dyspraxia and dyscalculia, are defined by the difference between the learning difficulty and the individuals overall learning capacity. So, you can be better than average at reading, writing and spelling, but if you're a genius in other areas, that's still dyslexia.</p></div>		</li>
