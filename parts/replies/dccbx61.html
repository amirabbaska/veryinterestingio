			<div class="markdown"><p>i cannot believe they are going to go through  with this... it is so evident that trump lied about his qualifications and intentions to get this big job... now we are finding out he never intended to do anything for the american people ...and i just cannot believe we cannot nip this in the bud, legally.</p>
<p>the guy passed the interview and 'election' but now is stating and showing thathe doesnt intend to do what he said he would do...  when he shows up for his first day of work, no...before that,   we need to tell him that he did not pass the final test and he is not getting the job, and neither are any of his people.  we will do a redo of the balloting.. and we will see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It then goes to the Speaker of the House (Paul Ryan R-WI). If something happens to the speaker, it goes to the President Pro Tempore of the Senate (Orrin Hatch R-UT). It then goes through various cabinet heads. This assumes that the person in line of succession qualifies to be president. For example, Madeleine Albright, former Secretary of State under Bill Clinton, would be disqualified for being in the line of succession because she was originally <del>Polish</del> Czech. </p>
<p>EDIT: Albright is Czech, not Polish. Should have double Czeched the facts. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No. The list is 18 people. VP, leaders of both houses of Congress and 15 cabinet secretaries.</p>
<p>It's currently 17 people as one of the cabinet secretaries is ineligible to hold the Presidency.</p>
<p>After that the House could elect a new Speaker or if the house is completely wiped out the Senate could appoint a new Pro Tem but this isn't really detailed in the Constitution as a citywide attack just wasn't a realistic prospect when it was written.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, once you've run out of Cabinet members, you've run out of options.</p>
<p>I suppose Congress could elect a new Speaker or President pro tempore which would include any congressperson.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Meh. </p>
<p>It's a yes, no, maybe situation. </p>
<p>If a current President is facing criminal charges then they can resign their office and have their VP take over. The new President can now decide to issue a full pardon for any crimes committed by the former President. </p>
<p>Or the new President can decide to prosecute the former President for any crimes committed. This has never happened before and it would probably take clear cut treason to actually happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also consider the aftermath of the war against Iraq.  The actual intelligence agencies did not produce any &quot;proof&quot; that either Iraq was behind 9/11 (an obvious fabrication, even at the time) or that they had current WMD programs with plans to hit the US.  Recall, the WH had set up their own intelligence interpretation office on day 1 of the Bush Administration (Cheney in charge), and demanded the raw data from the real intelligence agencies.<br />
The result of this alternate data interpretation was that Iraq was behind 9/11 and a nuclear ICBM hitting the US was imminent, along with biological pathogen attacks.<br />
The Bush Administration took us to war.<br />
After the facts came out, President Bush was not held accountable because he acted on bad intelligence.  The intelligence agencies themselves weren't accountable because they legitimately had nothing to do with fabrication.  The folk that actually compiled the false intelligence weren't accountable, because they were just following orders to find connections between Iraq and 9/11.  That later changed to Iraq and WMDs.<br />
Neat and tidy, eh?</p></div>		</li>
