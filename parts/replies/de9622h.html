<p>The extra two cards should be something useful, like teaspoons to cups and/or the C# precedence chart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would require making a number of different printing plates &amp; keeping them all ordered.  These things don't come out of an inkjet printer, they come out of a machine designed to make thousands of copies of the exact same thing per hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would increase the complexity a great deal, plus these days people expect jokers in their pack of cards, and jokers are used in a huge number of the more casual card games as wildcards.  </p>
<p>so even if you now can cut the joker from your deck, you would just get a ton of complaints from people asking &quot;Where's the fucking joker, How am i supposed to play shithead without a joker?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
