			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7huc8l/the_last_time_atmospheric_co2_levels_were_this/dquaxey/" target="_blank">here</a> with a link that shows a rate of increase at 1.5 ppm per year between 1990 and 1999, and shows a concentration of 365 in 1998. If it's 408 in 2017 then that's an average of 2.15 ppm a year increase since 1998. That pegs us around 2037 to hit 450 if 2.15 even stayed constant and didn't increase further. Does this check out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no way we can reach zero emissions in just ~30 years.<br />
There is still no viable alternative to energy production, heating and transport.<br />
Solar is inefficient and only works during the day time - and days in most parts of the world (weather, short days, sun angle).<br />
Wind also needs windy plains to be worth it and huge parks to provide power for just a fraction of humanity.<br />
Wave generators need waves - and yet again power output is not enough.<br />
Geothermal is limited to few regions of the world.<br />
Battery tech for transport is still primitive, expensive, short lived and far from green.<br />
People are blindly afraid of going nuclear (molten salt reactors) - which would be zero emission/green energy.  </p>
<p>Animal farming will not vanish - not as long as there is good and affordable lab grown meat available. Vegan world is a utopia that will not happen (diff people, culture, environment not friendly for growing food, winters, genetic differences that affect taste etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Molten Salt Reactors do not exist beyond a few lab prototypes, they still require major technological and scientific advances, in particular in the materials for protecting the reactor vessels against corrosive salts. MSR's are far more uncertain as a technology than for instance electric cars, which are already commercially available, and cheaper amortized per mile than gasoline cars at high utilization. And both wind and solar, which in the right areas are already some of the cheapest forms of energy in the world. Not to mention traditional pressurized nuclear, which are a bit expensive, but will probably play a significant role.</p>
<p>Your whole commentary seems a bit off, why for instance do you say there's no alternative for heating, when in fact ground source heat pumps, and combined heat and power are available, widely used, and in fact often profitable. </p>
<p>You're right that 100% reduction looks unlikely, things like air travel will be very difficult to deal with, and wind/solar will require chemical fuel backup for the foreseeable future. But the targets are for an 80% reduction from 1990 to 2050, which is manageable. I know in the UK we haven't exactly done anything radical, and we're already 40% down from 1990.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not buying into vegan world either, at least not for a very long time. But I might buy that people could reduce consumption of beef and substitute, say, chicken. That reduces emissions, if not animal suffering.</p>
<p>Still isn't good enough to make much of a dent though</p></div>		</li>
