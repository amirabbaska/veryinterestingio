			<div class="markdown"><p>So I would counter that it's not.  My in-laws and spouse are Chinese, and we've also travelled in China.  There is good Chinese food in most large cities in the US.  Plus much of the lousy Chinese places have some traditional dishes, they are just either (1) mediocre versions of real Chinese dishes, or (2) breaded and fried and sweetened, like general tsos or orange chicken, to better suit our tastes.</p>
<p>In general, I would suggest you almost never should go to a buffet.  Chinese food should be eaten hot, not reheated.  Second, mostly avoid chains.  Some of them are mediocre to good, but it's hard to rise higher.  Finally, for the best food you have to ask around.  Even a previously great place may drop to just average when a chef leaves.  And these better places are usually in an Asian business area of town</p>
<p>Last, if it tastes good, who cares (notably, sometimes the US creations do make it back to China)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ordered a plate of Mapo tofu once at a P.F. Chang's, and received a plate of fried tofu with mildly sweet sauce and some broccoli.</p>
<p>To put it in terms of American cooking, that's like seeing &quot;loaded baked potato&quot; on a menu, ordering it, and receiving a plate of chili cheese fries. The fries might be perfectly good, but they are absolutely not what was described on the menu just because both dishes involve a potato. The waitress couldn't seem to understand that I wasn't saying there was a problem with how the dish tasted, just that it was entirely different from what it was supposed to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Living in British Columbia, Canada, I've noiced every restaurant(seriously every) across the whole provice has the same variation on the same deep fried food.   Most of the protein is deep fried in a fluffy breaded batter with lots of sugary sauces and Sweet and sour chicken(deep fried) Is more popular than general tso's. In fact i dont think i have ever seen it on any restaurants i have been to.  I was referring to how japanese food is more authentic, like you said how chinese food is altered for our taste. </p>
<p>Is there any foods that you recommend trying to duplicate or know of any good tutorials?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a person who has visited Japan and lived in the USA all my life....Japanese food is not even the same between both countries.  I mean, the closest is just some of the sushi and ramen.</p></div>		</li>
