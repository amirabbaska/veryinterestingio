<p>Great reply but it's probably worth pointing out that this embassy is fictitious.  The United States does not have a permanent diplomatic presence in DPRK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, true.</p>
<p>The UK does, though, which is what I was thinking of. And in return, North Korea has an embassy in London, which is <a href="https://pestisracok.hu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/%C3%89szak-Korea-londoni-nagyk%C3%B6vets%C3%A9ge-rt.com_.jpg" target="_blank">basically a nice house in an upmarket residential area</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being a spy is also not a black and white affair - part of the job of being a diplomat is keeping your ears and eyes open, and report developments to your home government. This could be during official negotiations, or something you overhear at a cocktail party. This, technically speaking, is a bit like spying.</p>
<p>But many embassies also have &quot;real&quot; spies (the CIA/KGB/MI6 types) on their official payroll, because real spies are subject to very nasty punishments when caught. On the other hand, this is officially frowned upon (because its abusing the trust relationship of diplomatic immunity), so these spies don't run a round killing people or whatnot. That would be overboard.</p>
<p>It's all a very suave and handshake deal and unwritten rule world.</p>
<p>Interesting thing about the ex apt in the UK that was killed is that he was part of a spy exchange (he was a UK double agent). There was always an unwritten rule in the cold war that exchanges spies are off-limits after the exchange - otherwise an exchange wouldn't really make sense. So it's a bit strange that Russia seems so have broken that long-standing rule.</p></div>		</li>
