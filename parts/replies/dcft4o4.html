			<div class="markdown"><p>just to expand a little further. Most books are printed on B1 sheets which are roughly 100 x 70 cm (most common in asia is 90x 64 cm, i think). When you fold this into A4, you get a 16 page signature. If you fold into A5, you get a 32page signature. </p>
<p>Generally when planning how to produce the book you'll combine some 16,8 and 4 page signatures. It also depends a little bit on the volume (how many books you want to print). </p>
<p>It is also possible to add a single sheet (2 page) into a book with a &quot;tipping collator&quot;, but this is usually quite expensive and normally only used in higher end magazines who want to be able to charge a lot for advertising on a thicker page in the middle of the magazine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To also add:</p>
<p>This is why in most magazines that are part color and part B&amp;W that the the pages with color all correspond with the opposite page. For example, the cover and the back will both be color. In a 100 page magazine maybe page 25 and 75 are both color, or 40 and 60. Why? Because they're on the same sheet when printed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To also also add:</p>
<p>Some books will have images or statistics that are printed across two pages. A lot of times this will affect how many blank pages are present, and where they are - as you have to make sure that these features aren't going to be printed on the front and back of a single page.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I always kinda assumed it was done in a two step process. First, something like a big fast printer to spit out all the pages of the book before starting over. And second, the binding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be completely wrong but I believe how it works is that the plates have been laser engraved with the text/images for the pages. When they put water over the plate the oil based ink will not stick to the plate except the bits that have been engraved because they are roughened and porous from the engraving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in other words the number of bound pages in a book has to be a multiple of 4.  If there are fewer required, some will be blank. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some circumstances of digital print, books can be produced to multiples of 2 pages. I'm working on a book at the moment that we will be producing this way. It's a whole lot less hassle, as we <em>used to</em> have to produce in multiples of 8 or even 16. </p>
<p>Usually, unless it's for specific design purposes (for example, don't print anything on the verso of the title or half title page), &quot;unnecessary&quot; pages go at the end of the book after all of its content.</p></div>		</li>
