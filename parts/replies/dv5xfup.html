<p>... You're aware that StarCraft: Remastered is a Blizzard product right? They didn't have to publish their source code to do it, cause it's theirs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really true. There's no way a company as large as Blizzard, making so many games, only has one or two master disks. I'd say they had at minimum 5, for multiple hard copies of the source code. Having only two means that disasters happen if it's not saved somewhere else and the disks are lost, broken, or stolen.</p>
<p>It'd just be terrible practice to let that happen, and Blizzard is better than that. They didn't actually &quot;lose&quot; the source code - they never lost it. They had other master disks, and likely had the code saved on multiple computers as well.</p>
<p>However, the point is to reclaim all of the master disks that may have been lost or stolen, and if I remember correctly, the one in the article was the last one they hadn't found. They reclaim the disks and do their best to avoid the leak of the source code in order to prevent leaks of their engines and coding, and to protect their intellectual property.</p>
<p>Starcraft Remastered didn't come out because Blizzard got the source code back. It came out because they wanted to release it. This is probably actually because of a recent spree where Starcraft was popular for a while again with the Afreeca tournament that was hosted. It featured the two legendary rivals Flash vs. Jaedong in the finals, which is honestly enough to get people who quit Starcraft back into playing it - it certainly was for me.</p></div>		</li>
