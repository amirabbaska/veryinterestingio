			<div class="markdown"><p>Lung capacity being the most important thing in a breath-hold is a myth :) It is not nearly as important as how quickly someone's body goes into oxygen-saving mode (mammalian dive response). Most of the oxygen in your body is stored in your blood, and on top of that, if you are breath-holding on FRC it's going to be very much the majority.</p>
<p>There are some competitive apnea divers in the world who can go further/longer diving on FRC than TLC because they have a stronger mammalian dive response on FRC. They start with half the oxygen in their lungs, but it is used more efficiently, so they do better overall.</p>
<p>Finally, carbon dioxide tolerance is not very important. It makes a breath-hold feel easier, and perhaps you can relax a little (er ok I'll be honest, a LOT) easier! :) But if someone has experience they can do close to the same performances with or without having good carbon dioxide tolerance (you lose it very quickly if you're not training regularly). It helps the psychological side but not really the physiological side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. TLC basically becomes your FRC when there isn't breathing activity. Although, your CO2 content pushes you to breath. It's the tolerance/threshold that stops you, for example, someone on heroin or narcotics would have a higher threshold and can thus tolerate more CO2. With that logic, I'd think someone week trained can tolerate not having to take a breath for a little longer than others. This by no means means that it's healthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does TLC become FRC when there isn't breathing activity? FRC is what you have on a passive exhale, ballpark 3-4L, and TLC is what you have on a full inhale, ballpark 6L. They're totally different things. In terms of CO2 tolerance, elite divers are hypoxia limited, CO2 doesn't come into play at all. If you're out of training it just means it feels rubbish :) </p>
<p>The health benefits from training breath-hold are well studied and considerable. Body gets better at utilising oxygen and tolerating low oxygen states, your cardiopulmonary system gets much more efficient, you also get increases in lung capacity (it seems to be about 100mL per year training in the sport, obviously that will taper off eventually). It's the same sort of thing that you get from altitude training or ischemic preconditioning.</p></div>		</li>
