			<div class="markdown"><p>While a lot of it makes sense to me, I'm in my second year of college as a Chem. Eng. major, and I don't understand half the descriptions. Many of them assume that people know what orbitals are and understand the wave-particle duality of electrons, along with tons of other things. Many of these answers seem to be ELI'm a chemistry undergrad...
OP's question should be answered with the assumption that he/she is in high school chemistry, issuance the deepest OP went into chemistry knowledge is the basic components of an atom.</p></div>		</li>
