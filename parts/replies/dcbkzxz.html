			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm one of those people you probably look at and assume I'm just doing it for show. Black coffee, neat scotch, semi sweet desserts, 00 dry red wines, traditional fermented sauerkraut and pickles are all favorites of mine.</p>
<p>A few anecdotes to add: I had severe allergies as a kid and wasn't exposed to sweets early on, and my parents still try to eat reasonably well. </p>
<p>I started drinking black coffee in high school. I don't like most medium roasts they're all to acidic. I love a nice dark roast. I taste woodiness and earthiness when I drink coffee. Adding sugar or Irish cream makes the sides of my tongue tingle like I'm about to eat salt and vinegar chips. </p>
<p>I also don't like sweets that aren't also savory or sour. I associate sweetness with things like BBQ sauce and fresh fruit, both of which are usually tangy. I'm not a fan of plain figs and other purely sweet fruits. </p>
<p>I think we can probably all force or tastes to change a certain amount, but I too am curious why I like what I do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't remember when or where it was on reddit, but a few weeks ago someone was discussing that the bitterness of beers and coffee being an &quot;acquired taste&quot; is scientific, and involves indoctrinating your brain into liking them</p></div>		</li>
