			<div class="markdown"><p>The media is not a market driven industry.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Cable television still exists largely because it is bundled with internet subscriptions.</li>
<li>Most newspapers don't turn a profit, they run off of funding by their mega-rich owners</li>
<li>Online media has discovered that a click is a click, and the best click-producing material is stuff that makes people angry, not the stuff that reports the facts accurately.</li>
</ul>
<p>The media is actually almost totally insulated, in many ways, from market effects.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is basically the only answer. Demand and overall production costs of SSD’s has shifted dramatically in the last five years. Within the last two alone the market for laptops has shifted so much that it’s now “harder” to find a machine with an HDD. More specifically that they’re intro/economy computers for low product value (and even then, smaller margin).</p>
<p>Basic supply and demand. More demand with higher supply, lower individual cost. Whereas before it was low demand, low supply, high cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't fully explain it though. The same fabs that produce RAM for your smart phones, computers and graphics cards also produce SSD memory. DDR 4 RAM has been obscenely high over the past 2 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RAM demand has been insane with IoT devices gobbling up the cheap stuff and the lack of manufactures popping up until this year. Then the AI demand has also been getting their hands on as much high end stuff as possible. With the race to automate cars, it's put massive pressure on the market on one end while IoT devices have put pressure on the other end. </p>
<p>It's starting to dip a bit with some cheap RAM hitting the market to alleviate the low end stuff. Same thing happened about 5 years ago when they underestimated global phone/tablet growth, then a bunch of new players came along and flooded the market. The prices collapsed and the big three RAM producers gobbled up the little guys. AI and IoT may change the cyclical nature of the RAM market a bit this cycle, but it will still go down eventually.</p></div>		</li>
