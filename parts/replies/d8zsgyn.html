			<p>Because saws spin their blades at thousands of RPMs, and the teeth help the blade bite into the material.  Ever try cutting a piece of wood with a non-serrated blade?  Try it, and then try cutting it with a serrated hacksaw and tell me how much easier it is with a serrated edge.  <br><br>The thing to bear in mind is that cutting different materials requires different blades.  Cutting a 2x4 is way different than precision slicing of human flesh.  A saw blade literally pulverizes the material and rips out material the width of the blade.  Far from ideal for cutting human flesh that the surgeon intends to heal without massive scarring.<br><br>An obsidian scalpel can slice flesh with an edge thickness that is measurable in angstroms, a unit of measurement used to describe the size of individual atoms.  A saw blade will be ~3mm thick, 1,000,000 times thicker than an obsidian scalpel at its thinnest point.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; A saw blade literally pulverizes the material and rips out material the width of the blade.<br><br>Only if it's <em>dull</em>. If you keep your saw teeth sharp, just as you would most other cutting implements, it will slice out and remove material, leaving a smooth, even cut. <br><br>The difference between a knife and a saw is that a knife makes one cut through whatever it is you're separating, while a saw makes hundreds or thousands of small cuts removing material. </p>		</li>

			<p>I think he was making the point that no matter how sharp your saw is, it will never cut as smoothly as a well-sharpened chisel or smoothing plane.

			<p>Saw teeth aren't sharp just on the tip, they're sharp on the sides too. Hence why, like I said previously, if your saw teeth are properly sharpened and in good condition, you get a smooth, even cut. <br><br>So no, they do <em>not</em> merely &quot;pulverize and rip it out&quot;. They do, in fact, <em>cut</em> it out.<br><br>The difference between a chisel or a plane vs a saw blade isn't about ripping or sharpness, it's in how they cut. A chisel or plane makes one long, slow cut, while a saw makes many small, rapid cuts. Additionally, one smooth cut in one direction by one blade will   naturally leave a smoother surface than many small cuts next to each other on the same surface. It's really nothing to do with &quot;ripping&quot;. It's has everything to do with one smooth even cut vs many small cuts. <br><br>Bottom line, if your saw is in fact &quot;pulverizing and ripping,&quot; then it's in bad shape and needs some work - just like a dull knife.<br><br>Source: I used to work in construction, and have used many types of saws on many kinds of wood, metal, and plastic.

			<p>&gt;point that serrated blades rip and knives cut.<br><br>This discussion was never about serrated blades. It was about <em>saws</em>, which, in most cases, are functionally quite different from serrated blades.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I understand the perspective you're coming from, and in many discussions, these distinctions wouldn't really matter. <br><br>But when the question is specifically about how a saw blade is less efficient than a knife, these distinctions <em>are</em> the answer. Ripping through something soft with a serrated blade <em>is</em> faster and more efficient than cutting through it with a knife, it just leaves surfaces less smooth and more damaged. <br><br>Saws serve a different purpose than knives. Whether you're talking about smooth knives or serrated knives, knives are designed for cutting through soft material. Saws on the other hand are designed for cutting through harder materials that knives often can't cut through at all, or at best, cut through very inefficiently. When one big cut doesn't work (knife), you use many small cuts to remove bits of material (saw) to eventually cut through.<br><br>I mean seriously, is it too much to ask people to do some basic research before trying to answer someone's question? Read up on saws in encyclopedias or other sources; you will find that saws do not have jagged blades and do not generally pulverize or rip when they are in proper working condition on their intended material. Spreading false information is not helpful when explaining how a saw is less efficient than a knife.</p>		</li>

			<p>This explanation is flawed and based on a misunderstanding of how both saws and serrated edges work. <br><br>A saw is not a jagged cutting edge, it is a series of individual teeth aligned along a straight or circular saw-plate. Each of these teeth has its own smooth, sharp cutting edge that is specially shaped depending on whether the saw is intended for cutting with or across the grain so it can cut out a smooth trench (called a kerf) to separate the parts being sawn; there's no &quot;pulverizing&quot; going on in a sawcut unless your saw is hopelessly dull.<br><br>Serrated knives are different from saws. They are straight cutting edges that are either wavy or jagged and they work by concentrating the force of the cut on the peaks of the serrations. </p>		</li>

			<p>Saws still cut. The difference is that a saw makes a scooping cut, removing material from the kerf of the cut; a knife makes a slicing cut, which tries to push the material out of the way. If the material is soft enough, the knife can move through the material easily. Imagine cutting Jello with a wedge; as the wedge moves through the Jello, the Jello moves out of the way. If you try to do the same thing with wood, the wood will resist being separated by the wedge, and the wedge will not move through the wood easily.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'd like to add an extra point that may not be totally clear.<br><br>On a knife, the cutting edge is the length of the blade. It has to be sharp the whole way, and it's used to slice through relatively soft materials.<br><br>On a saw blade, there is a cutting edge on each tooth (forgot how to link on mobile so, example: www.kregtool.com/files/Newsletters/KregPlus/Images/november12/set-blade-image-large.jpg), perpendicular to the cutting direction used to force its way through wood. The jaggedness is so the wood that's being removed has somewhere to go. <br><br>Then there's metal cutting tools which need very sharp edges forcing their way through material. </p>		</li>

			<p>Everyone is partially right, but missing one key point (unintentional pun):<br><br>Serrated blades can exert more force per cutting surface.  With a smooth blade, the force is spread out over the blade.  With a serrated blade, the force you apply is focused on the serrations that contact the workpiece (whether it's a piece of wood or a porterhouse steak).<br><br>Saws work in a similar way.  For most common hand saws, if you look closely you'll see it's like many knives with their points resting on the wood as you pull it across the surface.  Try this - take your pocket knife, attempt to cut into wood by sliding the blade across.  Now turn it up so that only the tip contacts and try to cut now - the pounds per square inch that you are applying to the wood is much much greater now.  This is also why saws designed for larger pieces of wood will have less teeth per inch.  Bandsaws for re-sawing large timbers may only have one tooth per inch or less.<br><br>This is simplistic as saws also remove material, and so the spacing of the teeth allow for material to collect in between then drop out as the saw moves out of the material.  However, when choosing a bandsaw blade, there are formulas for how many TPI (teeth per inch) to use based on your material type and width, and it all goes back to the pressure exerted on each tooth into the material.</p>		</li>

			<p>Think of a saw blade as not a single blade, but many hundreds of blades- one on each tooth.  Each of those tiny blades is smooth.  Why do you need teeth?  Because you cannot slice wood like bread.  Since wood is rigid, you need to make a slot so that the rest of the saw can pass through the cut.  Not only do you have teeth, but the teeth are bent a little bit to either side so that they make a slot slightly wider than the rest of the blade.  When you get halfway through the log, the  blade can still slide freely though the slot.  Now when you sharpen your saw, you have to sharpen each tooth!</p>		</li>

			<p>Threy are very much still jagged. It's just controlled jaggedness, and all of those sharp controlled teeth are designed to bite down into the wood and rip it out of there.  You could argue the little sawblade actually cuts the wood out in little pieces, but the only portion that gets cut would be the bottom side of each little wood chunk. The wood chunk is still ripped out of the left and right side of the board being cut. </p>		</li>

			<p>My guess is that the jaggedness of a saw blade maximizes friction to tear out minute particles of the material being sawed to separate the two pieces. Cut wood is always smaller than the original piece by the thickness of the blade. The part being removed creates sawdust. But that's not desirable for a surgical blade. </p>		</li>

			<p>The actual cutting blade is across the teeth. A saw is like a big safety razor; multiple blades in a row. This evens out the force applied to make it easier to cut tough objects. The blade is thinner (width wise) than a razor to make a more precise cut and lose less material. The shape of the blade, or whether it has an arced handle (and other designs), are to help with distributing the force across the row of teeth so you can make longer, smoother, more efficient cuts.</p>		</li>

Saws do still cut, but instead of cutting by pushing each side of the cut apart, as a knife does, the saw cuts tiny bits away with the teeth, removing material.

			<p>As I understand it, the break is how the edge is formed, but the properties of the material are what cause the edge to be so sharp.</p>		</li>

			<p>I remember hearing that obsidian pretty much has no crystal lattice structure (like how salt generally retains a cubic shape) and that helps to allow it to produce a very thin or sharp edge. </p>		</li>

			<p>Same reason you want a skyscraper to bend a little. If it doesn't then it breaks when force is applied laterally. With obsidian scalpels this would mean your surgical incision gets microscopically tiny, super sharp and durable splinters of obsidian all up in it.</p>		</li>
