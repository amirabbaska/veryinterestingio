<p>in a quiet place there is always some noise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have problems with noise sensitivity, and I've tried to explain this to people, and they don't understand. People will say to me, &quot;Just relax and enjoy the silence,&quot; and I'm like, &quot;What silence? Don't you hear that car driving by, or that dog barking in the distance, or that water running, or ...?&quot; There's basically never total silence.</p>
<p>For me what works best is having noise that I control drowning out the noise I can't control. If I have the TV on or a podcast I'm listening to or something, that allows me to focus on it and ignore the other noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is that <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/earths-quietest-place-will-drive-you-crazy-in-45-minutes-180948160/" target="_blank">one anechoic chamber</a> that is the most quiet place on earth and the longest anyone has been able to spend in there is 45 minutes. </p>
<p>I can imagine people with tinnitus would be freaking out in there. I wish I could sit there for like 5 minutes just to experience true silence.</p>
<p>Bet it's creepy as hell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everytime I am reminded of this place it makes me really want to sit in there for awhile. I have no idea how long I'd last, but I honestly would love to try and take a nap in it, assuming I could fall asleep if course. If nothing else, it'd be a really unique experience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can also imagine many people would realize they have some degree of tinnitus after spending a few minutes in there, which would of course ruin their lives from then on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sleep.with the TV on. I think it's a bit of an autistic trait. Struggling with no stimulation makes my brain just run into overdrive and I've no chance of falling asleep. Put some background noise on that I can concentrate on and I will easily drift into sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;even in the country&quot; thing reminds me of my mother. She grew up in a large city where there is constant noise around the clock. Even at 2 AM, there is light traffic, there are police sirens and car horns, there are factories nearby where the night shift is running heavy machinery, and there are people walking down the sidewalk talking, shouting, and just generally being noisy.  </p>
<p>When I was little, we moved to a tiny town in the country, and it was QUIET at night. The lawnmowers and the local feed mill started making noise at 7 AM, but after 5PM, things got quiet, and at night it was absolute silence. There may be two or three cars passing through at 2 AM, but there were no pedestrians, factories, sirens, etc.  </p>
<p>That was 40 years ago and to this day, the television in her house is always on, whether anyone is in the room or not.  </p>
<p>On an unrelated note, it was also pitch black in that town at night. Only certain streets had streetlights and unless the sky was clear, you couldn't see to the end of your backyard. In the city, there is darkness, but not like what you see in the country.</p></div>		</li>
