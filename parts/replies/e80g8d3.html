			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does the amount of cortisol and adrenaline released during stressors not form a feedback loop with its amount of decomposition afterwards? The body should learn the correct amount over time and stressful events, and adapt the dosage to correct and healthy levels.</p>
<p>Isn't this what happens with all other chemicals and their concentration levels in our body?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just speculation, but I would imagine it's because the exogenous source of emotional and psychological stress that caused the flight-or-fight response is very subjective from person to person. The body may have just evolved to assume that ANY emotional or psychological stressor warrants the release of cortisol and adrenaline to help with physical exertion, even if physical exertion isn't warranted. Back when these systems were evolving in our primitive ancestors, it may have been the case that physical exertion was the ONLY proper response to ensure survival of the organism. If it's better to be safe than sorry, it makes sense to put up your defenses and ask questions later. After all, the negative consequences of high levels of these hormones in your body are not of immediate concern, they are long term and chronic issues that won't be experienced until later in life.</p>
<p>Cortisol does rise and fall naturally throughout the day due to objective, endogenous factors within the body, and these systems are well maintained in a feedback loop. But when the input source that dictates emergency cortisol release is external to the body and also subjective, the body has no way to know how to dose properly since there is no objective way of measuring the input.</p>
<p>Also, if you were a footsoldier armed with a shield and there was a volley of arrows incoming to your location, you wouldn't lower your shield until after all the arrows landed. Otherwise you might get an arrow to the face or knee. Similarly, cortisol levels may remain high in the body until after your body receives some additional input acknowledging that you are now safe. Whether that's running away from your attacker, then calming down once you are OK or forcing yourself to calm down through meditation, which has been shown to reduce cortisol levels as well. But with our modern and daily stresses constantly bombarding us and making us feel unsafe at all times, maybe the body decided to keep the shields up all the time. Better to be safe than sorry, especially if the side effects aren't immediately dangerous. </p></div>		</li>
