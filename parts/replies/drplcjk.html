			<div class="markdown"><p>But is it possible for information to travel FTL somehow? If we think about Force as something that exists everywhere and whenever there's a &quot;disturbance in the force&quot; shouldn't the whole thing moves, instead of it acting like waves?<br />
Like imagine there's a very, very long, almost massless but unbreakable stick that stretches 1000 light years, I'm at one end and say, a guy called Luke is on the other end. I start moving the stick in morse codes. Will that count as information transfer? If so I could imagine the force act very much like it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stick would move much slower than the speed of light. Assuming the stick is made of matter and has mass the stick would not appear to move all at once. As you move one end of the stick the atoms would compress in kind of a spring like manner. Even though your side had moved Luke wouldn't see the stick move for a very, very long time (presumably in a galaxy far, far away.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now, how could the range of influence of a force have mass? It clearly doesn't. Changes in a field propagate at <em>c</em> because fields have no mass.</p>

<p>some of the (fundamental) interactions have massive carriers, like the weak force and residual strong force (not fundamental). </p>

<p>they also are said to have finite range (meaning they drop off exponentially, not that they are zero at finite distance). </p></div>		</li>

<p>How does this work with the whole idea of the unification of the fundamental forces at high energies? Would the resultant unifued force have a carrier particle or not? Would particles even exist at such high energies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photon is the carrier for EM. Graviton is the supposed carrier for gravity. I say supposed since we don't really know *how/if force carriers fit in for gravity; If you do, get your suit ready for Stockholm.</p>
<p>As it stands we're kinda lost in physics. We have the standard model which is great but it has a fair few problems and we aren't really sure where we need to be looking for new physics. There are a lot of parameters in the model which we put in by hand (masses, couplings, mixing phases etc.). Heck, we don't even know what kind of fermions the Neutrinos are!</p>
<p>Supersymmetry doesn't look all that promising now and the string theories aren't testable yet.</p>

<p>They do also, but those are massless. As I said above, <em>some</em> are massive.</p>
<p>Mind that carrier particles doesn't mean that these particles are shot back and forth between objects that are interacting with each other. It means these particles are quanta of the corresponding fields over which the objects interact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also heard c being referred to as the speed of causality, so any interaction of any kind cannot happen faster than c. I find that name to be much more descriptive than speed of light. </p></div>		</li>
