<p>Conscientiousness (ie, dedication, focus, hard-work) is right up there with it. And while people vary widely on that, and it is also heritable to a lesser degree</p>

<p>Are we sure that it's heritable to a lesser degree? Maybe it's just harder to measure. Measurement error will degrade our measurement of heredity. Not trying to be contrarian, just honestly not sure if that possibility has been ruled out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm recalling correctly, I got that table out of a book called &quot;Genome: The Autobiography of a Species&quot; (or a title along those lines.)</p>
<p>I don't have the book with me, so I can't look up the references to find where the Author got those numbers.  I recall that the twin studies, at least, came from Thomas Bouchard at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>I'd recommend the book though.  It's not particularly heavy on any sort of science or conclusions. It was just an enjoyable read I picked up about 10 years ago.  The author has a nice sense of humor, and he kind of goes around picking on an eclectic assortment of heritable things humans have, and how that gets tied back to genes.</p></div>		</li>
