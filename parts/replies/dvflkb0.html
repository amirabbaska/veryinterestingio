			<div class="markdown"><p>If I were to draw an Earthly parallel to what you're describing on/in Jupiter, the NASA GRACE mission that operated from 2003-2011 detected and imaged Earth's &quot;asymmetric&quot; gravitational field. Exact gravitational contours were suffiently detailed to detect under sea mountains and troughs that had never previously been charted. It was also able to document the loss of mass in the Greenland ice cap as it melted due to year to year gravitational changes. Similar to mapping the jetstreams on Jupiter, Grace also was able to detect the location of warm and cold ocean currents due to their decreased and increased water density. Lastly, Grace detected the depletion of water in aquafiers due to changes in the gravitational field. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational mapping is an incredible detection technique. I imagine we have way higher resolution/detection threshold with the Earth-oriented project you describe than with a single probe way out in the outer solar system. </p>
<p>But it’s been used elsewhere in the outer solar system than just Jupiter. Cassini famously measured a density change over the southern pole of Enceladus, which scientists have believe strongly supports the idea of there being a sub-surface ocean there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GRACE was so successful, that they basically copied the concept and sent it to the Moon as GRAIL in 2011. Its results are actually better in some ways than GRACE's, as it could get much lower (down to 11 km altitude towards the very end). This allowed it to map the gravity field of the Moon up to degree and order 1500 (I think JPL's even working on 1800). This is crazy accurate using just satellites. For the Earth GRACE provides the first few hundred, much of the higher degree terms are obtained from Earth-based measurements (geodetic GPS stations, etc). </p>
<p>As for Enceladus, some now believe that the sub-surface ocean isn't confined to just the South Pole (even though that's where you can see those &quot;tiger stripes&quot;), but is global, similar to Europa.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation! It's worth mentioning what is meant by &quot;symmetrical&quot; vs &quot;asymmetrical&quot; in case people are wondering. The gravity field of a rotating body is never symmetrical everywhere, because it flattens out around the middle. But usually for a gas body it's symmetrical at all longitudes for a given latitude, and the northern hemisphere gravity is symmetrical with the southern hemisphere gravity. Jupiter's gravity IS symmetrical at all longitudes for a given latitude, but NOT symmetrical north to south, for the reasons listed above. </p>
<p>I think it's also worth mentioning just how subtle this effect is. The asymmetrical part of Jupiter's gravity is ten million times weaker than the symmetrical part. Finally, it's interesting to note that Saturn, which is very similar to Jupiter in many ways, has a symmetrical gravity field. Scientists still don't fully understand why this is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In order to determine how deep the jets actually extend, Juno precisely measured the gravitational anomalies of the planet - if we can measure there are mass differences across latitudes down deep, that must mean there are jets down there, too. The point of the research here is that those mass differences (and thus the jets) extend about 4% of the way down. That lies somewhere in the middle of what most folks though about this debate: deeper than the shallow-jet folks though, but shallower than the deep-jet folks thought.</p>

<p>Does this research teach us anything new about how the upper layers of stars work or are they altogether different mechanisms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty different. Stars are much much hotter and the upper layers will be plasma instead of gas, so the physics are not really similar. Also there's just a ton more energy involved, so much about the structure of stars is related to to the flux of thermal energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Quite a bit more than just a ton. The Sun's luminosity is about 3.8·10^(26) W, equivalent to about 4.2 million tons of mass converted to energy each second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary opposing forces on a planet like Jupiter are gravity pulling the gas inward, and the electromagnetic force pushing molecules and atoms against each other outward.</p>
<p>In a star, the primary opposing forces are gravity pulling the plasma inward, and radiation pressure pushing outward. The fusion in the core of a star gives off enormous amounts of energy and radiation. This radiation pushes outward as photons of various wavelengths. When the photons encounter a nucleus (a plasma doesn't have atoms because each nucleus doesn't have associated electrons), it imparts some of its momentum, pushing in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The photon is the force-carrier particle for electromagnetism however, so in a way stars are also gravity versus the electromagnetic force. But the mechanisms are very different. It's mainly the Pauli Exclusion Principle at work when you stand on the ground, or atoms collide on Jupiter, but it's direct radiation pressure in a star.</p>
<p>It's actually kind of mind blowing. A star is basically constantly exploding outward, and gravity is constantly pulling inward. The star's size is determined by the exact point where these two forces are in balance, which is why a star gets larger when its energy output goes up for a given mass size (the red giant phase).</p>
<p>It's also why stars &quot;collapse&quot; when a supernova occurs. </p>
<p>You can think of a star kind of like a pressure cooker. The core is the part being &quot;cooked&quot; (fusion), and the outer layers are the part creating the pressure (gravity). Every element has a certain &quot;pressure&quot; in the cooker where it starts cooking.</p>
<p>Whenever a star runs out of, for instance, hydrogen in its core, the radiation pressure drops abruptly. Because there's less pressure opposing gravity, the star shrinks and the &quot;pressure setting&quot; for the core climbs. It continues to climb until it hits the &quot;pressure setting&quot; for the next available element. This restores radiation pressure, and a new balance is reached.</p>
<p>Every element until Iron will output a net energy balance (create radiation pressure) given the right pressure setting. If a star fuses stuff all the way till Iron though, when it starts to collapse, and the Iron starts to fuse from the pressure, this will actually <em>draw</em> energy from the surrounding area, even further reducing radiation pressure. This creates a feedback loop that results in the rapid collapse of the whole star. </p>
<p>Once radiation pressure is no longer there, the next barrier is called electron degeneracy pressure. This is just another form of the Pauli Exclusion Principle: that two electrons can't occupy the same place in the same way (electrons can occupy the same &quot;space&quot;, as much as they can have &quot;position&quot;, if they have different ways of occupying that space, such as spin). If there's enough mass, gravity is stronger than this force, and the electrons get absorbed into all the nuclei, turning the protons into neutrons.</p>
<p>The core continues to collapse until the neutrons are all touching each other. Neutrons also don't like sharing the same space with other neutrons, and push back. This is called neutron degeneracy pressure. If gravity isn't strong enough to break through this barrier, you get a neutron star. They're called that because they are literally nothing but solid neutrons. It's like an atomic nucleus that's as large as Manhattan and has no protons.</p>
<p>If gravity is stronger than this force, there's nothing left to stop it, and the core will collapse into a stellar blackhole.</p>
<p>So I went pretty... off topic, I suppose, and I'm not even sure this is stuff you didn't already know. But in answering about the mechanisms, I kinda got carried away.</p>
<p>TL;DR: The mechanisms in Jupiter are more like the force of your foot on the ground and the way hurricanes work, while the mechanisms in a star are more like a perpetual explosion that's fighting against the star itself.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>So while this is true for a planet like  Earth or even Neptune, this is largely <em>not</em> true for Jupiter. Most of Jupiter's mass is liquid metallic hydrogen, which <em>is</em> partially degenerate matter. Electron degeneracy pressure is very important there.</p></div>		</li>
