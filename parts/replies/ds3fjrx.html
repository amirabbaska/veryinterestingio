			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit more information on this, since people in the thread are bringing up other kinds of developed allergies in adolescence and adulthood:</p>
<p>OP is worried about a developed mango reaction. That by itself is not cause to worry about other developed allergies, due to the special nature of urushiol reactions. </p>
<p>It's possible to develop other allergies in adulthood, but it's fairly rare. When it does happen, it's almost always because your immune system is overreacting and on hyper-alert due to some other stimulus and goes overboard. It sees the substance as being too close to the current allergen and labels the substance an additional offender. This is what likely happened to people in the thread re: allergies that developed as a result of already existing hay fever or other pollen reactions. This <em>can</em> lead to reactions of other things that look (to your system) enough like the offending pollen - fruit that grows on similar trees and tree nuts. But this is fairly rare (though it super sucks when it happens). Most people with seasonal allergies will not suffer this.</p>
<p>If you have hay fever or the like and develop symptoms to foods, please go see an allergist. And if you have the tingly feeling in your mouth, don't keep eating the food before getting checked out - reactions will get greater over exposure! </p>
<p>But if you're only having a problem with mango, the cause is common, easily explained, and not by itself a reason to worry about developing further reactions. </p>
<p>The immune system and responses are complicated. In this thread, there are several types of reactions being discussed. They all will increase in severity due to exposure, but some (like mango and cockroach) have always caused an immune reaction - it's often just too minimal for us to notice and some people have greater genetic resistance. Others (like a developed apple allergy) have likely not always caused a reaction that's increased in severity. But they've started to cause one due to being confused with a current allergen offender.</p>
<p>How and why things get labeled allergen offenders is tricky business. You are at more risk of developing allergies if you grew up in a super sterile environment. (This is why people shouldn't disinfect everything and worry about kids putting things like pennies or dirt in their mouths.) And introducing foods that contain finely ground peanuts to children at six months can reduce chances of an allergy - though some children are naturally more at risk than others, and so people should check with their pediatrician.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to my girlfriend a couple years ago too, she loves avocado but then one day out of the blue she starts getting a really itchy throat and breaking out on her skin a bit. Got an allergy panel done and it avocado is what did it the most, she can't eat them at all because the doc said each time will probably give her increasingly bad reactions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure, since this unfortunately doesn't have the same easy explanation as the mango case. My best advice is to go see an allergist and get tested! (And avoid avocado.)</p>
<p>Are you sensitive to latex or birch pollen? Those known to have cross-reactivity with avocado (a similar protein with latex and cross-reactivity orally with pollen). Latex-fruit syndrome is also highly associated with bananas, kiwi, and chestnuts. But the only way to know what will happen is to see a specialist.</p>
<p>Good luck! I hope the allergist gives you good news.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always had mild seasonal allergies and asthma, then I developed an allergy to rice after going gluten-free because I thought I had Celiac Disease (turns out it's a wheat sensitivity). Rice was one of my favourite foods, too :(. I've also developed other foods intolerances. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome! One reason to watch out for reactions to cockroaches is that they're a major pest in big city apartment buildings. So if your apartment manager or superintendent is dragging their feet about getting rid of pests, this is a good thing to forcefully remind them of! Cockroaches are a health hazard - more than mice!</p></div>		</li>
