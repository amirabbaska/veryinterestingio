			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it works exactly the same the same way.</p>
<p>Let's take the binary number 10.10111, which is ~ e, and because I don't want to be here all day, lets just say that Ï€ = 3, which is 11 in binary. </p>
<p>11 x 10.10111 = </p>
<p>10 x 10.10111 + 1 x 10.10111 = </p>
<p>10 x 10 + 10 x 0.1 + 10 x 0.001 + 10 x 0.0001 + 10 x 0.00001 + 10.10111 =</p>
<p>10 + 10 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.001 + 0.001 + 0.0001 + 0.0001 + 0.00001 + 0.00001 + 10.10111 = </p>
<p>100 + 1 + 0.01 + 0.001 + 0.0001 + 10.10111 = </p>
<p>101.01110 + 10.10111 = 100.00101</p>
<p>I'm guessing that what your professor taught you is that there is a simple way to multiply with binary, as you might note from the two numbers above. Just as in base ten, if you take 10.10111 (in binary) and multiply it by 10 (also in binary!), you get 101.0111. Which is a nice property. Similarly, 10.10111*0.1 = 1.010111.</p></div>		</li>
