<p>It's not really well understood, but there are some <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/25/the-benefits-of-left-side-sleeping/?_r=0" target="_blank">theories</a> that left side sleeping is best. My GI doc recommends it if possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My allergist recommended it too, when I had acid reflux and was starting medicine that took a few days to kick in - left side sleeping and tums helped quite a bit. </p>
<p>Except I sometimes get heart palpitations when I lay on my left side, and that can make it really hard to fall asleep. Apparently laying on that side brings your heart a little closer to the chest wall and makes your heart beat more noticeable and more prominent. It's not very pleasant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered if there was a difference in the stomach being on the left side, so if laid down on your left the top right/up and not constantly have everything in there pushing up against it as it would if you laid on your right side. Maybe it's just a psychological thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh it's definitely  a physical thing too. I love sleeping on my right side and I'll try to take tums or something similar. Rarely helps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is science behind it! Because your stomach sits in the <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19574.jpg" target="_blank">left side</a> of your abdomen, laying on your left side (left lateral, or recovery position) causes gravity to pull the contents of your stomach away from the esophagus and reduce the feeling of reflux, reducing nausea. That's why if you have someone who's drunk and you're afraid might vomit/asphyxiate, you put them on their left side so that you reduce the chance of vomiting, and the vomit will not go back into their airway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother taught me this one. Every time I would complain about feeling nauseous, she would tell me to lay on my side, and it would help a lot. I never wondered the why or how. I just accepted it as a remedy.</p></div>		</li>
