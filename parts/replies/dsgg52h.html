			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you're correct. The crack is going to start on the outer surface (so in your image the surface at the top) and so only when that surface has groves will they have a significant impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I'm not sure. I actually think it varies. If I were breaking up a lot of chocolate (for baking or a serving bowl), I'd probably break it like that. If I were breaking a small piece off a large bar sitting on a counter or table (e.g. if I'm eating chocolate while gaming or watching TV) I'd probably put my index finger under the end of the bar and push down on the groove with my thumb. That way I could do it with one hand, but it would break the chocolate the other way.</p>
<p>And that's probably the most thought I've ever put into how I break chocolate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, his image is definitely correct, because breaking it that way is what puts the tensile force on the side with the grooves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose the real question is whether chocolate is prone to tensile or compressive failure.</p>
<p>If the chocolate bar was made of wood, you would want to compress the side without grooves... assuming I'm thinking about this correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting thought, however all of the work I've seen and applied over nearly 3 decades (I  know - an old Redditor - blame my high schoolers for this addiction) says failures happen in the tensile side, pretty much always.  You can do things with constraints and forcing a compressive failure, but that typically requires hundreds of times the force relative to a tensile failure, so it doesn't happen naturally, even at a small percentage of the time.</p>
<p>Wood is very interesting because it has fibers, which have their own properties themselves, and which change the properties of the bulk.  There are many plastics and ceramics that utilize fibers to change the failure path, and therefore energy needed, in novel and not so novel ways.  In this case, trying to mimic nature to a degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Delamination is the only reason why there is compression failures. It's actually shear within the layers of a composite that causes it to buckle. Buckling itself is a failure method by compression.
And wood is one of the most basic composites available.  I would define chocolate as isotropic, unless there are nuts in there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I follow. I'm still fairly early on in my education on this stuff.</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, the grooves aren't helping much because they're molded into the chocolate rather than scored into it after hardening, so it doesn't disrupt the crystal lattice as much. So if you really want perfect squares, use a knife.</p>
<p>However, that would mean that it is more important to focus the force the way you want it than it is to use the grooves as defects. I know it's a different shape of bar, but if you google &quot;how to break toblerone&quot; it shows the application of a force along the &quot;top&quot; that causes tension in the side away from the grooves. I'm suggesting that this could work on other bars too: if the top of the bar is in compression, it's already going to buckle where there's a hole and force a tensile failure directly opposite of the groove.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to [Toblerone] (<a href="http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/09/weve-been-eating-toblerone-all-wrong-5671265/" target="_blank">http://metro.co.uk/2016/02/09/weve-been-eating-toblerone-all-wrong-5671265/</a>), the best way to break apart the pieces on their chocolate bars is by pushing them together on the groove side. But they do have a very unusual shape, so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait what? Whenever I break tabs from using a CNC router I find it breaks so much cleaner when I compress the top, which in this case would be the one with the groove right? Otherwise I get tear out along the bottom face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I look at a lot of brittle fracture data. Ring on ring fracture tests require statistical measures to determine strength properties. A small scratch at the edge of the sample might cause failure at 100 times less stress. Even though it's outside of the stressed ring area. But that's why 50 to 100 samples are tested. The statistical confidence goes way up. Typically Weibul modulus is quoted after the strength. Which is a measurement of the spread of the strength data. The higher the Weibul modulus the more consistent  your material fails in brittle fracture. Consistent failure allows the engineers to trust the strength data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Love reading your material.  Ended up in pure mathematics after starting in Mechanical Engineering.  Had two friends as engineers, aeronautical and Metallurgy, who deemed me as near one of their own, and had many, many educational discussions throughout their lifetimes (also drank many beers with them).  I did a statistical analysis on manufacturing outcomes in a short stint once.  Never got metal completely out of my blood.</p></div>		</li>
