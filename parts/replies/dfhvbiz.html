			<div class="markdown"><p>Interventional vascular techniques are utilized a fair amount as well for acute bleeding (GI, Spleen,Liver, pelvic fractures etc)  not just for the uterus and definitely do not always cause tissue necrosis.  If you are not embolizing an end artery (spleen) you have a fair amount of collaterals or ability to develop collaterals and avoid tissue necrosis (this is why we can embolize gi bleeds and not kill people with inevitable bowel perforations) </p>
<p>Acutely unstable trauma bleeding patient is straight up OR- as my old trauma attending said time and again 'you cannot adequately resucitate a bleeding patient'. My experience is It's either to the OR for a laparotmy +/- thoracotomy if you need proximal control (cross clamp aorta) or to the IR sweet for angiography and embo which is usually dependent on the patients stability at presentation-unstable to the OR right away, stable patient goes to CT then decision is IR vs OR from there. </p>
<p>Fun fact- Venous injuries are significantly more terrifying than arterial injuries-arteries having a muscular wall have a higher likelihood of spasming and slowing the blood flow, not so much in the veins. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have the exact number on this, but the most common type of internal bleeding is a stomach/small intestine ulcer from overuse of NSAIDS, such as ibuprofen or Aleve. You add that to common use of blood thinners to prevent stoke, cardiac or other vascular complications, and you have tens of thousands of intestinal bleeds a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very common-but we would have to define what we consider &quot;internal&quot;.  I will go with bleeding in the peritoneal or retroperitoneal spaces and structures therein. </p>
<p>If we throw Gastrointestnal bleeding (bleeding from stomach, small bowel or colon) in then I would say by far  more common than  trauma.  Additional causes being ruptured aneurysms 'AAA', iliac, celiac, splenic etc. </p>
<p>Lots and lots of reasons for 'internal' bleeding outside of trauma and a whole lot of etiologies that can cause it from peptic ulcers to cancer to untreated hypertension/atherosclerosis with a whole lot of reasons in between. </p></div>		</li>
