</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion when somebody cannot spar, or cannot neutralize an opponent without serious/permanent injury then they are not skilled enough in comparison to their opponent. That might be great for a hypothetical &quot;my opponent is a murderer&quot; situation, or for soldiers. However, for the vast majority of situations groin attacks, gouging eyes, breaking arms, and other permanently debilitating attacks in terms of martial arts means the practitioner wasn't skilled enough to stop the attacker in a non-disabling manner. I saw an interview with Jackie Chan once and it went along the lines of, nobody wants to be physically hurt by an attacker, but it is also superior to be able to stop an attacker without severely hurting them because hurting somebody else can be emotionally painful. </p>
<p>This all being said, if somebody is ever trying to seriously hurt you, don't get hurt or killed because you are overconfident in martial ability; believing you can easily stop them. Defend yourself in any manner you legally and ethically can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the same time, knowing your own strength is part of actually being good at martial arts. If you deal with every problem as if you're fighting a fellow black belt and go all out, even if you're trying to teach a novice, you're going to go to jail for killing a kid.</p>
<p>Restraint is necessary on the part of the attacker. That's why you spar, not engage in death matches :P</p>
<p>If my sensei brought his A game when he sparred with me, I wouldn't be here to talk about it. SO for sparring purposes, stick to non-lethal things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. It's also why police are supposed to call for backup and assist immediately if somebody is likely to, or is currently resisting arrest. There's that video of an officer doing security detail at a high school and a student refuses to leave her seat, eventually a struggle ensues and the only way the MUCH larger officer can subdue her is by sheer force. Even with significant size disparity, things can get messy. A 120lb 5'5 person can still struggle and hurt themselves or the other 6'4 260lb person. However, with 2 officers or more, it is much easier to completely overcome the person so that they don't hurt themselves or the officers in the struggle. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Krav Maga was invented by the Jews in the 50's to beat up Palestinians, and is the martial art you learn when you want to feel superior to everyone else and still be bad at fighting. You'll learn how to knee someone in the head fifty times and poke their eyes out, but as soon as a wrestler double legs your ass you'll start complaining about how if you had a knife they'd be dead already and if you go to the ground in a street fight you automatically die because the floor is lava. The best strategy to beat a Krav Maga practitioner standing up is to punch them really hard in the face because they can't spar without instantly murdering anyone so most of them have no idea how to fight at all. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a lifelong martial artist, veteran of you dont' want to know how many tournaments,  who 7 years ago discovered MMA and BJJ as forms of actual full contact combat, that is by far and away the best description of krav maga i've ever heard.  Bravo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not that KM isn't infested with poseurs just as you described, can't argue with that. But the founders of KM don't deserve to have their names tarnished this way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bas Rutten seems to take Krav Maga seriously, and is a certified instructor in it IIRC. That to me means there has to be something legit there. Like any other martial art it's going to depend on the quality of the school and instructor though, I'm sure there are a ton of
shoddy McDojo style Krav schools out there not worth a minute of
anyone's time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same way there are a some legit badass karate guys.  I have no doubt that KM has a lot to offer in a self defense scenario, BUT,  KM has somehow, in the age of the internet and MMA, convinced the world of the same thing that karate did in the 1980's.  That they have this amazing ability but they just can't show you in case they kill you.</p></div>		</li>
