			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Grew up in a Russian household. March 8th in our house, though, was more of a day where we got to do whatever the hell we want, and the dudes can't bother us.</p>
<p>Every other day of the year, though, I was reminded about how a woman is in charge of the household and &quot;what kind of man is gonna want to marry you if you can't cook/clean/make babies???‚Äù or &quot;Going to school isn't gonna get you married faster.&quot; or even better &quot;Don't be a smart ass aroumd guys, they don't like it.&quot;</p>
<p>Lol, I ran away from home and now live in a pretty progressive city. Never been better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's not because of the wars. it is about the origins of the day as a reminder of women workers' struggle. It was a part of socialist struggle at the beginning of 20th century.</p></div>		</li>
