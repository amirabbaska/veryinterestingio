			<div class="markdown"><p>Had eaten dinner with a friend downtown and we got a to go box and went out to walk around downtown. I noticed a homeless man walking around the city square, shyly looking into each trash can as he walked by. I stopped and watched him do this about three more times.</p>
<p>I told my friend to wait a second and walked over to the man and asked if he was hungry and he said yes, so I gave him the box of food and went on my way. I felt happy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good move. :) I realized a while back that I never eat leftovers (I forget they're in the fridge), but at about the same time I realized a lot of homeless people do eat leftovers heh. So, I always take food to go and either give it to someone directly or, if I don't pass anyone, I leave it on or next a trashcan. No tickets for littering yet!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to live in a mountainous area with harsh winters. A homeless guy I used to smoke with said he loved winter because food thrown away in outside garbage cans would stay good for hours and still taste really great once he heated it up over a fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly? Because I was too tweaked out to think properly. Also I wouldn't have had enough time to wait for the boiling hot hose water to flush out to be drinkable. They may have even let me have a glass of water, if I wasn't a meth head too tweaked to handle speaking to people. Meth makes ya think funny. </p>
<p>Edit: also the delerium that comes with hunger/thirst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Phoenix. I always carry a gallon or more of water when driving in the summertime. If someone's car stops on the freeway in the middle of a 118 degree day, it's basically a medical emergency. With no A/C and direct sunlight, heat stroke can set in quickly. Especially if you're not from AZ and aren't prepared for the weather. So yeah, we take it pretty seriously. If I see someone pulled over in the summer I'm going to stop and help. Their lives could depend on it! </p></div>		</li>
