			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any interesting insights into the whole-system effects of traffic circles?</p>
<p>Edit: your post and the linked image inspired me to draw <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Green_wave_one_way_only.svg" target="_blank">this diagram</a> for use in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light_control_and_coordination" target="_blank">this article</a>. Feel free to suggest improvements or corrections. For simplicity, I avoided showing the spillover effect of traffic having to wait for the second light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In North America, roundabouts are still relatively new, so the HCM process for roundabouts is still not that good (not a lot of data collected). Since roundabouts don't usually have signals, you don't need to consider them when coordinating signals except as a source of delay (so if you drew the time-space diagram in your example, maybe the slope would change a little as vehicles pass through it. The problem with this is that in a normal signal-only network, traffic bunches up into &quot;platoons&quot; due to the signals. This doesn't happen in roundabouts, so it can interfere with signal coordination (or render them moot) if there are a lot of them. From a safety standpoint, roundabouts are usually better than signals as you can not longer have left-turn-opposing conflicts, so t-bone type accidents are virtually eliminated. This are more deadly than side-swipes, which are more common in roundabouts.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest concern with roundabouts in cities is pedestrian and cyclist safety. If there's no traffic light, then pedestrians have to look for gaps to cross the roundabout, and so poor design can actually make it pretty dangerous. </p>
<p>It's a pretty clear figure for a simple illustration, probably better in some ways that the original. These diagrams are are type of time-space diagram, and so the slope of the greenwave corresponds to the speed limit.  Naturally, if you drive at a different (faster) speed, you may find a &quot;hidden&quot; greenband. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, despite what people are writing here, cities will never time signals to make vehicles stop more (but signals may be timed so that the &quot;greenband&quot; is widest at a certain speed). This is just counter productive in every sense. Signals may be timed poorly (poor data, poor methods), or for some other reason. In Canada and the US signals are usually timed with computer software, such as <a href="http://www.trafficware.com/synchro-studio.html" target="_blank">Synchro</a> which uses equations specified in the <a href="http://hcm.trb.org/?qr=1" target="_blank">Highway Capacity Manual</a>, which is a publication put out by researchers funded by the US government that contains a bunch of equations and factors used to calculate things like green time, red time, yellow time, and &quot;offset&quot; (delay of the start of the next green).</p>
<p>Congestion can also break down traffic signal timings, as many signals are just statically timed based on some representative values. Lately, the &quot;trendy&quot; thing to do in municipalities is to give priority to transit vehicles at signals (&quot;Transit Signal Priority&quot;) by tracking transit vehicle locations and extending the green time to allow busses through a signal about to change to red or cutting a conflicting signal short to show green to a waiting bus. This type of operation obviously increases delay for other motorists. <strong>At the end of the day, if you've got green, someone else has get red.</strong> You shouldn't expect to see green all the time as you drive, and in a network with traffic flows that are equal on every road, you can expect to stop a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personal anecdote, but there's a road that basically follows the beach near where I live.  If you travel down it at around 30-33 MPH, you will hit every green and it's very smooth.  However, if you go faster than that, you'll hit the red lights. </p>
<p>I always thought this was to encourage slower traffic, since a lot of people run across the street to get to the beach.  Sorta like an advanced speed bump system.  </p>
<p>Anyways, I just set my cruise control to 33 and it's great, since it's like a 5 mile stretch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably the true. Signals are usually optimized for the &quot;speed limit&quot;. In the city I live (Toronto) they lowered the speed limit from 50 to 40 on a major one-way road (Richmond St), and they added a note below the signs saying &quot;Signals timed for 40kph&quot; to discourage speeding.</p></div>		</li>
