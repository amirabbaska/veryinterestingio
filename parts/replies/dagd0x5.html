			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand how the assumption that no algorithm exists is made. As far as I understand it's just incalculable; in order to solve M you must solve M. I imagine it more like an infinite loop rather than proof M cannot exist. Plz help </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to prove a negative statement (e.g. &quot;there is no algorithm that always tells us whether any given mathematical statement is true or not&quot;) we usually start by assuming the opposite (i.e. &quot;there is an algorithm&quot;) and show that this assumption leads to a contradiction (i.e. &quot;the statement is both true and false&quot;).</p>
<p>As an example of this reasoning, suppose we want to prove &quot;not all birds can fly&quot;.  We start by assuming that all birds can fly.  An emu is a bird.  Therefore, our assumption says an emu can fly.  But an emu cannot fly - a contradiction.  Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that the opposite is true: not all birds can fly.</p>
<p>So in the argument that the algorithm does not exist, we do not <em>assume</em> that <strong>no</strong> algorithm exists.  We assume that <strong>some</strong> algorithm exists (which we refer to as M) and prove a contradiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The halting problem is how Turing solved the problem.  For that, we suppose we have an algorithm for the &quot;simpler&quot; problem of determining whether a Turing machine eventually halts or runs forever.  From such a machine, we can construct another machine that will halt exactly if the original machine says it won't.</p></div>		</li>
