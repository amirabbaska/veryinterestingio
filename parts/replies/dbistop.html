			<div class="markdown"><p><del>The main difference that I understand is that running and other primarily cardiovascular forms of exercise are &quot;isotonic&quot;- the pressure in the muscle is kept constant by changing the length of the muscle, they're dynamic, i.e. you move!

<p>Dynamic exercise is associated with the changes I outlined above. Static exercise increases both systolic <em>and</em> diastolic pressure. As a result, there is evidence that this increases the chance of causing the heart to &quot;bulk up&quot; to try to pump harder against that raised blood pressure. This bulking, or hypertrophy, of the heart is unfortunately not as beneficial as hypertrophy of regular skeletal muscle and can lead to obstruction of the outlet it needs to pump out through or lead to electrical rhythm problems.</p>
<p>Most static exercise also doesn't increase the heart rate as much as dynamic exercise, and that heart rate increase is responsible for some of the benefits.</p>
<p>I'm not totally up to date on this, though, and I know there are many studies showing other benefits of static exercises like weight-lifting, including improved bone health, improved oxygen delivery to muscles, improved fat:lean mass ratio which has knock-on hormonal benefits, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This part is incorrect.  </p>
<p>Firstly, primarily cardiovascular forms of exercise vary in the contraction required.  For instance, running has a large eccentric component to the contraction, while cycling and swimming are almost entirely concentric.  I had a quick look and can't find any papers saying that cycling or running is isotonic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, weightlifting is almost entirely dynamic contractions.  Randomers in gyms do dynamic exercises with free weights and machines.  Out of competitive weight lifters, only strongmen do isometrics in competition (most of their competition is dynamic contractions though).  And bodybuilders (who don't lift in competition) mainly train with dynamic contractions.  </p>

<p>I have no medical background, but I know that <a href="http://www.luzimarteixeira.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/pressao-arterial-e-exercicio-resistido.pdf" target="_blank">systolic and diastolic pressure increase during weightlifting</a>, as does interabdominal pressure.  It's not that it's isometric, but that it's heavy.  So based on your comments, I'm starting to think that this is the big difference between the effects of weightlifting and cardio on the heart (I asked you a question about that before seeing this, so apologies for the double comment).  </p>
<p>For a long time I've been wondering why weightlifting sees general improvements in some cardiovascular health markers (the only one I can remember is VO2 max typically goes up if people weight train, but there are others), but it also decreases arterial/ventricular compliance and increases pulse pressure (unless accompanied with cardio).  I should do some more reading, but I think you've made sense of it.  Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that if you take caffeine before exercising that it's worse since caffeine can be a vasoconstrictor? Or does it not have a large enough affect to matter </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. I've never thought about this, so I'm going off some very brief reading of Google Scholar.</p>
<p>Interestingly, caffeine is performance-enhancing in running/cycling, and I presume most dynamic exercises. That doesn't necessarily mean it's good for health of course.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002914990914359" target="_blank">this small placebo-controlled RCT says you're right</a>: caffeine does increase BP during exercise. But, I haven't been able to find any studies saying whether this is harmful. There have been huge population-based studies suggesting there are some benefits of caffeine to heart health. We should always be suspicious of those kinds of observational studies (maybe heart healthy people are more likely to be coffee drinkers?) but I think there may be some causal link there, I just don't know the mechanism. Does this offset the raised BP during exercise? I don't know.</p>
<p>I was going to say that I assume it also depends if you're a regular caffeine-taker or not, because as we all know, drinking coffee regularly means you withdraw if you don't, and having a big coffee out of the blue makes you feel like you've taken speed. <a href="http://www.recoveryonpurpose.com/upload/Caffeine%20and%20Exercise.pdf" target="_blank">This review from 2001 says I may be wrong</a> as the effects they were looking for (mainly performance enhancement) were the same in both groups. They didn't really look at cardiovascular effects, though, and I haven't read it in enough detail to know if it's a decent study anyway.</p>
<p>In summary: I have no idea. Would love someone else to answer this question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered about metabolic effort that is not exercise, i.e. is significant exposure to cold equivalent to exercise?</p>
<p>There feels like there is a definite difference in cardiovascular load between floating in a warm pool or floating in our icy cold lake in spring. Just floating there, not even swimming, my heart rate and breathing are significantly elevated.</p>
<p>The same goes with being out in the winter in sub -20C temperatures. I am breathing harder and it feels like my VO2max is impacted, as I feel that I'm doing serious exertion while doing work that would not be exhausting in warmer weather (i.e. rolling out hay bales)</p>
<p>Being out in the cold will work up a significant hunger in me as well, as if I had been out on a hike for the length of time spent in the cold. It certainly feels like exercise, but does it carry any of the benefits? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also wonder the same thing. Mainly because I'm cheap and my house is always cold, so I like to think I'm doing myself a favour, 'cause this totally counts as exercise, right? And that means I earned biscuits with my tea.</p>
<p>Mostly the answer is no, sadly. Being in a cold environment in and of itself <em>does</em> increase your calorie expenditure, so you're OK eating a bit more (but not much), but it doesn't have the extensive hormonal and autonomic (sympathetic/parasympathetic) effects of cardiovascular exercise. The higher perceived effort at very cold temperatures is probably to do with very low humidity, so your airways are drying out, and I'm not sure what else. In general, cardiovascular responses under heat stress are what is studied, so I'm a bit clueless there I'm afraid. There is a distinct physiologic response to sudden exposure to a very cold environment, particularly cold water: generally heart rate goes down and (more variable) breathing rate goes up. That's the diving reflex and is a whole other kettle of fish that I won't get into right now as I'm about to get to bed. </p></div>		</li>
