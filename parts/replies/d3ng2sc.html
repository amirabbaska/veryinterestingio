			<div class="markdown"><p>So many people died constructing the Empire State Building that modern technology would have saved.  This picture would be in no way at all ever be allowed.  OSHA would go berserk.   <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ij6SY3F.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/ij6SY3F.jpg</a>   </p>
<p>Edit: this picture is not from the Empire State Building.  It's from the RCA building, but it's from the same time period.  The argument is that construction from modern day buildings vs construction pre-ww2 are completely different due to safety standards among other things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Official records state only five workers were killed, so I wouldn't say &quot;so many people died&quot; but still, 5 is too much.</p>
<p>One was hit by a truck, another fell down an elevator shaft, one was blown up by explosives, one was hit by a hoist and the last one fell from scaffolding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but &quot;official&quot; records say a lot of things. From what I was told in my OSHA classes, that number is 5 because that was the number of sanctioned or documented workers killed. The undocumented workers weren't counted towards the total and the actual number is somewhere in the high hundreds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's odd, but each time I have to sit down for a H&amp;S meeting within Construction, that picture is always either shown or mentioned.</p>
<p>So, they are still going berserk over it, even in other countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this, and I'll also add who whole lot more  bureaucracy.  You need permits  for just about everything you can imagine in NYS, dealing with unions, endless inspections, and the usual delays that go along with all this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this top comment is completely wrong. Our modern building construction isn't that much harder. It could have easily been done in a year. The real reason is beuerocracy. NYC had a lot of hands in that pie as well as rotating politicians constantly changing things and doing favors. </p>
<p>If they really wanted to, a building could have been there by 2003. </p></div>		</li>
