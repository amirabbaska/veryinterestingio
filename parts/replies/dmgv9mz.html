<p>This article deals with the effects of sleep deprivation (thus the average being higher than optimal, and giving a partial mechanistic explanation for decreased efficiency of information processing when tired). Google searches with keywords such as sleep, plasticity, and homeostasis pull up a number of papers if you want to investigate further. I believe the original paper I read was in Frontier, but I can't find it from just a precursory search.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The paper you linked does not support your claim that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we oversleep, we cause this average to dip too far below the optimal window, and we can't process information as efficiently until we raise it back to optimal levels by being awake for a while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have never heard of this happening. Do you have a source that shows this? In the paper you linked they are only looking at sleep deprivation compared to the control group of normal sleep without an 'oversleeping' group.</p></div>		</li>
