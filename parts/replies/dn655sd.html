<p>And they just end up pissing everyone off in the process.  Where I am, they start blasting Christmas music the day after Halloween, and play it until the middle of January.   I'm all for getting in the spirit, but it does get aggravating after a while... Especially when it's shoved down our throats for nearly 3 straight months.  I can live with it for 2, maybe 3 weeks, but any more than that, I just get fed up and turn it all off.</p></div>		</li>
