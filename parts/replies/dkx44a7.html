			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a University student here dealing with hours of Accounting coursework. I found that while reading a chapter, I better understand the concepts if I were required to tutor or teach a class the next day. Finishing a chapter off with a condensed 1-page summary of all the key points really helps connect all the dots and allows for mnemonics and diagrams to be made. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry man, all I did was math and programming, and neurology/cognitive science courses. It is not likely that you will be able to recall anything after 2-5 pages of formulas and definitions thrown at you. Now, multiply that by N times where N equals the number of courses you take in a semester.</p>
<p>What helps is not reading at all, then going straight to questions/problems, and answering them not by flipping to a solutions page but searching the answer from the pages you did not read. That won't work if you don't listen/attend your classes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm working towards a Masters Degree in Electronic Engineering; I feel your pain regarding formulas and definitions. I agree with your suggestion of going straight to the problems and searching for a solution! As for formulas and definitions, I tend to try and memorize (using the 3R's principle) the derivation of these formulas and concepts to build my mental &quot;chunks&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on where I am! If I'm on the bus/train - summary in my head. If I'm in a quiet place but with paper to hand - summary on some scrap paper. If I'm home alone - I'd give a verbal summary as if I were lecturing to a class!</p></div>		</li>
