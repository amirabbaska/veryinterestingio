			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. Specificity and sensitivity are both specified because they're both important. Nothing has a 0% false negative rate or a 0% false positive rate, and we use many tests that have higher levels of both and often do a follow-up test to confirm</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's a statement of a naive test creator who doesn't handle reality. You take what tools you can get and understand their capabilities during application to get good results. Even shoddy tests can be enlightening</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's making a big assumption though. Say if you have some blood marker B in your blood it means there is a 25% chance you have cancer, but if you don't have it you definitely don't have cancer. You would get the same results every time but still have 75% false positive </p></div>		</li>
