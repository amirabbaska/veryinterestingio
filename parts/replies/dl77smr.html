<p>create thousands of accounts and leave them dormant for months. </p>

<p>Mmmm. I can hear people proposing some sort of dormant-account-banning already.   </p>
<p>From a geek, lemme tell you that simply won't work. It's trivial to make a script that makes low effort comments now and then to make it look like it's not dormant.    Generic filler like &quot;OMG, this is so me&quot;.   I'm pretty sure there are people working on a tool that automatically karma-farms. Reposts, agreeing with political stances, regurgitating news reports. Hell, people upvote the obvious bots when they're useful.   </p>
<p>Spot the bot is a hard game of cat and mouse. And we're going to lose that game when only one side is paid for it.  With better AI coming to the masses, it'll only get worse.</p>
<p>Web of trust solutions make for a massive echo chamber.  Which is probably fine for a subreddit sort of thing.</p>
<p>Moderation makes for tiny tinpot tyrants. Could you imagine some of these people being told to play spot the bot and ban anyone they thought wasn't human?  &quot;He repeated a talking point, obviously a bot, banned.&quot;</p>
<p>And any sort of.... Trustworthiness score, like if your upvotes only counted for a fraction based off of your own karma, or if you had to keep your account in &quot;good standing&quot;... Man, that sounds fascist as hell. MeowMeowBeans levels of fascism.</p>
<p>Still, despite their flaws, I think we should try all these ideas. In limited scope, like Reddit moderation right now. Or as experimental trial runs. Let's see what works.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is accounts that don't post are perfectly legitimate in a lot of cases. Some people don't like to post and comment, and don't like the default subs. Lots of people use their reddit account for nothing other than subscribing and unsubscribing so their front page isn't cluttered with things they don't want to see. I originally made this account for no reason other than to get obnoxious spam from /r/Atheism off my front page. I don't know what the solution is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. IIRC, lots of people also created accounts just to unsubscribe from /r/News during the Orlando Shooting scandal, where the mods instantly censored all the posts about it when they found out the shooter was Muslim. Just totally wiped every mention of the shooting from the sub - People were hearing about it on Facebook first, because /r/News refused to allow it. Eventually, /r/AskReddit mods made a sticky so it couldn't be hidden from default sub users anymore. I remember looking at /r/News' sub count, and every time you refreshed the page they had lost another couple thousand subs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true too. Perhaps one day there will be algorithms that can predict certain behavior with accuracy, then we could use them to clean reddit up a bit. Just a thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I followed Digg. They got new owners who changed the entire site from being much like Reddit, with users submitting posts and queries, with upvotes, to being just a collection of news and articles. I really liked the early Digg, but the crappy new Digg forced me to join The Great Digg Migration to Reddit.</p></div>		</li>

Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
