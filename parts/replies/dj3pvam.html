<p>Another example is how consoles frequently beat a PC with exactly identical specs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this day I don't think this ever happened, mostly because the consoles have always at least one component designed specifically for them, thus making the statement impossible to confirm or deny.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thats why I made sure to emphasis the crap out of it, this generation is the closest example. But it still remains true that to get the same quality on a PC takes slightly more power than a console, even if its in a hypothetical environment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>so you can just hard code an adjustment for it rather than fixing it which may well be harder.</p>

<p>Yes, custom devs can just ditch out all the unnecessary stuff because they know that the device(s) they are aiming for does not need it. Also   costum ROMs / roots allow for a precise control over memory (heap sizes, swap frequency, processors load, cancel conditions like 'low memory state', etc)</p></div>		</li>
