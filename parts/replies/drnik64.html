			<div class="markdown"><p>Laying out a graph in 2d with ‘boxes’ is NP-hard (there’s a more formal version that Knuth proved is NP-complete that relates to laying out pictures in latex). The equivalent statement in 3d is O(n); in particular it admits a trivial single-forward pass implementation. This means it’s hard to layout computer chip designs.</p></div>		</li>
