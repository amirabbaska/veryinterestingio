			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. To be fair i did lean over the pool and sniff the water, which made my sister want to see what i was smelling and i pushed her in. Neither of us knew how to swim but my dad jumped in, took her out and literally shoved me in with his foot as i was distracted by laughing at my sisters torment</p></div>		</li>
