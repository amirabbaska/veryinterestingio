			<div class="markdown"><p>I just took an &quot;Early Humans&quot; archeology class over the summer, and it's so cool knowing a lot of this!! I love the way you structured all the points; your reply is probably the most well put! I do want to see if you know the specific type of radar they use. They have a type of radar that is able to penetrate treelines to show what exists under forests and woodlands to see if there are any potential survey sights, do you know what it's called?? Or is it just what GPR is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I wasnt sure about the tree penetrating radar but i googled it and got this: <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/80982" target="_blank">https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/80982</a>
Hope it helps! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey!! So I checked my notes and I have it down as <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html" target="_blank">Lidar</a>, which I believe is what that link you sent explains. I have it down as &quot;Light detection and ranging; measures the height and features of large areas shroaded with trees cover and able to produce high resolution pictures&quot;. But as you said, it is very expensive and they only really bring it out when they know there's an area of interest! </p>
<p>Edit: I just woke up from a nap, but I'm pretty sure UAVSAR is different from Lidar, as Lidar can penetrate through the canopy and through trees rather than just mapping the top of trees! But like I said, I'm not entirely sure! Are you a graduate and did you study Archeology or Anthropology? </p></div>		</li>
