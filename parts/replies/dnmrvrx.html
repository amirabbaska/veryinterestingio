			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the fact that psychic (emotional) tears are a consequence of the lacrimal glands producing so much fluid, that the ducts draining into your nose can't handle it, and it ends up streaming down your face. Since there is more water with the same amount of salts/proteins, the concentration of the salt in psychic tears is less than that in basal (&quot;regular&quot;) tears.</p></div>		</li>
