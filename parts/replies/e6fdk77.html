			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly true... The necklaces Mr. T wore were found to be lost in the clubs he bounced at (not the necklaces of the people he kicked out). He would wear all of the necklaces found the night before so that if someone lost one they could get it back without having to go back in the club. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume most of these people lost their necklaces during a fight, and then wouldn't be able to claim them right away. So it's probably closer to a mix of the two stories. I don't think too many big chain were just clumsily and drunkenly left at the club.</p></div>		</li>
