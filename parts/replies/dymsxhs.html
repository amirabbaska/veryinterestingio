<p>At least that's what Albert Speer claimed in his memoirs. The truth is a lot more messy. What does &quot;war economy&quot; even mean, when two thirds of your country are in ruins and working people literally to death is the <em>desired</em> outcome of your economic policy? You're producing more tanks than in 1943, but is it actually desirable when you can't get them to the front because you aren't producing any lorries? You're producing more airplanes than in 1943, but is that <em>useful</em> when you don't even have enough gasoline for training flights, much less offensive operations? You're producing more ammunition, but only if you count Schindler's sabotaged munitions that don't work, have you even achieved anything? </p></div>		</li>

If that's the case, then it would make sense that Germany had trouble outproducing Britain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not only that in 1944 they were worried to find infantry replacements and even shaped their tactics after this fact, despite fielding only a &quot;small&quot; army compared to the big 3. His claim that the Allies had no manpower issues is false.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the end of the war, Germany was arming every single citizen alive.  Women, children, and even the elderly.  But was completely ineffective.  The lack of manpower was evident, when US soldiers started realizing that the troops they were fighting tended to around the age of 18 and not much older.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And looked like 16, because all those famines had led to shunted growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true, and I don't know what your source is. The German population was shockingly well fed, even at the end of the war. This was due to the regime understanding that if the people suffered they would rebel. So the german people (as in, non-soldiers) actually lived very well until ~1943. They had a goddamn football match in a city FOUR DAYS before it was occupied. The propaganda was real, constant motion and activities for the (non-jewish, slav) population.</p></div>		</li>
