			<div class="markdown"><p>no. money losing value means goods become more expensive over time.</p>
<p>if lots of money is withdrawn from the economic circle in a short amount of time, it leads to a situation where there's less money around for the same amounts of goods. this means that instead of prices raising over time (inflation), goods suddenly become cheaper over time (deflation). </p>
<p>this might sound like a favourable situation for the consumer, but it's extremely dangerous for the economy:</p>
<p>in a normal situation (slight inflation) you need to do something with your money because if it just lies around (under your pillow for example) it will lose value slowly over time. but in a deflation situation money becomes more valuable on its own. you don't need to risk it by investing it. if you want to buy a house or a car, buying this in a month or in a year would mean it's cheaper. because money gets more valuable over time on its own, more and more people are starting to pull their money out of the economy, which leads to even more deflation. this is called an 'deflation spiral' and it can kill the economy very quickly. this is the reason why central banks are trying to maintain a slow, but steady inflation of 1-2%.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And that's exactly what I said/meant. If something loses value, you need less of other valuable things to get it. </p></div>		</li>
