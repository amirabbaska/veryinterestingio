			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, so each nuke plant costs as much as 2 gigafactories. And the <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2016/06/06/5-billion-tesla-gigafactory-worth-50-billion-analyst-estimates/" target="_blank">ROI</a> on a gigafactory is 10:1. I still don't understand why other companies/countries are <em>not</em> building their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supposedly the first gigafactory will make more batteries when completed than all other worldwide LiIon battery production combined.  That ROI is speculative - producing all those extra batteries would lower the worldwide market price for batteries.  Musk is assuming that enough EVs will be made to use all those batteries and thus keep prices above the marginal cost to operate the gigafactory.</p>
<p>But yes now affordable EVs are selling rapidly, there is talk of building a second one.</p></div>		</li>
