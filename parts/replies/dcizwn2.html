			<div class="markdown"><p>I greatly appreciate all the feedback. I knew that my lack of nutrition was the cause of my continuous fatigue, but after reading all these answers and suggestions I have begun to take the possibility of it being tied to depression more seriously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really, really does. There's a a deep connection between mental and physical states.<br />
I just came out of a two month major depression, and eating and sleeping were a major problem during that time. But, it's getting better now, in part due to me seeing a therapist. Look around. Many cities have resources that are either free or sliding scale.<br />
Good luck with it. And do take care. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep and appetite are the first things affected.  I'm bipolar so it's really obvious, because I'll sleep like 60 hours in a month and lose 20 pounds while manic; but while depressed sleep 14-16 hours a day and gain weight.  I don't necessarily gorge while depressed but the stagnancy is what makes me gain weight.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peanut butter milkshakes are good and decently edible even on poor appetite. </p>
<p>Cooking breakfast on a skillet always gets me pumped to eat. Also german sausage on a skillet.  Making cookies for the family might lift your spirits a little too, and watching a movie together while you prepare/ eat. </p>
<p>I don't enjoy cooking even, but I think it's hard not to enjoy some kinds of cooking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also dehydration. Drinking plenty of water before bed helps. Sometimes people are too tired to wake up because they are DEHYDRATED. </p></div>		</li>
