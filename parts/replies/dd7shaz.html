			<div class="markdown"><p>Wool socks, shower before you lay down, dry them with hot air, but most importantly, keep your core warm and your extremities will slowly warm up. Your core is more important than your extremities so your brain tells your body to steal heat from your extremities. All this I learned slowly over the past 6 hours. (If i'm wrong please somebody correct me). I should turn this into a TIL post. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. Being in a cold as fuck house (45 in my bedroom right now), learning how to keep warm as best as possible is so very important for my comfort. If I showered earlier in the day, normally it's no biggie when my feet are sweaty from the day. It's usually not anything to worry about or even notice, but when the air is pretty cold and your feet are bare... it's really fucking noticeable. </p>
<p>Showering makes a huge difference, so you go to bed with dry feet. Wool socks after showering makes a bigger difference, but them socks on their own are pretty magical. Don't do cotton unless you've showered, otherwise your feet stay cold.</p>
<p>And /u/CleverExpletive jokes, but doing crunches before hopping under the covers isn't far off from another good way to keep feet warm. IIRC, part of the process that makes your feet cold beyond the sweat is, as you mentioned, is your body focusing on your core. Vasoconstriction, I think that's right, is what it's called when the vessels tighten to help keep heat inward, by reducing heat loss from the surface, and having less blood going to extremities.</p>
<p>If you do some light exercise before covering, it can open the vessels, or prevent them from narrowing in the first place. If they're good and toasty from this, and then under the covers to keep warm, they got no reason to close up unless they're sweaty and having trouble regulating temperature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Get in your cold bed, and do some horizontal scissor-kicks under the covers.  Warms the sheets AND the feets with friction, and gets the benefits of exercise as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.  If you go to bed sweaty your extremities will steal the heat from your core, which is over-cored from your crunches you just did.  Keep on winning.</p></div>		</li>
