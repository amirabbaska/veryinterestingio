<p>Mammals concentrate their nitrogenous waste into urea, which packs more nitrogen into each molecule, so we can store more in less water</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why don't we just release it into the intestines?  With as much gas as we pass I'm sure a couple of dozen cc's of nitrogen isn't going to even be noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen gas is N2 with the two atoms being bound with a triple bond.</p>
<p>I don't think we have the ability to take nitrogen we can use (which is bound in single and double bonds) and make a triple bond of it. I could be wrong, but triple bonds are incredibly resilient. </p>
<p>Triple bonding nitrogen uses all available &quot;slots&quot; (since it has 3 available electron holes to fill it's shell, it can't make a triple bond and then bond some more)</p>
<p>Not a chemist so not using proper lingo at all.</p></div>		</li>
