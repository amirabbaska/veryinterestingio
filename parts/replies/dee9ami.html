<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Yes, the antiparticle of a north monopole would be a south monopole.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there an asymmetry that would unbalance monopole production like matter, so there would be one type of primordial monopole left?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since we do not know what caused the matter/anti-matter asymmetry (and also don't know where monopoles fit it into the scheme of things if they exist), it is not really possible to give a concrete answer to this question.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For a non-existent particle, based on what? Why couldn't there be a north and south monopole that aren't antiparticles? Like an electron to a proton, up quark, or anti-muon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There could be various N and S monopoles.  However, the antiparticle of a N monopole will always be a S monopole and vice-versa.  It would of course also be possible to have additional varieties of such objects, but always with the particles/antiparticles having opposite monopole charges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>bear in mind that not all particle Antiparticle pairs do this.  a photon is its own anti particle and doesn't annihilate itself.  annihilation is really because of the electromagnetic coupling of electron and photon which means there's an interaction of charges with each other over the electromagnetic field so you can have a process where two charged Antiparticles  interact to produce a photon (a quantum of the electromagnetic field), for the same reason that an electron can interact with a photon. </p></div>		</li>
