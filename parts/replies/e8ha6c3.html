			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, the cost of artists means that you can't have hours and hours every week.  You can do more of the work with computers to save money, but it shows.  If you look at some old Disney short, every frame is a work of art.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looks like Super was made by a drunk who never tried drawing anything in his life ...</p></div>		</li>

All 3D animation. Surprisingly crude and jerky, not what I expected from a company that practically invented animation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make beautiful images digitally as well. </p>
<p>The problem is accessibility. As accessibility increases, lower skilled animators enter the workforce and average quality decreases. </p>
<p>Same with regular arts like drawing, painting and sculpting. They used to be too expensive for non professionals, but now that anyone can buy a paint set, you see lots of mediocre art by people who are mildly interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Respectfully, this sounds like armchair speculation, and, as counter arm chair speculation, it also sounds like nonsense. But if you legit know what you're talking about I'm happy to stand corrected.</p>
<p>I struggle to believe Disney, for example, &quot;accidentally&quot; hires unskilled animators/artists simply because the talent pool is too large and diluted--and that they subsequently fail to notice that they've done so, and that entire series are released at subpar animation quality entirely because the guy they hired learned too little too fast. </p>
<p>Budgets not allowing for enough artists to have enough time sounds like a much, much more likely story to me.</p>
<p>I get the accessibility argument in some contexts--web design, which is a field I work in, certainly suffers this. But it's the entrepreneurial dimension of web design that allows for this--<em>anyone</em> can start a web design business with next to zero overhead. Launching a television show demands, I'd think, rather a lot more vetting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For animes with specifically the most stunning animation:</p>
<p>KyoAni (Koe no Katachi specifically), Makoto Shinkai, Mamoru Hosoda, the trilogy Kizumonogatari (this one is like comparing the originals FFs with octopath traveler), Ufotable (the classic Fate Zero, the post-processing does real magic).</p>
<p>With the exception of Fate Zero, everything is movies. This is due to the infinitely higher budgets than those of a series.</p>
<p>Now, if we simply want good 2D animation without literally needing the best that exists, the list grows several hundred recommendations for the large number of good series. The most typical to recommend are usually One Punch Man or Atack on Titan, quite spectacular.</p>
<p>Personally I like to recommend Mushishi because action and movement is not everything and a good soundtrack with beautiful landscapes are sometimes enough to enchant your mind with the atmosphere they create.</p>
<p>There is also a website dedicated to collecting <a href="https://www.sakugabooru.com/" target="_blank">sakuga</a> moments. The sakuga is the name given to the scenes that have been animated with an extremely higher quality than the rest of the episode with the intention to enhance the sensations. It is better to have two or three sakugas than to distribute that budget for all the footage and to dilute it to the point that there is hardly any difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a follow-up comment for those who aren't familiar but may be interested in checking some of these items out.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;KyoAni&quot; isn't the name of a particular production, it's short for the anime studio &quot;Kyoto Animation&quot;. Most of their stuff looks great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Makoto Shinkai is a director probably most famous for the 2016 global hit film, Your Name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mamoru Hosoda is another director. I can recommend The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. Wolf Children is supposed to be good but I haven't seen it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Kizumonogatari trilogy is one of the later installments of the Monogatari Series, but since it's a prequel it can be viewed without any knowledge of the other members of the franchise. It is indeed absolutely gorgeous.</p>
</li>
<li>Ufotable is another studio</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll also add that the film Tekkekinkreet is pretty amazing visually, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally I would not recommend the monogatari franchise to anyone who is not  already an anime fan and has known what the medium can offer. It  has elements that... well, the anime already has enough deserved bad  reputation of by itself due to certain tropes and the last thing that we should do is to flag a series that unites all those tropes and engraves  them several magnitudes. But as we speak purely of animation quality, no doubt the prequel trilogy is a must.</p>
<p>And I have not seen Tekkonkinkreet yet, but Eyepatch Wolf did an excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBtaqdXIVv8" target="_blank">review</a> recently. I'll probably watch it this year.</p>
<p>Yes, Wolf Children is pretty good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are a fan of Makoto Shinkai and you liked Hoshi no Koe, I highly recommend Pale Cocoon. In fact, I would recommend any work by its author, Yasuhiro Yoshiura:-Patema Inverted (movie)</p>
<p>-Harmonie (an OVA created for anime mirai 2014)</p>
<p>-Eve no Jikan (there are series and movie. The movie is a compilation with extra scenes so it is not necessary to watch the series)</p>
<p>But Pale Cocoon shares a lot of atmosphere with Hoshi no Koe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ufotable  is a unique exception in the anime, they are a very familiar study and  with a very close relationship to takemoon adapting also successful  franchises in their original formats, that's why their joint projects  come out very beneficial<br />
I doubt even if KyoAni could afford those budgets if they wanted to.</p>
<p>The Canipa Effect dedicated a video to them. </p></div>		</li>
