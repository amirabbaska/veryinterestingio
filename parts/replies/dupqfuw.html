			<div class="markdown"><p>The more debt you have, the more income goes to interest and debt repayment. It's better to pay 5% of your income to interest than 25%. Generally when large percentages of your taxes aren't being used for anything benificial to the country (interest), it hurts the economy quite a bit and causes a lot of instability. You're basically taking money and shoveling it out of your useful economy. Publicly held debt isn't such a big deal because the interest goes back to your own citizens. Foriegn and private debt is bigger because you're paying money that leaves the economy. </p>
<p>Germany has a lot of debt, just like the US. Surplus means they took in more money than they spent this year. Deficit means we spent more than we took in and had to borrow (increase debt) to cover it. So Germany has been decresing their debt but we have not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a country shouldn't go into debt more than they can afford. Only a very small part of the GDP ends up in the pocket of the state and can be used to pay off debt. It is the same reason why I shouldn't try to buy a house when  I don't even have a job. At some point, you need to pay it back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Large debt can be manageable with low interest rates. But if rates start to go up, a country ends up spending way more to service that debt, which necessitates either more revenues (taxes), spending cuts, or more borrowing (at higher rates). If left unchecked, a country runs into a debt spiral, where the debt itself costs more than normal spending. </p></div>		</li>
