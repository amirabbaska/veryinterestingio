			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just <em>some</em> countries, but actually <strong>most</strong> developed countries and <strong>most</strong> countries with the greatest population.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_and_married_names" target="_blank">Maiden and married names</a>. </p>
<p>Most women keep their original surname in China, most of Western Europe (sometimes by law!), and in the entire Spanish-speaking world. </p>
<p>Really, the only women that use their husbands' surnames are white baby boomers who are American descendants of English people. Using it as a banking security question is a retarded choice that alienates all the Spanish-speaking population in America, most Asian-Americans, as well as much of the younger generation. </p></div>		</li>
