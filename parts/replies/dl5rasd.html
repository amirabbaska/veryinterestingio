			<div class="markdown"><p>Skinny person with an atrocious diet, can confirm. I never gain weight - in fact I'm frequently underweight for my height - but I have almost no muscle, and often little to no energy. Somewhat ironically, in my case this could be solved by eating even <em>more</em> unhealthy (lots of red meat), but part of the reason I don't eat much in the first place is because I'm lazy, while the rest of my family are health nuts who abhor red meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not eating enough is my problem. I'm getting better but I could stand to gain like 30 pounds so people will stop pointing it out to me as if I don't hear it from literally everyone. </p>
<p>Is weight gainer a bad idea? Been thinking about trying this mass gainer shake I saw</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're a bad idea in the fact t that they're expensive and full of sugar. Instead check out r/gainit or r/fitmeals for homemade shake ideas that are tastier and friendlier on the wallet </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would go to r/fitness and read the wiki if you want to know how to gain weight properly. Basically, work out and eat a lot of healthy food with lots of protein. You will gain a lot of muscle.</p></div>		</li>
