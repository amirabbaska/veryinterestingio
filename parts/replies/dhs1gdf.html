			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the rapid advancement of technology that has made many of past requirements less meaningful. In the 90's Verizon reached a deal with the state of NJ that it would expand broadband access to the majority of New Jerseyans by 2010 in exchange for money collected from cell phone bills. Verizon has successfully argued and settled with the state of NJ that it has fulfilled its promise to deliver broadband internet to most of NJ. Through a combination of fiber optic, DSL, and 4G/LTE and that all of those count as broadband services. </p>
<p>Many people have objected to considering LTE or DSL comparable to modern, fiber optic broadband. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If somebody had asked me what &quot;broadband&quot; means, I'd probably have said &quot;anything that offers above 56K of bandwidth&quot; just because that was the dividing line when I was much younger.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia article on broadband still uses that definition: &quot;In the context of Internet access, broadband is used to mean any high-speed Internet access that is always on and faster than traditional dial-up access.&quot;.</p>
<p>Considering that, we should probably toss the term broadband altogether and explicitly demand 100Mbps+ (or whatever).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.. is a really good point.  The vague term broadband could mean different things.  I think I'm from your era, so I'd probably say anything faster than ISDN.  But then you're looking at T1 quality, or 1.5Mbps.  Is that even still considered broadband anymore?  You're right, they need to start including hard numbers in any kind of legislation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about....&quot;You must spend this money on running fiber to places which do not already have it.  We don't give a flying fuck if it's 'profitable enough' for you, we're handing you a giant pile of money, make it fucking work, assholes.  This is your last chance, if you fuck it up or try to spend this money in other places (or back off on what you're averaging annually to upkeep your existing network because of this), we're turning this whole fucking thing into a public utility and then good luck on keeping your profits up.&quot;</p>
<p>How's that for wording?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hardware certainly is, but the rest of the services ISP's provide (DSN servers and the like) are not. I'm not an expert, but having the government controlling the physical cabling and the services provided by regionally competitive ISP's would probably solve most of these problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK... so they quit spending all of &quot;their&quot; money on infrastructure and spend all of &quot;your&quot; money on infrastructure. They then spend all of &quot;their&quot; money on hookers and coke. Congratulations, you just fucked up again because you forgot that money is fungible. </p>
<p>Really the best way to do it is to have economists run an analysis on what is possible given the amount of money they're giving out, require broadband companies to meet those goals and then be compensated with money after having already invested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still depends, you have stuff like what someone mentioned in this thread about NJ, they said &quot;Everyone in NJ shall have broadband internet by 2010&quot;. Verizon got full cell phone coverage in the state, said 3g is broadband, so pay us. Meanwhile, NYC told Verizon to get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/nyc-sues-verizon-alleges-failure-to-complete-citywide-fiber-rollout/" target="_blank">100% FiOS coverage in NYC by June 30, 2014 and they failed</a>, this was a much more strict wording, and they are in court over it because Verizon said NYC didn't help with it's part.</p>
<p>And ultimately, money is fungible, so even if you say do all houses here and I'll give you $100mil, maybe they were going to do it anyway, you really don't know if your $100mil got your people cheaper access, or if they just installed it at some insane price.</p>
<p>The way it works is the way the DoD does it, tell them I want these houses covered with internet, and pay labor and material directly, their incentive is how much over they go over/under the quote (you pay labor, plus $10mil, plus 10% of whatever they go under their quote, and minus 10% of what they go over their quote). But if the government is going to pay for everything like that, they might as well maintain ownership of it, and then they can regulate it as a condition of it's use. In fact this is how they do the power in my town, the state owns the lines and polls, and they pay a contractor to bill everyone and fix everything. Since it's the state that ultimately owns it, they can tell them exactly how to do everything, and keep rates down.</p></div>		</li>
