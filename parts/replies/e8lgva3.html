<p>I'm a Canadian in the Philippines right now. Should I stop drinking the fruit smoothies I've been buying from restaurants? They're made with ice that I'm pretty sure is just tap water..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the disease epidemics that swept Native American people when Europeans came over. Simple diseases were less life threatening to European carriers because they had been exposed to them for generations and had built an immune response. The Native Americans did not have those antibodies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, there is also that mechanic.</p>
<p>Interestingly, all those deadly diseases were ones that jumped on humans from other species. An example is smallpox, which comes from cows and doesn't really harm them much. However, in big cities there was lot of cattle in close contact with lot of humans: eventually one mutated smallpox virus managed to infect humans and not being adapted to our system, it was harmful. Same goes for lot of deadly diseases such plague (rats) or ebola (bats).</p>
<p>What's interesting is that native Americans only domesticated lamas and didn't have many large cities where there was lot of human-animal contact like in Europe, so no or few diseases managed to make the intraspecies jump. The result was that natives didn't have any deadly disease to pass onto Europeans and decimate our population, which spared us brutal epidemics that could have potentially been worse than the black plague.</p></div>		</li>
