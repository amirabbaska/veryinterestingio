			<div class="markdown"><p>What is it with the rampant analogies nowadays? John Oliver is basically a series of analogies spoken in a crescendo. With funny jokes inbetween. A lot of recent stand up comedy is like this too </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because analogies simplify a complex thought process down to a series of steps that are easy to track. Learning is not easy for everyone, even though we are predisposed to learning by just experiencing. </p>
<p>Analogies lead me to conclusions that are established. They don't give me room to consider incorrect or unrelated variables (well, assuming the analogy is good LOL) and arrive at wrong conclusions. </p>
<p>They make it so a topic which requires functional knowledge of 10 smaller &quot;sub-concepts&quot; can be explained to someone successfully without necessitating they &quot;functionally understand&quot; those 10 concepts. </p>
<p>And my personal favorite...thinking is hard and not everyone wants to do it. Like me on Monday mornings at work. Just spoon feed me info, don't make me go through my emails....</p>
<p>I think there may be something to the theory that attention spans are shorter and general willingness to educate oneself is not all that prevalent anymore...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You parenthesised the crux of the problem. Using an analogy in a debate just shifts the debate to being about whether or not it is actually analogous. Which cannot be answered without understanding the original topic sans that analogy...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Analogies always make a lot of sense to the person making them up. It makes them think they have a perfect explanation. A good analogy also makes sense to other people, but those are rare. </p></div>		</li>
