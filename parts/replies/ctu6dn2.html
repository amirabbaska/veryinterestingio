			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest problem with these systems is corrosion on the pistons and cylinder walls.  The U.S. military had aircraft engines in the 40's and 50's that used water injection as a power mode for takeoff and emergencies.  The water injection increased the efficiency of the combustion while lowering the cylinder temp letting them run at higher cylinder pressures giving an increase in power.  The engines had to be, at least partially, rebuilt after use because of the corrosion from just a few minutes use.  Apparently, hot steel and water don't get along well.</p>
<p>The holy grail they seem to be looking into to get around this problem is ceramic coating the combustion chamber parts. Still a way away from what I read.</p>

<p>Such a system would be self-cooling, and wouldn't need a radiator. It would also make efficient use of waste heat.</p>

<p>Only as long as your water reservoir wasn't empty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Er, you can do water injection on a 2015 Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X, which is a 2l turbocharged 4 banger. The colder the cylinder, the better the turbo works, so quite a few people do water injection. </p>
<p>They aren't rebuilding after a few minutes. They're also not steel, but I don't see what steel has to do with car engine blocks in today's world anyhow, even Ford uses aluminum in their larger engines now, and they were one of the few that held on to cast iron blocks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are thinking of injection cooling, not a water-injected steam engine. Steam on metal requires substantial water treatment prior to boiling or it builds scale and corrosion very rapidly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ummm, maybe because they use these things called cylinder sleeves that aren't aluminum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, even if the block is aluminum, the cylinder itself is a steel liner, the valves are usually steel and the piston rings are ductile iron. </p>
<p>The turbine housing could be some sort of iron alloy as well, sometimes inconel.</p>
<p>But you're right the engine won't be rebuilt after a few minutes of water injection, that's ridiculous. It could effect long-term reliability but I don't know the details. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water injection in the form of an injector in the intake manifold [1] is very much a thing in high performance diesel trucks.  Cooler EGT and more power at a given EGT.  There are no major corrosion issues - it's no different than driving in a rainstorm.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contamination is likely to be one problem, but also consider the complexity of capturing <strong>only</strong> the steam portion of the exhaust. Rather than a simple manifold, you now need extra valves in the exhaust system (piston head?).</p>
<p>It's not impossible...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that sounds like a very quick way to get cracked and corroded cylinder walls and piston heads...</p>
<p>would also need a heavier block to deal with the temperature fluctuating so much.  all the negatives grossly outweigh the positives</p></div>		</li>
