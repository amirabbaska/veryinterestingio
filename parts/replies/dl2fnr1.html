<p>if you look at the end use for residential and commercial buildings, then consider about 40% of that energy goes to HVAC both heating and cooling that can help give an idea of the scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, Sankeys are very commonly used for visualizing &quot;flows&quot; and breakdowns and are super common in the energy/building sector for that reason. </p>
<p>More from a broad perspective, or policy side of things, we dont send Sankeys to Facilities Managers about one building.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great add, prtcipator,  I would refine it to clarify though that geothermal uses similar technology to an air conditioner, not to the passive solar chimney system i posted.</p>
<p>An geothermal can do heating and cooling!  To super simplify it - its the same as a window air conditioner, but the half that normally hangs outside of the window is buried underground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when I worked at a power utility, I would read through their utility engineering magazines that got left in the.. uh.. 'break room'. I remember reading an article about large server farms using multiple artesian wells (wells drilled deep enough that the water comes out under its own pressure) to run over their building chillers (large buildings send air through big 'radiators' with cool water flowing over them). It was essentially free cold water, since the wells maintain a consistently cool temperature year round. The actual cost, aside from an expensive installation (artesian wells aren't cheap, especially when your talking about 20 or so of them), was that regulations require the water to be treated and reinjected back into the ground. As to not deplete the ground water. This is just the basic idea, but it is very efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do HVAC engineering, ground source heat pumps/geothermal can be great systems if designed properly. They do have a whole slew of issues that hold them back from being competitive in most applications. If your payback is 10 years and the life of the equipment is marginally more than that, why invest in a significantly more complicated system? They usually require a huge footprint relative to the size of the building to install the wells, too. A small 2 story office building that we did needed <strong>50</strong> separate wells dug, each 250 ft deep and spaced 15 ft apart. It took up pretty much the entire parking lot, and even if you are smart designing the system you still run the risk of line breaks which are an expensive fix when it's buried under structure or asphalt. Additionally, since they have a lot more parts and pieces than a typical rooftop unit setup, suddenly the owner is paying twice as much to install the system and twice as much every year for maintenance since the average facilities guy for a small building might not be familiar with how the system <em>should</em> work. We've had buildings that weren't balanced properly and the maintenance workers just went around shutting off systems until they &quot;fixed&quot; the problem, which would reappear anytime the temp fluctuated much. It killed any inherent efficiency in the system, pissed off tenants and the owner, and ended up being over a year til the building was where we intended.</p>
<p>Anyways, long story short: they are clever, efficient little systems that can work like a charm but take a lot of attention and aren't always worth the price or energy savings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. It is not just for power consumption, which is of course one big issue, but there is also the problem of refrigerants. More specifically, today is in use gas called hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), which is a replacement for chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) - arguably the worst invention of the 20th century (according to Bill Bryson, A Short History of Nearly Everything - &quot;Chlorofluorocarbons may ultimately prove to be just about the worst invention of the twentieth century.&quot;).</p>
<p>HFC kicked in as gas that does not damage the ozone layer (as CFC does), however they are potent greenhouse gases, way stronger than CO2 (<a href="http://unfccc.int/ghg_data/items/3825.php" target="_blank">http://unfccc.int/ghg_data/items/3825.php</a>). And according to recent research, we saw a dramatic rise in HFC emission in just a short period of time between 2007 and 2012 (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/19/5927" target="_blank">http://www.pnas.org/content/112/19/5927</a>). Since specific types of HFC gases are used in air conditioning systems, it is not difficult to link where these gases come from. In fact, if you are interested more in this subject here is the link where you can find a more complete text of my summary: <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/hydrofluorocarbon-emissions-up-54-with-air-conditioning-on-the-rise" target="_blank">https://www.carbonbrief.org/hydrofluorocarbon-emissions-up-54-with-air-conditioning-on-the-rise</a></p>
<p>All in all, the negative impact of air conditioning is huge and worrying, but there is always that question about how much are people willing to give in on their comfort. Unfortunately, it seems to me that the majority of people do not even understand the consequences of greenhouse gases in the first place. Or they are just being ignorant. Whichever it is, I think it should be our responsibility to protect the environment for our kids, but that's another story. For now lets just hope that our planet won't turn into Venus any time soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jean, to put a slightly more positive spin on it - air conditioning is necessary for modern human life in a lot of part of the world. Whether or not we should be there is a whole separate debate.</p>
<p>From the engineering perspective we just focus on what gains can be made without asking people to change their lives/behavior, because no one wants to.</p>
<p>IF we can clean up our act in regards to refrigerants, and IF we have a much cleaner mix of energy production then the negative impacts of air conditioning are greatly reduced. </p>
<p>I think it is important to have this moderate perspective to show that there is a non-partisan path towards having a more sustainable society that doesnt involve us all giving up showering and wearing hemp clothing. If you tell someone they can have a fancy car, and an air conditioned house AND be an environmentalist then we will win!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HFCs are a huge problem, but many developed countries are making huge steps towards phasing them down or eliminating them! The European Union has a major F-Gas (fluorinated  gas) phase down in effect (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/f-gas/legislation_en" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/f-gas/legislation_en</a>). The United States has the Significant New Alternatives Policy (A different SNAP...) is also working on phasing out the most harmful of the HFCs (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/snap" target="_blank">https://www.epa.gov/snap</a>). The big replacements are Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). They have the same amount of impact on global warming as carbon dioxide (about 1/2000th of HFCs currently in use). Some of the big auto manufacturers have already committed to using these in new cars. So HFCs still pose a big threat, but things are definitely moving in the right direction. At least for now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New refrigerants (r600, r290 and r1234yf) are being produce though. They have no impact on the ozone layer and have a GWP of 1 or very close to 1.</p>
<p>The only downside is that they are all at the very least flammable and there's already been cases of air conditioning units bursting into flames.</p>
<p>Refrigerants used nowadays (the cleanest widely used being the R134, for wich every single kg of game is roughly equivalent to 1,4 <strong>tons</strong> of CO2) are being pushed away from the market and should be out by 2030. <em>Should</em></p></div>		</li>
