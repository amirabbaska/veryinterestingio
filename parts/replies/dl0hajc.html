			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot. I have read a lot of books including my high school books and Steven Zumdahl's Chemistry book but nothing made sense, this is the first time someone has presented all the facts in a clear cut timeline. Thanks again. If you ever get time please answer some of my other questions like-(1) How did they know if the sample they have is purified (2) Is it a coincident that Mendeleev arranged the elements numerically and later on people found out that the arrangement was, in fact, related to or based on the number of protons present in an atom?
(3)Are all atom made up of same kind of substance or matter or whatever is relevant, and Does the difference in the properties of different element arise because of the number of protons and electrons present in an atom?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) You can take a small sample of your substance that you think is pure, react it with another sample of a different substance you think is pure, and see if there are any weird leftover substances you can't account for.  </p>
<p>2) No, it's not a coincidence. Mendeleev organized them according to weight, but he didn't know about neutrons. Neutrons add weight to an atom without affecting the chemical properties of the atom. Chemistry is all about electric charges, and neutrons don't have one. (Or if you like you can say they have  a charge of 0.) As was mentioned earlier, sometimes he found that he had to take two neighboring atoms and swap their positions in order for their chemical properties to fit observed patterns.  The protons are what determines the identity of the element. If two atoms are neighbors on the modern periodic table, the one on the right will <em>always</em> have exactly one more proton than the one on the left. <em>Usually</em> the one on the right also has more neutrons, but <em>sometimes</em> the one on the left has more neutrons, which makes the one on the left heavier. So the true predictor of how an atom will behave chemically is the number of protons it has. Usually more protons means more mass, but sometimes more protons means fewer neutrons, and therefore smaller mass, so organizing by weight is a close, but imperfect, approximation to organizing by the number of protons. </p>
<p>3) Yes, the protons, neutrons, and electrons of a hydrogen atom are identical to those of a uranium atom. The number of protons determines what kind of atom you have. The number of electrons determines the charge on the atom.  <em>(Edit: I think it's more accurate to say the difference between the number of  electrons and protons determines the charge.)</em> The number of neutrons has no impact on how an atom bonds with other atoms. Although neutrons do play a role in radioactivity, so while they have some effect, it's not a direct effect on the bonding process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He succeeds in experimentally stripping out everything but the nucleus of a hydrogen atom.</p>

<p>How on earth did he measure that though? How did he know he was left with only the nucleus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because what he was left with had a positive charge. As previously stated they knew electrons were negatively charged and likely composed an outer shell to the atom.</p>
<p>So, if you managed to strip that shell off and all you have left is a positive particle that matches the atomic weight of the original atom then you can safely conclude that you have isolated the nucleus of that atom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Everything</em>, in this case is actually a just single electron. A hydrogen atom is just a proton with one single electron orbiting it. Still not trivial though, I certainly can't strip an electron off an atom by my own, they're too tiny!</p></div>		</li>
