			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off this, you don't even need to have psychoactive drugs for large numbers of people to have suspiciously-similar delusions. My favorite example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_the_%22Influencing_Machine%22_in_Schizophrenia" target="_blank">&quot;influencing machine&quot;</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The schizophrenic influencing machine is a machine of mystical nature. The patients are able to give only vague hints of its construction. It consists of boxes, cranks, levers, wheels, buttons, wires, batteries, and the like. Patients endeavor to discover the construction of the apparatus by means of their technical knowledge, and it appears that with the progressive popularization of the sciences, all the forces known to technology are utilized to explain the functioning of the apparatus. All the discoveries of mankind, however, are regarded as inadequate to explain the marvelous powers of this machine, by which the patients feel themselves persecuted.</p>
<p>The main effects of the influencing machine are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It makes the patient see pictures. When this is the case, the machine is generally a magic lantern or cinematograph. The pictures are seen on a single plane, on walls or windowpanes, and unlike typical visual hallucinations are not three-dimensional.  </li>
<li>It produces, as well as removes, thoughts and feelings by means of waves or rays or mysterious forces which the patient's knowledge of physics is inadequate to explain. In such cases, the machine is often called a &quot;suggestion-apparatus.&quot; Its construction cannot be explained, but its function consists in the transmission or &quot;draining off&quot; of thoughts and feelings by one or several persecutors.  </li>
<li>It produces motor phenomena in the body, erections and seminal emissions, that are intended to deprive the patient of his male potency and weaken him. This is accomplished either by means of suggestion or by air-currents, electricity, magnetism, or X-rays.  </li>
<li>It creates sensations that in part cannot be described, because they are strange to the patient himself, and that in part are sensed as electrical, magnetic, or due to air-currents.  </li>
<li>It is also responsible for other occurrences in the patient's body, such as cutaneous eruptions, abscesses, or other pathological processes.</li>
</ul>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Schizophrenics provide some interesting insight into the topic, <a href="http://www.factgo.no/getfile.php/3570631.2467.refcsfbwdc/EASE.pdf" target="_blank">EASE</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Fuchs3/publication/314288757_EAWE_Examination_of_Anomalous_World_Experience/links/58e89eb2a6fdccb4a8304000/EAWE-Examination-of-Anomalous-World-Experience.pdf" target="_blank">EAWE</a> provide a really thorough list of common experiences and for some it's pretty easy to see how the delusions can come about to rationalize simpler more understandable experiences. For example I knew a schizophrenic person who was convinced everyone but him had telepathy and all of his &quot;evidence&quot; was simply that everyone seemed to know how each other were feeling when he didn't, but it was obvious they were just reading affect/facial expression/body language and he was completely unable to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The weird thing is in a way, he was right. They didn't have literal telepathy, but to someone who can't read body language that's just about the same. The concept of people able to look at others and intuit what they're thinking and feeling must be crazy if you can't do it at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're referencing an article in which a psychoanalyst talks about the fact that many schizophrenic patients attributed their delusions to an outside force he calls a &quot;machine.&quot; Many of them shared very similar explanations/delusions.</p>
<p>Basically, &quot;There are other people doing this to me against my will.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you read DMT - Spirit Molecule, they have some patients go in without any prior knowledge of what they'd see or experience, and many reported seeing the same thing, per the book and it's study references. they also have prior-use patients. but overall, i wouldn't rule out bias. They try to expand on it, but found no reasoning why people uninfluenced would experience similar or same experiences. Worth a read, for context </p></div>		</li>
