			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a little bit onto this, <em>c</em> being called the speed of light leads people to come to weird conclusions about it. Think about it more this way: when mass moves through space it takes energy to reach a higher speed. The faster it goes, the more energy it needs. Eventually you reach a point where you need infinite energy to go any faster. This is <em>c</em>. Light so happens to not have any mass, and thus automatically goes this speed, as well as many other particles such as neutrinos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close, but neutrinos have negligible mass and travel less than the speed of light <em>through space</em>.  </p>
<p>Actually, everything travels through spacetime at speed c. Particles with mass travel more through time, particles without mass travel only through space, but they all move at c through spacetime. </p>
<p>As for sound, think about shoving a person in a crowd. If you push hard enough, they'll push the next person, and so on, but it's not an immediate response. Sound works the same way. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So everything moving has a certain amount of 'movement credits' to spend in space-time. But the more massive things has to spend more on time, so they have less to spend on space before they're out of space-time credits. So, from our perspective, if 'racing' something less massive (L), something more massive (M) 'racing' in a certain direction either moves less distance in the same amount of time as L, or the same distance in a greater amount of time. Cause those two things are equivalent expenditures of spacetime credits. And it seems the universe executes both of those functions on top of each other to form our reality. Woahdude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your 2nd paragraph does violence to some basic notions! Movement is change of position in space as time passes. Picture 2D space with time as the third dimension. If you take a slice through this space time, you get a 2D slice of space &quot;at an instant&quot;. If you move the T coordinate of the slice, the things in the slice appear to move around. (Different observers may take the slice at a different angle, but ignore that for the moment).</p>
<p>But nothing is &quot;moving&quot; in space time. It's a single fixed structure, permanent and unmoving. It doesn't make sense to say a particle moves at c through spacetime. In spacetime a particle &quot;is&quot; a trail or path, and nothing is moving. Depending on your perception of &quot;now&quot;, you see a different slice of that trail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both. The speed of light can be derived from Maxwell's equations. It turned out that a solution to Maxwell's equations was a travelling wave that propagated at the speed of 1 / sqrt(electric constant * magnetic constant). This value matched the speed of light and Maxwell determined that light was an electromagnetic wave. His hunch was later confirmed by Heinrich Hertz.</p>
<p>But the electric constant and magnetic constants are just that - measured constants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both actually. There are ways to derive the speed of light through physics (Maxwell's equations), and the calculated value of c has been confirmed through many experiments</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a calculated and measured value; but then we decided that it was such an important measured value that we chose to use our best calculation of it to define the meter. So now it is a fixed value - and as we make more accurate measurements of it, we instead are defining the meter more accurately. </p>
<p>We are in the middle of doing the same thing with the kilogram - improving our measurements of Avogadro's number (with a perfectly round sphere of silicon) and Planck's Constant (using a watt balance), so we can chose a defined value of one of them, and from there turn all the definitions backwards to derive the kilogram.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related question; what are the materials with the highest and lowest speed of sound? (or at least the ones where you could still really call it 'sound.' I guess one of them would be something super dense like lead, but then at that point it can barely be called sound.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like it depends on both the density and elastic properties of teh materials From <a href="https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/HighSchool/Sound/speedinmaterials.htm" target="_blank">https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/HighSchool/Sound/speedinmaterials.htm</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The closer the molecules are to each other and the tighter their bonds, the less time it takes for them to pass the sound to each other and the faster sound can travel. It is easier for sound waves to go through solids than through liquids because the molecules are closer together and more tightly bonded in solids.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the speed of light is the speed of causation.</p>
<p>other things can move at the same speed, anything without mass basically.</p>
<p>but nothing can move faster than the speed of causation.</p>
<p>the exception is expansion, the speed at which space can expand within itself is not limited by the speed of causation.
this is where we get multiverse level 1 and 2 theories.
its possible that the observable universe is just one tiny bubble of space time but that we can't reach other such bubbles of space time because the speed of expansion is faster in between than the speed of light.
if we share a single set of physics with all the bubbles thats multiverse level 1, if there are infinite possible ways for the laws of physics to work, thats multiverse level 2. </p></div>		</li>
