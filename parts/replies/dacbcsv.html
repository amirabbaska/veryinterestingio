			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so important and I feel like it is commonly overlooked. Until five years ago I had never even heard of a large scale solar farm that was using photovoltaic cells. I had only heard of the farms that used thousands of mirrors aimed at the tower, and store their energy in sodium. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could also use solar power by burning trees. This would be carbon neutral too, because the carbon dioxide released from burning the trees is equal to the carbon dioxide absorbed by the trees during their growth.</p>
<p>Practically every source of power is &quot;solar.&quot; Hydroelectric? Sun energy makes water evaporate into clouds, clouds drop water off upstream, water runs through turbine generator on its way back to the ocean or to a lake. Wind? Energy input from the sun produces environmental dynamics like high and low pressure zones that together produce wind, the flow of which spins an air-turbine to drive a generator. </p>
<p>The only exception is nuclear (fission produced by energy trapped in atoms of another star when it supernova'd; fusion from the fact that the rapid expansion of the universe made matter &quot;crystallize&quot; into atoms lighter than iron, which is the energy sweet spot). Geothermal, too, since the decay of potassium in Earth's core contributes to that heat.</p>
<p>The problem is simply <em>which</em> solar we use; specifically burning fossil fuels—carbon that has been sequestered for many millions and millions of years—and releasing them into the atmosphere so quickly, we suddenly end up with release that <em>isn't</em> carbon-neutral at climate-affecting timescales. This is what is bad: releasing carbon that's been trapped for millions of years.</p>
<p>As long as you're planting as many trees as you're burning to keep carbon absorption the same over time, firewood is also a carbon-neutral source of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's an interesting philosophy i had not considered.  you we need to be storing as much carbon as we are releasing.  so we just need an efficient way to store carbon.  either science gets a lot better, or we start paying people to hike around and plant trees.</p>
<p>do we know enough material science that we can have buildings trap carbon?  we make a building, but most of the time we don't actively use the roof.  we could, within reason, put trees and other carbon absorbing structures up there.  then i guess the argument becomes, why didnt we just put the whole building underground?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is not really with storing carbon efficiently or in a high-tech way, it's more with storing an enormous amount of it cost-effectively. Plants are a very good solution to that because they are intrinsically solar-powered, self-repairing, self-growing, and self-replicating machines. Machines that are literally built from the carbon that they sequester. It's pretty hard to design a better system than that, not to mention a cheaper one—all it needs is sunlight, water, and some common elements in the soil.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, nuclear reactions on Earth, the heat underneath the planet's crust, the Earth's angular momentum, the Earth's magnetic field, and the Earth's orbital velocity are the only sources of energy available to us on this planet that aren't actually solar energy. Even oil is just stored solar energy that went through a plant and then animal phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to point out though that Ivanpah solar power facility does not produce zero emissions. According to the wiki link you provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2014, the plant burned 867,740 million BTU of natural gas emitting 46,084 metric tons of carbon dioxide</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess this is natural gas required to start the plant. Obviously this pollution is less than that of an average coal power plant which produces like 3-4 million tons of carbon dioxide.</p></div>		</li>
