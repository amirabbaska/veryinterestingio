			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it was the Julian calendar before it was the Gregorian calendar. They differed by about two weeks after 1400 years. The calendar actually &quot;lost&quot; days when Western civilizations gradually (and at different times) made the switch.</p>

<p>In case someone else tries looking at it without seeing anything strange at first - it might be you have to manually choose «United Kingdom» as country, it had changed to my location (norway) for me when I forst looked at it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Julian calendar did account for leap days. The reason it drifted out is that a year is slightly less than 365.25 days. The Gregorian calendar accounts for this by not having a leap day if the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400 - the years 1800, 1900 and 2100 aren't leap years, but 2000 was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep - and that's why the British fiscal year starts on 6 April.</p>
<p>The first day of the year prior to 1752 was 'Lady Day' on 25 March.</p>
<p>We skipped a load of days in 1752, but so that the taxman/lenders/landlords wouldn't lose out on a couple of weeks' worth of payment, a law was passed to extend the financial year to the beginning of April. </p>
<p>I think it was originally April the 5th, but we've had a couple of leap days since then, and one of them got tagged on to the financial year again to give us the new start date of 6 April.</p>
<p>However, the traditional 'quarter days' for accounting and collection of quarterly payments is still based on the public holidays of Christmas and the Annunciation. So 25 March, June, September, and December. Still used by lots of companies and commercial landlords who are sticklers for tradition.</p>
<p>So we've got a calendar year that doesn't line up with the financial year which doesn't line up with the accounting and payment quarters, because of whiney landlords and 'tradition'.</p>
<p>It's a particularly British thing - lots of other countries just set everything to 1 Jan and told people to get over it...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to extend that: the reason it was those four days is that up until 1752, the 1st of January wasn't the first day of the year in the UK. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And this is the reason that people protested against the new calendar - it wasn't because &quot;days were being stolen&quot; - it was because they were expected to pay rent and tax for non-existent days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also keep in mind that in the original Julian calendar, the start of the year was 1 March. That's why the names of some months (September to December) are off by two - September should be the seventh month as its name implies. This possibly has relevance as it's why the fiscal year starts in the spring at all, as the calendar also used to start around then. </p></div>		</li>
