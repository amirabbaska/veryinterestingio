You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backwardâ€”reversing cause and effect. I call these the &quot;wet streets cause rain&quot; stories. Paper's full of them. In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read.

			<div class="markdown"><p>COMPLETELY full of nonsense. </p>
<p>First: Dan Brown is a creative writer, not an historian. It's not an historical analysis, and liberties were taken for the sake of story.</p>
<p>Second: the plot of Da Vinci Code was based on a <em>medieval</em> conspiracy theory, invented by people one thousand years removed from New Testament Biblical times, whose worldview was <em>entirely circumscribed</em> by the New Testament. This &quot;mary magdalene had Jesus' baaabies&quot; urban legend is basically just Medieval fan fiction. </p>
<p>Third: There is absolutely ZERO EVIDENCE that Mary Magdalene was an historical person. There is also zero evidence that Jesus was an historical person. Counting sources that are not the text of the religion that these characters are major figures of? We have nothing until 90 years after the supposed death of Jesus, when an outside observer mentions that <em>people espouse a belief</em> in Jesus. </p>
<p>If you have a robust understanding of the melting pot of the Ancient Near East versus that of Late Antiquity, it's pretty clear that Jesus is one of a <em>class</em> of culture-hero characters, who were entirely fictional. The only reason you know his name and not Simon Magus' or Mithra's is because history is after all written by the victors. And by &quot;victors,&quot; I mean that early Christians eventually killed enough of the other heroes' followers, and made sure those characters were lost to time. </p>
<p>If you take a close look at the Wikipedia article on Jesus, the &quot;historicity&quot; section practically <em>begs</em> the reader not to question anything -- it presents no evidence. It just talks about how many &quot;credible&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; scholars agree, but doesn't say why they would agree. </p>
<p>Josephus is the only evidence possible to present, and he was the 90-years-in-the-future witness to the <em>cult of Jesus,</em> not to evidence of Jesus' existence. This is typical of scholarship from within religious circles -- after all, who wants to spend a long time studying the Bible only to admit that it's actually just poetry, not reality? </p>
<p>You can't prove a negative, but in the context of Late Antiquity politics and religious movements, there were a LOT of characters that filled exactly the role that Jesus did; the transcendent, super-powered folk hero, who came from a small town, generations ago but not far from here, who had a <em>message</em> and could do <em>miracles.</em> </p>
<p>Situated in the midst of all of this rich, and period-typical myth-making, it would be strange to find ONE figure amongst the many fictions who was actually based on a real person. It would be like finding out that even though we have a thousand superhero stories, and many that you've actually forgotten even at the height of the hero myth's popularity, it turns out that <em>the John Stewart Green Lantern is actually alive, and living in New York.</em> </p>
<p>Just him, though. Not Hal Jordan, or Superman or Wolverine. Those guys aren't real. But Stewart is totally a real guy. </p>
<p>It's absurd. </p>
<p>Furthermore: You can tell the difference between Late Antiquity and Ancient folk-heroes, because the new version always had a <em>message.</em> Herclues didn't have a message, just a bunch of feats of strength. Mithras could save you, but he didn't talk to you and tell you he was interested in your problems. Jesus (the generic local boy), Simon (the wise man magician -- literally that's what his name means), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dositheos_%28Samaritan%29" target="_blank">folks you've never even heard of</a> -- all of these characters existed in a rich ecosystem of competing Messianic and magical figures, who were all <em>mysteriously concerned with the cultural preoccupations of the First Century AD.</em> </p>
<p>This new style of mythic hero is concerned with challenging ontology itself -- the world isn't really as it's presented to you, which gives you an excuse to start looking for ways around temporal authority and the Roman system of religious governance. Culture heroes of transcendent wisdom arose as a challenge to Roman state religious normativity AND to the  mysticism of both Roman cults (like Mithraism) and local Semitic messianic hysteria (which looked a lot like Taliban incursions crossed with the David Koresh cult). </p>
<p>You had all these social forces at work, some new and some very, very old - some very present and some distant. You had your family telling you to lean one way and the local Roman administrator making sure you were behaving, and none of that was appealing. And here comes Simon, the man, the myth, the legend -- I heard he can do miracles, so his power is greater than a puny military occupation. And I heard he knew secrets -- that the world is spiritual and accessible, and speaks directly to <em>you, brother,</em> he wants you to know those secrets too, even though you live in a world that discards your identity and tells you that you owe something to everyone, but seems to owe you nothing. Give ME (really -- I mean him -- totally it's all about HIM) that loyalty instead of giving it to a government that doesn't trust you, a tribe that only wants to fight small-minded wars, or one of the false prophets on the next corner over, who preach nonsense. MY hero had miracles that I've seen with my own eyes, so you know something special is going on here!&quot; </p>
<p>Replace Simon with Jesus, or any of the other cults of the time. If you understand their social context, Jesus fits neatly into a category of fiction that facilitates temporal power for the leaders of the establishment. That's a &quot;Church.&quot; That's the center of this religion business in the Roman occupation, and beyond. It's an alternate reality option, which facilitates an alternate power structure. </p>
<p>Jesus only looks &quot;real&quot; because so many people have simply <em>assumed</em> his legend is based on a real person. But the ancient world invented, fought over, murdered over, and discarded these characters all the time. These characters and their mythic concerns represented the real-world political concerns of the people of that time. It would actually be a LOT weirder if any of these people turned out to be historical figures, than if Paul and his cronies had simply made up a bunch of polemical figures to bear their cultural dialogue forward. That's what these characters <em>were for</em> in this time and place - they carried a way of life, poetically described as a person. </p>
<p>Mary Magdalene is prominent in Christian tradition as a prostitute, a Saint, a feminist icon, a symbol of loyalty, possibly &quot;secretly&quot; the real founder of the early Church. But she's mentioned <em>only</em> in the Gospels -- hundreds of years after her life. </p>
<p>She's an icon, a symbol. She's a story designed to compel and inspire you. What she is NOT is a real person who we can see evidence of in Roman or any other history. She, like Jesus, is entirely her myth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not Cunningham's Law. That relates to retrieving the correct answer to a question by posting the wrong answer on the Internet. It's more to do with more knowledgeable people feeling the need to <strong><em>actively</em></strong> contradict fallacies, than any reference to experts vs non-experts. There is also no reference to those without knowledge accepting the wrong answers (posted deliberately) as fact.</p>
<p>/u/swaggler's theory sounds more like a cognitive bias of some sort, rather than a Law. I would guess a study relating to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> or a similar theory. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes to everything except the brain. I'm currently working in a polytrauma/brain injury clinic, so this is right up my alley. </p>
<p>Basically, it depends on the type of brain injury. In Anoxic brain injury (when the brain goes without oxygen for an extended period of time), you are correct. Some gains will be made within the first 6 months, but after that, gains will be measured in millimeters instead of inches.
In traumatic brain injury, you should see some gains within the first 6 months, however gains can still be made pretty significantly after that.
In fact, we've found that neuroplasticiity- the brain's ability to learn- does NOT go away with age. New connections can be made in much older adults, including those who have suffered a stroke. </p>
<p>As with anything, the ability for the person to make significant gains after injury revolves around the significance of the injury (how bad), and the location of injury. I currently have a man who attempted suicide by putting a gun under his chin and pulling the trigger. The bullet ripped through the frontal lobe, and took out his eye. He's walking, talking, and tomorrow we're going to bake. His major deficits are in attention and speed of processing. </p>
<p>TL;DR: it varies how much recovery you can get, but the brain can absolutely recover from major trauma. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a speech therapist and I work with adults who've had strokes. I've been working with a woman who had a stroke over a year ago and has substantial fluent/Wernicke's aphasia. When we first started working together, she could barely string together a coherent sentence. Now, she is reading simple paragraphs and participating in conversations. Brains heal!

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor, but this answer is wrong/misleading.<br />
The &quot;healing&quot; process you're talking about is due to neuroplasticity, not physiological healing. Your patient's brain will never replace the now-missing grey matter that previously occupied the frontal lobe in the same way that a bicep would repair/rebuild itself after a gunshot wound to the upper arm.<br />
Instead, the other parts of the brain will compensate by forming new synaptic connections to re-establish as much functionality as possible. Hence, your patient's ability to re-learn how to walk, talk, and bake a celebratory cake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right and wrong lol. Yes, you're correct. The brain will not physiologically heal itself. However, the function of the brain is to form synaptic connections that allow us to process and store information coming in from our senses. A person who has suffered a stroke and developed a left side neglect will suffer death of the tissue involved in the stroke. BUT, if they are able to regain use of their left side, and learn to scan to the left for visual input, and are able to functionally go about their lives post stroke, the brain has &quot;healed&quot; in that those connections are reformed, and progress is made on the cognitive deficit.</p>
<p>Is it going to heal the matter? No. Will they be able to regain function? Possibly. The amount is variable- some recover fully, others not at all. But the potential for those neural processes can be reestablished is there (neuroplasticity) and frankly that's how we measure the progress the patient is making in brain healing.</p></div>		</li>
