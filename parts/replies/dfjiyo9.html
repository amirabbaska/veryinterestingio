<p>Ah-haha. Hey, then every day is a &quot;explain like I'm five&quot; day. And that's cool, for much rather that than flip-side of dealing with the self appointed know-it-alls. </p>
<p>Retired now, and when someone asks what I did for a living, in fun I reply that I boiled water. And loved it! Those who don't creep off giving me sideways glances like I was just let out of the funny farm, then explain I was a steam boiler guy. And if still interested, can talk up a blue streak with it. (Like I'm doing here?, lol). But lots to it folks just have know idea, as sure you've come across.</p>
<p>Anyhow, hats off to you appliance techs. Though much similarity with some controls, etc, I get all cramped up &amp; claustrophobic-like frustrated working in such confined space. Feel more at home with room to move slinging around a 36&quot;-pipe wrench, ha. </p>
<p>Praise the Blue Collar and keep on truckin', my friend.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add to this that what is important with heat (the transfer of thermal energy) is the temperature difference between the two items. </p>
<p>The interior of the oven will still be &quot;warm&quot; after you're done placing, say, creme brulee very carefully in the oven. So the food starts being cooked immediately. It only takes the oven a minute or two to warm up again, depending on how well your oven works. If you have a convection oven, it helps to turn the fan off a few seconds before opening the door. </p>
<p>But it only takes a couple minutes to heat up again. Once the oven is above the boiling point of water, it heats up quite quickly. Ovens aren't exact science, they rarely hold the exact temperature you set them to, but flux a little above a below through heating cycles. This is all why all ovened recipes give a little leeway in cooking times.</p></div>		</li>
