<p>In general things become solid when they get cold, you need some tricks to avoid that. A thin gas without contact to surfaces is unlikely to become solid as only three-particle collisions can have two particles stick together after the collision (in two-particle collisions this would violate energy conservation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a few other interesting superfluids you didn’t mention.</p>
<p>Dipolar BECs (e.g. dysprosium) are interesting because they’re strongly dipolar, so you get different superfluid behaviour based on the surrounding magnetic fields and what direction the particle dipoles are pointing. It’s a bit like a superfluid ferrofluid.</p>
<p>Neutron stars are believed to be superfluid, at least partially. If true it’s interesting because neutron stars are not super cold like most superfluid systems.</p>
<p>You can get polariton BECs, which can almost be thought of as a superfluid form of light particles.</p>
<p>As long as your system’s particles are (or act like) bosons, and you can get it into a state (usually by cooling) so that a decent fraction of the wavefunctions associated with your particles drop into the same identical ground state, you should start getting superfluid behaviour. Most superfluid theory assumes your particles are non-interacting. Gasses (and to a lesser extent liquids) approach this limit. Interactions between particles shift the critical temperature for superfluidity; solids and most liquids are too strongly interacting for the theory to apply.</p>
<p>You need bosonic particles otherwise your particles can’t share the same quantum (ground) state. Interestingly, helium-3 also forms a superfluid even though it is made of fermions. The fermions pair up through a process called Cooper pairing and when paired act like bosons, allowing for the superfluid effects to manifest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading this gives me an idea. If you could somehow maintain and contain a superfluid, could you use it as a sort of kinetic battery? Getting this from the statement that it will just continue to rotate when stirred, since it loses very little energy in motion</p></div>		</li>
