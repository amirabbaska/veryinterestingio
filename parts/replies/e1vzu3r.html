			<div class="markdown"><p>That is absolutely fascinating. I’ve noticed this myself when scanning the night sky for the Andromeda galaxy. Even in good conditions it can be hard to see looking straight at where it should be (live near two cities), but with averted vision it’s much more easily perceptible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, so averted vision is still necessary for objects magnified the telescope?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Averted vision makes it a little easier to see dim objects, and telescopes make dim objects much brighter. A small telescope will let you directly view objects that the naked eye can only glimpse with averted vision, and glimpse in averted vision objects that a larger telescope would let you view directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not technically &quot;necessary&quot;. It makes a physical difference in how the photons interact with your eye. And it isn't about magnification of the telescope, it is about how dim the object you are looking at is. </p>
<p>During the day, everything is bright, even when the sun is behind clouds. That makes things easy to see and distinguish, when there is a lot of light entering the eye. </p>
<p>Your <em>direct</em> vision is better at seeing color. Your <em>peripheral</em> vision is better at picking up very dim objects where there is little or no light, and that's just because of how the eye works. </p>
<p>So, when you look at sometime directly, you'll still see it, but it will be blurry and you won't get much defining detail, where as if you look with your peripheral vision, your eye is more capable of discerning a small amount of light and therefor you get more detail. </p></div>		</li>
