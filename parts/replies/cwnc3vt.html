			<div class="markdown"><p>I find what you say very interesting! I'm an inveterate coffee spiller while walking with a mug of coffee. </p>
<p>From what you're saying, am I correct in inferring that if I walk while stirring my coffee (thus swirling it), I will be less likely to slosh it about and get it all over the carpet / my hand / my boots (assuming that I walk carefully enough to negate the danger of the edges of the swirl being higher up in the mug)?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> It totally works! Walking while stirring my coffee (in a coffee mug with a handle; I walked while holding the mug by the handle) caused me to spill none at all, and I didn't even have to vary my gait that much (to break up the standing wave). It seems to be independent of the size of the stirring utensil - obtained the same results with a little thin plastic stirrer as I did with a full-on teaspoon.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe.  The best thing to do is watch the cup while you walk.  If you're trying not to spill, you'll automatically vary your pace to break the standing wave.  Alternatively, get a lid.</p>
<p>EDIT: Nice experiment! I totally just pulled everything I said out of my ass so it's good to know my guess was probably right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have been employing the walk and stir method and it has definitely reduced the amount of spills I have. Also I try to leave 3/4&quot; of space at the top.</p></div>		</li>
