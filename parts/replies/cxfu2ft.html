			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in the wind industry and you know your stuff.</p>
<p>I'll also chime in that from a siting perspective, people absolutely hate looking at two blade turbines. Significantly more than they hate the three blade designs. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but given the how problematic NIMBY is for wind already, companies do take it seriously.</p>
<p>Even if two blades were as efficient and stable (which I believe they can be under the right conditions, but feel free to correct me), you'd likely still see companies focusing on the three blade designs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, Thanks for your vote of confidence. Very interesting to know most people prefer 3 blades over two blades aesthetically. Now that you mention it I likely do. As a engineer its easy to forget design requirements such as aesthetics in many applications such as this where it seems like function is everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a weird quirk of opinion, but like I said, when NIMBY is already so rampant for wind it's definitely a consideration (at least according to the folks I work with on this). I think efficiency + output trumps all (which is where you come in) but always good to consider all factors!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seen a few single blade turbines in New England.  They actually look really cool.  But whether these turbines are single blade or triple bladed, there are so many people that demand that they stop installing them.  It's kind of a NIMBY issue, I think, as the same crowds usually are against the installation of solar panels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very Neat, Ill look up one bladed turbines! Agreed on the NIMBY, People in general find change stressful. In many wind turbine installs the government just decides the location without discussion with locals, the benefits are not seen by locals as the power is always on anyways, so the only thing they see is the eyesore. They just need more planning and discussion with those effected. I personally don't believe in the low frequency causing issues that many people are up in arms about often. I have seen this near my folks cottage area with wind turbines. but I do know there is a pressure wake from these blades, and hearing one up close in person is a powerful sensation. I believe its used as reasoning to fight the install of more turbines because of the NIMBY issue, and cant be proven either way.      </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I've never been near a windfarm. But I can certainly hear the edge of lower ranged sounds easier than other people can.</p>
<p>So I don't see it being impossible that some people can barely hear it and it slowly drives them mad.</p>
<p>I worked around fairly loud equipment for a couple of years that was just inside the &quot;safe audio range&quot; so my hearing is rather shot in certain normal ranges..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can understand wind farms being a NIMBY issue due to noise pollution, but what is the argument against solar? Making the roof of a parking structure or building out of PV panels can be done in a way that looks fine aesthetically. And the panels have no direct effect on surrounding properties beyond looks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry mate, but it's not entirely right. Less blades is most definitely not more efficient. The most efficient turbine would actually be a turbine with infinite nr of blades spinning at infinite speeds. </p>
<p>The reason less blades is less efficient is because of the tip loss effect (different from the tip vortex!). Basically the tip loss effect describes the portion of the flow not being disturbed by blades, and this is more pronounced at the tip. The less blades, the more air is allowed to freely pass without noticing the rotor. Another way of looking at it, is that the free undisturbed flow at r>R is mixing with the flow slowed down at the turbine area (r\&lt;R).</p>
<p>This is basically the first reason why Betz is unattainable. The second is drag. Drag simply determines the optimum tip speed ratio, and dictates infinite speed isn't a great idea.</p>
<p>Sources: Wind Energy Explained by Manwel, McGowan, Rogers (2002). Looking at page 133 right now. Wilson et al. (1976) actually have an approximation for Cp_max as a function of nr of blades, tip speed ratio and Cl/Cd.</p>
<p>Other source: this topic is basically my master's thesis.</p>
<p>Summed up in a picture found on wikipedia:</p>
<p><a href="https://energypedia.info/wiki/File:Wind_turbine_limitation.png" target="_blank">https://energypedia.info/wiki/File:Wind_turbine_limitation.png</a></p>
<p>Additionally, lower nr of blades means higher optimum tip speed ratio: higher tip speeds: more noise.</p>
<p>As to your point about eigen frequencies. That's true, but not really a deal breaker. The critical rotational frequencies simply determine which tower lengths and hub masses aren't a great idea (mass on a stick). Most frequencies around 1P, 2P, 3P, 6P are avoided (P rotational frequency) for a three bladed turbine. A two bladed turbine this would reduce to 1P, 2P, 4P. Because a 2 bladed turbine has a higher optimum rotational speed this means a more convoluted range of critical frequencies. Could be a problem, but it's also easier to avoid.</p>
<p>One of the biggest selling points of two bladed turbines however is structural though. A two bladed turbine can be parked horizontally. Greatly reducing the loads while idle, which is nice during storms or while braking/start up (a critical load case). So yes, two bladed turbines are more difficult because of the frequencies, but there's some benefits to a balanced rotor.</p>
<p>Edit: the third reason Betz is unattainable is because some of the momentum is lost into wake rotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It just hit me. I realized why there is so much discussion and controversy on this topic!</p>
<p>There is two topics here, overall lifting surface efficiency and total power harnessed from the wind in a rating of efficiency. </p>
<p>My statement is based on lifting surface efficiency,
many others are on the &quot;efficiency&quot; of how much of the total wind energy can be extracted from the winds kinetic energy. </p>
<p>So we are all on the right track! just different topics haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey dude. I'm graduating in Mechanical Engineering, in Brazil, and I am very very interested in working with renewable energy. Do you mind answering how does one start a career in the wind turbine field? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey man, I haven't graduated yet and my only experience in the field is a year long internship at a Danish company, so I'm afraid I can't help you much in starting up. I need to that myself as well.</p>
<p>What I do know is that the Brazilian market is booming and a lot of (international) companies are tendering for the wind market in Brazil. The big players (Vestas, GE, Alstom, Siemens etc.) are all setting up or have set up a presence in South-America. </p>
<p>I think it depends on your interests where you should start. If you want to design the turbine or are interested in aerodynamics, the turbine manufacturers is where it's at (Vestas, GE, Siemens). The engineers of those companies may very well be located in Europe or the US, so that may be difficult. If your interests are more towards manufacturing, maintenance, field engineer etc. there will probably a lot of job opportunities. Wind turbines are exclusively build locally because of the size. Therefore a lot of companies will have Brazilian plants and offices.</p>
<p>I don't know how well versed you are in wind energy, but I'll give a brief overview of the fields where a mech. eng. is needed: blades: structural (fatigue)/aerodynamics/aeroelasticity/noise, hub: power electronics/structural/generator design, manufacturing: steel/large scale fibre reinforced plastic/mould design/transport solutions. And then there's all kinds of field jobs to erect and maintain the turbines.</p>
<p>So, if you have qualifications and interests in any of those fields, you'd be able to find a job.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your comments from someone in / studying in the industry, and I agree a impossible to make, infinitely thin and infinite blade and infinite speed in a mathematical model shows the highest efficiency but as we know its not achievable.</p>
<p>I am taking my knowledge from aircraft and crossing it over, and that dictates with only the blade surfaces in mind a single blade is most efficient based on coefficient of lift or lift vs drag, any lifting surfaces near each other have losses dictated on them from interference and further induced drag.</p>
<p>My opinion on this to all is to remember mathematical models are generated by us humanity and they have their limits, its a tool to find a optimal solution, it is not the hard rule. And a engineering compromise will be needed to find a good solution. As I know a infinity long wingspan with a huge A/R ratio on a aircraft would have the highest and most efficient lift possible I also know it cant be done structurally or practically in any order.   </p>
<p>Thanks for your suggested source as well, I hope to take a look at it some time. </p>
<p>Very good point on the parking on a two blade! I can see that being far more beneficial.</p>
<p>And momentum lost in wake rotation makes sense, makes me think of gas turbine stator and how critical they are for efficiency and blade loading in a multi stage compressor or turbine.</p></div>		</li>
