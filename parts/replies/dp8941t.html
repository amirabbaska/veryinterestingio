			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just a really nasty situation to be in. On one hand you want a sick child to have at least the chance at life. On the other you want the two people alive that would have had better success chances with those lungs. </p>
<p>I understand the parents choice to take this to court (everyone would have tried) but that girl already lost the first pair of adult lungs, is now on her second transplant and would need a third if she survives to adult hood. Stings a little if you ask me. Anyway, my thoughts go out to that girl - the surgeries and aftermath of them sound like torture; her Thoracic diaphragm is damaged and she's back on the respirator. So much suffering on all ends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I get that it's her kid, and I'm sure I'd try to do anything too, but this seems a little selfish? She's essentially wasting a lung for short term value? I don't know.</p>
<p>If there's a surplus of adult lungs then that's different and should be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO it's not selfish, I get your point and understand it, but if it's your child you do anything in your power to save her/him. It's not that you are directly killing someone to get their lungs, still... someone may die if they miss those lungs that are trimmed, but definetly not &quot;wasted&quot;. It's complicated, but not a little bit selfish from MY point of view, I'm not trying to change yours, just adding my two cents mate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like you said the problem is that to save this one life you need two people to die instead of one. Further more you could have saved two people that may not get a transplant in time. So potentially 4 people are dying to save one. </p>
<p>Healthcare providers and hospital ethics boards fought it, hard. It was a pretty big debate inside the field for doctors and nurses. Cause of the cost of life vs the life of a single child who due to her illness (cystic fibrosis) would probably of had a good prognosis following the transplant barring complications. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree if they could live like that for a while until tyne come ones became available, but if it's desperation time and your kid might die before that then I am sure you'd push for it too</p></div>		</li>
