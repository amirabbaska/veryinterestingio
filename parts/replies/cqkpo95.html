			<div class="markdown"><p>To play devil's advocate, what good would it do if United States apologized for using nuclear weapons against civilians or for genocide against Native Americans? That won't bring the dead back. Every nation has deeply embarrassing history. The bigger the nation, the more embarrassment in its past.</p>
<p>As to my own opinion, such apologies might be a good first step to healing the animosities among the descendants on both sides. But done poorly, these apologies might only stir the pot and brew more anger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the US has already apologized for the poor treatment and mass destruction of the Native American people and their culture. And the nuclear weapons were in a time of war, not a random action brought on by hatred. But I agree with this statement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US government isn't going to apologize for the use of nuclear weapons because its deterrence strategy is based on the understanding that it would use those weapons again. It would pretty self-defeating to apologize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, many Turks died in WWI, so Turkey apologizing would anger the many descendants who had their families tortured and massacred by Armenian armies led by General Andranik.</p>
<p>I have extended family of Armenians who were massacred by Armenian Dashnak rebels, for refusing to participate in the seditious act of rebelling for independence. They wanted peace with the Ottoman Turks, and they were murdered for being disloyal to Armenians.</p>
<p>Collective apologizing and collective punishment never works. There were many atrocities on both sides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Empty apologies ring hollow for sure, but any measures imolemented to prevent such attrocities in the future would go a ling way toward healing old wounds. Without dialogue, nothing gets fixed. In that way, thus relationship between countries is like that between individuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Accepting responsibility is also made more difficult when instigators see themselves as victims, too. The Russian response to questions about mass rapes by Soviet soldiers in Germany (and, as far as I understand, to some degree in Poland and Hungary during the advance) has essentially been &quot;How DARE you, Soviet soldiers were the only ones putting up a real fight against the German army for years and the Soviet population suffered the most casualties.&quot; </p>
<p>If you spend enough time looking at different countries' national narratives, everyone tries to play the victim. So while you and a friend from a rival country might be able to get along just fine, getting entire countries to do so strikes at the very heart of each one's identity. The only time this has really been addressed is in the post-WWII German case, and let's be real - a crucial reason was because they lost. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is literally all of international relations. State actors act within their interests. This works both ways, though, and I'm generally wary of countries who demand apologies, too, because I'm not convinced that it isn't the pursuit of their own political agenda under the guise of seeking justice. Basically, too much university has made me not believe anyone ever. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why can't we (by we, I mean every country that has a shitty past behavior - which is probably most countries on the planet) apologize? Wouldn't that help heal wounds? How hard would it be to say &quot;I acknowledge and recognize my past actions. I am sorry I put you through this. Let us work together now and make sure it doesn't happen again&quot; - how hard can that be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent question. Probably because some people would like to believe their history is untarnished, and facts, even those you can apologize for, get in the way.</p></div>		</li>
