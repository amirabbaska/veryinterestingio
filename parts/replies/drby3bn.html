<p>Pain in your neck is 'somatic pain' and from muscles and joints, as are tension-type and cervicogenic headaches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when I had nerve pain in my shoulder they focused on getting me to hold my head up straight. The biggest thing to doing this isn't to use muscles, but rather to make sure your lumbar lower back is curved in far enough. I never realized it but whenever I would stand or stretch my back I was trying to straighten out my lumbar, but I should have been bending it in further. Once this part of your back is bent in far enough to support your chest properly, then your head will naturally pop up and sit on top of your shoulders. It may feel really weird but that's because you've been training it for years to feel natural in the wrong position.  It will feel like you're sticking your stomach out and your butt out, but you're really not sticking it out further than it should have been already. (it feels more exaggerated than it looks)</p>
<p>Practice that alot.  And then also from that position, practice letting your head fall backwards. a normal person should be able to face straight at the ceiling (I did not know this but I could not)  When your back is right, you should be able to. </p>
<p>It will take a lot of practice for this posture to feel comfortable or even &quot;normal&quot;  but it should be your normal standing, walking and ESPECIALLY SITTING position.  If you can't sit like this when you work, move your keyboard and mouse until you can. If you still can't then your chair is bad.  Use a small pillow or towel rolled up to push your hips to tilt forward until your lumbar is properly under your chest while you sit.</p>
<p>This position will relieve a lot of the subconscious muscle stress and awkward angles for the nerves that have to pass through holes in the vertebrae.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or could be like me where my lumbar is exaggerated and I have to do breathing exercises to turn off my hip flexors so I have less curve. </p>
<p>If your low back looks flat/even with your butt, the above may help.</p>
<p>Posture does not necessarily correlate with pain, but it can be a contributing factor if the posture disallows muscle balance.</p>
<p>Also, with the neck, if there are fixations (places where bones are stuck in an unnatural place) then there will be lots of stiffness and muscles that are on the stressed side are being pulled taut and work all day in a futile effort to correct. Then, when you yawn, turn your head, or sneeze--something that requires extensive and unconscious recruitment of muscle--you are at high risk to experience spasm or even a tear. C1/C2 is the most common fixation that makes the first 30Â° of flexing the head forward impossible. Your head will drop to your chest without your chin properly tucking in. This fixation is often seen in computer and cell phone users. </p>
<p>If you can find a massage therapist with an orthopedic specialist cert you can have your range of motion assessed and the bony fixations softened by gentle muscle energy techniques (they assist you in doing exercises so that your body essentially realigns itself). If you can't find that, a chiro who uses an activator device is great also. Personally, knowing what I know now, I would never get a high velocity adjustment on my neck.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter so much what your range of motion is, the first thing that should be observed is what the end range feels like. Is it soft? Is it bone-on-bone-like? This says a lot about what you actually need for your body. </p></div>		</li>
