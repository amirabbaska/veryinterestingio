<p>One interesting thought that people in the nociception field (a fancy word for noxious stimuli like pain) is that it was the very first kind of memory to emerge. So, according to some folks, all learning and memory exists as modifications of the original circuit, which had the purpose of relaying something that we might consider pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool! My research is in cognitive science (I'm a PhD student in the Philosophy of Science but I'm also part of a psych lab). Interesting proposal. But I wonder why pain memory should be thought to precede pleasure memory? Seeking behavior seems to me to have a better claim to being more basic: the first creatures to move probably moved to eat, not to avoid things.</p>
<p>Maybe the idea is that the most basic seeking behavior is highly canalized (so doesn't have to be learned), whereas avoidance behavior is more likely to result from learning?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know exactly what you mean! Many of us in the neuro community diverge a bit from the psych community here, since we're misguided engineers at heart.</p>
<p>The idea is as follows: it's much more important to encode information about noxious stimuli than it is about pleasurable ones, like chemotaxis towards food molecules. That's a bit of a philosophical argument, but the idea is that you have a very limited time, and number of times, you can escape predation and environmental damage. But, y'know, you might be able to skip out on getting a glut of food. Generally, it's just about having the opportunity to reproduce. Predation ends it, starvation weakens it. Many butterflies, for instance, are born without functional probosces because they're just a means to an end, and that end is more butterflies.</p>
<p>Moreover, when we study these circuits, we see they are far more well-conserved between species than pleasure circuits are, so it's a hint that it existed before too many evolutionary divergences happened. In the literature, the much talked about Kandel paper (Nobel Prize, foundational literature for memory neuroscience) was looking directly at a nociceptive circuit, for instance. Researchers forget this.</p>
<p>So the idea is that noxious stimuli formed the evolutionary pressure for an organism to have to remember things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer to your first question is a simple one. A mistake in pain memory would often have more dire consequences than a mistake in the pleasure memory. As an infant you realize when you touch certain things (e.g. a fire or.something hot) that it hurts and should be avoided. If not it could be the immediate end of your life. On the flip side, realizing food/milk is good for you, or pleasurable, would likely cause you to want it more. The lack of not having it immediately likely won't cause too many problems. Short answer, pain memories have an immediate impact on life/death situations, and are therefore more important. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Cheesecake is high in fats, oils, and sugars. Homo sapiens didn't evolve in modern society where we can eat as much food as we want high in fats, oils, and sugars. These calorie rich foods are all scarce in the environment where anatomically modern humans evolved, i.e. the African savannah of the Pleistocene era. So it was adaptive to eat as many foods rich in these things as possible. This is why we evolved brains that crave these kinds of foods, despite the fact that overeating these foods does considerable harm to our bodies in our present environment.</p>
<p>(note: the psychology of food preference is a bit more complicated than that. In any case, we can say that we have a defeasible tendency to prefer calorie rich foods.)</p>
<p>edit: haha, I probably interpreted your question too nerdily.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aren't fats the same thing as &quot;oils&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can you say something like understanding the evolution of pain and then say cheese cake does damage?</p>
<p>Cheese cake doesn't do damage.  In no way shape or form.  </p>
<p>Maybe you are thinking of a lifetime of bad habits eventually over working your heart?</p>
<p>Cheese cake is an evolutionary awesome thing for our body. </p></div>		</li>
