			<div class="markdown"><p>Robert Sapolsky's lectures he gave at Stanford concerning Aggression argued that many anti-social behaviours, that have been so far explained with psychoanalysis in this thread, could be explained by lesions to the pre-frontal cortex. These may be caused by an accidental brain trauma or physical abuse. You can find many of his lectures on itunes or youtube if you're interested. They're part of an excellent series of lectures called Human Behaviour or something geared towards the lay community. </p></div>		</li>
