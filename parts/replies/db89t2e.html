			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;establishment of religion&quot; was strongly referencing historical situations where a state had an official church with mandatory membership and attendance- you could be fined for not attending church.  And let's be clear, not &quot;any&quot; church, you had to attend an official Anglican church set up by the state.</p>

<p>That's a very special status.  Could a Jewish synagogue fine others for not attending THEIR church?  Of course not.</p>
<p>Presently, many middle eastern nations DO require adherence to specific Islamic practices.  Iran requires business be closed briefly for prayer time at multiple points in the day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>nor is it establishing one</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It certainly feels like it is.</p>
<p>One nation under a deity from a monotheistic religion that is recognized by the name &quot;God.&quot; This narrows down the choices pretty significantly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Establishment in the first amendment is referring to the church of England where you had one choice.   Same in a lot of Europe.<br />
Even today they have state religions that tax money goes towards supporting.     </p>
<p>In the US it was saying you can't have an official religion and can't support one over others.   Caveat here is it had to be a legitimate religion (sorry FSM) and showing symbols or referencing it aren't establishing.   </p>
<p>The first amendment gives you the freedom to believe and worship without the government interfering. </p>
<p>Basically,  this isn't limiting your religious freedom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of Justices that would agree with you. The Establishment Clause is one of the most legally controversial portions of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court has consistently failed to adhere to a single standard for when it is violated. I just finished a paper on it, and one of the law journal articles I cited identified over ten different tests the Court employed over the space of a decade. Standards under which &quot;In God We Trust&quot; does not violate the Clause have just narrowly won out over time, albeit usually in 5-4 decisions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God isn't a name. It's a synonym for deity.</p>
<p>Some names attributed to the Christian god are: YHWH (an abbreviation of god’s true name which has been lost to time), Jehovah / Yahweh (attempts to recreate the name which YHWH abbreviates), El Shaddai (“God Almighty”), and Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Plenty of words are generally understood to refer to this god, but act more as descriptive words or nicknames that are given significance by context, like “father”: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are all descriptive nicknames Christians use for YHWH.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Kinda, not quite though.  It was more of a writing style where the reader was left to supplement the vowels, like shorthand.  Since it was revered as the name of God is was not to be pronounced and at some point people forgot how to actually say it so the best we have now are guesses.</p>
<p>Some pronounce YHWH as Yehova and some as Adonai, some still as Yahweh though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's part of the process, you don't have to say God when you're swearing to tell the truth.  It's like the part in a marriage ceremony where they say &quot;til Death do you part.&quot;  It doesn't mean you have to stay together until death.</p></div>		</li>
