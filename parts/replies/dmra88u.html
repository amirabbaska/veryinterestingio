			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Book sales for well known preachers are staggering. There's absolutely no need to take in a salary when you're making millions off of book sales. People want to assume the worst. Now, does it look great for them to have these huge mansions?  Nope, because they're supposed to be serving people and helping and people expect ministers to be humble, not ostentatious.</p>
<p>The ones you have to look out for are people in your every day churches who have an opportunity to access funds, no other source of income, and keep increasing their standard of living. At a church I went to, it came out that the guy who handled the finances had embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars over years. His big new house and the big new house he bought his mom were a big red flag.</p></div>		</li>
