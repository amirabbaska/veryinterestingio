			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because it is not a regulated term doesn't make it worthless though.</p>
<p>They are &quot;marketing&quot; that they are selling fish fit for sushi, and taking steps to ensure safe rawfish. Develop trust in that promise or don't, depending on the brand and how much you &quot;trust&quot; that brand. </p>
<p>Also they have a lot of incentive to be careful because advertising &quot;sushi grade&quot; and selling unsafe fish would be a clean and easy lawsuit, and several.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they aren’t. They made the term up to sell raw fish to non-Asian restaurants.  The term has no legal meaning.  Much like the term “natural” has no meaning.  </p>
<p>All marine fish are sushi grade.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Their advertising it as sushi grade, which means &quot;safe to eat raw&quot; to most people. If that's some random cut to fish though it might not be safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably more likely that almost all fish sold in the US is parasite free (or sushi grade) since regulations require fish to be frozen at a certain temp/time. So the sushi grade fish probably won't make you sick but neither would normal fish. Similarly, I've read that the odds of an egg having salmonella is something like 1 in 10,000, so the odds from getting sick from raw eggs is actually pretty low.</p></div>		</li>
