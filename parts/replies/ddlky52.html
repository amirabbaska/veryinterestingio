<p>Oh, this would make a lot of people go free, you say? Yeah, fix the fucking system then, it's obviously broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a brilliant idea and way to formulate it.</p>
<p>Norway, where I'm originally from, has a slightly different system but with similar aims: There's no public defender, but anybody accused of a crime is entitled to a lawyer of their choice, paid for by the state.  Any lawyer asked to do this is (to the best of my knowledge) not allowed to refuse.  I'm sure there are some limitations as to how much to pay the lawyer, but limitations on ability to defend is not a topic that I've ever seen come up, so I guess it's enough to not be a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prosecutors usually have an insane caseload too that's why they offer plea deals in 99% of cases.  And often they dont have more than 15 minutes either, their plea deal is based on charges and rap sheet and experience not the entire file usually (at early stages). The private attorney will have 30 cases/month while pros has 30/day and pd 100/month.  Only one of those can read whole file and show prosecutor weak facts and why a better deal makes sense and provide caselaw etc. to back up arguments.<br />
The system is flawed and criticism is easy, coming up with a better one is hard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Combine that with the fact that most prosecutors are also new to the law ('Shockingly incompetent') and rather than screw up a case in court (and, therefore, lose their stepping stone to a cushy job at a firm), they will give decent plea deals to all but the most airtight cases... closing the circle.</p>
<p>So, while they are more inclined to actually prosecute cases that will get them career attention, those cases are the ones with real lawyers on the other side...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This... is insanely logical.</p>
<p>Why haven't we developed some sort of Lawyer AI to substitute for public defenders? Or at the very least, augment the public defenders? Just plug in the charges/accusations and let the glorified google machine spit out all the relevant laws, loopholes, and whatnot. I feel like we have had the technology for this for along time now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The IBM Watson Agent Program has a Lawyer Mode, actually.</p>
<p>It can handle searching for relevant Case Law, and collate data for the Lawyer's review. <em>However</em>, it still takes Watson a lot of time to go through <strong>literally every case in American History</strong> that has been digitized and find the relevant cases where the Judicial Precedent is binding in your jurisdiction. Even then, the lawyer has to spend time to read through what Watson has gathered... and 240+ Years of Binding Legal Precedent has a way of piling up.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, the way that Federal and State funding <strong>usually</strong> works means that this won't help the situation much. Improved Productivity generally leads to a cut in the budget, so that the money can be sent somewhere that's low on required resources. This isn't because Politicians are <em>evil</em>, mind you. </p>
<p>Most Politicians I've met in person are generally Idealistic and believe that they're doing the right thing. However, they've got a ton of choices that they have to decide between. Do you send funding to the Road Maintenance Crews, so <em>that one bridge</em> gets replaced before it's due to be decommissioned; or do you fund the Public Defenders, ensuring that even the poorest people can get a fair trial and all the Protection that the Law should give them? Not funding either one screws over a lot of people. Not fixing the bridge screws over a greater number of people when it gets decommissioned. Not funding the Public Defenders causes <em>much more harm</em> to a smaller number of people.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that smaller number of people will likely lose their right to vote if they aren't helped. So... guess whose problems get solved?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or if that's not an option, which one harms more people? Lack of representation since time immemorial or one bridge in the last twenty years?</p></div>		</li>
