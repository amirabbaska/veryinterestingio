			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, no one knows the whole story. Speaking for some of the nasa projects, fellow engineers are not told what project they are working on or how their part fits with every thing. Only the PhD knows what the big picture is. This is an efficient form of secrecy because if only one guy knows that part you know who leaked it. If the whole project is leaked it's  the PhD if only part of it is leaked it's the engineer in charge of that piece.
I've actually seen projects where no one at the facility even knows what it's for not the engineer or management, some of those actually caused quite a bit of fuss as to where they are going or what to do with it in the meantime until some general comes to pick it up six months later. </p>
<p>Tldr: if you break it up small enough, the pieces don't even need to be classified, only how they fit together</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Classic example being Bletchley Park where Enigma was broken. Clearly everyone on site knew that they were a SIGINT/Codebreaking group, but the guys in Hut 3 would literally not have known what the people in Hut 2 were doing. Codebreaking obviously, but not on which signals or ciphers, or whether they had had any success. People working on German ciphers wouldn't know anything about Russian ciphers, how many were in use, for which units of the military or which huts were working on them (and whether they were breaking them successfully.</p></div>		</li>

You can't ask questions about things you don't know about.</p></div>		</li>
