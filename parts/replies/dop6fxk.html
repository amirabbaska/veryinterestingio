<p>At least, I think that's what they're asking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you look from side to side, does everything look all blurry while you are moving your eyes?  Probably not.  You see one clear image and then another, even though your eyes are open while you move them.  This is saccadic masking, your brain sorta cuts out the brief moment while your eyes are moving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I understand. The still snapshot you see when rapidly moving your eyes, rather than the blurry composite your brain makes when viewing rapidly moving objects/scenery with a steady gaze. Thanks friendo.</p></div>		</li>
