			<div class="markdown"><p>You notice getting used to low food during stomach flus. I had a 5 day stomach flu years ago and after day 3 of no food I stopped being hungry and by day 6 when I was all better I didn't want to eat anyways as I felt fine. Took me days to get where half a sandwich a day wasn't enough.</p></div>		</li>
