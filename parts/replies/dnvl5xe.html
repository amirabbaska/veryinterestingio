			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the current record holder is JET in the UK, with a fusion energy gain factor of 0.67 (1 being the point at which you get back as much energy as you've put in).</p>
<p>If memory serves me correctly I believe NIF reported that they had gained energy relative to the amount of energy that was put into the fuel, however that wasn't the same thing as the energy required to run the lasers (i.e. they don't include waste heat energy generated by the lasers, they don't include energy lost when the lasers are reflected off mirrors etc.), so the energy out was still a lot less than the overall electrical energy they put in running the lasers. </p></div>		</li>
