			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't 5 minutes a little long for some launches? For example, a Space Shuttle to the ISS. Or something like Gravity Probe B, which according to Wikipedia only had a launch window of a second; would you happen to know more about this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hold time is not the launch window. It is &quot;if everything goes right, we'll hold the countdown at -0:30 for 5 minutes.&quot; If something goes wrong and the countdown has to hold for 2 minutes 30 minutes before launch, everything is fine - you just reduce the hold time to 3 minutes and still launch at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see.</p>
<p>So what's the point of this hold time? Seems a little redundant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This all depends on the vehicle, manned or unmanned,  and has a lot to do with the overall performance in flight of the vehicle, fuel carried, payload weight, battery/apu/and propellant drain back/replenishment time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, sorry for the delay, was taking a day off from the net.  OK,  I gave OP the I am 5 answer, as they asked about interplanetary launches.  I dealt with the shuttle my whole career.  Most of the shuttle launches pre-ISS could have a launch window 4-5 hours long, if we were putting a satellite into say an equator launch for a geosynchronous orbit.</p>
<p>For missions like our satellite rendezvous and repair, your launch window is tight.  You have from the time the satellite rises over the western horizon, and sets over the eastern horizon, in generic terms.  On a good pass, that would give you about 5 minutes tops.  With the ISS, we tried to launch the moment the ISS was overhead, but could go a minute or two early or late, depending on winds, weather, or boats/planes violating the range.</p></div>		</li>
