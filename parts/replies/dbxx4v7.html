<p>the pheremones you release from your armpit sweat, when smelled by other females, actually modifies their menstrual cycle which is why women who live in the same household tend to have synced menstrual cycles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;After the initial studies, several papers were published reporting methodological flaws in studies reporting menstrual synchrony including McClintock's study. In addition, other studies were published that failed to find synchrony. The proposed mechanisms have also received scientific criticism. A 2013 review concluded that menstrual synchrony likely does not exist.&quot;

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to point out that there is no evidence that indicates women sync up their menstrual cycles. This myth comes from a single study on a small number of women in a university dorm that no one has ever been able to replicate or confirm.</p>
<p>And as far as I can tell, the study you link does not mention this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.  There is zero evidence of this and it drives me crazy when someone states it as fact.</p>
<p>A woman's cycle is on average 28 days. Unless the woman is on daily birth control, this varies.  This makes it nearly impossible for one or two women to not eventually sync up, <strong>randomly</strong>.  It will not last!</p></div>		</li>

<p>You hear about cases of this all over the place and experience it so often, I'm honestly surprised science hasn't found more evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, let's define &quot;all synced up&quot;.  does that mean everybody starts on the same day?  They overlap (mine ends just a day or two after yours starts)?  They follow in line with one another (mine is Week One, yours is Week Two, etc.).  </p>
<p>Here's the thing.  A) There are only four weeks in a lunar cycle. B) Almost zero women have perfect one week menses and 28 day cycles all the tie.  Therefore, if you have more than three females, there's bound to be some sort of overlap eventually. I have -- in the past -- lived long term with four other women (sisters and mom). Five women.  Four weeks.  Variations in the cycle.  It's inevitable:  there is gonna be overlap. There are even months where Sis and I might start on the same day.  </p>
<p>If you believe in syncing, then there's your &quot;proof.&quot;  if you don't believe in syncing, the only significance to read into it is that you're spending a lot of money on hygiene products and Midol.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, 99% of the time, my sisters and I couldn't agree on what TV show to watch after supper.  No way we'd sync up our periods (more practically designated as &quot;the bitchy time&quot; of the month and &quot;the even bitchier time.&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some of the first evidence for subtle smell cueing came from reports that women who lived in close quarters, such as those in college dorms, ended up with synchronized menstrual cycles. Subsequent research has shown that armpit sweat—from females or males—when placed on women's upper lip, can modify cycle time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does mention that they cannot pinpoint the pheremone that does this so there is some questioning the accuracy of the study</p></div>		</li>
