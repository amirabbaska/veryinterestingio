			<div class="markdown"><p>One way I would describe it is that think of harbors. They almost always have what is called a &quot;break&quot; to prevent large ocean waves from reaching shore by breaking them into smaller waves.</p>
<p>Now, just replace ocean waves with sound waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that will happen is that the suppressor will heat up a lot, lower end suppressors are only rated for a few shots at a time and higher end ones can be &quot;full auto&quot; rated in order to handle more heat and more gases better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first shot is often the loudest actually. Google “first round pop”. There’s better explanations out there than I can give but typically subsequent shots don’t get much louder. At least not to the point where it’s audibly different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard this as well. Apparently it has to do with burning off the oxygen in the suppressor. If you fire subsequent shots off in succession, O2 won't have time to fill it back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've fired suppressed handguns, and the first round seems like it's always the quietest by a large margin. Maybe I'm not paying enough attention and the second is actually quieter, I dunno?</p>
<p>But even a dry suppressor definitely gets louder, often notably so after only a handful of rounds. With medium (I always used some kind of grease. Vaseline is cheap and effective), you only get about three shots before most of the grease you put in is blown out or vaporized (i.e. what was actually packed in the baffles), and the thinned-out residual grease is pretty much gone in another ten. It's mind-blowing how hollywood-movie-quiet a .45 with a wet suppressor is on the first couple shots. And equally surprising is how damned loud it'll be before you've even finished a single magazine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The video shows a millisecond counter on each shot. You can see on most of the suppressors the gasses are mostly clear within 5ms. Even on full auto most guns are going to be 50ms+ between shots.</p>
<p>For example, the M4 can fire 950 rounds per minute on the high end. That is still ~60ms between each shot. </p></div>		</li>
