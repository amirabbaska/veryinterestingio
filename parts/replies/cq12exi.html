<p>The reason they often don't react? They don't care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not so much that they don't care, but that they don't have anywhere near the same capacity for social expression and comprehension that dogs do. Dogs evolved as pack animals driven by complex social signals, and so they've evolved the capacity to communicate via body language. Cats on the other hand, were more solitary animals, meeting only to mate. Feral cats for example tend to not form packs, but rather establish separate territories.</p>
<p>Because of this difference in evolution, dog's ability to read more refined communication between each other (i.e food, enemy, we go this way, etc) allows them to more easily communicate with humans. Despite the fact we have different bodies they can still usually manage to understand hand gestures and the differences in intention between subtle vocalizations. If you intently direct your vision at something while clearly speaking to them, many dogs will correctly interpret that as you directing them to pay attention to what your looking at or go there.</p>
<p>Cats on the other hand are similarly intelligent, but they do not anywhere near the same ability to interpret social communication, nor do they have the inclination to obey a dominant figure. While they may respect you as being in charge, the concept of you making decisions as the leader is simply not one they understand. The extent of their understanding is that they respect your ownership of the territory (the house). The only way to get a cat to do what you want is to get it to come to it to get the idea on it's own, as it won't be able to understand your directions.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> When a cat does not react to a command, it's not disregarding you because it doesn't care, it simply has no idea what you're trying to tell it. Cats only naturally communicate their emotional state (i.e anger, fear, pleasure, relaxation, desire etc) , and so have no way of directly coordinating socially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cats being independant thing is a bit of a myth. Domesticated cats will usually be territorial with other domestic cats, and see their humans as their family (as well as other cats in the house and sometimes dogs). Feral cats will actually join together to form colonies (a clowder) and defend their territory from other cats or clowders as a team. They form bonds, share food sources and groom each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before domestication, cats were strictly solitary. But when they gradually approached humans, they become a bit more &quot;social&quot;. This is because human food storages (and where their preys appear) are concentrated in small places, so &quot;traditional&quot; territories do not work for them. Thus cats evolved to tolerate each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are dead on.  Dogs are easy to train, because both dogs and humans are social creatures, we speak largely the same language.  </p>
<p>Cats are just as trainable, but what people don't usually realize is that the first thing you have to do is teach them that command-&gt;action from the cat-&gt;reward .  Once you have that down, it's largely identical to training a dog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Cats can still be trained, but one must realize that they will learn only on the basis of giving them incentives, and each communication method must be trained for. Dogs excel at understanding on the fly; they do not need to be trained in every specific nuance of communication, as they learn subtle communication on their own just as young humans do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to call my old dog by different names and hed always react, even if I called him shitface. ((Edit: also worked with, george, fred, any other name. And it worked using different tones as well for the most part..)) He just always knew I was talking to him... I do the same to my current dog and its much the same. ((Although, I havent tried it in different tones)). Though sometimes hell just lay there and pretend to ignore me, but the wagging of his tail always gives him away when he hears his name. He also likes to ignore me on purpose and listen to my fiance instead. Or when I call him over he goes to her just to be like &quot;fuck you, she has tits bro&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine dogs use much the same logic as we do to determine whether they specifically are being addressed. After all, when one dog barks at another, they aren't calling their name either, but it's still pretty obvious who they're barking at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only within the last few years did it occur to me this is the reason for the phrase &quot;cat-calling&quot;. I had always heard it and somehow assumed it had to do with cats being noisy or something. Nope, like the cats being called the people being &quot;cat-called&quot; don't respond either.</p>
<p>To many people this may be a 'duh' but I didn't know it damnit!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I guess the properties given to the word catcall allows us to use the word dogcall when the situation involves a male instead of a female?</p>
<p>I don't know why that fascinates me but it does. </p>
<p>Do words work like that in other languages usually? Is there a language that comes to mind that wouldn't work like that? </p>
<p>Although I doubt anyone would make the connection if I used the word dogcalling in a sentence unless they were familiar with the original word or are good at ebonics and slang. But how easily would someone recognize the intent of the word catcalling if they didn't already know it?  Why am I asking these questions....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really good!</p>
<p>Took off some of the weight I had regained after losing my gym membership. I don't think my upper body was this in shape even when I was going to the gym regularly. Really good core and stability gains.</p>
<p>No routine as of yet, still just doing it idly throughout the day. Gonna do a post eventually about it but haven't had the time to organize more with it. But it's pretty good as just as a jungle gym.</p>
<p>Been workin on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdUf5mWhR7U" target="_blank">shameless plug here</a> instead.</p>
<p>Thanks for asking!</p></div>		</li>
