			<div class="markdown"><p>Highly variable from person to person, or highly variable from day to day? Because if any individual person is reasonably constant over time, it really doesn't matter much if the baseline for reporting calories is &quot;total calories&quot; or &quot;calories absorbed by an average person&quot;. You'll still have a modifier of some sort to apply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, some metabolic diseases can reduce the amount of calories absorbed. Crohn's disease causes the intestines to slowly convert to scar tissue and as a result parts of the digestive tract simply don't allow for absorption.</p>
<p>So each individual person might retain less nutrition/calories from the same food depending upon the specifics of their tract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have Crohn's and IBS.  When I was 5'10&quot; and 115 pounds for 2.5 years, I probably absorbed 50% of what I ate.  You compensate by eating a lot more, which doesn't help the absorption problem.</p></div>		</li>
