			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very loaded question.</p>
<p>How often does this happen? Are there certain movements/positions that cause it? Do you have other symptoms? Any other neck pain? Headaches/jaw/arm pain? Numbness or tingling?</p>
<p>There's a lot that goes into prescribing exercises.</p>
<p>In general, a lot of the muscles of the neck are actually anti-gravity, and don't actually benefit for more than a brief moment from stretching. The neck requires strengthening of the shoulder girdle/upper back, as well as some specific strengthening of muscles called your deep neck flexors. Which exercises are right for you depend on your injury and its irritability - ie working deep neck flexors too much too early can worsen headaches from your neck. There's also a huge posture component.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are tons of things you can do for it. </p>
<p>A therapist can mobilize/manipulate (stretch joints), perform soft tissue (muscle) releases, dry needling, and prescribe exercises.</p>
<p>There are some medications that can help reduce inflammation and nerve pain.</p>
<p>General activity (like walking) as tolerated is important. Modifying activity to avoid irritating the nerve further is important.</p>
<p>Other pain modifiers such as heat/ice/topical ointments can help slightly with pain so you can do more.</p></div>		</li>
