			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, valid without citing religious opinion. It is definitely an ethical crossroads even before you get people's faith involved. It's really a matter of when we consider an organism a human being. I'm not particularly religious, but knowing that an embryo has human potential makes me a little iffy about the issue myself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not bad reasoning. The only problem with this argument is that once harvested, embryonic stem cells can be cultured indefinitely, so embryonic stem cell therapies theoretically wouldn't require vast numbers of embryos. </p>
<p>The only argument I've ever heard is the religious one. Religious people are largely Republicans, resulting in approximately half of U.S. politicians opposing stem cell therapies either due to their own beliefs or to ensure their re-election. </p></div>		</li>
