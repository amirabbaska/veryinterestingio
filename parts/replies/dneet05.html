			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that another barrier is political. It's hard to get representatives from states outside that corridor to vote to spend that much money on something that doesn't directly benefit their constituents, particularly when thier constituents likely have transportation projects that they need funding for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even harder to get them to vote for something that will never be financially self-sufficient. Amtrak runs so far in the red that, even at extremely high ticket prices, tickets are still around 75% subsidized by tax payers (outside the NE corridor). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I understood is that the ticket prices are so high because that's the only way they can provide service to little podunk towns in the middle of nowhere Kansas for example. </p>
<p>The trains going through these tiny rural towns is apparently a huge deal and a lot of people rely on them for a lot. So the million people paying hundreds a month to commute to NYC or DC, etc. allows random rural towns to have a rail lifeline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our roads aren’t self-sufficient either. They are supported by tens of billions of dollars in tax money, dozens of times more than amtrak has gotten.</p>
<p>Let’s make literally <em>every</em> mile of roads in the US a per-mile toll road so that users must pay their own way, and see how fast our rail system gets built out. The only reason road travel appears less costly is because you don’t pay at point of use.</p>
<p>Oh, and the subsidies outside the NE corridor only exist because congress forces amtrak to serve those routes. We can’t bitch about tax money for those routes when amtrak wouldn’t even have them but for congressional mandate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is the main reason rail will never be a viable option. When a new line was proposed between Milwaukee and Madison it was dubbed as high speed. Yet the time for the train was actually slower than a car driving the interstate. And there was also the expensive state subsidies that would never go away. Plus if you are a farmer or anyone else from the Madison area and traveled to Milwaukee (which would be slower and more expensive even with the subsidies) what do you do when you get to Milwaukee? If you drive there in your car which would be cheaper and faster you would just drive to where you want to go. If you took the train you would have to get an extremely expensive taxi, take the bus, or walk. No option makes any sense. Yet Milwaukee's mayor loves the idea. Why? Who knows. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've been seeing a lot of hate and disagreement here and I think it's uncalled for. The U.S. interstate highway system was one of the largest construction projects in human history and took decades to complete. I hope someone has a better source but here's the only one I found. (<a href="https://interestingengineering.com/top-5-biggest-infrastructure-projects-constructed" target="_blank">https://interestingengineering.com/top-5-biggest-infrastructure-projects-constructed</a>) Yes it's true there are now areas the require extensive maintenance and upgrades but I cannot fathom a project of this size that once complete exists in perpetuity without the need to be repaired.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nobody said roads don't need to be repaired, but for scale, feast your eyes on this: </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its not throwing away, its adding to it.</p>
<p>Highspeed rail requires very straight, very small inclination path.
If theres any private properties in the path it can cost a lot of money to revoke. bridges/tunnels add significant cost to the path, more so then regular train due to the larger turn / smaller inclination required.</p>
<p>It costs a lot to build. High speed trains above 186 m/h (300km/h) increase the wear require more maintenance ($$$). </p>
<p>over large distances i think its less cost effective then air travel. </p>
<p>also in platforms where trains pass through at speeds above 100 m/h require a physical barrier 7 feet away from the edge of the platform, making the platform a lot smaller (and when converting existing platforms, quite ugly too) (according to euro standards).</p></div>		</li>
