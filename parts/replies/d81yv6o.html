			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose this all boils down to an energy cost issue.  Although it likely something as a species we will end up doing at some point just so we can transmute material from the gas giants for use as building material when we get to the point of stripping the solar system of usable materials.  Via something like this  (Megastructures 09 Nicoll Dyson Beams <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjtFnWh53z0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjtFnWh53z0</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if we survive that long sure. If we ever get to harvesting whole planets for resources and collecting a resonable fraction of a stars output as the power to do so, making materials may not be such a big deal (haven't run numbers, just know that stars put out a large amount of energy, and that making materials in an accelerator costs a large amount of energy. They could still be orders of magnitude off.) But by that point, we are talking about a society with technology so vastly superior to our own ,we can't really speculate about their needs or methods of meeting them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From an engineering point of view. we likely could start work on such a mega structure in less than 50 years assuming automation technology holds.  </p>
<p>The bottleneck is software. We have the robotics to bo it now. And lunar regolith is 20% silicon, 14% iron, 9% calcium, 8% aluminum, 7% magnesium.  Almost perfect material to build mirrors and optics out of it.  Even if the starting goal is just a solar light array. </p>
<p>The only issue I can see on a self-sufficient fully automated system that can be self-replicating. Would be some bottleneck resources like hydrocarbons and doping elements for semiconductors. But if we have that locally on the moon then this is doable. </p>
<p>There no reason we couldn't use a few of the Falcon 9 Heavy send a collection of robots to the moon. Task them to build manufacturing and resource gather facilitates near the lunar poles to take advantage of eternal light.  You might be able to task the robots to build a basic mass driver as well (although the engineering on that is a tad bit more exotic) to get things out of the lunar gravity well. </p>
<p>But once things are up and running, and your spitting out mirrors and optics into orbit.At that point we have the ground work done to start larger projects.  For example smelting resource asteroids directly with said solar light array.</p>
<p>I'm betting you can sort of see where this goes from a scaling point of view.  The moment you have access to that much energy along with effectively free labor you can sort of set loftier goals. </p>
<p>And everything I just layout here can be done with the current robotic system we alredy have if our AI systems just get a little bit better. Any odd edge case situations could also be handled by remote human operators.</p></div>		</li>
