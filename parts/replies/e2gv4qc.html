			<div class="markdown"><p>I go right before bed and I drink plenty of water throughout the day. That doesn’t mean that drinking large amounts of water immediately before bed isn’t going to wake me up though.</p>
<p>And what good would peeing then drinking do? It would all still be inside you.</p>
<p>Much better advice would be to drink first thing in the morning and throughout the day, not wait until you’re about to sleep then drink.</p></div>		</li>
