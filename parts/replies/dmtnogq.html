			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, great answer. I am definitely looking into more references.
But I suppose there would be a limit to speeds? (apart from sound speed) at a certain point the centrifugal force would win over the pressure difference, especially for clouds at large radius or not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a Master's in Meteorology, currently working towards a Ph.D.</p>
<p>Work done by Emanuel in 1987 provides a theoretical pressure minimum (from which, using some assumptions about the flow and friction, a speed maximum can be calculated) for any given storm in a location. This is derived by treating a hurricane like a Carnot Heat Engine, and making some assumptions about the radial temperature gradient in the &quot;mixed layer&quot; and dissipation. Ocean temperature is an important part of the equation.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about this equation is that it yields no solution occasionally, instead leading to a run away process of intensification of the hurricane. This only happens in extremely warm climates with very high ocean temperatures which could only exist at very specific points in Earth's geological history, such as the one decribed above during Pangaea. Emanuel theorized that the Earth would experience &quot;hypercanes&quot; during this time period, which would achieve pressures as low as 700 mb and would reach into the stratosphere. These storms would be extremely disruptive to the atmosphere and potentially harmful to the ozone layer.</p>
<p>There is some debate in the community, however. Some further work has questioned some of the assumptions made in the initial paper, though the concept as at least a good approximation has held up well. As to the hypercane, it is unclear whether these storms could happen, or if they could really get that strong. Eventually other processes that aren't important initially begin to become important, such as turbulent vortex breakdown, and some of the initial assumptions begin to break down, like inflow being isothermal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for adding your clarification at the bottom. Paleotemperature proxies are very difficult to quantify - given that mass extinction causes themselves are still debated it's useful to recognise lots of this isn't consensus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question:  Would the makeup of the atmosphere have a significant effect on the strength of these theoretical storms?  </p>
<p>For example, I remember hearing somewhere that the oxygen content of the atmosphere was much higher in the distant past.  Would that have any effect on the storm's strength in comparison to today's atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna take a shot at this. </p>
<p>There have not been any studies that I'm aware of to this question. But yes your correct however there are other factors that are more likely to limit it than this. At 700 mbar and below shallow ocean would essentially start being treated as land. Ie the storm would suck out the energy to quickly to feed it at shallower than let's say 100 meters which would likely limit it long before a centrifugal force. Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow geology student here.  Great answer!  </p>
<p>I was happy to see a reference as Dr. D.L. Kidder. He was my historical geology professor and has done some amazing work with hothouse Earth.  He retired at the end of spring 2017.  If anyone has a chance to meet him ask about Chattanooga black shale and the song with it.</p></div>		</li>
