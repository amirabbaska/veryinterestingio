			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation. To an extent, in my opinion, the Zipf's law is understood to occur to underlying, unobserved variables. Despite our best attempts to account for them they still exist. Again, in my little experience reading up on this and seeing examples of it, it often seems to comes from things that are seemingly random but are all similar. </p>
<p>Even when looking at populations in a city, yes there's no clear explanation for Zipf's law but we're still drawing from cities that very well could have similar factors affecting whatever specific issue you're comparing across those cities or within one city. Similar to language, where it was discovered and recognized so clearly, those same structures to a sentence end up making a lot of sense.   </p>
<p>It's still interesting af though. I know statistics tries to account for random chance and any other influences that may have on an outcome. When it comes to something like words who are all defined by similar sentence structures and connectors or people who are all defined by human nature, in my opinion, it becomes too hard to account for all of it. A kind of we don't now what we don't know (or understand) kind of thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the paper also do a good job of explaining why giving people a list of random nonsense words to use in a story ends up with those words following Zipf's Law?</p></div>		</li>
