			<div class="markdown"><p>The skull itself does not normally contain the spinal fluid (CSF). It is contained by a leathery membrane called the dura, which envelops the brain and spinal cord. At the end of an operation, we sew the dura closed, which keeps the CSF inside. Pressure changes in the CSF do cause headaches, but the pressure rapidly equilibrates after surgery, since we all make and reabsorb around 400mL of CSF a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. But you can't do brain surgery without opening the dura, so it's not really something you can avoid. Draining spinal fluid under controlled conditions in the operating room is generally safe. This is one reason why brain surgery patients commonly have a headache after surgery (see also: the big incision we just made in their scalp).</p>
<p>Edit: I should add, drainage of CSF is actually a critically important step of brain surgery, not just a nuisance we wish we could avoid. Draining the fluid relaxes the brain and makes it softer, which eases our work in many cases.</p></div>		</li>
