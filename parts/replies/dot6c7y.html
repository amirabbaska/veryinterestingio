			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember learning about esters in chemistry. Went to a college in Sydney and the cafeteria there had these glazed donuts with pineapple flavour that I liked. One day after lunch in chemistry class we did this experiment producing esters. One of them smelled exactly like that donut I just had for lunch. I quit eating those after that class. :-)</p></div>		</li>
