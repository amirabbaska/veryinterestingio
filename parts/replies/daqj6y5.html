			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in a medically induced coma for nearly a month and when I woke up i had the most ridiculously huge boogers. It was like removing a small finger from my nose, I can't even begin to describe how satisfying it was, almost made the coma worth it (not really, but silver linings and all that)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had surgery during which my nose was broken.</p>
<p>They then put some long strands of tissue in the nostrils.</p>
<p>When after a couple of weeks the doctor pulled those things out, it felt like slowmotion super-intense sneezing coupled with pain, but oh boy was it worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so I just asked my mom &quot;Reddit has a question for you&quot; and sent her a screenshot of this thread. She's a research nurse and says she knows nurses who have patients like this. Her response was: &quot;Lol. Kind of. Yes. They have to clean their noses when needed. There are swabs specifically designed for it&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only ever gotten the ones that've migrated towards the opening of the nares (nose holes).</p>
<p>And only then on ventilated or unconscious patients. </p>
<p>I have never picked a booger from a conscious patient. Bloody scabs, yes. Boogers, no. </p>
