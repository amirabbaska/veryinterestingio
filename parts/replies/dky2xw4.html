			<div class="markdown"><p>Canned laughter can certainly be misused, and sometimes backfire. If done well, they can save a tv show. Iirc, the first real experiment with laugh tracks on tv was with the show Hogan's Heroes. They tried the pilot with and without the laugh track, and the laugh track was overwhelmingly more successful than without. Sometimes the audience needs to be told that a joke just happened. :) Live studio audiences fill the same purpose. If you've ever been to a taping, they will even sometimes prompt the audience with signs telling them what their reaction should be at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because to me jokes without a laugh track feel more real and authentic rather than 'WE WROTE THIS THIS IS FUNNY A JOKE HA'. I watched all of its always sunny and thank god that doesn't have a laugh track. Made me appreciate it and it was funnier because it felt more real, if that makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laugh tracks were used in radio shows as well, The Goon Show (look it up, it's hilarious) aired from 1951-1960 and featured a soundboard, laughtracks and often a live audience as well. </p>
<p>The best part of it was that they'd often make fun of their own laughtrack. E.g. the main character would tell a terrible pun and suddenly (obviously a cut to a sound sample) cheering and laughter would erupt and abruptly stop.  </p>
<p>Because it's all live (and the foley effects are hilarious) there are often parts where the main characters are audibly on the verge of giggling themselves. Which is far better than the <em>blank stare</em> of Big Bang Theory or something. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0072vdz/episodes/player" target="_blank">There's some episodes on BBC</a>, a couple on youtube and <a href="http://goonshowradio.radio.net/" target="_blank">a radio channel</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laugh tracks work for me are when it seems genuine.</p>
<p>Seinfeld has countless moments where the crowd's laughs can be memorable and elevate the hilarity that much more...one I always remember is when Elaine throws George's toupee out the window...there's a guy who is cracking up and his laugh kind of trails longer then the rest...makes that scene i think</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can handle them in most shows, but good god, someone working for Big Bang Theory needs to be freaking punched.</p>
<p>Edit: hah! I apparently wasn't the only one who thought of this show first. Just read all the comments above. Ugh!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically, sitcoms with laugh tracks are repulsive IMO. Mockumentaries, like The Office and Parks &amp; Rec are often funnier to me, because it is not forced laughter and is entirely made up of the content of the joke. The release of endorphins is just that much more pronounced. </p>
<p>Is there an explanation for that or do you think that my sense of humor is just not like that of mainstream laugh track comedies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's a few things at play:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you enjoy the show and are laughing you don't really notice the laugh-track because you're kinda mentally (if not physically) chuckling along too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you <em>don't</em> like the jokes, then it'll likely grate on you a lot more because you're being told something is funny and it isn't. Whereas with a show without a laugh-track the writers might have though quip or phrase X was a fantastic joke but because there's no 'laugh here' cue you won't even notice that you missed an unfunny (to you) joke and therefore your &quot;they thought that was funny?&quot; frustration counter is much lower</p>
</li>
<li>Also, sometimes I have found that I  <em>notice</em> the laugh-track, it can really throw me and suddenly I cannot un-hear it and it just grates (at least for me). Sometimes when go back to the same show I've forgotten about it or not thinking about it so the annoyance disappears again</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well put. Definitely some logic behind this. I just feel laugh tracks are too often used and it bothers me a little too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this explains why I've been kicked out of a few classes in high school until I could calm down. I honestly wished I could stop at that moment, but nothing could stop me from laughing harder and harder. That shit is no laughing matter. Especially when the muscles in your stomach start cramping and hurting because of it.</p></div>		</li>
