<p>Trump's claims of charitable contributions include 2,900 rounds of golf at his businesses.  This comes with a very high claimed market value and this translates into a very high tax deduction.</p>
<p>However, the actual cost is not tangible.  One possible viewpoint is that if they were not given away, the appointment times would go unused, and there was no cost involved in these rounds.  </p>
<p>As such, the &quot;donation&quot; is not what you'd think, where you have $$$ in your pocket and choose to sacrifice that wealth for a cause via donation and then NOT have that money.  Rather, this is starting with no money, making a paper donation, and having net gain in money-in-pocket due to the &quot;donation&quot; process.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think  you can claim a deduction for labor, just donated assets.  The golf rounds are assets.</p>
<p>I think a better question could be, what if you wrote some POS software thing, sold 2 copies for $50, then donated 50,000 copies to Goodwill?  Well, they have an established value of $50- but they're not useful to anyone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Enough money and lawyers to front the IRS if they ever came sniffing would be my guess. It's likely a game common folk don't even get to play, let alone play with different rules</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned, the rich play with a different set of rules than anyone else.</p>
<p>For example, look at all the faked businesses of Trump owned businesses declared bankruptcy. Do you think a mom and pop proprietor could have that many business bankruptcies and still get loans from financial institutions for new businesses?</p>
<p>I have two analogies for all the talk of bootstraps in this country: it's much easier for someone to get to home plate when they are born on 3rd base versus someone trying to get home when they and born just in time to step up to the plate. Society always plays favorites. Look at most major sports. There are always different rules for superstars versus contribution players. Steph Curry travels, the refs often won't call it. A sub that sees less then 5 minutes a game travels, it will be called every time. A player that hits Sidney Crosby hard but legal will most likely see a penalty. A player that hits a 4th liner in the same way won't.</p>
<p>There are different rules for the rich than the rest of us when it comes to taxes or business behavior. There is a reason that the U.S is now at the highest levels of income inequality since 1928. The rules for today are written to benefit those at the top. This is from 2013, but it's even worse now.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why, love it or hate it, Trump (or more precisely, his Tax Attorneys) ARE smart.  They exploit such loopholes in tax law.  </p>
<p>This is also why many conservatives (not RINO/Neo-Cons) want to close many of the tax loopholes.  </p>
<p>Raising the tax rate only will hurt the middle class, while the rich will continue to exploit such loopholes, just to a greater extent.  However by closing the loopholes, more money would go from being in these 'charitable events' to actually being written to a charity, or a check to the government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why retail and fast food set up charities? People donate a combined extra $1M for the year, and then the company donates that to a charity they set up so they can deduct it from their income, so they get a bit of a matching bonus?</p>
<p>Then there's <a href="http://www.loveofreading.org/en/overview" target="_blank">http://www.loveofreading.org/en/overview</a> where Indigo/Chapters requests donations to buy books, from themselves? , to donate, to their own foundation... and it just feels like Chapters is making mad bank on this deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Money donated directly to a charity (even one set up by the company in question) is money to the charity, not the company, no deduction. The Ronald McDonald House box on the registers is money to the charity. They can write of the &quot;x% of our proceeds go to charity Y&quot; money because that was the company's money and was then donated, but remember that a tax write off is not the same as a tax credit. The write off reduces the taxable income, so the total value of the write off can't exceed the total possible tax liability (simplified, IIRC there is some carry over stuff that can happen in some cases). So if the company donates 10% of their proceeds and they had 100k in income, assuming they're liable for a 25% tax rate, normally they would pay  25k in taxes. Instead they'll pay 22.5k in taxes, so the company gave up 10k in income for a 2.5k reduction in their tax bill. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you can't deduct other people' donations.  And you don't have to have employees donate anything in order to &quot;match&quot; the donation.  Matching is just a way to help increase donations.</p>
<p>From a corporate/business perspective they are probably just doing good things with some of their profits in order to garner good will from both employees and customers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, if you donate stock that has appreciated in value, you write-off the current value of the stock even though you paid less for it. You are getting some of the value of its gain without paying any capital gains tax for it.</p></div>		</li>
