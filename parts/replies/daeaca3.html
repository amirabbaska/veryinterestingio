			<div class="markdown"><p>This is on the right track - and is part of the reason (and is addressed in leading answer) but you've got the mechanism a little bit off...</p>
<p>The chemical you're referring to isn't produced in the bladder, it's a hormone (vassopressin, antidiuretic hormone) that causes your renal system (kidneys) to reduce the rate at which water is removed from your system as they decontaminate your blood, so less urine is produced and that which is produced is more concentrated. That hormone though does not directly effect your sleep.</p></div>		</li>
