			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just because those languages didn't have a word to specifically describe blue. Lots of color words came about relatively late in history. The English language lacked a word to describe orange (although they did use &quot;yellow-red&quot;) until the 14-1500s when the fruit physically made its way from southeast Asia to Europe and people began referring to the color using the name of the newly arrived fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japanese was the opposite, blue was one of the first color words, and the word for green was much, much later.</p>
<p>And they also use &quot;orange&quot; to describe that color, though the pronunciation is orenji. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it is actually very similar to most languages. The Japanese word for blue, ao, didn't originally refer to just blue (and it still doesn't), but rather referred to blue/green/violet/gray/etc. Similarly most languages had a generic color term to refer to blue and green and similar cool colors together. </p>
<p>To this day the Japanese still use ao to describe these other colors because of the way you can use the adjective directly. For instance, green apples are often called ao-ringo (blue apple). If you wanted to describe an apple as green then you couldn't say midori-ringo, but rather you would have to say midori no ringo and that's just too many syllables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, Hindu mythology interprets some gods as having blue skin. Do you think there's any possibility of this due to blue being a rare color and hence interpreted as a unique/divine label?</p></div>		</li>
