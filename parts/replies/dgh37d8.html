			<div class="markdown"><p>Random mutations happen all the time.  Replication errors result in tiny changes to the genome, and unless these mutations cause a change that allows the resulting phenotype to be selected against, these mutations are passed from generation to generation with little effect.  Albinism would be one example of a phenotypic change typically caused by a mutation in several different genes, but that can manifest without these mutations.</p>

<p>DNA replication errors cause your aforementioned genome changes.</p></div>		</li>
