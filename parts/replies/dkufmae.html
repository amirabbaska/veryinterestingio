			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing a special on this.  The taxi drivers are required to take an insanely complicated and memory intensive exam to be licensed.  Is it possible the years of studying and practice for the exam creates their complex spatial awareness?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's hard to say which came first, the brain shape or the job, I think that's probably pretty likely. I'd say actually performing the job probably goes a long way towards doing this as well. </p>
<p>One hypothesis could be that people who make good taxi drivers don't necessarily start out with higher hippocampus grey matter volume, but are rather predisposed to generating new grey matter in these areas via experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite London taxi levels of knowledge required, but I'm a pizza delivery driver and we have set areas that we cover, some people use GPS for a couple months while they're getting to know the area, some people do it for a week, some people for the whole time they work there. There's definitely some level of it being a natural thing first I think, but it's probably a combination of the two.
I think they'd have to have a <em>reasonable</em> sense of direction to even consider going for the London taxi license and all the studying just improves it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They had good test subjests. London taxicab drivers have to learn every street, alleyway, pub hotel and tourist spot in London before they get certified. It takes around 2 years to complete. </p></div>		</li>
