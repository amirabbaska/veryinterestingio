			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to war mentioned by another commenter, density of people may have been a factor.  In fact, in modern times it's only recently (within the last 150 years) that cities have had a net positive birth rate.  More people died in cities that were born due to the disease and other factors that increase dramatically when you pack more people in together.  Combine that with inaccurate &quot;knowledge&quot; of how disease spreads and literal shit in the streets (or people drinking from sewage contaminated rivers) and you have a recipe for plague.</p>

<p>Of course, Rome isn't a perfect analogue for Industrial era London, but not knowing how to effectively prevent disease and the ease of spreading it in a dense population were definitely still relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the urban life and war mentioned, general health of the population was recorded to have decreased in the archeological record around the time of the agricultural revolution. I guess that partly nutritional changes (suddenly lots or carbohydrates in the diet, plus less varied food, plus teeth issues), partly zoonotic diseases are to blame here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Skeletons from Greece and Turkey show that the average height of hunger-gatherers toward the end of the ice ages was a generous 5' 9'' for men, 5' 5'' for women. With <strong>the adoption of agriculture, height crashed, and by 3000 B. C. had reached a low of only 5' 3'' for men, 5' for women.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Life expectancy at birth in the pre-agricultural community was bout <strong>twenty-six years,&quot;</strong> says Armelagos, &quot;but in the post-agricultural community it was <strong>nineteen years</strong>. So these episodes of nutritional stress and infectious disease were seriously affecting their ability to survive.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>We seem to be doing OK in general terms. How are the free folk fairing? Also, 'bad luck' isn't a thing.</p></div>		</li>
