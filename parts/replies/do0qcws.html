			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, it's applicable. But, as the article states, that would be magnitudes less than just fluctuations due to battery level (&quot;one hundred-millionth&quot;). And at that small scale, we wouldn't be able to measure it anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea if we were talking about 2 identical memory cards one full and one empty there would be a slight difference. In the case of a phone the electrons just moved from the battery into the NAND</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that you're measuring extra electrons, in fact, the electrons DON'T move from the memory to the battery or vice versa. The number of electrons in the memory stays the same, but the transistors holding a &quot;high&quot; value have trapped the electrons in a higher energy state and, therefore, provide more mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have worked with scales that can measure fraction of milligrams (0.1-0.01mg) and even the tiniest air currents or vibrations from people moving around or dust from the air settling on the scale made  the scales oscillate wildly. That's why they were enclosed in a box</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be even less than that because the example is not calculating unused vs used space, it's calculating all bits set to 0 vs all bits set to 1.</p>
<p>EDIT: I was wrong, they accounted for this and the math is for a 50-50 split of 1s and 0s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this most storage devices don't have their unused space kept at all 0's, the unused space is usually random 1's and 0's. It's entirely possible that by saving files to your phone you could end up with more 0's and less 1's than you started with and your phone could end up &quot;lighter&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

Your phone's memory is heavier when it is empty.  As far as I remember, this is dwarfed by the change in weight due to battery charge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Assuming that all these bits in an empty four-gigabyte Kindle are in a lower energy state and that half have a higher energy in a full Kindle, this translates to an energy difference of 1.7 times 10–5 joules, Dr. Kubiatowicz calculated. Plugging this into Einstein’s equation yields his rough estimate of 10–18 grams.</p>

<p>The article does the calculation assuming that half the bits are set to 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...but those electrons would still all be there if you erased the internet (by writing over it, on every hard drive etc., with all zeroes). The weight of the energy differential between &quot;the internet&quot; and &quot;the internet overwritten with all zeroes&quot; would be much smaller than that strawberry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This won't perhaps be the answer you're looking for in terms of mass of electrons, but may be interesting none the less.</p>
<p>Let's assume this website is roughly accurate in terms of how much data the internet holds as a whole: <a href="http://www.live-counter.com/how-big-is-the-internet/" target="_blank">http://www.live-counter.com/how-big-is-the-internet/</a></p>
<p>Then let's assume all of it is held on 6TB hard drives which weigh about 1.7lbs a piece.</p>
<p>The total weight would be 3,289,389,216lbs (1,492,041,850kg). Or 23 aircraft carriers, more than the entire world has in service.</p>
<p>And that's not even counting the servers that hold those hard drives, or the racks, or the datacenters built to house them, or the tons of equipment to keep that datacenter cool and powered. It really becomes impossible to calculate very quickly.</p></div>		</li>
