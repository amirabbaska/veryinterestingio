<p>Another easy example: what happens if you draw two parallel lines? On a flat plane, they'll never intersect. But if you draw two parallel lines running north/south at Earth's equator, they'll intersect at the poles.</p>

<p>That's one way. The curvature of the universe is also connected to the expansion rate of the universe, so we can look at how redshift changes with distance to measure it. For this, we look at type Ia supernovae, because they are pretty consistent in inherent brightness, so we can figure out how far away they are just by how bright they look from here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Be careful here, you're conflating the notions of parallelism with two lines being perpendicular to the same line. In the plane, these notions are identical. On a sphere they are not. Two parallel lines <em>by definition</em> do not intersect. However, two lines perpendicular to the same line may still intersect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof. It's a simple question, but the answer is pretty mind-blowing.</p>
<p>In a flat universe, it's a Euclidean geometry in every direction. We call this &quot;flat&quot; because, if we imagine a 2D space, it would look like a flat sheet stretching in every direction. The main feature of a flat universe is that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.</p>
<p>In a universe with &quot;positive curvature,&quot; the angles of a triangle add up to <em>more</em> than 180 degrees. &quot;Impossible!&quot; you scoff. But we have a very good analogue right here: Navigating on the surface of the earth. We can build a triangle consisting of three right angles (two on the equator, and one at the pole, say). Every one of the lines is perfect straight <em>with respect to the surface of the Earth</em> (technically, these should be called &quot;geodesics&quot;), and yet the sum of the angles is now 270. The upshot of this is that, in positively curved space, if you head in any direction and &quot;go straight,&quot; you'll eventually (in finite time) come back to where you started. A universe like this is exactly the same, only in 3D space. So if you head into space and fly straight, a positively-curved universe will eventually bring you back to where you started (in principle, provided you can outrun the expansion of the universe and whatnot).</p>
<p>It's negatively-curved universes that are impossible to wrap one's head around. This so-called <a href="http://www.paradise.caltech.edu/cook/Workshop/Math/HyperbolicLand.html" target="_blank">hyperbolic space</a> has the curious property that, because the angles of a triangle add up to <em>less</em> than 180 degrees, space &quot;explodes&quot; in all directions. If you walk a mile, turn 90 degrees, and walk another mile, the shortest distance back to where you started is pretty much to turn around and retrace your steps, because the &quot;straight line&quot; (read: hyperbolic geodesic; edit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5sdyes/by_guessing_the_rate_of_the_expansion_of_the/ddf1fxw/" target="_blank">actually, see below</a>) linking your final destination with your starting point is <em>much much longer</em> than the path you walked to get there.</p>
<p>tl;dr You measure the curvature of space by adding up the angles in a triangle. On a sufficiently large scale, non-flat universes behave very counterintuitively.</p>
<p>Edit: Got positive and negative reversed, embarrasingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation. One note, though--you switched &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; curvature. Positive curvature is spherical; negative is hyperbolic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know that measuring the curvature of space is even possible? Wouldn't our giant distorted triangle rulers look normal to us if the curvature were to exist in a higher dimension that we are currently unable to even percieve? </p>
<p>Think of it this way: a man inside a youtube video is measuring a triangle using three rulers. If the youtube video were being played on a curved OLED screen, then the youtube man will continue seeing the same units on his rulers, despite the fact that to us, the cuvature of the video screen tells us that his rulers are wrong.</p>
<p>How can scientisits be ure about something if we don't even know if our youtube screen is curved in the eyes of a higher dimensional being??</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A two-dimensional analog:</p>
<p>A piece of paper is flat. If you draw a triangle on the (idealized) surface of paper and measure the interior angles, they will add up to exactly 180 degrees. </p>
<p>The (idealized) surface of Earth is positively curved. If you draw a triangle on the surface and measure the angles precise enough, you will get a sum of more than 180 degrees.</p>
<p>A saddle is negatively curved. The interior angle sum will be less than 180 degrees.</p>
<p>In principle you can do the same measurement in space: make a random triangle with straight lines, measure the interior angles, and see if they add up to 180 degrees. Triangles we can make with spacecraft are too small to expect a measurable deviation, but there are some tricks to get equivalent measurements in cosmology by observing things very far away, in particular the cosmic microwave background.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not necessarily. There are flat geometries with finite volume, e.g. torus-shaped (the topological torus, not the donut one). They are not isotropic, which would be odd, but we cannot rule it out.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Here's an arguably oversimplified explanation that may help:  two points of space are considered the same point when the distance between them is zero.  This makes intuitive sense -- if you have a coordinate grid and mark two points, (2, 3) and (2, 3) ... well you've really only marked one point, haven't you?</p>
<p>If the universe did originate from a single point (which is still very, very speculative), all that really means is that the distance between all points was zero at some finite time in the past.</p>
<p>As soon as the distance between points became nonzero, if the universe <em>is</em> infinite, then it would have immediately been infinite then and its size on the whole would not have changed since the moment of the big bang.</p>
<p>So yes -- the universe would have been infinite directly after the big bang.</p>
<p>Now, also note that just because the universe is expanding doesn't mean that the universe is finite.  Expansion is relative -- it just means that &quot;objects in space are moving away from each other.&quot;</p>
<p>Imagine a common household sponge -- the kind you wash dishes with.  Now imagine that it's an infinite sponge:  it goes on forever in all directions.</p>
<p>Early in the universe's history, that sponge would have been in a &quot;squeezed&quot; state -- still infinite, just very dense.  As time marches forward, the sponge relaxes, and the density decreased; but again, it's still infinite.</p>
<p>That is the sense in which the universe is expanding -- not like an explosion with an outward shockwave (that would be incorrect even for a finite universe), but rather like an infinite sponge that is de-squeezing.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you. I wonder how much of my perception of what the big bang was comes from science astronomy tv programs where when describing the big bang there is the sound of and explosion and a flash of light on the screen and then they show the universe or a galaxy or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you 'run the universe in reverse', you'll find that the distance between any two points decreases asymptotically to 0 as you get closer and closer to the Big Bang, but that doesn't mean that the distances were acually 0 at the Big Bang because the Big Bang is a singularity. Mathematically speaking, saying that the distance between two points at the Big Bang is 0 makes about as much sense as saying that the distance was 2, pi or 'green polka dots'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you've totally screwed with my mind, I was content ish thinking..nothing, explosion, matter flying all over the place in a kind one way direction(why is that) and that's the reason the universe is expanding!
Is the sponge explanation a theory most accept?
I prefer, universe expands to a point then contracts to a tiny point then explodes then we start all over again, I know this is not true but I can get my head around that!</p></div>		</li>

<p>We know that the universe was originally very very hot and very very dense. We don't know if it came from a point, or from another universe that collapsed, or if it just gets asymptotically smaller forever back in time.</p></div>		</li>
