<p>This is true, but they can probably write up an outline of how they want the missions to flow and tailor the map creation to fit that outline.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, the writing is done well in advance, and probably mostly finished when production kicks into high gear. The level design part has to be done after the base layout of the map has been set in stone (and modeled in 3D) or you risk ending up with floating/clipping objects and buggy missions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Writing is one of the last things done in a lot of video game productions.  I cant speak for GTA5 specifically as it was pretty unique in its development, but I think story is one of the last things worked on in a lot of video games.</p>
<p>In the NoClip documentary <a href="https://youtu.be/vsoVQWnSOfM?t=102" target="_blank">&quot;Doom Resurrected&quot;</a> they explicitly talk about how they locked down everything <em>but</em> the story until towards the end of development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The developers of The Witcher 3 said they built the map around the missions. They wrote the stories they wanted to tell, and then made a map to fit them. That's probably why everything in that game feels so consequential. There's no busy-work filler.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An open world RPG game or an atmospheric, story-based one? They'll have a lot of the writing done beforehand. On the other hand, an FPS won't bother with the story until late in the development progress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an advantage if they have such a large map with a large city in one place, a military base next to it, surrounded by nearly empty land and an ocean. If the story demands something, they can find a nice place relatively close by to put it. Need a large warehouse to mow down thirty gangsters in? There's one in the industrial area, we'll add in some details like extra catwalks and crates for cover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you mean baking when you say freezing (edit: or &quot;locking out&quot;, baking is when you do the heavy computation for lighting etc and at some point you have to stop changing thing since that baking can take hours/days (before it is baked, it is harder to estimate if there are areas that cause performance drops and/or if it looks perfect at the same time), locking out means the level geometry can't be changed, after this we &quot;paint&quot;, add textures, decals and non collideable objects such as patches of grass, elements that are only visual.). </p>
<p>I don't know how Rockstar internal editors work but i can take an educated guess and say that it is largely procedural. Terrain for sure is procedurally generated, with most of the vegetation, beaches, cliffs, mountains etc. having simple rules where to put what, what texture it has based on elevation, angle, surrounding stuff, special areas and regions that are exceptions to those rules (desert vs a prairie vs tundra all have largely similar shapes and forms). </p>
<p>Roads are laid by hand on top, the terrain will be shaped again (if i can guess, the terrain will retain the &quot;virgin&quot; data, how it would look like without any of our modifications, removing a building will return the terrain to the shape it was before the building was there). </p>
<p>But without really knowing how extensive their tools are.. well, it can either make full junctions with all the roadmarkings, traffic lights, walls, ramps etc. just snap in there automatically or it is connected in more manual fashion (still snaps in place..). This all improves level design immensely, you can just make a huge changes and not having to fix the surroundings. This approach needs a lot of testing and QA is very, very important. At the very end of level design, the level starts to get locked up more and more and final details are added but ANYTHING can change up to the last days, entire city blocks can vanish (don't think Rockstar has had to do this, the maps are quite consistent).</p>
<p>The whole thing has to also be optimized for &quot;streaming&quot;; loading and deleting the scene while we are playing it, this should fit right in with procedural tools for level generation: it is largely the same process; we have light data that says &quot;objects 14987645 is at XYZ1235.234657,-0.2656346, 973.39456 with rotation (XYZW) and scale multiplier in XYZ&quot; and he game finds the correct objects, translates, rotates and scales it (the 3 parameters that define EVERYTHING in 3D, in cartesian coordinate system), and places it on the scene. Collision layer can be and usually is separate so our game mechanics can be loaded before the visuals; game mechanics CAN'T wait for draw whereas anything that is sent to GPU is pretty much &quot;best guess&quot; anyway and has so many parallel computations that it just won't stay &quot;in sync&quot; with the actual game.</p>
<p>But there is a HUGE chunk of time spent to make the tools, a lion share of the whole development is about in house tools. Because if you can automate something, you usually should devote time on it. One week in tool making can save months in man hours.</p>
<p>edit: to note, i know only basics of these, have made some tools and worked quite a lot with large scale terrain autogeneration and no, not just in unity ;) but not a professional level designer.. at least not yet </p>
<p>To add, googling &quot; terrain heightmap &quot; may give some clues how GTA style game manages to store huge terrains. It is a grayscale image where each pixel is terrain elevation at that point. Nice little algorithms smooth it to look like very convincing surface. How we carry on from this point.. can't say i know how Rockstar does it but i can bet my lunchmoney for a month that it is heightmap based..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is unfortunate side effect but is pretty much the only option. Either we wait and the game stutters or we somehow load the visuals first, which would make you drop off from the map. The ground is anyway made from triangles with no 3rd dimension, it is not just infinitely thin, it has no thickness (which we can fix by employing a few checks but like so many that have accidentally dropped off the map knows, those don't often work, also checking constantly and in all conditions takes time and can cause paradoxes themselves). So many things would be better if we only had a way to store volumetric data better, so that our objects would not be empty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean locked in you can't modify (or at least not everyone can). </p>
<p>For a big studio I imagine the terrain is split into several layers: relief (mountains), terraforming (roads) and details (rocks and other small things), each of which get locked at some point to keep things manageable.</p>
<p>Most of the vegetation is placed using procedural tools (roads probably too).</p>
<p>For rural area biome painting is probably done by hand and procedural rules are used to make variations inside biomes. (GTA might take a different approach since it has a lot of hurban landscape).</p>
