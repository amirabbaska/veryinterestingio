			<div class="markdown"><p>I know your phone probably autocorrected you (damn phones), but for everyone's sake who don't already know, it's relative minor, not relevant minor. Though I guess you could argue it's relevant to the discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how come the exact same notes are two different scales, just cause you play them in a different order?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a scale is actually not defined as &quot;Note 1 Note 2 Note 3 Note Note 4, etc.&quot; it's &quot;Note Interval Interval Interval Interval.&quot;  </p>
<p>When you play on just the white keys and start on C, it's &quot;Note, Whole Step, Whole Step, Half Step, Whole Step, Whole Step, Whole Step, Half Step.&quot;  Which your ears hear as major, because that third not is a whole step above the second.</p>
<p>When you start on A, it's &quot;Note, Whole Step, HALF Step, Whole Step, etc.&quot;  That third note up being a half step is part of what we define as a minor key.</p>
<p>Every different starting note makes a different scale.  These are called &quot;Modes.&quot;  Playing on just the white keys, C to C (major scale) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_mode" target="_blank">Ionian mode</a> (Some people call this Hypolydian, but they are wrong).  A to A (relative minor) is the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolian_mode" target="_blank"> Aeolian Mode</a>.  (Some people call this Hypodorian, but I hate them SO much.)</p>
<p>Every mode has a different sound.  Some sound major-ish, some sound minor-ish, some sound different.  And this works in any key; if you play three flats, Ab to Ab is Ionian (major), while C to C is Aeolian (relative minor).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not that they are played in different order but it depends on where you start your scale or otherwise known as the mode in this case the mode is called Dorian there are 7 modes depending on where you start your scale. An A minor scale starts with A on the piano and you play all the natural notes (White Keys) to the next A note (octave), Where as the C Major scale starts on C while playing all the natural notes and ends on the next C. These scales share the same notes so they are relatives A is the Minor and C is the major. If you play the scales each will have a unique sound to them. The major scales sound happy and the minor scales sound sad and somber.
Your can find more info about this by understanding the circle of fifths [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1aJ6HixSe0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1aJ6HixSe0</a>.] but now you are getting into music theory which is more like math than music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Play them yourself (or look up a recording) and you'll know why.  They sound different and focus on different root notes and intervals.</p>
<p>If you remove the focus on major or minor and just look at the set of natural notes and the orders you can put them in, you get the seven modes, each beginning on a different note of the scale.  The notes themselves are less important than the relationships between them and which ones are played together (i.e. the chords used)</p>
<p>If you're familiar with Legend of Zelda and specifically Saria's Song (and being on Reddit, you probably are) this is a great introduction to modes and how the exact same notes in a different order have very different feeling to them: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ayBYqpeOAvQ" target="_blank">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ayBYqpeOAvQ</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer for people that never really learned to read music or play a scale. Other answers are assuming little things that anyone without a music background might not know. </p></div>		</li>
