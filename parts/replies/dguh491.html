			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's interesting.</p>
<p>But what if someone went to random Walmart's or something and spent a lot of counterfeit money. Don't they store a lot of the cash in the registers to give people change? Wouldn't that give a huge potential for fake money to circulate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there was a big scam in the 90s that did this at McDonald they would spend a fake 20 on a soda and end up with a lot of real money. they finally got caught because the extremely complex method they used to make the bills didn't get the ink all the way through. if i remember right it was an arcade they used one of the bills at the teller had a nerves habit of ripping the corners off of the bill well she ripped it off saw there wasn't any ink and called the police.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a small retail business owner, and you are pretty spot on. The manager of our local bank says that there is a tangible % of counterfeit bills ($10s, $5s, even fricken $1s) circulating. The lower denominations aren't scrutinized. and they rarely end up back at the bank because they are used as change / pocket cash. I see a lot of fake $100s, $50s, $20s, but I am starting to see more and more fake $5 bills. Put side/side with real bills you can really immediately see glaring differences, but when you look at them solo, I can totally understand how they pass so often. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was sent on a change run when I worked at a small local retail store. They gave me a few hundreds and I went to the bank to get them broken down into $20s, $10s, $5s &amp; $1s. Turns out that one of the $1s freshly brought back from the bank was counterfeit. Badly. We had some lulz back at the shop about that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Registers are swapped out every 4 hours, give or take, so yes, but the bills that make it into the booth and into a safe are not coming back out until it's time to go to the bank. There's separate boxes for money to be tsken out, at least where I worked.</p>
<p>Pretty much all counterfeit bills that are brought in are direct losses. It's pretty easy to spot decent fakes, but when you employ part timers for $7.50/h they could give fuck all. Most places offer zero incentives for it as well, pretty silly tbh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked at CVS for 7.60 an hour previously. Let me tell you this - I did not give a fuck about the tender I was paid or any abnormalities in transactions because originally I did notify my managers and all that shit but they never did anything and considering it was a shit job with shit hours with shit pay with no benefits I stopped caring. If your bosses that are supposed to be running the show don't give two shits (had a snatch and grab before and no one even called the cops, kid just ran out with like 800 dollars of beauty supply products because the cabinet doors got fucked because tags got stuck in them). </p>
<p>Most shady transaction I had was guy bought like 2000 dollars worth of Green Dot cards paying all hundreds. Obviously laundering drug money or some other ill gotten cash. Not a single fuck given. Guy looked like a thug (big mofo, in a coat during summer, looking left and right nervously).</p>
<p>&quot;Here you go sir, have a nice evening&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually stopped pointing out fakes to my boss. People get them occasionally around here as change and you can tell, but apparently it's rude of me to ask for a different five or something. Now I just slip weird stuff to the bottom of the till so he can eat it. I still check 50s and 100s in the light though, even though this is also apparently rude. <em>shrugs</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can tell you've probably spent some time in a grocery store just by you saying &quot;booth&quot; and &quot;safe&quot; haha. At our store the cashiers use the markers made for detecting bills and are trained to do it to each one out of habit. There's no incentive but I'm sure if a cashier neglected to use one and a bill slipped through, they'd be written up for it. Perhaps just the fact that the vast majority of employees use the pen has been enough to discourage any possible person looking to use counterfeits from even trying it with our store.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I bet they can pick them out immediately, just from dealing with real bills every day. Even good fakes will stand out. </p>
<p>When I was in grad school, I worked at a really popular campus bar. Some people have really good fake IDs. After a while, you've seen every real ID imaginable and the fakes, even really good ones, stand out. The guy at the door may have let you in anyway but it wasn't because the ID fooled him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Not every ID. When I traveled the US heaps of bouncers acted like they'd never seen my 2009 drivers license (they change the design every year) from my state in Australia and would test me on my birthday. Then they always called someone else to have a look. Although maybe they were showing the new guy an uncommon one so they could learn what they look like. Hmm. </p></div>		</li>
