			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for high-jacking your response but what you've said is good and I only wanted to add a few more bits of information.</p>
<p>Honey can go bad if the lid has been left open. Moisture can get in, causing the sugar/water ratio to favour bacterial growth.</p>
<p>But then honey contains hydrogen peroxide that stops bacterial growth and kills bacteria. It's actually the presence chemical as a disinfectant so their's potential for wounds treatment. That said...due to the wild nature of honey, there might also be a bucket load of natural allergens waiting to set off a severe allergic reaction...so I'd recommend Savlon instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once added a tiny bit of water to a spray bottle of honey to dissolve crystallized sugars. A day later the bottle was completely bloated from the formation of natural gasses that occurred when the sugar rich environment suddenly starting supporting microbial life.</p>
<p>As a chemist, I thought that that was pretty damn cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I busted open my shin doing box jumps at the gym a couple years back, needed stitches and of corse I didn't goto doc in time.  After finally going to doctor I was told I needed to be extra careful and thorough in cleaning the wound since it was too swollen for stitches.  After several weeks it didn't look like it was getting any better and looked as if it was probably infected.  I did some research and figured I'd try Manuka Honey before going to the hospital again.  </p>
<p>Well, now I'm now a HUGE believer in that stuff.  Within days the wound started looking better, felt better, and the gash even looked like it had started to close as if it were stitched up (I used butterfly closures, load of 40+ manuka, and a bandage to cover it all.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Have you ever had Savlon on toast? I'd definitely recommend Honey over Savlon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true! Feeding honey babies less than a year old is not recommended because it can cause Infantile Botulism which is a dangerous condition that leaves the baby weakened until treatment is given. Their underdeveloped digestive systems aren't able to kill off the C.botulinum effectively so they reactivate, grow, divide, and produce Botulism toxins. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it would also need to be in an inert atmosphere. Oxygen is pretty reactive. </p>
<p>Ideally, lower temperature would also be better. </p>
<p>Argon atmosphere, dehydrated, kept at -400 F? That's gonna last until human civilization is over! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was in a closed environment it does have a long shelf life. The issue being that most dehydrated food when exposed to even the moisture in the air will reabsorb it like a sponge. Creating an environment for growth. </p>
<p>In addition pure honey doesn't have oil which can go rancid and is mainly made up of stable sugars which won't break down.</p>
<p>freeze dried food can often have many years before going bad and even then is still likely edible but discolored or lost flavor of volatile oils etc, and general breakdown of components not due to product safety. </p></div>		</li>
