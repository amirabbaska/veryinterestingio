			<div class="markdown"><p>That is perfect.</p>
<p>The most interesting point about the US market is that we're not homogenous, weather-wise. Noone in New Mexico cares about this option.</p>
<p>Even my question betrays my ignorance &quot;We've all been there&quot;. Haha. Though I promise I was aware as I typed that not everyone is in my country, in my weather, or owns a car.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They did not show that on Breaking Bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live way deep in the south.  I can only think of a few times I would ever need this.  Where I live the winter is so mild it would almost be like Spring to someone from the north.  It may sound nice to you but I really wish we had some real winter weather, with snow and all that.  We see Christmas movies with snow and people all bundled up and you wish you could experience that on a daily basis for part of the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to pile on, but it really is beautiful. </p>
<p>On Saturday, there was a nice little snowstorm where I live on the East coast...I wish you could hear how snow sounds. It's this dampening quiet. Like a muffling. It really is sparkly and wonderful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I moved from SC to upstate NY a few years ago.  Be careful what you wish for.  IDC how pretty it looks and how great the idea sounds -- brushing 10&quot; of snow off your car when it's 10 degrees with 20mph winds is no fucking fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm in Alaska and have seen people crack their windshield with the forced air defrost on full blast. When it is -50F and you throw the heat on it, the glass can crack at the bottom. Electric would give a smoother and more consistent warm up, preventing the stress of thermal expansion on the bottom vs the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Minnesota pick up trucks are always coming out with &quot;Northland Editions&quot;.  Basically it means they have a buck painted on the fender and four wheel drive.  </p>
<p>What would really make a true northland edition vehicle would be: on-demand 4x4, all season radials, those defrost wires on ALL the windows, block heater, extra huge washer fluid reservoir, super heavy duty wiper blades, heat vents on the floor in the back seat, jumper cables standard, cold weather battery, seat heaters, dash buttons you can use with gloves on, removeable floor mats, extra protective coating to reduce salt damage and a buck painted on the fender.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish Canadian cars had this, it'd be much more reasonable of a demand. Maybe I just need to stop driving honda's and dodge's from the early 90's early 2000's.. But even the new Ford Trucks I see going around don't have them.</p></div>		</li>
