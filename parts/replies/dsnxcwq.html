			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. There are a lot of little considerations, but the largest is likely that it's cheaper to producer a whole unit with valves in place than it is to produce a single valve. Also, as the whole filter is meant to be replaced anyway, it's easier to simply replace the entire unit rather than repair the valve. Quality of a repaired valve is a fairly major consideration as well. Think of it like welding...a beam is stronger brand new than if it's been repaired. </p>
<p>Edit: I fail at words sometimes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dire consequences of a bad check valve make it unreasonable to suggest that a user field repair their valve mask. </p>
<p>If a piece of PPE has to be very reliable, it hard to guarantee it's performance after the materials may have aged and after it has been field repaired (especially by untrained individuals). The usual concern is aging of elastomers from ozone exposure. Most polymers slowly get attacked by ozone in our atmosphere. Many elastomers develop cracks and become brittle. </p>
<p>My guess is that a very serious piece of PPE would get put through some tests to assure that various junctions are sealing properly before they get packed up. There's a big difference between inhaling some tolune vapors spraying paint and inhaling tiny radioisotope particles.</p></div>		</li>
