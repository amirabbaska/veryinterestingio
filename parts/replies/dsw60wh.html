			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just for <em>venous</em> air embolisms though, since they are eliminated by the lungs in most cases (for example, one of the reasons you put a patient in Trendelenburg to place a central line is so that any air will travel toward the lungs and not &quot;float&quot; up to the brain). Arterial air embolisms — or venous ones that cross a PFO to become arterial — are much more serious even at small volumes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure they use a lot less than 10-20ml of air. More like &lt;1ml. And the air that is in the syringe is in the form of microbubbles, not frank air bubbles. And there is still a (very small) risk of ischemic events should a shunt be present. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do echo bubble studies frequently and the protocol at my hospital (Kaiser) is 9 ml normal saline and 1 ml of air. Granted, sometimes you’ll do a few injections, but don’t think I’ve ever done 10. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bubble study during an echo is 1 mL of air with 10 mL of saline. The saline &amp; air  is “agitated” as it mixed Rapidly to create the small bubbles. It doesn’t need to be injected into a central line. </p>
<p>This is the correct answer </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya when you put in an ECMO you can get away with having a fairly significant amount of air if it’s veno-veno. If it’s Venmo-arterial then you rrrally need to make sure as much air as possible is out of the lines. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would 100-200 ml look like an IV. While getting chemo, the nurse would regularly let inch long bubbles into me. Would freak me the &amp;#($ out. The nurse said it was fine, but I still didn't like it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can vary between different tubing sets, but I'd say like 0.5mls per inch at most? You figure the entire tubing takes about 20-25mls to prime (push all the way through)</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, the &quot;lethal dose&quot; is  3-5mL/kg but it's also been a year or so since I've last gone over this. (EDITING TO ADD) This is more of a general guideline and not a &quot;lets test this theory out.&quot;</p>
<p>Personally, I take my time when preparing IV lines to avoid anxiety in my patient, I believe it to be good practice as well the outdated and crappy IV pumps we have at my facility will throw &quot;Occluded&quot; errors like they're in a strip club with a fistful of 1 dollar bills</p></div>		</li>

<p>haha try working in a veterinary hospital ICU. It's like a constant symphony of bleeps from 100 syringe pumps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100-200 mL is like a small to moderate sized IV bag (like where medication would be placed).  An inch of IV line should be less than 1 mL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is in addition to WHERE the air is introduced. 20 cc's in the carotid is a guaranteed stroke. 60 cc's in the femoral vein probably won't do anything.</p>
