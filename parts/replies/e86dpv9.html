			<div class="markdown"><p>I still find it confusing how money gets into all of this. Once we introduce money, like a banker coming along and saying &quot;hey here's $100 for 100 eggs&quot; where did the value from that $100 come from? I know we use to rely on the gold standard where money use to represent physical gold but since that no longer exists, where is the actual value? When we print more money, why is that money worth anything? Are we devaluing all the money currently in circulation by introducing more freshly printed money? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes absolutely. Money, like anything else has a value following supply and demand. Increasing the supply of money without a corresponding increase in demand for it (productivity) will result in inflation. It will be valued less. Just like gold. The value of gold, just like the value of a dollar is supply and demand. The value of gold, or anything else for that matter is a mutual agreement of the market. The same applies to the pieces of paper we call dollars. Rather than being backed by some other asset, they ARE the asset. </p>
<p>Imagine that I eggs to sell but I don't need any plants. You need eggs. Since eggs spoil and plants die, how can we make the transaction in a more convenient way? Well, what we do is, I sell you the eggs and rather than you giving me plants that I don't need, we mutually agree to a contract, written on a piece of a paper, that I can come get plants from you at some point in the future. That contract states that you owe me X amount of plants. The cool part is that I can buy other products with this contract. I can go to the house builder, give him this contract and now he owns the claim to your plants while I get a return of his labor equivalent to the value of those plants. </p>
<p>That is currency. Its paper that everybody agrees has a certain value and its value in an aggregate mostly matches up, or tries to, the production  of the economy, just like our contract matches up to our farm's production of chicken and eggs. We can't exchange contracts based on amounts of eggs and plants we know we can't produce. Does that make more sense? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah that definitely makes sense. But I guess money just gets more and more abstract because US dollars for example, can't be immediately traded for anything specifically. The paper representing eggs and plants can obviously be traded for eggs and plants. But what can US dollars be traded for? What's backing the US dollar given that we're off the gold standard?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Or is it the idea that money really isn't worth anything, we just know that its identifiable and scarce so we abstractly agree to associate value with it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not correct that the amount of currency, or even money more broadly, will match the production of the economy. Imagine an economy where A &amp; B rent rooms from C for $30/mo. (And every month is 30 days, just to simplify.) A &amp; B grow different foods, each harvesting 3 pieces of food each day, and everyone (A, B, &amp; C) wants one piece of each every day. Each piece costs $1. Total market production in this economy is $60 (housing) + $120 (the amount of food that gets sold) = $180/mo. But $60 in money will be perfectly adequate to keep things humming. (A &amp; B pay $30 each for housing at the beginning of the month, which he pays back to them day after day for food, and they use what they get from C each day to pay each other for food. Rinse &amp; repeat.)</p>
<p>Fundamentally, money is a stock (an amount at a <em>point</em> in time), while production is a flow (an amount over a <em>span</em> of time), so they can't match in a meaningful way. Even if money stock equals weekly production, it will be far shy of annual production, for example. There isn't any rule that relates the two, though economists will look at the velocity of money -- how fast money circulates, defined as nominal GDP divided by the stock of money. In the A, B, &amp; C example, we'd say monthly velocity is 3 ($180/$60). But then annual velocity would be 12 times larger, because $60 of money will stay constant, while the annual GDP is 12*$180.</p></div>		</li>
