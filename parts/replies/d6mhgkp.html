			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The moment power is lost, volatile memory is reset. That's why you can't pull out a RAM stick on your PC and plug it back in quickly and hope it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually not instantaneous, but is typically on the order of seconds. And if the RAM is kept very cold, that can be extended to hours or minutes: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/cryogenically-frozen-ram-bypasses-all-disk-encryption-methods/" target="_blank">http://www.zdnet.com/article/cryogenically-frozen-ram-bypasses-all-disk-encryption-methods/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. You take apart the cartridge, insert it into your gameboy, leave your gameboy on, take the back of the gameboy off, and swap the battery life. The gameboy is providing the power while the battery is disconnected.</p>
<p>It's really easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are motivated enough you could probably run some kind of power supply to the cartridge and maintain voltage. I wouldn't know how to do that, but I am sure someone out there can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yesss :) Although, I'm sure that it would be easier to just buy a GCM reader/writer. I am curious, How would you test if the battery is failing, and is there a manual for how to do this with various GCMs?</p></div>		</li>

<p>RAM</p>

<p>There's DRAM (the chips on your 1-16 GB RAM sticks) and SRAM (the RAM that your CPU registers and cache are made of). The former is represented by a small capacitor that needs to build up or deplete its charge, and the latter is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics\)" target="_blank">transistor circuits</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. SRAM is a lot faster but it's WAY more expensive, which is why computers only generally have a dozen megabytes of it at most.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only volatile example I can think of is RAM (Random Access Memory).</p>

<p>Information on a TV screen or electronic billboard is essentially volatile memory.  The information exists only until the power is turned off or the device is instructed to display different information.</p>
<p>(Also, the L1/L2/L3 Cache on a CPU is volatile memory, but you could technically say it's Random Access Memory too)</p></div>		</li>
