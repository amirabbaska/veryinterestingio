<p>My mind immediately goes to training I've had with avalanche beacons, which are devices that emit RF to assist in finding people buried in the snow.</p>
<p>You'll get a cool demonstration of how your beacon, in 'receive' mode, will detect the victim's beacon at varying distances depending on its orientation. Then, when you follow your beacon's directional indicator to locate said victim, you'll see that you tend to walk in a 'U'-shaped pattern. If you spread a bunch of people out and have them strictly follow their beacon's indicator, you will actually map out flux lines in the snow- i.e. the footprints will look just like drawings of the flux lines around the pole of a magnet.</p>
<p>I would think a car remote, also being RF, would follow similar principles, no?</p></div>		</li>
