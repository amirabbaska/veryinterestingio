<p>Most historical borders were biased on a natural reference (river's) or known physical datum (Markers at the location).</p>

<p>... or they were just drawn on a map as straight lines (look at US states for example). When territories were historically divided, they didn't have the modern CAD and GIS equipment. In that case the actual width of the line drawn on the map with the pen becomes important.</p>
<p>As an example, a line drawn with a very fine drafting pen on a 60 inch wide US wall map would be several hundred yards thick in real life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the other way round<br />
Maps don't define territories, the territories define the map   </p>
<p>Maps may be used to help decide where a border is and how thick it'll be, but the thickness of the pen will not be the determining factor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all, maps were never draw arbitrarily without a reference or local point. In the case of the states where straight lines were drawn, parallel lines of latitude were often used since they can be very accurately sited on the ground off of stars and or the sun/moon positions and a compass. Horizontal lines of longitude are very easily sited using the same methods. Additionally large trigonometric studies were used taking azimuths off land features such as peaks and could get an accurate survey line between two points.</p>
<p>While yes maps were often used to create arbitrary divisions, those divisions were very well defined points and the thickness of the pen would have never been a factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a geospatial guy, piggy-backing on this comment. </p>
<p>In GIS you have to consider something called topology. If you have two polygons representing people's property, it's important that those polygons are touching, but not overlapping. This has to be true at any scale, down to millimeters (and theoretically beyond millimeters, forever). You can't have un-owned property in between, and you can't have an overlap with &quot;two owners&quot; - even if it's an arbitrarily small area.</p>
<p>This makes more sense on computers, where you can increase scale indefinitely, but it would work in theory on paper maps as well.</p></div>		</li>
