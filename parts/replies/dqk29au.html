			<div class="markdown"><p>When you split the atom you build up xenon and other fission products which absorb neutrons. Normally some neutrons in the reactor burn these out in a real time balance. But after a scram or significant power reduction, you don’t burn these out as fast and have to wait for them to decay. This can limit your maximum power or prevent a restart of the reactor entirely for 36-72 hours if the particular reactor doesn’t use sufficient excess reactivity to overcome the xenon effects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Xe-135 is a neutron absorber. This is what makes it a poison. After Xe-135 absorbs a neutron, it becomes a much more stable isotope, Xe-136, which is not neutron hungry and really doesn't impact the reactor much at all.</p>
<p>So when we stay &quot;burn out&quot; in this case, we are referring to xenon absorbing neutrons and changing to something else.</p>
<p>There are 2 ways to get Xenon-135 out of your reactor. You either hit them with neutrons to burn them out, or you wait for them to decay. If the reactor trips, you have very few neutrons, so if you don't have enough reactivity to safely start up, you have to wait for them to decay.</p>
<p>Side note: Fossil terms like &quot;burn&quot; get used inappropriately in nuclear power in a number of ways. The biggest one is that we refer to the total energy released by the core as the &quot;burnup&quot;, even though there is no fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't samarium the real issue in poisions? From what I remember xenon can come out of the rods but samarium has a huge absorbsion cross section and continually builds up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Samarium doesn't decay, however it gets burned out by neutrons. </p>
<p>So what happens, is after initial startup, Sm builds up to some level based on your power production. Eventually it reaches a steady state level at 100% power, where the production rate and neutron burn rate match. After that, it stops increasing during steady state operation.</p>
<p>After a unit trip, the samarium level increases as the parent radionuclides decay to Sm. So you do get some increase in Sm, but there's only a fixed amount. Once you start the reactor up, you begin burning out Sm back to your equilibrium power level.</p>
<p>It doesn't continually build up, it reaches its steady state level for either full power operation or reactor shutdown. PWR plants will account for Sm in their critical projections and when performing reactivity balances, especially if boron is used to bring the reactor critical. BWR plants, the software will compute it, but we don't pay attention to it at all. </p>
<p>Sm has a pretty slow response, being days. While Xenon has a rapid response (hours).</p>
