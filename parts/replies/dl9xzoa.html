			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your response is a good reason why salt and pepper stood the test of time and remain to be staple spices, but i think the preservative answer is more of why it originally became a staple.</p>
<p>That was a great TIL about the qualities of pepper though. Apparently it &quot;stimulates the taste buds in a way that increases [stomach] acid production&quot; which helps with digestion... Cool!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see people talking about table salt being necessary and ascribing all sorts of symptoms when they go without it for like a day, so to clarify a bit: Salt is not essential, many people throughout history lived without it no problem. If one considers it for a moment it doesn't make any sense that we would require regular salt to survive - it's not an easy-to-get commodity found it nature and was pretty inaccessible before widespread civilization and there was certainly no cavemen boiling seawater movement. We do need some small amount of sodium but its provided naturally from whole foods - vegetables etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say we need a small amount of sodium, we need a decent amount of sodium and if you're active (like people had to be hundreds of years ago) you need a substantial amount of sodium, and salt is the easiest way to get it. There's hardly any sodium found naturally in things besides like fish and some cuts of meat (assuming uncured).</p>
<p>But putting that all aside and looking at a modern tidbit, we also need iodine which is extremely uncommon besides in iodized salt (which all table salt has to contain in the u.s... which is where the whole sea salt craze came from, its a legal loophole for salt companies to avoid the cost of adding iodine to salt... Cuz it's &quot;natural&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do we need iodine if it's extremely uncommon? It just seems silly that our body would develop a dependency on something we can't get easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume, then, that there's salt in dog food or cat food?  My pets are indoors, and only get to eat what I give them, which is never people food.</p></div>		</li>
