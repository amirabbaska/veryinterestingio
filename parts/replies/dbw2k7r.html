			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm happy I ran into your comment, good to see a fellow SLP. To bounce off of what you said, there are also some useful tools one can use to determine the approximate progression of an individual's dementia. One such tool is the <a href="https://www.fhca.org/members/qi/clinadmin/global.pdf" target="_blank">Global Deterioration Scale</a>; it's by no means the only tool, nor is that pdf the only source of information about the GDS, and there are patients who present differently. But it does do a fairly good job of showcasing how skillsets are lost as the dementia progresses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My initial thought, coming from a Cognitive Science background, was that perhaps Alzheimers affects declarative memory first and then affects prodecural memory. Would you know if there's any indication of such a trend or does it tend to affect both types of memory simultaneously?</p>
<p>I guess my thought was that it was like global amnesia, where procedural memory is fine but declarative memory is shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Declarative memory is generally the first to go. I don't have the book with me, but in &quot;Physiology of Behaviour&quot; experiments are described wherein a patient is asked to learn some kind of game. The more you play, the better you get.  When after some period of time he is asked to play again, his performance remained better than when he first start playing, despite him not remembering ever having learned this game. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Word finding deficits are extremely common at all ages, especially in typical adults who are aging normally. The cause for concern comes when it is happening more frequently, or happening with commonly used and well know words (like family member names, etc). </p></div>		</li>
