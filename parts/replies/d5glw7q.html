			<div class="markdown"><p>As a veteran backpacker I often had to deal with blisters (before I learned to put moleskin on a spot the instant I realized it was getting hot). Blisters left unattended can get bigger and really hurt, impeding your walking. The old Boy Scout trick is to sterilize the skin by washing with soap, sterilize a needle by heating it with a match, let it cool a few seconds and then insert it sideways under the skin just outside the blister and into the plasma, pull out the needle and squeeze the plasma out through the little channel. Then cover with a clean band-aid or moleskin.</p>
<p>Sterilization is vital. Feet are filthy and infections can be dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never liked the pressure it added to the sensitive skin. I preferred duct tape over a small piece of gauze on these hot spots for long walks because it slides better if there's any residual friction after treatment.</p>
<p>One trick I've learned to prevent walking blisters is aftwr youe feet start to swell which is usually about a mile after walking, to unlace my boots/shoes and re-tie them. That and good socks with lots of elastic  (Fox socks) so it hugs your foot very well and doesn't slip or bunch up. It basically becomes a second skin. And two pairs of socks helps too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Had a huge blister on my big toe, it would drain out through the toenail. Ended up getting a gnarly staph infection. Woke up on the couch one night to my nurse/mother smelling and examining it. Knew it was time to go see doc. </p>
<p>He bent my tow in his initial exam, and that movement finally popped the blister itself,  shot a stream of plasma a super soaker would be envious of. My doctor avoided the brunt of the spray with some pretty sweet doctor rolly chair moves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? I have the problem though that if I don't 'pop' a blister it just rips open instead, I think I'd have to not wear shoes for it to be unbroken until it healed. but if I pop it it doesn't rip, and in my experience it stops hurting and heals faster. whats odd is this is exactly opposite to what everyone else is saying...
is there a way other than not wearing shoes to maintain the structural integrity of the blister?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah. i dont get the people who say &quot;NEVER pop a blister&quot; the most common place to get a blister is from your shoe. and unless youre planning on going barefoot for a few days while it heals, youre going to tear that blister open from the same rubbing that caused it in the first place, and then its going to get infected and hurt even more. best option is to swab the area, pop it with a sterile needle, and put a bandaid over it.</p>
<p>the only blisters I wouldnt pop would be from burns.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The blister is your body's way of telling you that you have soft smooth wimpy feet...Embrace nature, free the toe!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this method deals with the blister on your own terms. It's going to grow and eventually pop if the same forces keep being applied to it. Unless you can somehow go without shoes for a few days it's better to do the inevitable popping in a controlled environment where you can clean and cover the wound. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medium to large blisters absolutely heal faster and cause much less pain when you cut them open, drain them, CLEAN them with soap and water (super important!) and wrap them up.  People who don't cut and clean blisters are completely missing out and dealing with a slow and painful 'natural' healing process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same. I think if you're careful about popping it, keep it washed and clean, maybe put a bandage over the area.. I think with modern first aid products and antiseptics, you can pop it if you're careful. And I'm with you, I'd probably rip it anyway, I'd rather control it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I had a nasty one while I was on vacation last month that was basically making walking painful (and I was doing a lot of it). Ran to the pharmacy to grab some needles, antibiotic and bandaids, and my foot was good as new the next day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I usually leave the blister and let it rip/pop.  Then I carefully cut away the dead skin and apply a bandage with antibiotic ointment.  That usually let's it heal in a couple days after the rip/pop.</p></div>		</li>
