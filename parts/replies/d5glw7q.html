			<p>and not just that, the wound hurts 10 times more if you pop the blister. If you keep the blister it hurts but after a while it stops hurting and will not hurt in the following days. If you pop the blister it will hurt hours and hours and it will hurt on the following days if you touch it.</p>		</li>

			<p>I burnt my hand badly on a pan and had this massive bulging bubble blister that was inches across my fingers. It started swelling for days then after a week it decreased and another week passed it was pretty much gone. There is a faint scar still visible.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ive got a skin condition called eperdermolysis bullosia simplex, which basically means my skin will blister at the tiniest bit of friction so I've experienced a whole lot of blisters and in my experience popping them is always the best option for me. I find that having a blister will keep hurting for as long as you have to walk on it or have clothes over it, but popping it will only hurt for about 5 or 6 minuets. The trick is when you drain the fluid you have to make sure you get absolutely all of it out so that the blister isn't wet, because the wet blisters are the ones that hurt for days. What I do is I make a slight tear in the blister and then use a tissue to push down with reasonable pressure and then soak my feet in some water and then let them dry out and by the next morning I'll be able to walk on them with no pain at all. Also, there's been a few times that I've been hospitalised with my blisters and in those cases the doctors have always popped and drained the blisters, as I think it's much more sanitary to pop them in a sterile way and treat them like a cut, rather than let them pop accidentally and have to deal with the loose skin getting stuck and drying into the wet wound. </p>		</li>

			<p>I am currently recovering from a gnarly blister on my foot partially caused by friction and partially caused by the asphalt burning through my shoe. I've heard then skin gets stronger every time a blister heals up. Would it eventually be thick enough to not blister up anymore?</p>		</li>
