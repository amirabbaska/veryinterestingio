			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so another follow-up question.  Do galaxies &quot;abut&quot; each other in that are they typically close enough to affect one another and or do they just kinda float around out there.  Sorry, but your answers and comments stimulated this thought of how very vast everything is.  If I ask too much...please let me know.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It was my understanding any interaction of our galaxy would have it change from spiral to elliptical galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The axis they rotate on doesn't necessarily line up perfectly perpendicular with their orbital plane (why we have seasons on Earth, for instance.) Mercury has a low axial tilt of 0.03 degrees, while Uranus rotates on its side with an axial tilt of about 82 degrees. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you view the solar system from above (such that the orbits trace out circles), then from your perspective, they rotate on the <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SitTF.png" target="_blank">Z axis</a>. If you view the solar system from the side so that the orbits appear to go left and right, the planets are rotating around the Y axis. If you view the solar system so that the planets rotate up and down, they rotate on the X axis. When you rotate around an axis in 3D space (assuming you're rotating at a perfect angle), the axis you're rotating around is the one in which your coordinate remains the same. So if you view a car tire from the front, it rotates on the X axis because  a point on the tire will move up and down and forward and backward but not left or right.</p></div>		</li>
