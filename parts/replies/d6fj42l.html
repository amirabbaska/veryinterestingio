			<div class="markdown"><p>The question becomes what you mean by &quot;perfect.&quot; For scientific purposes are generally close to &quot;perfect&quot; in that they're all the same, cheap to maintain, and easy to work with. But there are also many cases where an inbred strain gets cross-bred with other strains, to introduce other genetic traits (bigger litters, different coat color, susceptibility to certain diseases, etc) at that point, there's a complex husband scheme to describe what your mice actually are, since they aren't inbred anymore, EXCEPT sometimes researches go through the trouble to breed and re-breed the progeny of these crosses until the manage to create an entirely new inbred strain. </p>
<p>In a sense, the simple answer is yes. You can select for specific traits in mice the same way you can in dogs, corn, or whatever else you're working with. But when you introduce new traits to your inbred strain by cross-breeding, it's not genetically identical anymore, and not inbred. </p></div>		</li>
