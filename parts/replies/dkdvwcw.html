			<div class="markdown"><p>Legally, all unclaimed land in the US is owned by the US government. But if &quot;off the grid&quot; is what someone is after, there is plenty of unsettled land that you couukd just go to and live on and chances are, no one would ever know about it. Off the grid and all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what sounds really nice about the USA to me. Space. Wilderness. I'm from Ireland and live in Scotland. Land is expensive and good luck getting planning permission to build anything. (and they wonder why house prices are high)</p>
<p>edit: Scotland does have wilderness too though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to believe you but I don't think all that much govt land is really for sale.  It used to be with the homestead acts, but I think this is pretty much history and not around any more.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any govt land that is really for sale.....for 'dirt cheap' would be better....but I suspect if any is really for sale, it will be worthless land or surprisingly expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of state land for sale/available for free with some conditions. Like this for example:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lincolnks.org/Housing.html" target="_blank">http://www.lincolnks.org/Housing.html</a></p>
<p>It's not necessarily 'worthless' in the sense that it can't be used for anything, but it is worthless in the sense that nobody wants it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you provide this one example, I don't think that qualifies as &quot;most of this land the govt will sell to you.&quot; nor do I think &quot;plenty&quot; of state land is available.  I agree that some is available, but I don't think there is very much, and a lot of the stuff that is available comes with considerable strings like your example.  21 building lots in a town in Kansas isn't even &quot;state&quot; land </p></div>		</li>
