			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some questions about this that I haven't been able to find  satisfying answers to and maybe you can help. I've heard a couple times that this is the largest water event ever seen in that spot, is it true and by how much? Also if it is how will recovery/rebuilding be different than other events?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/LxUCj4n.jpg" target="_blank">Here's</a> the list of most water from 1 storm that has ever happened in the continental US.</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Allison (#5 on that list) was also in Houston. It was a similar kinda storm, where there wasn't much wind damage but it just kept raining and raining. So Harvey recovery will likely be pretty similar to Allison, though Harvey was larger (and Houston is more built up) so the flood damage is more wide spread.</p>
<p>The other answer you got is also good, because it was very spread out over the whole state so there is a huge volume as well aside from the high points near Houston.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's the largest amount of rain a tropical storm/hurricane has ever dropped on Texas. The last one was Amelia in 1978 at 48 inches. Preliminary reports are saying 51 inches in some areas.</p>
<p>Since Harvey is blasting Louisiana right now the record there is Allison from 2001 at 29.9 inches.</p>
<p>Also even as a tropical storm now this thing has still got so much energy left in it that the models are predicting that it's going to go all the way to Kentucky and then meander over to North Carolina before it's done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also often design underground storm water detention basins, at great cost, to store and slow water to larger drainage systems. Particularly for project sites that will have a lot of impervious surfaces. Zoning is key.</p>
<p>There's a great article in the WaPost today talking about how officials chose to forgo this in Houston.</p></div>		</li>
