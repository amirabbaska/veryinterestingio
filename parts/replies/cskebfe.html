			<div class="markdown"><p>To continue with this answer, let's investigate the evolutionary lines of cows and horses!</p>
<p>Cows belong to a group of animals called <strong>ruminants</strong>, the group of mammals that require digestion of cellulose in two specialized stomachs before regurgitating the cud back into its mouth and then re-swallowing into the last two stomachs.  Other ruminants are goats, sheep, deer, giraffe, et al.  To keep track, you can remember that all ruminants are either bovids (cows/sheep/goats), cervids (deer), or giraffids (guess).</p>
<p>On the other hand, horses are more related to rhinos (of all things).  We can tell this because unlike almost all ungulates (hoofed animals), they have an odd number of toes.  Tapirs also belong in this family.  All odd-toed ungulates have a single stomach and break down cellulose at the end of the digestion process.</p>
<p>Again, why there is this difference in how cellulose is treated is simply the randomness of genetic mutation and simply the fact that both processes work for those animals.  Moreover, other mammals have their own methods which have evolved independents.  For example, hippos have three stomachs and are considered pseudoruminants, but the food passes straight from one stomach to the next, and there is no need for regurgitation or cud chewing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rabbits and other lagomorphs have evolved another procedure for digesting grass/vegetable matter, cecotrophy.  They poop out cecotropes (which are different than ordinary rabbit poop), which they then eat.  It's disgusting, but it's very similar to rumination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there is no &quot;NRC nutritional guide lines&quot; for rhino's, so most exotic animal nutritionist use the equine NRC for rhinos, and elephants. Exotic birds are where it gets really weird. From a nutritional science stand point, we know ALOT about chickens. The problem is, not all birds are like chickens. So on the exotic end, you get some very interesting NRC guide lines to follow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It comes down to digestive strategy. Equids have developed as bulk feeders, making up for inefficiency of digestion by high volume. Ruminants have taken the opposite tack, by increasing digestive efficiency via intensive processing (cud-chewing). In effect, ruminants gain more per kilo of feed, but it takes them much longer to process. </p>
<p>This is likely a result of interspecies competition for resources, as equids tend to inhabit habitats that are sparsely populated such as steppe lands, whereas ruminants are often found in wetter, denser regions with more grazers, such as African river lands. This in turn is probably a result of the availability of water, which is supported by the difference in nitrogen eliminating strategies between the groups. Equids tend to eliminate more ammonia, whereas ruminants employ uric acid and urea, which are more water-intensive nitrogen eliminating chemicals.</p>
<p>However, this is certainly not a hard and fast rule as both digestive strategies are effective, and specimens of both types can often be found side-by-side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the question could be restated as &quot;Which evolutionary advantage do horses have that they don't need four stomachs?&quot;. </p>
<p>Your answer is perfectly right, and completely useless. &quot;Why do humans have eyes? Because it gives us an evolutionary advantage&quot;</p></div>		</li>
