<p>Thanks for your answer, profoundly interesting. I thought I would know more after posting this question, where now I merely have more questions </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the rabbit hole.  Do you read up on the subject?  Astrophysics strikes most people I talk to as dry, but oh man it's anything but.  I recommend it to everyone - after all, relativists, cosmologists, theorists and astronomers are answering the most profound questions.  And you're right, the answers only lead to more questions and puzzles.  It's so exciting and never ends.</p>
<p>Let me know if you need a few suggestions for literature and I'll send your way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to discuss your last point about space time being a part of the big bang expansion.</p>
<p>From my current research into the topic via m-theory it is my current understandig that space time already existed for matter and energy to permeate through and produce the universe as we know it.</p>
<p>If you have any literature on space time being a part of hyperinflation i would love to read it.</p></div>		</li>
