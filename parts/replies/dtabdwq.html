			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s depends on the country. But in the US (in most states) the constable is usually a police officer that basically run the paper work for the courts. They serve warrant, process serve (give notice of pending court in accordance with due process “You’ve been served”), give summons, deal with evictions etc. Basically they do the police work after the fact (after a court has been involved), they don’t come when you call 911, but when you need to sue someone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Constables are somewhat obscure in the US, and their powers vary greatly.  The title is most commonly given to process servers.  They usually don't have arrest powers, but messing with them brings interference with a government official charges.  It is also sometimes given to someone who needs limited arrest power but shouldn't be seen as a full policeman.  Instead of hiring a watchman, a homeowner's associate might hire a constable, who technically works for the state, but only looks after them.  Finally, a  constable is sometimes a miscellaneous government official due to some sort of historical oddity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve also seen the term used when a police officer is temporarily given jurisdiction to an area they don’t normally have. Say there’s a natural disaster and a city needs more cops. Police from out of state may come to help, but to give them local jurisdiction they are temporarily sworn in as “constable” in the local area. This gives them limited arrest rights and the ability to enforce local laws which they otherwise wouldn’t have. </p></div>		</li>
