<p>I'm being a little bit facetious, but shifting the ingredients around to make it look like there's more still seems quite deceptive to me. That kind of picture implies that there's sufficient lettuce or whatever to make it stick out of the sides like that, not that there's just enough lettuce to form the bit that's poking out the side.</p></div>		</li>
