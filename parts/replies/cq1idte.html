			<div class="markdown"><p>I've a dog called Ty who isn't too clever, and if he hears anything that remotely rhymes with Ty his wee ears pop up. This includes: bye, why, and since I'm Irish there have been too many times I've shouted 'aye' in from the kitchen only to hear a patter of wee paws thinking he's getting fed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OMG that's the cutest thing ever. My dog is called Terence, so even in the dodgy Aussie accent there's not much he'll confuse with it luckily. He can however hear me opening a packet of chips from the backyard and comes running in. </p>
<p>He knows the difference between the timers on the microwave, oven and dishwasher in the kitchen, and only comes in for the first two. Selectively smart I call him ;) </p></div>		</li>
