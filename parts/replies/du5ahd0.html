			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this. The temporal duration after effect studies are the most relevant. Thereâ€™s some interesting debate about whether there is a single internal clock for detecting timings, or a clock for each sense (vision, touch, sound). I suspect what you are effectively doing is slowing down <em>an</em> internal clock which is also affecting your other auditory perceptions. You should have some fun and test yourself to see if you perceive things from other senses (such as a ticking clock) as also slowing down. </p></div>		</li>
