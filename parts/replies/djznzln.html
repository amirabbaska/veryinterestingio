			<div class="markdown"><p>In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have asked the question :) I can't understand your answer directly by reading through, but you've effectively given me a road-map to understanding. I'm going to spend some time going through it paragraph by paragraph, by reading up the points mentioned by googling and reading. (Wikipedia may feature heavily in this reading.) </p>
<p>Thank you very much for your answer. Apologies for not being ready for it, but I will benefit from this reading up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's absolutely no problem. Just ignore the first half of the answer (this just sets up the technicalities somewhat).
I highly recommend reading throug <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/virtual-particles-what-are-they/" target="_blank">this</a> post first (the first one I linked above). It features a very detailed answer that should be quite understandable even if one is not familiar with the hole framework. And then later you can try reading up on the whole QFT buisness :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it more accurate to say that these massless, nonphysical &quot;particles&quot; are actually &quot;pips&quot; of energy of some discrete quantifiable amount? </p>
<p>And excuse me if my question literally makes no sense. I'm simply an amateur trying to understand why the term &quot;particle&quot; is not accurately descriptive of what is actually happening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I was a bit unclear.</p>
<p>First let's talk about the particle thing: On-shell particle means, that the excitation of the field satisfies the classical equations of motion, has a certain energy, momentum, spin, charge, ... . For scattering experiments, we take these particles to be asymptotic states, i.e. at times far away from the scattering (plus and minus infinity), they are plane-waves with given energy-momentum. But you can also take them to be distributions, e.g. gaussian type (so a localised particle). These are the particles we can observe.</p>
<p>The scattering experiments I considered above, like electron-positron scattering, are elastic, that means the energy is conserved in this process. What we observe is incoming and outgoing particles, of which we can measure energy, momentum, the scattering angle, ...</p>
<p>What happens inbetween these two states, in and out, is what we describe mathematically using perturbation theory. In this framework, we say that there are intermediate, &quot;virtual&quot; states of the system, e.g. exchange of virtual photons, <a href="https://inspirehep.net/record/830693/files/OneLoop.png" target="_blank">loop corrections</a> and so on. However, this is just our mathematical description. There are no actual photons exchanged between the two particles.</p>
<p>So in short: Electron field and electromagnetic field interact with each other, to describe this interaction, we use a perturbative framework. In this framework, the notion of &quot;virtual particles&quot; arises.</p>
<p>So it's best to not think of these disturbances as particles (in fact, it's probably best if we don't think of particles at all, but rather of fields :) )</p>
<p>Is that helpful or is it more confusing?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I would say it is best to think in terms of quantized excitations of fields atop the vacuum state.  Otherwise the key on/off shell distinction of your very good explanation gets undermined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does energy follow the eom? No, it's a sum of forces.  Forces can't follow eom, but, particles have forces, and there must be a set of equations that can describe the how forces from particles and gravity relate?</p>
<p>Edit: fyi, much of what u wrote was over my head</p></div>		</li>
