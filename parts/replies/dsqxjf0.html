			<div class="markdown"><p>Jumping on board with some simple links:
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofascial_trigger_point" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myofascial_trigger_point</a>
Wiki also has some paper links. Pubmed also has a lot with simple keywords such as 'trigger point theory'.</p>
<p>I'd also like to point out that trigger point theory is very common among healthcare practitioners but is just that, a theory. Here is one criticism article I found with a quick pubmed search <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25477053/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/25477053/</a></p>
<p>It's a great basis for physical therapy. Stretching, massage, and dry needling can work well but oftentimes the muscle with the active trigger point actually needs to be strengthened in order to prevent getting &quot;knotted&quot; again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in Physical Therapy and work with Trigger Points.  I just want to second the statement that the muscle with the Trigger Point does actually need to be stretched (gently) and strengthened in its proper biomechanical position to help prevent it from occurring again. </p>
<p>For example, if one has a Trigger Point in the Upper Trapezius muscle and has a forward head, forward shoulder (slouched) posture, all the stretching, therapy, and strengthening in the world is not going to prevent that TP from coming back because the muscle is under an increased work load.  Correcting the basis of the problem, in this case, the alignment issue, and looking deeper to find the cause of the mal-alignment (habit, weakness, tightness in anterior chest muscles, etc) is key in preventing the TP from returning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My life has become consumed with fighting this exact muscle pain on a daily basis. I sit for work and for hobby for hours at a time. I’ve spent the last 5 years trying to figure out how to sit/stand property so I can eventually overcome this pain, but nothing seems to help. For the past year I’ve been trying to train myself to sit/stand with a more hips forward position (hoping to put a more natural curve in my spine), but I have no idea if what I’m doing is right. Are there “posture experts” that can help with this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>will you be my physical therapist. Mine just wants to get me in and out to bill insurance as fast as possible. I have a recurring knot in my left trapezius and it gets so bad i can't turn my head to look in my mirrors for traffic etc. I've never heard anything about needing to strengthen the muscle to stop it happening any more, it's always just rest and come back when it happens again. Put heat and cold on it blah blah. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has Trigger Point Theory been refuted? Not necessarily the clinical phenomena but the underlying theory explaining the mechanisms causing it.
There was a paper I read about it in the British Society for Rheumatology. What do you think?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted that exact same study in the original comment.</p>
<p>We know there are problems with it, but it gives us an ideological basis for which to work. A lot of the research outlined in that article is not great quality either way (to prove or disprove).</p>
<p>Trigger points are probably multi-factorial and are both causes of and symptoms of other issues and pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A repetitive strain injury can certainly cause muscle knots. Sitting at a computer with bad posture, for example, can cause you to bunch up your shoulders. Doing this for hours every day, for days/years on end will invariably lead to painful knots in the neck and shoulder muscles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little.  It notes that the effect on pain was not statistically significant, and the effect on function <em>was</em> statistically significant, but not compared to other physical therapy treatments.  It specifically calls out that the studies showing the largest effect have the lowest quality scores.</p>
<p>So,  some indication it helps a bit, but &quot;promising&quot; seems like a stretch.  Appreciate the further reading regardless.</p></div>		</li>
