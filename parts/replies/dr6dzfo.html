<p>And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to answer the second part of OP's question as to why it's easier to see some stars by  it looking directly at them. </p>
<p>Our human eyes have more nerves that detect light in the &quot;sides&quot; of our eyes, so looking slightly beside the object you want to see allows those receptors to work. </p>
<p>This doesn't just apply to stars. You can do this with anything you are viewing in a dark environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost, but not quite right. You have 2 main types of light receptors: rods and cones. Rods are great for detecting dim light and motion, but poor for colour and detail. Cones give great detail and can combine to differentiate colour, but need a certain intensity of light to work. When you look straight at something the part of your retina dealing with that has no rods, so if the light is very dim you might have to look slightly to the side of it for it to be noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually rods can't detect color at all; &quot;night vision&quot; is strictly monochromatic. Cones detect color by comparing the signals of the 3 different cone types, but there is only one type of rod, so there is nothing to distinguish different colors with.</p>
<p>&quot;Twilight vision&quot; where a small amount of color (mainly blue) can be detected is at that point of transition where the rods are beginning to activate and the cones are basically giving up. The short-wavelength cone (blue) is the last to go, so you can, for a short time, see with your short-wavelength cones and your rods at the same time, but it doesn't last long. :P</p>
<p>You're correct that there are no rods in your center of vision (fovea), so you can't see dim stars by looking directly at them; you have to catch them in your peripheral vision, which is where your rods are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, to add to this.  It's to help us from predators.  If you notice, you can react more quickly to something in your peripheral via instincts than you can staring at it.  This ended up helping us with a lot of things, like driving avoiding falling on sharp objects, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could just as easily argue that it isn't about escaping predators, it's about being a predator. Concentrating cones in the center of the retina allows for more detailed, high contrast color vision for identifying and tracking prey from a distance.</p>
<p>Among the animal kingdom, human eyesight is actually pretty darn good. Lots of animal have us beat in the dark but not a lot besides some birds got us beat at color, detail, and distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still confused by this, by the “diameter of the source” part, do you mean like, the apparent size in the sky? (Since a star obviously has a larger actual diameter). So do objects of the same apparent size in the sky twinkle about the same amount, such as a star in the sky that has the same apparent size as a planet in the sky? Or am I misunderstanding this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a sphere of 1 meter (or yard) around your head. You could project every object you can see on the surface of the sphere like: a car that is nearby, a plane in the sky, the moon, the sun, planets, stars...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The projection of that object has an area, which depends on the size of the object, and on the distance of the object.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Planets are not really big but (astronomicaly) close by, so they have a small, but measurable area.</p>
</li>
<li>Stars can be very big, but are very, very far away *, so their projection is so small, they can be considered point-like.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Some close big stars (like Betelgeuse) are very big and close by and are an exception.</p>
<p>Edit: format</p>
<p>Edit2: It is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle" target="_blank">solid angle</a>, the 2D equivalent of an angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it into context, it's useful to consider some actual numbers. Neptune has the smallest apparent angle of the 7 (non-Earth) major planets... it can appear to be as small as 2.17 arcseconds* wide. But the apparent largest star, a star called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_Doradus" target="_blank">R Doradus</a>, is only 0.057 arcseconds wide. (Betelgeuse is a close second, at 0.055 arcseconds.)</p>
<p>Blown up through a super-powerful telescope, Neptune would appear to be 38 times as wide as R Doradus, when viewed from Earth. (And <em>Jupiter</em>, when at its furthest from Earth, still appears to be 520 times as wide as R Doradus.)</p>
<p>* What's an arcsecond? A circle going around the entire sky can be divided up into 360 degrees. Each degree is divided up into 60 arcminutes, and each arcminute is divided up into 60 arcseconds. So an arcsecond is pretty darn tiny... The Moon is about a half a degree wide, or 30 <em>arcminutes</em>, when viewed from Earth.</p></div>		</li>
