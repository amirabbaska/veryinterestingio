<p>Effectiveness of vaccination and wearing masks on seasonal influenza in Matsumoto City, Japan, in the 2014/2015 season: An observational study among all elementary schoolchildren</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335516301553" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335516301553</a></p>
<p>Their summary - “The overall effectiveness of vaccination and mask wearing was 9.9% and 8.6%, respectively. After dividing children into higher (grades 4–6) and lower (grade 1–3) grade groups, the effectiveness of vaccination became greater in the lower grade group, and the effectiveness of wearing masks became greater in the higher grade group. “</p></div>		</li>

I’d like to add that part of the reason that it can never be fully protective is that for many illnesses there is an asymptomatic period where people are able to spread disease but don’t have any symptoms yet. They don’t  mask up because they don’t know they are sick.
I deal with patients with known cases of flu, cold, and other respiratory viruses on a regular basis.
Wearing a mask and good hand hygiene is very effective at reducing transmission. While this would be protective in a large number of daily encounters there will always be unavoidable contact. Think of going to the drive through, if someone there is sick and touches your food or the packaging/bags it comes in it would be nearly impossible to completely avoid exposure and cross contamination.</p></div>		</li>
