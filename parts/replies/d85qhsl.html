<p>imaginary numbers, carbon copies, microwaves.</p>
<p>heck, even gasoline was thought to just be a by-product of kerosine manufacturing for decades before the internal combustion engine. </p>
<p>EDIT: Lots of comments about imaginary numbers, which more modernly are called Complex Numbers. They're necessary in equations for electronic and computer engineering along with designs for oscillating physics (think a door stop you twang back and forth). </p>
<p>For a more in depth answer I'm quoting <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/questionCorner/complexinlife.html" target="_blank">university of Toronto</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are some examples of the first kind that spring to mind. In electronics, the state of a circuit element is described by two real numbers (the voltage V across it and the current I flowing through it). A circuit element also may possess a capacitance C and an inductance L that (in simplistic terms) describe its tendency to resist changes in voltage and current respectively.</p>
<p>These are much better described by complex numbers. Rather than the circuit element's state having to be described by two different real numbers V and I, it can be described by a single complex number z = V + i I. Similarly, inductance and capacitance can be thought of as the real and imaginary parts of another single complex number w = C + i L. The laws of electricity can be expressed using complex addition and multiplication.</p>

It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability" target="_blank">Island of Stability</a> because they are thought to be much more stable than any of the super-heavy elements yet discovered.  Some of them thought to have half-lifes of minutes, days or some say even millions of years (we won't know for sure until we discover them).

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus these things can read and write with millions of bits in parallel could even displace SSD and maybe even RAM. Also, they can project/encode multiple bands of light from the same bit space. Effectively, each space is no longer a bit of data but can represent a different base like 3.</p>
<p>Other interesting affects are the use of crystal light traps for quantum data. So you'd purchase a RO Holodisk with embedded Qbits to read.</p>
<p>Though I'm wondering about the phase effect as well for use in ultra fast transitive properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, we have learned that our theoretical models are correct. That is huge in-and-of itself. Our models predicted the existence of the Higgs boson, and now that we've finally managed a way to create one, we know that our predictions were correct. That validation of the theoretical model improves confidence in other predictions that may have more practical applications, or may cause us to revise our models.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Pedantic comment, we got a lot more data that matched our predictions but we don't by any means know our models are correct (actually we have some evidence to suggest our models have holes in them, such as our models going completely crazy when temperatures get hot enough because gravity would start to become as strong as other forces at that point and we don't have a quantum theory of gravity). We do however know that there more correct than the models we used to have, which is saying a lot </p></div>		</li>

<p>Right.</p>
<p>There were some surprises, but they are typically at the level of &quot;this nucleus lives longer than expected&quot;/&quot;we didn't expect to see so many nuclei of this isotope to be produced&quot;, and the translation to an improvement of theories is not trivial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why are we interested in new elements?</p>
<p>The question has many answers on many levels. I'll try to go through them in turn.</p>
<p>All the atomic building blocks of our material universe can be fitted into the periodic table of elements. Where does it end? How many elements are there?  What are their properties? Are any of them useful?</p>
<p>If you take a very simple model of the atom you'll find that the Bohr velocity, i.e.  the velocity with which an electron orbits the nucleus in the planetary model exceeds the speed of light at a charge Z~137.  If you get more sophisticated, the Dirac equation for an electron around a central charge greater than about Z~172 does no longer yield physical solutions, if one takes into account the finite size of the nucleus, this value changes a bit, but it is clear that there is going to be a natural limit for the number of charges you can put into an atomic nucleus before it can no longer sustain an electron shell as we know it. So there will be a limit to the number of elements that CAN exist, but we are nowhere near it yet. (Ref: See e.g. P. Pykko &amp; J-P Desclaux, Relativity and the Periodic System of Elements, Accounts of Chemical Research 12, 1979).</p>
<p>The more stringent limit comes from nuclear stability. The nuclei with charges greater than 100 are extremely fissile and the Coulomb repulsion should tear them apart. The liquid drop model for example predicts that there is no fission barrier left at seaborgium (Z=106).  The reason we observe heavier nuclei is because the nucleons are fermions and sit in shells. The energies of these shells depend on the specific nucleus, and this can result in extra stable configurations, like the chemical inertness in noble gasses. It is these shell effects that stabilise heavy nuclei and give them halflives up to 20 orders of magnitude longer than the liquid drop model would allow. We call these the superheavy nuclei. The fact that very small changes in binding energy lead to large changes in half-life makes these nuclei extremely sensitive testing grounds for theory. This is very good, because modern nuclear theory is divided on the most stable proton configuration, but flerovium (Z=114) is a very good candidate, we will also see shell stabilisation at Z=126. </p>
<p>Ask, if you want me to expand further on this.</p>
<p>Regarding usefulness, in the 1940s we had elements up to plutonium (94). Americium (95) and curium (96) were discovered in '44, berkelium (97) in '49 and californium (98) in '50. Americium today is the primary ingredient in smoke detectors and has thus saved countless lives. Californium sources are used in every borehole looking for oil. Both these were only possible because people were curious and followed that curiosity. Often research has applications not forseeable when setting out, that's the wonderful thing about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you know what our best guess is for what the limit might be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For something to be considered an element it has to have a nucleus and a neutral atom (i.e. a full complement of electrons) for a minimum length of time. We typically make that minimum time 10^-14 seconds (~10 fs), which is the correct order of magnitude for two H atoms to form a H2 molecule, i.e. perform simple chemistry.</p>
<p>The limit from the electron shell comes in around Z=172, as I outlined above, the nuclear physics is much more tricky.  Let us look at the binding energy of the nucleus. If you look at the binding energy per nucleon, it grows to about 8.5 MeV at it's maximum  (near iron/nickel) and then drops off slowly. Here is a good illustration. <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html" target="_blank">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html</a>.  Once it drops below about 7 MeV the nucleus becomes very weakly bound.  In addition you will have to take fissility into account (how easy it is for the nucleus to undergo spontaneous fission), this is given by the fissility parameter x~Z^2 /A (square of the nuclear charge divided by the nuclear mass). Once Z^2 /A reaches 40 or greater, the nucleus becomes very unstable against spontaneous fission. This happens around rutherfordium (Z=104). At this point it is entirely due to the details of the individual configuration of nucleons in any given isotope whether the nucleus derives additional stability from the shell effects, or not. It can change from one isotope to the next, and is precisely the reason why these superheavy elements are such sensitive testing grounds for nuclear theory. Very small differences in the models can lead to large differences in the observed fission half-lives.  The next doubly magic peak will be the strongest positive correction on to of this, it will occur at the very latest at Z=126 and N=184, although Z=114 and N=184 will also be very strongly bound. </p>
<p>Thus I do not think that we will be able to create nuclei much beyond Z=126, and indeed we are currently struggling to create Z=119 and Z=120, although I'm sure these will be discovered in the near future. After that it will probably need new experimental approaches and techniques before we can progress further. </p></div>		</li>
