			<div class="markdown"><p>If you do care about facts, then next time maybe go and ask over at /r/askscience instead of /r/explainlikeiamfive. This sub has basically lost its core idea and moved from &quot;explaining difficult topics in simple terms&quot; to &quot;/r/askscience without any sources&quot;, so you should be cautious about the replies you are getting here because you really cannot be sure what qualifications the people hold who are replying to you or where they have their knowledge from - it might as well be utterly wrong. And just because something has a lot of upvotes or sounds reasonable does not mean it's true, it happened plenty of times on this sub before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. The mods went so against the idea of people explaining things too simply, that now it's really no different than stuff like /r/askscience .</p>
<p>I liked it before when people wrote analogies in their answers and other stuff to make complicated topics easily digestible. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey man, come on. There has been significant research published in peer reviewed journals lately, as well as documentaries mentioned in other answers, that describe the ability for plants to communicate in great detail. While none of them are cited here, it is short sided to imply his answer could be wrong simply because it exists on this sub. The original answer here was well-researched and accurate, and as a botanist who studied the relationship between native grasses and the fungal mycelium that helps them communicate, you can tell that I have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an argument that the smell of grass attracts predators who will prey on grazing animals, hence protecting grass. </p>
<p>I don't know how valid that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many prairie grasses evolved to actually be eaten - see the large populations of grazing animals past and present. It strengthens root systems, which is where all the magic happens in grasses. This is very beneficial for a plant with a single growing blade, because the blade can be replaced from the bottom (monocotyledons). The grazing animal eats the green blade, then feeds the plant (root system) by then dropping feces.</p>
<p>Pretty clever actually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that could just as easily be explained as those predators learning to treat that smell as a dinner bell than it being something that the plants &quot;intentionally&quot; developed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on the predator and grazing animal. For example, it is entirely possible that a predator with a strong sense of smell (Wolf) could learn that a strong smell of &quot;freshly chewed grass&quot; means that a deer or rabbit was nearby recently.</p>
<p>The smell itself isn't &quot;attracting&quot; the wolf, but the wolf could learn that the smell is associated with the presence of prey.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except you weren't, while the smell we think of as cut grass is not entirely or probably even majorly composed of signaling molecules, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12205/full" target="_blank">that these volatile chemical signals exist is fairly well established.</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a chemist and I study plant volatile components at UC Davis. This response is not true. Chlorophyll is far too heavy to be in the air as a gas. You are mostly smelling smaller chemicals, in this case of cut grass they are no bigger than 6 carbons long. </p>
<p>Plants definitely communicate through volatile, gaseous chemicals (and in other ways too). There are manuscripts published that describe how plant odors can trigger other plants, herbivores and insectivores in other ways. This is a great paper on it:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is evidence for both underground and above ground signalling with volatile compounds. They are not mutually exclusive. Especially in the case of damage to plants volatile compounds are produced at the wound and spread through the air and can induce the production of toxic or repelling compounds in neighbouring plants.</p></div>		</li>
