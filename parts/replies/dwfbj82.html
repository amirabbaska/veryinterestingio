			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important part that is often overlooked on this question. Even footage of reality looks less real than footage of reality today because we can see it at higher definitions and color quality.</p>
<p>At 360p hair looks blurry regardless of if it's real. At 4k CGI has to basically render individual strands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is ELI5 so I am keeping it simple. Film from the good old days may be capable of producing resolutions even higher than 4k. However when you shine a bright light through it to expand it on a big screen you do not get the same quality as is on the film itself. The technology of analog film projectors increased just like digital quality does.</p>
<p>EDIT: Considering we are talking about film, I figured I should throw in this too. Film through a projector was much more &quot;blurry&quot; because it was fed through at much slower frames per second than is possible today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You even notice this with fairly recent movies. Things look realistic it the theater, but on your TV it looks less real. It is getting closer now that theaters are upgrading their systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or just rewatching things in general.  Something like the Neo vs 100 Agent Smith's fight from the Matrix Reloaded had a lot of CGI that I think looks pretty bad now, after having watched that scene a bunch of times.  The first time I saw it I thought it looked pretty amazing, but they do a lot of jumping back and forth between complete CGI and real characters, and it's easier to let your brain just &quot;go with it&quot; the first time you're watching the scene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just my view - but I remember seeing it at the time and being not very impressed by that scene. I feel like I gave it a bit of leeway as it was clearly ambitious, but the matrix effects had generally been excellent to that point. As you say, the jumping back and forth is very noticeable.
Perhaps part of this idea of it 'looking better when we first saw it' is partly down to.our expectations. We know it's not real, but that it's otherwise impossible - maybe we subconsciously give it a wide berth. By the time we revisit it, our expectations are greater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. One of the reviews said it looked caroonish and more like a video game. I felt the same when I saw it for the first time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now? As I was watching it in the theater, I was thinking &quot;what's this crap doing in a Matrix movie?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember it looking weird and extra elastic-y in theaters too, but that part of the movie is basically the first time that Agent Smith REALLY starts fucking with The Matrix, so my head canon was always the Matrix's rendering couldn't keep up with Smith breaking the rules like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember playing the game 'Black' on PS2 on a CRT television and it was the most beautiful and photorealistic game I'd ever played. </p>
<p>I just played on my 4k television when it came back for XBOX One X and it was the most terrible thing I'd ever saw despite the fact that my 1X was able to upscale it to 4k. </p>
<p>Lesson learned: some nostalgic things need to be left as memories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this with NFS: Most Wanted. </p>
<p>Been watching my kid play Payback on the PS4 thinking that the old PC games looked better due to all the AA and high quality texture settings. Boy was I wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I won't even touch NFSMW after I've played Black. The big issue is that the memories I had of playing it are now kind of ruined after I saw it on the 1X because my biggest attraction to the game was the graphics quality. Since then I won't go back and play any more older games with the exception of Atari or NES games. </p>
<p>Although Warzone 2100 somehow never aged. It was blocky then and blocky now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked that game up a few months ago because I was curious as to how good it looked now. I felt the same way about that game when it came out, now I realize it was just a few tricks that made me think that. They had a good handle on volumetric(?) lighting and that gave the appearance of great graphics. </p></div>		</li>
