<p>How’s the DSM-V? I was still using the IV when I practiced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, my center still technically uses the DSM-IV for coding, though we use the ICD-10 more commonly. </p>
<p>I've just tried to get myself up to date on the DSM-5 for when we inevitably switch over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha, thanks. I heard a lot about spectrum disorders cleaning up certain segments, wasn’t sure if you were seeing/using that yet. Although, if you’re an ICD-10 shop I would guess not so much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The DSM-V has categorized more disorders than the DSM-IV. There are more disorders that have their own diagnosis than the previous. I used the DSM-V when doing research in my Master's. Many disorders have been separated into more subcategories. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my professors works with Eating-disorder patients that are often also affected by body dismorphic disorder.</p>
<p>They ask them to draw themselves on a piece of paper.
Often, those suffering from BDD will draw themselves as they think they look (huge noses, thighs, heads etc.).</p>
<p>Of course that's not sufficient for diagnosis, but it gives them a good idea what they are dealing with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder why eating disorders are treated differently than gender dysphoria. Eating disorder patients are taught to accept themselves and to nuture their body. Gender dysphoria patients can get to a point they are surgically altering healthy functioning body parts. Both seem to be branches of BDD</p></div>		</li>

Those patients know how starved they look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're taught to <em>change</em> their body if they have already done damage to themselves through malnutrition, however.  Eating disorders are not just anorexia, either - some eating disorders cause obesity, in which case the patients also must work to change their body.</p>
<p>The underlying thread in all of them is that healthy mental and physical function are both impaired by the disorder.  Lifestyle changes, and yes, some body modifications, are going to be necessary if that is what it takes.  One girl I know with BDD ended up getting a breast reduction, for the sole reason that that was the body part causing her the most grief and making her want to starve herself.  She went from a C cup to an A cup and lost 10 lbs from the procedure, but she's a lot happier with her overall size and shape now and is eating normally, finally.  Both her and her therapist agree that it was the correct decision</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's typical for different disorders to be treated differently in all of medicine, not just psychiatry. Treatments are designed to improve functioning, well-being and increase longevity which is consistent with both treatments. BDD is not the same diagnosis as an eating disorder or gender dysphoria because the treatments for those disorders are very different than the treatment of BDD.</p>
<p>In particular BDD is an anxiety class disorder while gender dysphoria has biological origins. Eating disorders are often comorbid with anxiety class disorders but OCD is more common than BDD. My BDD patients aren't typically obsessed with their weight as much as they are with other features of their appearance such as bone structure, coloration, unique skin markings, racially identifiable features, or body type. None of my BDD patients have an eating disorder and a few of them eat a healthy, well-balanced diet in a way I would describe as extreme and take their fitness just as seriously. Physically they're taking great care of themselves but it's the emotional motivations and behaviors that drive the problems they struggle with. They are in fact rather different despite the superficial appearance of similarity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op, but I'm not sure that actually answers the question. What if a person is freakishly ugly and hyperaware that they are so ugly, and depressed at that awareness, hence the constant mirror checking. . . Its like, if you were born half man, half spider, and were upset that you weren't attractive, you'd be upset, not clinicly disturbed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no fundamental difference, either way you're obsessively unable to accept your appearance. Objective attractiveness is not part of the therapy, though it may be touched on. </p>
<p>Compulsive behaviour as a result of perhaps more accurate self-assessment is still compulsive behaviour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do acceptance and coping strategies come into it somewhere? I know that these can be important in other contexts, e.g., with people who got disfigured or paralyzed in accidents. IIRC, one of the aims of therapy in these cases is that patients will not define themselves based purely on that one (admittedly major) negative aspect of their existence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure of the question, but I think you're asking about what to do if the symptoms are vague, correct?</p>
<p>DSM-5 criteria are abundantly clear for each disorder. There really isn't much of an overlap between BDD and MDD related to physical appearance. The presentations, as described above, are markedly different. </p>
<p>They most certainly can occur together, but again, both sets of criteria will be met.</p></div>		</li>
