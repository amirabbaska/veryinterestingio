			<div class="markdown"><p>It is hard to deny that animal testing has produced enormous benefits (though it has also been misleading and counterproductive, too). But having benefited from animal research in the past doesn't, in my mind, commit us to an eternal future of animal research. We should begin phasing out the use of live animal models and work hard to find replacements. With the incredible advances in computer technologies, I would hope that we could innovate our way to a more ethical future. In the meantime, as we make our way toward animal-friendly utopia, I would like to see a halt to animal studies that simply replicate already existing data (e.g., the proposal by U of Wisconsin researchers to re-do Harry Harlow's nasty experiments on maternal deprivation in monkeys), that don't make important contributions to the literature (there is far too much junk research), or that cause profound suffering to animals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree to an extent, for some scientific questions, we may not ever be able to phase out animal models of disease. In my field (toxicology) there's a big push to develop human cell culture models and computational modeling as a way to do chemical risk assessment without use of animals, however for some of the questions I'm interested in, like whole body immune responses or developmental toxicity, there may never be a reasonable alternative to using animals.</p></div>		</li>
