<p>When I was stationed in Germany for a while I visited some towns in North Eastern France and the shit these people find in their fields or when they're doing construction in and around former Battlefields is incredible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Compare and contrast with France that had huge swathes of its territory rendered completely unusable to the point that even today they are finding metal fragments from the war there. </p>

<p>&quot;Finding metal fragments&quot; is something that happens with the remains of Caesar's battlefields.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_Rouge" target="_blank">The result of WW1 was the Zone Rouge: &quot;Completely devastated. Damage to properties: 100%. Damage to Agriculture: 100%. Impossible to clean. Human life impossible.&quot;</a> It's still off limits 100 years later, because the shells (especially chemical warfare munitions) are still lethal. And even if you get rid of the shells, the soil itself is lethal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some areas remain off limits (for example two small pieces of land close to Ypres and Woëvre) where 99% of all plants still die, as arsenic can constitute up to 17% of some soil samples (Bausinger, Bonnaire, and Preuß, 2007).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(There's a dig going on in some part of it right now, and going by comments from people involved, the army's EOD team is doing more work than the archaeologists themselves.)</p></div>		</li>
