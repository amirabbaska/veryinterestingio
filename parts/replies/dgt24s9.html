			<div class="markdown"><p>I once spent a week checking with the FTC, FCC, FBI, local PD, and 3 different phone companies.  I reached a human at each agency who seemed to be speaking authority when he told me &quot;We don't really care&quot;.</p>
<p>Basically, nobody in authority gives a shit.  They don't know how to block this, and it would be really hard, so they just throw up their hands and say &quot;it's not my problem.&quot;   And why should they care?  It's not costing them anything.  The only things it costs is millions of mildly irritated people and hundreds of suckers who willingly gave their money away to a con.</p>
<p>Now, if phone companies were liable for phone fraud with spoofed numbers, I guarantee the problem would disappear <em>overnight</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main problem I find is those suckers are elderly people with dementia. This happened to my grandpa he really thought it was legit that he won a car. He also didn't know who I was. He got diagnosed shortly after and everything is out of his hands now but they call nonstop. My grandma just unplugs the phone now. It has been about 8 years since then.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh, come on now, that's not a very reasonable way of putting it.  Most of the calls I receive prey on people with credit card debt.  They're scared and poorly informed.  You say 'suckers', I say 'frightened people who are already drowning'.  You say 'willingly gave away' and I say 'lied to and scammed out of'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phone systems are just misconfigured. In Internet backbone routing we have a couple decades bogon filters, route filters, and egress filters to prevent assholes from doing this shit. But the phone companies need to get their heads out of their butts and apply some obvious protections to avoid Robogeddon on the telephone system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, you can't really blame them for that. Conventional phone calls are going to fade away in the relatively near future (with more and more people switching to free internet-based alternatives) so the phone companies are focused on switching to the role of wireless network providers rather than investing in a dying technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Telecom has a long and entrenched ivory-tower-engineer problem. It's full of 'lifer' engineers who are convinced that they are the gatekeepers of a technology that other mortals could not dare to comprehend.</p>
<p>I worked in that world, my father-in-law still does. and even though the world has been proving them wrong for nearly 50 years now, the mentality still holds strong that telco engineers and telco engineering are arcane magic that mere mortals could never comprehend, much less manipulate to their own nefarious ends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There actually is a way to stop it but it's virtually impossible to implement efficiently. It would be the same process that ensures that you know when you log into your bank website, that it's the real website. Digitally signed certificates. Every device that uses a particular  a phone number rewarded one from their carrier. </p>
<p>So you sign up with Verizon and get a new phone? A certificate gets loaded onto the phone. You make a phone call and the certificate is verified before your phone call is connected with the carrier service. The receiving phone number gets a signal that a call is coming from 555-555-5555 and gets the certificate signature. Your phone then references that signature against a giant certificate database and if it checks out, the call is continued and your phone actually rings. </p>
<p>This alone only makes sure the person calling you is who they say they are, not that you want the call. The next step is the user developing a block/allow list that could be based on a particular individual, and organization, etc. So if you get a phone call and it's a spam message, you hit a button to reject any further calls from that organization or person. And going forward, those certificates are black listed and never make it to your phone. </p>
<p>Why don't we do this? It's insanely cost prohibitive. It's also inconvenient and hard to scale and isn't very flexible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to go beyond this and have a cryptographically secure chain of authorization to contact me. If you want to make my phone ring, you must get permission from someone in my contacts, or their contacts (transitively up to two or three levels). When you call, I can see who let you do it, and revoke that person's permission in the future if they're abusing my trust. Don't know anyone who knows me and want to cold call me? Pay ten cents, or whatever price I decide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That first six number thing is not foolproof. I deal with local phone numbers often for my job, and there are numerous sets of three that appear after the area code a ton. 616, 494, and 806 constantly show up in the middle section of numbers in my area, so much so that I recognize &quot;oh, that's the same as mom's, that's the same as my old number&quot; as I dial them. Obviously the area code is the same since they're in the same city, and aside from that there's still ten thousand combinations for the last four digits of your phone number. I'm pretty sure those similar numbers are just coincidentally people that have the same provider and got their number around the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait. Your mobile number has an area code... like a landline?</p>
<p>Here in the UK all mobile numbers start with an 07xxx prefix dependant on which network originally issued the number (you can move your whole number across to another network if you want, prefix and all) - so there's no link between your mobile number and where you live. </p>
<p>On the few times I've had scam phone calls it's always been from a standard landline number (01xxx or 02xxx), as opposed to the 0800 or 0345 prefixes typically used by national businesses, so I know at a glance isn't my home town.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SIP is not &quot;SS7 over IP&quot; . it is &quot;Session Initiation Protocol&quot;, SIP lacks all the control overhead of SS7</p>
<p>SS7 over IP is &quot;SaSSi&quot; or &quot;IP7&quot;. (Depending on whether you went with Lucent or Nortel's implementation)</p>
<p>(source: was security engineer for USWest Telecom, during the first SS7 over IP switching deployments, in 2000/2001)</p>
<p>You should probably address the lack of egress ANI Filtering as a result of SIP/SS7 gateways however, as the major factor in ease of caller ID spoofing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good post. I was thinking of SIGTRAN and have corrected it. Back in the days of people being excited to have their own ISDN line, that was where it first started to become very easy to spoof a phone number. The SIP and VOIP stuff came later when I was on to other work.   </p>
<p>There was this big Nortel server that nobody really knew how to support I inherited which was HP high availability nodes in a cluster configuration and it's job was to translate SS7 and IP networks so they could talk to each other. It had v.35 on one interface and fiber channel on the other. We called it a SIG not to be confused with an ISG which was an IS41 to GSM gateway aka old school analog to GSM. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nah,  I think the last time I did any kind of telco work was some voip stuff back in 2007. I did spent the three days during 9/11,  four floors into the basement of the armored CO in Denver (Colfax Ave) though.</p>
<p>Still a security guy, went on to do lots of DFIR Work (if you dig around with the people involved in the RSA Breach discovery, you can likely figure out who I am IRL).. These days I'm retired from DFIR and working in the product space to build better shit for the current generation.</p>
<p>Telco was a hell of a career starter though.. Probably helped that I had plenty of telco securty experience before I got my first telco security job though :D</p></div>		</li>
