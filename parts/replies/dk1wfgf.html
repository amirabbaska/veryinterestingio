			<div class="markdown"><p>No,  it's to feed them things like fries and chicken nuggets in moderation and make sure they eat plenty of healthy things too. Kids can still develop a taste for broccoli, it just takes more time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. My daughter is 3 and doesn't like nuggets, tho she loves fries and broccoli. This is mostly due to the portions we put on her plate and what's closest to her when the plate is served. Also, calling something &quot;Elsa's favorite veggie&quot; or &quot;Mickey's Favorite waffle&quot; makes her want to eat it. As long as the characters she likes also like it, she eats it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>negative. The key is to not let whatever tactic they're using get them out of eating the broccoli get them out of eating the broccoli...They don't want broccoli? offer 1 similar alternative, maybe squash? don't want that.. You will once I take both away and now you have none! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has also a lot to do with how parent &quot;buy silence&quot; from their kids...</p>
<p>So many parents don't have the nerve to let a tantrum run it's course and simply give the kid what they want (food or else..).</p>
<p>At some point the kids will want only what they like since they know how and can get it easily...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ignoring them is the key. Distractiing them just makes them associate attention with crying.</p>
<p>Kids behave and learn alot like puppies. When you get a new pup, he will cry all night (he feels alone, abandoned, etc...) if you get up, you are fucked.</p>
<p>If you give a cookie everytime he is annoying you, he learned he can get cookies by annoying you.</p>
<p>The only reason people don't treat their kids like puppies (not litterally, but you know...close! ) is because of the stigma. If a kid does a public tantrum, parents get judged and they will tend to do anything to shut it down instead of ignoring it...</p></div>		</li>
