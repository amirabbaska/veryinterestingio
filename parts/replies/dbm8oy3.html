			<div class="markdown"><p>How would a single photon exist at different energy levels simultaneously?  White light is an even distribution of different frequencies.  As I understand it, a single photon would represent only a single frequency.</p>
<p>Edit:  Ah!  One photon &quot;at a time&quot;!  So, sending complex waveshapes along this one bit channel would look something like pulse width modulation.</p>
<p>Edit2:  No, it's not a one bit channel, it's a one packet channel.  And I think it visualizes better as PCM than PWM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photons don't have a 'size', people sometimes think wavelength = photon size, which I think is what's happened here.</p>
<p>OP's question doesn't quite make sense. You'd need information about the incoming field to define a pinhole diameter which would let through on average 1 photon per exposure. And with a simple pinhole you're not going to be able to ensure only one photon per exposure. Supposing 'everyday' illumination conditions used for cameras, the pinhole would have to be very small to approach 1 photon per exposure, which would indeed reduce resolution massively.</p>
<p>You could, however, use a wide aperture and low intensity illumination. The image would then be limited by exposure time and noise in the detector, rather than angular resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean the TM_(00) mode? Although it has a set form, its actual width will depend on the system generating it, and in open space it will converge/diverge.</p>
<p>Measurement starts to get ugly if you talk about 'size' with quantum particles. The translation between classical and quantum 'sizes' a lot of the time comes down to 'diameter within which 1/2 or 1/e or 1/e^2 of the probability density exists', and this would kind of make sense by using the TM_(00) mode for light. The problem is, in the background physicists know they don't <em>really</em> mean size when they say 'size of the electron', or whatever particle, they mean this measure of probability. Then using the word 'size' with a layman is likely to cause confusion. </p>
<p>Take the photon example. If I say the 'size' of something is 5mm, and I try to pass it through a hole 4mm wide, in layman terms I wouldn't expect the thing to go through. The laser I actually use has TM_(00) of 6mm diameter, and I definitely get photons going through a pinhole under 1mm across.</p>
<p>Even for pinholes well below the wavelength, there's a very small, but non-zero probability of a photon going through (even without tunnelling coming into it). Physicists do use the term 'size' with some quantities they probably shouldn't, when they know who they're talking to knows what they <em>really</em> mean, but it's a point of laziness rather than being an accurate term to use. And while they will use 'size' when talking about atoms, electrons, protons, etc., I never really hear anyone saying &quot;size of a photon&quot; at my research centre. Maybe because wave-particle duality came to photons from the wave-side rather than the particle-side, like the other examples, so people didn't automatically lump them together with particles, which sound like they should have a 'size'.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anyone is interested in making pinhole cameras, there's an easy formula to figure out the optimum pinhole size relative to the pinhole to film/sensor distance. It is D=√f/141, where D is the diameter of the pinhole and f is the pinhole to film distance.</p>
<p>Edit: This is in inches, for millimeters the formula is D=√f/28</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nrrg, this kind of equation bothers me to an unreasonable extent. At some point the units were dropped from the constants. If they hadn't been dropped, then <em>it doesn't matter</em> what units you plug in or get out. You just convert from and convert to whatever units you need.</p>
<p>An example from astronomy is the classic distance equation:</p>
<pre><code>distance = 1/parallax angle</code></pre>
<p>...except this equation only works if distance is given in parsecs and parallax angle in arcseconds. Also you'll note that the dimensions don't equate -- distance has units of meters, but angles are dimensionless!</p>
<p>The underlying equation, before dropping the units, is</p>
<pre><code>distance = 1 astronomical unit/parallax angle</code></pre>
<p>In this equation you can plug in <em>any kind of units</em> and get a sensible answer. It also tells you something deeper about the phenomenon in question: the parallax is related to the distance from the Earth to the Sun (1 AU). The first equation has the hidden assumption that the telescope is located on the Earth (a quite practical assumption, but one which remains undisclosed), but the latter equation puts the assumption right out in front. We could easily calculate how much additional accuracy we'd get if the telescope was e.g. orbiting Neptune instead of on or near the Earth.</p>
<p>Getting back to the pinhole camera: I <em>want</em> to know more about how this equation works, but it's completely opaque to inspection. Does it make an assumption about wavelength? If so, what's the underlying relation? What if I wanted to make a pinhole camera for X-rays? Is there any attempt to minimize blurriness? Diffraction? Does it trade off light gathering ability? What's really going on here?</p>
<p>I also use my dimension-preserving calculator all the time (eg the <code>units</code> command), letting me just use whatever unit is most convenient. But I can't do that here, even though it's fundamentally an equation that involves physical units/dimensions.</p>

<p>It's likely derived from the Rayleigh criterion for angular resolution. The resolving limit for a camera is</p>
<p>Δx = 1.22(fλ/D)</p>
<p>where Δx is your resolution (the size of your CCD pixel) and λ is your wavelength. The 1.22 comes from a small-angle approximation iirc.</p></div>		</li>
