			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. I <em>suspect</em> that very moderate (1-2 drinks absolute max) per day helps with my autoimmune disease symptoms (beyond the relaxation aspect). But am I just imagining it? I really can't say for sure. It does seem like alcohol could modulate the immune system in some way that might benefit some people with immune-mediated conditions(????)  I'm not trying to justify alcohol use; in fact, I'd rather abstain completely, and currently am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol with autoimmune disorders generally feels good in the moment but will make you worse long term. Especially when you take into account that regular alcohol consumption in combination with the permanent, side-effect heavy medications AI disorders involve will destroy your liver and then you won't be able to take medication OR drink</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't imagine so. Remember that /u/slowandsteadylearner said alcohol weakens both you and your immune system. If it's weakening both sides of that equation, it's a wash.</p></div>		</li>
