			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting side effect of dictionary compression is that if you compress a whole set of dictionaries for different languages i.e one zip file per language then you can use this to detect the language of an unknown phrase.</p>
<p>If you add the mystery phrase to each of the zip files, the file that increase in size by the least amount is the correct language for the phrase. That's because this file will be the only one that already has the vocabulary of the phrase present so very little increase will take place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not sure if it would be considered delta coding but compressed video files have key frames periodically throughout the file. then the intermediate frames only need to have the data for pixels that have changed since the last key frame. higher compression ratios have less key frames.</p></div>		</li>
