			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello Reddit! If there was a surefire method we would not be having this conversation but I agree with <em>Quetzlcoatlus</em> that pointing to seemingly counter-intuitive evidence can help sometimes. But no matter that oil giants like Exxon accept the science (in fact, helped create it), facts falter in the face of beliefs. That's the lesson I've learned from too long in journalism.</p>
<p>So what I find works is to ask about the weather. Specifically have you noticed any changes in the weather? Most folks are ready, willing, and able to offer examples of how the weather just isn't the same anymore. In fact, I spoke with a lot of farmers in recent years for various reporting projects and while many of them were skeptical of climate change, none of them thought the weather was normal. In fact, the weather was so abnormal that they were changing their farming practices (planting earlier, adopting no-till, etc.) Similarly, I've spoken with many Tea Partiers who have solar panels on their roof. Why? It's not to combat climate change, it's for energy independence.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get at here is that it doesn't matter what people believe in (or don't) as long as the actions are towards reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and cutting emissions of greenhouse gases. As the saying goes, physics doesn't care whether you believe in it or not... I guess I worry less about convincing people and more about people making the necessary changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a great answer. Even if people don't believe that we're ruining the planet, they probably believe that we're running out if oil and that we'll need to switch to renewable energy sooner or later. Why not be at the forefront like Americans &quot;always are&quot;? The economical benefits in the long run are more important to some people than the environmental consequences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I have found to be a very simple thing that can be convincing specifically on climate change:</p>
<p><a href="http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/current-issues/climate-policy/climate-perspectives/our-position" target="_blank">Even ExxonMobil acknowledges the existence of human caused climate change</a></p>
<p>If an oil giant with a financial stake in denial can understand and acknowledge the truth, then anyone should be able to. The science is settled that it's happening and it's human caused.       </p>
<p>Edit: to be clear, I am in no way saying that big oil is supporting efforts to limit Climate Change or is out to save the planet. They are actively opposing efforts to combat CC in some very scummy ways. The point is that they can't and don't deny that it is happening and it is human caused. The evidence is too clear to deny, so they have to fight it in underhanded ways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to point out how vague and basic that statement is. It doesn't specify any of the actions they're taking to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions currently, or anything that they're planning to do in the future to change their business. It accepts no responsibility for the current issues that we're facing due to companies like Exxon Mobil. They're saying, &quot;Yeah...climate change.......&quot; <em>crickets</em> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their statement means little though when they continue to destroy the planet</p>
<p>just saying &quot;Yeah it's caused by us, but it's not a big problem&quot; is not really okay</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it was having to fight in a war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Ask the person,&quot;Why do you want to consign us (presuming you're an American talking to another American) perpetually fighting wars in the Middle East, or constantly fearing that some foreign dictator could wreck our economy at whim?  Even if we went whole-hog on extracting our own oil, it's still a global market - and it's going to be cheaper to get oil other places for a long time.  Shouldn't we do something to break this cycle?  Wouldn't it be better to invent something better, then sell it to everyone else?  Haven't we spent enough money and lost enough troops attempting to keep things &quot;stable&quot; in far-away lands?&quot;</p>
<p>There's some hyperbole in there, but I'm trying to give you something to be used in a conversation.  Please be aware that this won't work if it's not at least marginally congruent with someone's impression of you. </p></div>		</li>
