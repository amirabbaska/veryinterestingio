			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha :P I know what you mean but in this thread nearly 2/3rds of the answers were people talking about how Coca Cola only adds sugar to addict people. Etc etc etc.</p>
<p>So it was annoying to read, so wrote my reply in anger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems redditors have reached the point where they know so much that they get the conclusions totally wrong. Somebody who knows nothing about chemistry/biology/neuroscience would say &quot;hey, coke tastes sweet and people like the taste of the drink so that's why it's like it&quot;.</p>
<p>Add a modicum of extra knowledge and you get &quot;glucose is the preferential energy source for the body and is the exclusive substrate for brain metabolism. Millions of years of evolution have led us to develop biochemical reward pathways that make us feel elated if we eat a lot of sugar, Therefore drinking coke can have a neuromodualtory effect and can become addictive. Coca Cola knows this and deliberately adds sugar so we keep buying their products&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you also making fun of the second conclusion? I can't tell from your reply.</p>
<p>The second part was great UNTIL &quot;Coca Cola knows this and deliberately adds sugar so we keep buying their products.&quot; then it went bat shit insane. It implies an evil, it implies the main component is to add a substance to make something more addictive. Most cases that's really not the case. </p>
<p>Oh I made these cookies taste great, begin to sell them and after the fact people find out it has a lot of sugar. &quot;OH YOUR ADDING SUGAR TO ADDICT ME TO YOUR COOKIES? EVIL FUCKING PERSON HOW DARE YOU!&quot;.</p>
<p>Also it's really not deliberate. Deliberate would imply you can achieve the same result without sugar BUT they add sugar to addict people. Diet Coke tastes good, but has an after taste. Thus not the same result. </p>
<p>If anyone comes to the end conclusion at the second statement they really need to step back and think there life through. You need to prove that statement. </p>
<p>This is what I mean by these batshit insane conspiracy nuts. Hell if we want to go from the REAL reason so much sugar is in a coca cola it comes back to the days when they used COCA in coca cola, it was a medical drink with cocaine infused. That stuff tastes HORRIBLE and required a lot of sugar to make it drinkable. Couple that with the already sour tasting carbonation it's a no fucking brainier. After formulas changed, cocaine/coca removed they leave the sugar in because people liked the drink. Formulas changed over time, people liked the general taste. No reason to change a product without it. Why do they use HFCS? It's cheaper. Saves money, same result.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This was the key part - I wasn't referring to you but adding to your point about ELI5 becoming full of conspiracies. My overall point is that a lot of reddit users are fairly well read but they apply the knowledge in ways that lead them to erroneous conclusions, hence the second paragraph. </p>
<p>I was remarking that from a basic facts point of view, it's fairly obviously that Coca-Cola make the product sweet to appeal to the tastes of people and that's why they buy it. But then a lot of people who've done a little reading here and there pile in and incorrectly use scientific explanations to justify their crackpot theories. Sort of along the lines of  &quot;a little knowledge is a dangerous thing&quot;</p>
<p>To make it perfectly clear: I am lampooning people who espouse beliefs like in the second paragraph. I think coke has a lot of sugar because it's acidic and sweetness takes the edge off while maintaining acidic bite. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope, they simply make a lot of money because their product is naturally addictive. There's no conspiracy theory, just the blatant and obvious fact that people will continue to sell you something long after they find out it's incredibly unhealthy.</p>
<p>Just look at tobacco products. That shit kills millions of people every year, but they don't give a fuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I <strong>wholeheartedly</strong> agree. The OP is essentially begging the question. The soft drinks don't <strong>need</strong> that amount of sugar. They are just formulated that way, because the consumers love it that way. There's nothing inherent there. Personally, I drink mostly water, and everyone else should too, so I don't really care all that much as to how much sugar is there in soda. I get my sugar from cookies :)</p></div>		</li>
