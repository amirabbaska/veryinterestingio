			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same answer.  The 10-piece is marked up specifically to make you think the 20-piece is a good deal.  Instead of saying in your head &quot;Why am I paying $5 for this&quot;, you are saying &quot;Wow this is only $0.50 more&quot;.  Instead of wondering if $5.00 is a good price for 20 nuggets, you are happy that you think you are getting a good deal by ordering the larger meal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll find a lot of restaurants do this too. They'll list an expensive dish first, such as pasta for $54.99, so all of a sudden, those $24.99 entrees don't look so bad anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question.</p>
<p>Why is the same deal not available in germany? 9 piece (there is no 10 piece) nuggets are 4,49€ while 20 nuggets are 7,59€. Sure it is still much better than per nugget value, but not even remotely as close as $4.49 to $5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense, but I'm sure they could get away with making the 20pack $6 or $7 or something. Obviously there are great marketing minds behind the move but it just seems insane that they would price them that close together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make the 20-pack look like a <em>super good deal</em> and make you buy the $5 20 pack. If the 10-pack was $2.50 (a logical price based on a $5 20 pack) you'd just buy one of those</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both markups are likely pretty large, the 10 piece might cost them <del>$0.30</del>$0.60 and the 20 piece might cost <del>$0.60</del>$1.20 (see /u/meccanexus below).  The expensive part is the employee time it takes to take your order, take your money, and prepare your order (potentially /~$2 dollars for .25 employee hours--say 5 employees for 3 minutes).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's similar to the &quot;if you buy now, you'll get 3 for the price of 1!&quot; For things sold on TV.  The price is for 3, not one, so they can sell 3x the products per sale. </p></div>		</li>
