			<div class="markdown"><p>There's really no way you're going to tell a real from a fake Rolex when it's on someone else's wrist.  And even if you got a good close look, unless you are really familiar with the real one of the same model you're not going to notice the details that give it away.  </p>
<p>Seeing a Rolex on someone else's wrist only tells you that they want to look successful, not that they are.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a watch design company and during my trips overseas I saw some fakes that were so good that even good jewelers had to send them out to verify them. We used to call them cholex.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays fakes are getting so hard to notice, even for an experienced watch enthusiast. I feel the easiest way to tell if a watch is real is based on the person wearing it; how they carry themselves, what job they have, whether they would realistically be able to afford a Rolex, AP etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lots save up many years or spend a disproportionate amount of their income on a watch to celebrate an achievement etc.</p>
<p>Who cares at the end of the day, as long as they’re happy and not blatantly flexing a fake</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol I recognized my barbers Rolex as a fake because the glass was scratched up like a Timex you buy at Target. Very obviously not sapphire glass.</p>
<p>But I see your point, it’s hard to tell a <em>good</em> fake at a glance </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's a bad thing. My father was a successful corporate lawyer who drove a 10 year old BMW M3 and wore a Timex watch (yes, the car was still very nice, but only cost him $30k).</p>
<p>He always told me that work and reputation speaks for itself, anyone who buys expensive things only wants to LOOK successful and isn't necessarily so (in fact many live pay check to pay check to sustain that image).</p>
<p>I can understand it somewhat in financial advisory because it's harder to provide a proven track record. But in IB, consulting, law, etc. Those professions are so synonymous with big money having a Rolex or nice car makes you a dime a dozen.</p>
<p>This isn't to say you don't still need to look nice and dress well. He still wore Hugo Boss suits and custom leather shoes, but bought things that stayed in fashion forever and were practical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My best friend is an attorney. She did something I really admire and respect. She was in student loan debt of $250,000 (yep). She decided to pay off her loans as fast as possible so a huge percentage of her paycheck went to paying it. She has been extremely frugal. She has an old used Toyota Camry, lives in a studio apartment (but it's in a very expensive area), and she doesn't have that much clothing. </p>
<p>She told me that she is the only one at her current firm that she knows of that is paying off her loans this way. She said that the people she works with don't care how quickly they pay off their loans and that they have designer handbags, always get their hair and nails done, expensive clothing, and expensive cars.</p></div>		</li>
