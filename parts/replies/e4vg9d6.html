<p>If you see a Satellite that looks like it is wrapped in a gold Mylar Blanket that is not gold it is a Polymer called Kapton with an aluminum backing which is a different type of Mylar Blanket and is an MLI, Multi Layer Insulation which also keeps the sat safe from degrading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Also the same stuff as used for waveguide windows in SatCom and radar applications. (We used a ton of it when I worked in satellite communications... RF transparent, but a decent electrical insulator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Polyimide (the generic name) is super common. Great heat resistance, good insulator and pretty chemical resistant. The only downside is the price. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And MLI is a sandwich of the aluminized kapton and a a filler mesh (a bit like tulle) which maintains a small gap. Each layer pair forms a radiative couple that prevents heat from radiating away (since space is - 270C). </p>
<p>Without air, there us no convection, and the gap prevents conduction from  transferring the heat (except where the mesh touches) . I can't remember the actual numbers, but if each layer reflects 90% back, and you have 6 layers, it will reduce the heat loss by a factor of one million.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the lack of convection/conduction also works against you for cooling powered items. Some if the advanced heat pipes you see in tablets/laptops were developed to get heat from internal components to radiators on spacecraft surfaces more efficiently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would have thought it was more to prevent heat from reaching whatever object is in space.</p>
<p>While technically space is about 3 Kelvin, it’s also an exceptionally good insulator. It doesn’t really have a temperature - the temperature is of the few atoms that are present per meter cubed.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in space flight is getting rid of excess heat and preventing things from overheating.</p>
<p>And when you’re talking about delicate CCDs, you want them as cold as possible with certain lower limits, as keeping them colder keeps the dark current down as low as possible, which is a significant source of noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good visual example is <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/images/news-071613c-lg.jpg" target="_blank">the <del>leading</del> aft edge of the thermal cover</a> on the ISS' Quest airlock. It almost looks burnt.</p>
<p>Edit: I got turned around. That edge of the thermal cover is actually facing opposite the direction of travel, so now I just have more questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I was mistaken by the upside-down orientation of the photo. The 'burnt' edge is actually facing opposite the direction of travel. So now I'm a little confused about why it is darker on that edge.</p>
<p>The ISS would fly in 'reverse' (aft-end-forward) while the Shuttle was docked, but that would only last for 1 to 2 weeks at a time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Air is pumped out of the airlock (and back into the station) until it reaches a pressure of 5psi. The remaining air is then vented into space through a valve on the hatch. At 5psi, the air is not escaping at a significantly high velocity.</p>
<p>The airlock pump is capable of reducing the pressure to 1psi, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a trade analysis was conducted that compared the air savings of going down to 1 psi and the EVA time and consumables lost by the crew members waiting for that process to complete and it was determined that the optimal solution is to use the Depress Pump Assembly to lower the pressure of the crew lock to 5 psi (259 mmHg) and then to vent the remaining air overboard through the equalization valve on the external hatch.</p>
