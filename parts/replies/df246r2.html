Knowing the mechanics really helps when modifing recioes because you know what to manipulate in order to produce a specific outcome. Knowing the history makes you appriciate the dish and sound more cultured when talking to people about your recipes. </p>
<p>It is also nice that he talks about what to look for in terms of hardware. Most other shows never tell you about what to look for when choosing a whisk, rolling pin, food processer, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it was such an informative show.  I really like learning about the food chemistry and nutritional information, never knew eggplant was high in fluoride and isn't all that nutritional as far as veggies go.  Or how lentils are a popular meat substitute. </p>
<p>I watch good eats and the original iron chef.  One to learn about food, the other for recipe inspiration.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He also has a road show (Eat Your Science) that I've seen a couple times. He talks about food in much the same way as Good Eats and it's quite entertaining.</p></div>		</li>
