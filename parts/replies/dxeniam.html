			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm working with a service that has this exact configuration. Load balancers get the request, assign you a server from a pool and mark down your path for future traffic. If the server you got assigned had an issue just when you made the request and it wasn't flagged as down (and removed from the pool), this happens.</p>
<p>It's very hard to deal with every individual case and situation so it's much more effective to move the problem (as it were) back to the customer and have them refresh the page and start the stack from the beginning. It's like if you were fishing, and when casting a line it gets tangled up - just discard your pole and line, and throw another instead of trying to untangle the mess.</p></div>		</li>
