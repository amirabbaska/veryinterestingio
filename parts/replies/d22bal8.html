			<div class="markdown"><p>While the other top answers make good points, this one is definitely the most relevant to my experience. When we see people in person we average their facial movements over (a short) time, and the result is much more symmetric than any given snapshot, which taken in isolation will look distorted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trying to take a pic of a friend while she was talking to a group of people once, and she looked awful in every pic. I kept watching her and thinking &quot;but she looks normal. Why does she look so wierd in the pictures?&quot; 100% what you've described. When I'm watching her talk, she looks like she's a normal person talking because I'm not isolating one moment and studying it. I'm seeing all her movements and hearing her speak. When I take a picture, her mouth is open and her eyes are doing something and her hands are mid-movement. It's not a good representation of how she looked in real life.</p></div>		</li>
