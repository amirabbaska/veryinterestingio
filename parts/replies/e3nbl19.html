			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense. So if in theory we develop some sort of diamond tether that is very strong and does not stretch could we have perfectly straight power lines? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live they typically hang lower in Winter because there's higher electricity demand. The heating from resistance has a bigger effect than the ambient temperature. Not applicable if you're somewhere hot and AC load is a big deal!</p>
<p>Edit: Talked to an engineer here. (I'm not one, but I work with them). We use dynamic line ratings, which basically means that the colder it is, the more power you can safely transfer through a line. So, it's kind of self determining - the lines will sag the same amount whatever the ambient temperature, because the safe amount of flow is (partially) set by the ambient temperature. Hope that makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a side note, diamond is not very strong in this regard. It is very hard, so will scratch/cut most other things, but it's tensile strength (amount of force it will take before breaking) is lower than a lot of things. There's a good table of tensile strengths here <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly correct/incorrect. Look at an FBD of a stretched power line, there is always a gravitational component, which means there is always an X,Y component vector. Thus in the presence of gravity, perfectly horizontal stretches are impossible.</p>
<p>You're on the correct track and ended at the same result, but I wanted to clarify it for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, clarification is awesome since I couldn't say with 100% scientific evidence that what I said was absolutely true. I just took what little I know of the various sciences and formed this explination.</p>
<p>For example when you say FBD I have 0 clue what that is, I'd have to go Google it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I shouldn't do that. Free Body Diagram.</p>
<p>Here's a good example of one that also helps elaborate on my original point.</p>
<p><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicstestbook2/wp-content/uploads/sites/211/2017/10/Figure_04_05_06.jpg" target="_blank">https://opentextbc.ca/physicstestbook2/wp-content/uploads/sites/211/2017/10/Figure_04_05_06.jpg</a></p>
<p>It decomposes all X,Y,Z components as well as moments (torque), so you can see resultant forces, or motions, as well as what cancels. In the example pic the X components cancel so there's no X motion and the upwards Y component is cancelled by gravity, so again there is no motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are all valid, but I think you should also mention that electricity lines (which was mentioned in OP) are deliberately left slack because they'll contract at low temperatures and would snap if they'd been tightened to be as straight as possible.</p></div>		</li>
