			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess this is where I was getting at. Like a population of 10,000 with the genetics of 10 different ethnic backgrounds evenly bred within them will be stronger in a genetic sense than a population of 10,000 say of all one type bred among each other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. In a stable environment a population that is highly specialised to take full advantage of that environment will outperform a diverse population.<br />
That's just theoretical though, in practice environmental stability isn't a given. So enough diversity to provide the population with members possesing traits that enable them to take advantage of the changes in environment is better.<br />
There is a cost to traits that don't immediately translate into an inrease in reproduction though. So natural selection tends to balance diversity within populations on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an addendum, there are examples throughout the history of earth where environments stayed stable long enough for species to become highly specialised. These environments then changed causing the extinction of those overly specialized species. Natural selection is reactive, it doesn't know the future.</p></div>		</li>
