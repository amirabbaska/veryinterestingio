Then transported by truck, more regrigerator and possible nitrogen, and finally they want to sell them, make sure they are ready and ripe enought, then more refrigerated truck possibly to a local warehouse, more refrigerator, more refrigerated truck and finally the store.
Also have to bug clean and make sure no bug will come back... I guess the nitrogen also help for that (it remove the oxygen, no oxygen, no life, no bug).</p>
<p>Orange for consumption need to be good looking.</p>
<p>Orange juice are picked usually ripe, sent directly to be pressed with no real care about being damaged during the transport: it won't stay intact for long, few hours at most. Once pressed and all, they are bottled and some don't even need to be refrigerated. And even if they do need to be then it's standard refrigerator, no nitrogen required, no special packing or care.</p>
<p>Orange for juice just need to be good tasting and safe to eat AFTER PASTERISATION or whatever mean to make it safer. An orange on the ground that is half smashed can still be ok for juice under some conditions.</p>
<p>To damage a bottle you need to be really not carefull and almost do it on purpose. Even if a box drop then the bottle is most likelly still fine. To damage an orange, you only need to be a little less than gentle.</p></div>		</li>

That pretty apple you picked manually, carefully making sure not to leave any marks on its fragile skin? That one is for the grocery shelves, with any luck. That half-rotten apple full of slugs that fell off a week ago and got rolled over by the farm truck? That one is for apple juice. Thank god for pasterisation!</p>
<p>I still drink apple juice. Slugs make good protein!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That protein literally was a key competent of  a few developing countries diets. They would just eat staples but ground wheat is ground wheat right (usually loads of bugs) I'll look for the paper tomorrow but strict new requirements on siloing of wheat lead to a temporary health emergency as effectively their micro diet had changed overnight. They ate wheat but the bugs were no longer ground up in it so there low protein intake went even lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oranges and other citrus actually only ripen on the tree - once harvested, they are what they are. They also don't actually respond very well to controlled atmosphere storage either, they'll decay anyway. Source: am a produce buyer and oranges are a bitch. You can look all this stuff up on the USDA website and at UC Davis postharvest technology site, it's really interesting!</p></div>		</li>

I personally don't care eating &quot;ugly&quot; produce, my mom shopped at Asian markets all her life. The produce section in American grocery chains almost look like a showroom with the fruit looking all polished and shiny.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Some of the shiny is there for other reasons.</p>
<p>Many fruits and vegetables, such as apples, cucumbers, mellons, peppers, and others, are washed when brought in from the field then given a short bath in hot food-grade wax.  The ultra-thin layer of wax helps prevent fungus/mold issues, is a barrier to help prevent rot, and helps protect the fruit.</p>
<p>As a side effect, the wax provides a polished shiny layer to the fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically, the lower grades of produce of most sorts are actually called things like &quot;Grade A&quot; and &quot;#1&quot;</p>
<p>(Because the higher grades will be called things like &quot;Specialty&quot;, &quot;Extra Fancy&quot;, and the like -- but it varies by product.  I don't know oranges)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! It's beneficial for companies (they get to sell more of their stock &amp; don't have to throw out otherwise perfectly good food) AND the poor (get healthy food for cheap without reduction in quality other than aesthetically) which is super rare, so why wouldn't everyone do it? :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More importantly, juice oranges in the US are almost entirely Valencia or Hamlin oranges that are grown almost exclusively in Florida. They are not particularly good eating oranges. It's much more efficient to process juice oranges in bulk than to pack and ship the 'eating' oranges you buy at the grocery store, which are not usually  (as noted above) the same kind of oranges.</p></div>		</li>
