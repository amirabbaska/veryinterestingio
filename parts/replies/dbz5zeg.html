<p>FM theoretically takes an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation#Bessel_functions" target="_blank">infinite bandwidth</a>. But like all things in engineering, they made a tradeoff. Deciding how much distortion, for how much bandwidth to allow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the decision was made to cap FM radio at 19kHz bandwidth, as typical adult hearing peters out at around 19kHz. In the later FM stereo standard, a difference signal was transmitted 38kHz above the main Left+Right signal, and a 19kHz pilot tone (to lock the oscillators) was also transmitted.</p>
<p>The 200kHz channel spacing actually has more to do with the state of analog filtering in the era when the standard was developed, rather than how much bandwidth was actually required to transmit the signal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. In fact I am amazed at how many signals they now cram into those channels. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subcarrier#Private_audio" target="_blank">MUZAK</a> was an early additional signal they added ~1950's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>USA FM analog stereo stations broadcast a signal that receivers can convert to two channels of audio, and each of them spans from 50Hz to 15kHz.  The 15kHz rolloff keeps the multiplexed audio signals (the L+R and L-R) away from the 19kHz pilot tone. So the (ideal) multiplexed audio signal contains L+R audio from 50 to 15kHz, the 19kHz pilot tone, and then from (38-15=)23kHz to (38+15=)53kHz the L-R audio, which takes the form of a 38kHz SDM (Sum and Difference Modulation), often called double sideband suppressed carrier, signal.  </p>
<p>The FM broadcast frequency (such as 98.5 MHz) is called the carrier. The missing 38kHz tone needed to produce or recover the SDM L-R signal is called a subcarrier. It is generated by doubling the 19kHz pilot tone.  Stations that broadcast RBDS (aka RDS) do so with another subcarrier, at 3x19=57kHz.  Some stations may broadcast additional audio or data using 4x19=67kHz or 92kHz subcarriers. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is not true. a sine wave that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function" target="_blank">windowed</a> can have a finite bandwidth.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but in the case of audio it's fine to cut it off at the human range of hearing. In which case it won't be a perfect square or triangle wave anymore but the difference can't be heard by human ears</p></div>		</li>
