<p>But even with chicken, I think most people are a little overboard. As long as you take basic precautions you'll almost always be fine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, chicken only has a CHANCE of giving you salmonella if it was handled improperly. </p>
<p>But also..</p>
<p>I ate raw chicken once to prove the point that it wasn't gonna kill me to a paranoid friend. I was fine, but it tasted like shit. </p>
<p>Nearly all chicken is &quot;salt water plumped&quot; which means the distributor fills the meat full of saline so that it weighs more (so you get more water and less meat when you buy a pound).</p>
<p>This also means if you don't cook all that water out it's like eating a wet meaty sponge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a risk involved but it’s very low. With Tartare, you’d cut away the outside of the muscle and use the inside meat. You’d want to be very clean and properly have sanitized everything before and while you prepare the dish while keeping everything out of the <em>Danger Zone</em> (4-60 C) to minimize bacterial growth. You’d also want to serve as soon as possible also to minimize bacterial growth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, very high standards for good butchering and uses only high quality meat. Also has a raw egg in it.</p>
<p>Do not try to make it from cheap ground beef and eggs from Walmart.</p>
<p>Battery farms and high-throughout butchering is very bad for spreading potentially harmful bacteria which they try to mitigate by giving prophylactic antibiotics, a practice that gives rise to antibiotic resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trichinosis although still a thing is less of a concern nowadays. Most commercially farmed pork is dewormed. But if you buy from a local farmer, deworming may not have taken place. I usually cook thick pork chops or tenderloin to a nice medium doneness. Many people are still put off by pink pork so it’s not for everyone. </p></div>		</li>
