<p>Edit: As /u/HollidayDDS pointed out, I stand corrected - this was not a good study to use. I have found plenty of evidence in literature of in vitro studies which support the view of /u/Glaselar, here is one example: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19514931" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19514931</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't even an in vivo study!  This has very little to do with estimating the serum levels of magnesium in Epsom bath-exposed humans and then further determining if there are any measurable benefits thereof.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a chemist I am also not immediately convinced that it occurs, the skin is a reasonable barrier to salts. </p>
<p>The lack of literature is what concerns me, there is one interesting <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15080493" target="_blank">paper</a> that is actually published in a journal that suggests that both the sulphate and metal ions can pass through skin but for some reason I can not access it by my institution so I can't read it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not a very well done &quot;study&quot;.  It's not published or reviewed.  The authors mention that there are gender differences in their outcome measure prior to exposure but don't stratify their post-exposure measurements.  They claim a significant difference in pre and post-exposure measurements but not at what level.  They provide a range with their means, but don't indicate whether it is an error range or a confidence interval.  These ranges all overlap, meaning there is no statistical significance if they are standard errors.</p>
<p>Also, they indicate that &quot;Continuation of bathing for 7 days in all except 2 individuals gave a rise to a mean of
140.98 ± 17.00ppm/ml&quot;, which is ambiguous.  Did 2 individuals withdrawal from the study before taking 7 baths?  Were the measurements for the 2 individuals thrown out for some other reason?  Did they simply not see a &quot;rise&quot; in there magnesium levels?  They also say, &quot;Of 19 subjects, all except 3 showed a rise in
magnesium concentrations in plasma, though this was small in some cases.&quot;  Does this mean all 19 completed the study protocol?  Later they state, &quot;Generally, urinary
magnesium levels 24h after the first bath fell from the initial values found after day 1 (mean 118.
43 ± 51.95) suggesting some retention of magnesium in tissues after bathing as blood levels were
still high. Measurement of magnesium levels in urine 24h after the 7th bath gave values almost back
to control levels.&quot;  This suggests that the author both does not understand what a control is nor do they understand what is statistically &quot;suggestive&quot; as the ranges for pre-exposure means and 24hr post-exposure means (be they standard errors or confidence intervals) don't just overlap but include the means of the other measurement.</p>
<p>They make bold statements of causation and safety in a study of 19 people without apparent proper controls.  This is honestly the level of bad student work and really isn't worth considering as &quot;evidence&quot;, in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, it's not peer reviewed. This Birmingham Univeristy reader in Toxicology may not actually have written this for all I know. The source is <a href="http://www.epsomsaltsbath.co.uk/epsom-salt-bath-absorption-report/" target="_blank">http://www.epsomsaltsbath.co.uk/epsom-salt-bath-absorption-report/</a></p>
<p>So either she did this study entirely on behalf of the epsom salt advocacy organisation <a href="http://www.epsomsaltcouncil.org/" target="_blank">http://www.epsomsaltcouncil.org/</a> and then did not publish it even on Arxiv. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing studies that are showing correlation but no causation.</p>
<p>Your phrasing is implying (by accident I'm sure) that there's some empirical evidence that magnesium is the prime mover in these supposed beneficial​ results.</p>
<p>I'm seeing zero evidence that WAS has any proven curative properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you read the examine article? I can assure you of the 250 some odd studies at least a few were well controlled. Examine is a fantastic source and is reputable in the biomedical community, as far as I'm aware. </p></div>		</li>
