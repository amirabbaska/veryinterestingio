			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Fianc√©e put one of our plastic salad bowls in the dish washer. It came out significantly smaller and has circular dimples equally spaced throughout its surface area now. Pretty comical</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually thermal expansion/contraction refers to reversible changes, maintaining crystal structure if such exists. Your permanently shrunk plastic bowl is probably due to the polymer structure permanently rearranging itself. Plastic items are often shaped by forcing them to stretch/mold, which lines up the long molecules in the stretched direction. When cool the strands lock in place, but heated again they have enough energy to jostle out of their orderly arrangement back into a tangles, and the item shrinks.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Entropy cannot CAUSE anything, the plastic shrinks because heating it relaxes the crystal structure and as it cools it moves into a state of lower energy (less strained structure). The straight plastic is highly strained (or in entropy terms, ordered) and the shrunken state is less strained (angles all over the places, jumbled up mess like cooked pasta... In entropy terms, disordered).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well entropy can be understood through statistics. It just so happens that what we recognize as disordered states tends to have a lot more possible configurations that we would call disordered (or yield similar properties). If every possible state has equal probability, then you're more likely to end up in one you would call disordered. However, this is also why entropy is not equivalent to disorder. There are many cases where an ordered state can allow more freedom than a disordered state (i.e. losing orientational entropy for a gain in translational entropy), meaning that the ordered state has greater entropy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However it's very rarely a helpful explanation because it doesn't answer why. It itself is not a force. It can be useful for understanding what a system will do via inspection at the macro scale (it lumps together all of the microscopic processes in a way). Saying &quot;entropy causes it&quot; still leaves a level of obscuration- in this case, the lower level is molecular/crystal structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, if a polymer (especisally an elastomer, a stretchy polymer) has its chains under strain, they can elastically come back together much easier under heat. And then they expand again after a certain point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, if they do that, why is it called the coefficient of linear expansion?</p>
<p>That sounds like it would plot decidedly non-linearly.</p>
<p>Maybe it's a misnomer?</p></div>		</li>
