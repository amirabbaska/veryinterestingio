<p>&quot;Whoa! That was cool. I've been operating reactors for over twenty years and I always like watching.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>What makes the visible light slower</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current best-accepted explanation goes something like this:  light traveling in a medium couples to vibrational modes (and other types of excitation modes) within the medium, and ceases to be a massless photon but rather becomes a type of particle called a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polariton" target="_blank">polariton</a>.  Polaritons are massive, and thus they travel slower than the speed of light in vacuum.</p>
<p>The former best-accepted explanation was that photons are repeatedly absorbed and emitted by particles in the medium, thus briefly slowing them down on their journey.  However this explanation is unsatisfactory because different materials have discrete absorption and emission spectra, therefore only some wavelengths should be slowed, but in experiments this is not the case, so that explanation is lacking.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>Edit: autocorrect; but really, &quot;automistake&quot; is more accurate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I saw a video on that subject a while back, and they got a bit hand-wavey at one point about photons no longer really being photons while traveling through a medium. Now I know what they were talking about. Thanks!</p>

<p>This explanation isn't only &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, it's completely incorrect on so many levels (pun intended).  One can not consider light traveling at <em>c</em> between atoms.  The speed at which light propagates depends on the electric and magnetic properties of that region of space.  So, if light moves at c, we can deduce the patch of space has electromagnetic properties identical to vacuum.  materials have EM properties different from vacuum, and so, light can not travel at c inside a material</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;speed of light&quot; refers to the speed of light in a vacuum. Light moves fastest in a vacuum and moves at different speeds through different mediums. Glass has one speed, water has another, etc. </p>
<p>The really weird bit is that once light leaves a medium like water into say a vacuum, it instantly is going the speed of light in a vacuum. Instantaneous acceleration. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait...are you saying that light doesn't expend energy to accelerate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not visible light that moves slower, it's all electromagnetic radiation which will move slower when put through a medium. The constant 'c' which is referred to as the speed of light is actually the speed of causality, of which all electromagnetic radiation moves at an equivalent speed to when in a vacuum. </p>
<p>You'll need to do some extra research on the law of causality for a better understanding of the speed of light and the constant 'c', because it's quite a bit over my head and i'm pretty high right now. </p></div>		</li>
