			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude same. I can do 140 mph + down the back straight of a track no problems, even get the front wheel shaking from a power wheelie, drag around around turns. </p>
<p>But doing 40 mph down a hill on a bicycle with nothing more than a helmet is TERRIFYING</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I got a motorcycle (18 years old, straight out of high school, Yamaha 650), everyone said that I would die in a year.</p>
<p>I have since done over 125,000 miles on motorcycles, through Europe, many times across the US, from Canada to Patagonia, then back up through South America again.</p>
<p>I've been hurt.  I've lost a lot of skin.  Stripped my face off on asphalt.  I've taken brain damage.  Concussions. Currently being treated for facial nerve damage (excruciating). Shattered patella.  Broken bones. </p>
<p>Oh, all of those accidents were bicycles. Never honestly hurt on a motorcycle, except for a mild broken thumb in Peru.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. I ride a motorcycle with full gear and on heavy traffic you can easily get away from danger and leave everyone behind in a stoplight. In a bicycle not so much. Everyone is faster than you including really slow trucks. There's no rearview mirrors, no hp except your legs and the helmets are really small. The more protection you use, the heavier you get and the slower you are. I like riding a bicycle but in controlled environments, in the city is a lot more dangerous than a motorbike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice misdirection. Maybe you should wear a full face helmet on the bicycle? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah if I'm in town going 40 I still wear at least gloves/jacket/helmet (and usually boots too because I like my boots), I mean, pavement at 40mph hurts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rode a litre bike for years. I have since sold it and now mountain bike and it scares me sometimes. All those years of flying down the road at 140+ and now flying down a dirt fireroad at 25-30 scares the shit out of me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I'd been a passenger in cars doing 120mph and felt very little but my first time riding a motorcycle @ 30mph felt like warp speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The craziest thing is when you have been motorcycling regularly and then get on a bicycle.  I AGATT on the moto and wearing just shorts, a t shirt and bike helmet leaves me feeling naked.  Plus, I'm always looking for the turn signal with my left thumb on my bicycle.</p></div>		</li>
