			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, but I just went searching for it.  Turns out there's a wikipedia page about them: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorquer" target="_blank">Magnetorquer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A magnetorquer or magnetic torquer (also known as torque rod) is a satellite system for attitude control, detumbling, and stabilization built from electromagnetic coils. The magnetorquer creates a magnetic field that interfaces with an ambient magnetic field, usually Earth's, so that the counter-forces produced provide useful torque.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NASA did this with a couple of their STS missions. They had a super long conductive tether they would drag. They would end up snapping from heat degredation of the materials due to air trapped in the tether turning into plasma after taking 3500 volts.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve seen that proposed in a sci-fi book (Seveneves by Neal Stephenson, about humanity having to escape into space to avoid an apocalypse, check it out!) as a way to deorbit a rogue satellite. Since a current is flowing through the tether, dissipating energy, the satellite has to slow down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For that though, it would be more efficient to use an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_sail" target="_blank">electric sail</a>, where a positive electric charge is generated. Inside a magnetosphere like Earth's, it provides a braking action. This is currently in development and in actual in-space testing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't help but think this would be terribly primitive technology for a species which could travel to another star.</p>
<p>I mean sure, for us it's advanced, but I have to imagine aliens would probably have better ways of achieving the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't take for granted the possibility of leaps in one field without advances in another. In the 40's we &quot;harnessed the power of the atom&quot; to make bombs but it was almost a half-century before we had high power computational technology at the atom scale.</p>
<p>It could very well be a species would advance perhaps even accidentally far in the field of interstellar flight without comparable advances in other fields. Imagine warp drives on 1940's submarines in space - like how Star Trek TOS always referenced storage tapes and vacuum tubes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You say this, but we are the species with atomic powered steam engines.  We still write stuff on paper, and I'm drinking out of a ceramic kitty mug. My species has been making clay mugs in the shape of animals for at least ten thousand years. </p>
<p>Some things are just the best way to do something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;...Over 19 kilometers of the tether were deployed before the tether broke. It remained in orbit for a number of weeks and was easily visible from the ground, appearing something like a small but surprisingly bright fluorescent light traveling through the sky.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>
