			<div class="markdown"><p>I once (~10 years ago) worked on the design of a device that sat outside the heart, like a jacket, and palpated it in an effort to use the patient's native tissue to pump blood, escaping the problems of hemolysis you get with traditional VADs.  We proved efficacy in a live bovine model before funding ran out. It was supposed to be a bridge-to-transplant implant. Then the CEO died, perversely, of a heart attack.</p>
<p>I'm still working in cardiac devices for the time being, although I'm about to change concentrations within the mechanical medical device world. The future, in my opinion, won't be mechanical or electro-mechanical; it will be tissue-engineered. Clinical trials are underway for vascular tissue-engineered implants. I estimate they will be commonplace in 30 years.</p></div>		</li>
