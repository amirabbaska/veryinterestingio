			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also seedless diploid bananas. The vast majority of bananas out there are seedless -- that was selected for before triploidy. </p>
<p>However, the tetraploid, triploid, and diploid varieties mostly can produce seeds and pollen under certain conditions. You'll typically get one or two seeds per hundred pounds of fruit. </p>
<p>This is being used in the FHIA program to breed new bananas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the seeds even viable?  I found some seeds in my &quot;seedless&quot; orange so I stuck them in some good dirt in a climate great for citrus.  Nothing ever grew.  I suspected the seeds weren't viable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Banana seeds are next to impossible to germinate -- even wild banana seeds have only like a 5% germination.</p>
<p>What they do is dissect out the embryos and grow them in sterile culture. This technique is called &quot;embryo rescue&quot; and allows them to get plants from non-viable seeds. They get plants from something like 60-70% of the seeds this way.</p></div>		</li>
