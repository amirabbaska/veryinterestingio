<p>Is it a viable plan of action to preserve seeds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bananas we eat don't make viable seeds.  There aren't seeds to preserve.  Every single cavendish banana plant is a clone, generally made by taking a sprout from the roots of an existing plant and planting it by itself.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking this isn't quite accurate. Triploid bananas can be induced to produce viable seeds on occasion, but it is rare - you have to go through large numbers of bananas to find one viable seed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also seedless diploid bananas. The vast majority of bananas out there are seedless -- that was selected for before triploidy. </p>
<p>However, the tetraploid, triploid, and diploid varieties mostly can produce seeds and pollen under certain conditions. You'll typically get one or two seeds per hundred pounds of fruit. </p>
<p>This is being used in the FHIA program to breed new bananas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the seeds even viable?  I found some seeds in my &quot;seedless&quot; orange so I stuck them in some good dirt in a climate great for citrus.  Nothing ever grew.  I suspected the seeds weren't viable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Banana seeds are next to impossible to germinate -- even wild banana seeds have only like a 5% germination.</p>
<p>What they do is dissect out the embryos and grow them in sterile culture. This technique is called &quot;embryo rescue&quot; and allows them to get plants from non-viable seeds. They get plants from something like 60-70% of the seeds this way.</p></div>		</li>
