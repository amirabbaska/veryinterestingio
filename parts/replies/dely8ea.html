<p>Hmm, followup question: what's the longest wavelength we currently have the ability to capture?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First to not really answer your question: there is an inverse relationship between wavelength and resolution, the longer the wavelength, the less resolved the image.  To increase resolution you need a larger detector.  We cleverly use radio interferometry to get the best resolution for long wavelengths.  For astronomy, the longest wavelength radio telescopes like LOFAR can detect wavelengths as big as 30 meters.</p>
<p>To answer your question: if your goal is simply to detect but not resolve, then the limit to the longest wavelength you can capture is determined by how long you are willing to wait.  We could design a circuit capable of producing any wavelength we desired, and a circuit right beside it capable of detecting it, but the limiting factor would be the time from the front of the pulse to the end.  </p>
<p>Practically long wavelength radio waves are for things like submarines, which can use ELF (extra low frequency) spectrum, with wavelengths up to 10,000 kilometers, and some applications use wavelengths up to 300,000 kilometers.  We also see these kind of radio waves involving interactions with the earths ionosphere, or planetary magnetospheres subjected to the solar wind, pulsars and magnetars etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're actually on to something here: if we are talking about the part of the light spectrum that is visible to the human eye, then once the light from a given star is redshifted into the infrared band, the star will be invisible to us (though not to our various telescopes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your edit raises some interesting questions. I'm not well-equipped to answer them at the moment because I've been out of astrophysics for a decade or so. But, some observations:</p>
<p>Predictably, redshift calculated from the hubble constant approaches the speed of light asymptotically as the distance reaches the cosmological horizon. This is more of a definition than a property since redshift is actually how we derive the hubble constant and infinite redshift is one definition of the cosmological horizon.</p>
<p>However, the universe was once opaque on very small scales and is currently opaque on very large scales, so it's possible to talk about the &quot;observable universe&quot; and the &quot;detectable universe&quot; differently.  There are entire subfields of astronomy devoted to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the intergalactic medium (IGM), so I'm just going to give these a cursory treatment.  I suspect that the mean free path through the IGM (even from the distance of the CMB) is more of a limiting factor on observation at low energies than redshift due to expansion.</p>
<p>One last comment. It's important to remember that a detector's efficiency is not a step function, but a gaussian distribution. It is possible, though extremely unlikely, that your eye will absorb a radio photon (actually calculating that probability was an exam question when I was an undergrad).</p>
<p>This distribution gives us how likely our detector is to &quot;see&quot; an event at a given energy. We can combine that with what should actually exist (from previous observation and/or simulation). Using statistical inference, you can then weight your data based on the prior likelihood of detection (Bayes' Theorem). This, and deriving error from it, is a major part of modern astrophysics.</p></div>		</li>
