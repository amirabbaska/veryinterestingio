			<div class="markdown"><p>I am generally anti-msg. As a background, between family, friends we own numerous chinese takeaways / restaurants. Completely understand that it's basically the same as salt.</p>
<p>The problem I have with it in restaurant use is that the association of MSG for me is with chinese takeaway / restaurant chefs historically being very indifferent with their cooking practices. Compensating their lack of attention by &quot;making it more flavourful&quot; adding more MSG. Think how in Jamie Oliver recipe videos, he says &quot;pinch of salt&quot; then goes on the sprinkle it abundantly with salt. They do the same thing with MSG sprinkle abundantly with MSG for each dish. To make things worse for me, generally from the establishments I know that have used / use MSG, larger flakes are used as opposed to the smaller salt granules. I have personally found flakes to more effective at bringing out flavour both salt and MSG flakes, and as a result a smaller portion is required per dish. The worry is that they are being portioned as a 1-1 granules to flakes</p>
<p>Therefore more correctly defined, I would be against over seasoning. I have just associated over seasoning as a trait of chefs who use MSG rather than plain salt granules.  Amongst people I know use of MSG is synonymous with over seasoning.</p>
<p>I believe in general culture just like how a female dog is a bitch, but has increasingly become a generalised derogatory word. MSG has just overtime has been generalised and people who are less familiar are making up whatever to justify their use. The main difference being that MSG just is referred to in closer relation to its original environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^This. MSG isn't bad, salt isn't bad, but food that needs a ton of either to taste like anything good probably is. There's a point past which you're not seasoning, you're preserving. </p></div>		</li>
