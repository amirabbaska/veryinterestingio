<p>water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid, lemon juice concentrate, sodium hexametaphosphate (to protect flavor), natural flavor, <strong>tea powder</strong>, phosphoric acid, potassium sorbate (preserves freshness), caramel color, gum arabic, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, glycerol, ester of rosin, calcium disodium edta (to protect flavor), red 40.</p>
