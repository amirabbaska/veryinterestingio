			<div class="markdown"><p>One quick and slightly pedantic correction: We do not say that the model is &quot;correct.&quot; Rather, we say that the model is reasonably plausible to a given approximation. We can never know for sure that any model is the truth, only to what degree the models predict and explain observed phenomenon.</p>
<p>Edit: We are saying the same thing, but ya know, worth emphasizing the idea of what a theory means.</p></div>		</li>
