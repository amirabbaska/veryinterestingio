			<div class="markdown"><p>Last one is probably the worst and I think explains a fair amount of the housing problems in places like San Francisco.  </p>
<p>They wont increase supply to let housing prices go down because they'd lose money on their wildly overpriced homes, so prices skyrocket to the point where the businesses making the area so desirable start to have trouble attracting skilled employees because no one wants to pay $2,000,000 to live in a shack.  Businesses slowly start to move their operations elsewhere, economy falls apart.  But people are just beyond reason when they've got that much money tied up in these properties, they'll happily use height restrictions, strict zoning regulations, and historic building protections to drive their city into the ground.  </p>
<p>(Not that those regulations are a bad thing per se, but I think they are frequently misused for ulterior reasons)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Foreign investment is the main driver of inflated prices in major cities (in the US and Canada). The Chinese, who fear currency risk at home, park their money in real estate here; it's also a good strategy to circumvent their government's capital controls. In essence, because of foreign investment, there are more buyers chasing few properties. Impose a severe tariff (like Vancouver did) and prices will drop like a rock.</p>
<p>edit: I have noticed Aussies buying a lot in expensive NYC areas also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm coming from a Toronto perspective here, but don't think we can point the finger at foreign investors. Roughly 5-10% of sales are to foreigners (<a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3824467" target="_blank">https://www.google.ca/amp/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3824467</a>). The majority of sales fall to domestic investors, as the OP outlined, people buying a 2nd or 3rd house for speculation or rent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All of this contributes to property values as well. People don't want to live in a shack, but they don't want to face another dude's apartment either, built on top of a church of architectural value (and yes I've seen that shit).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is exactly the problem. For the good of the country, the goal should always be to <em>lower</em> property values.</p>
<p>Yet somehow we've got this idea that raising them is a good thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a 24 year old Norwegian it is not fun to hear from my friends that i should just buy a house like they did. It is so easy, just ask your parents for money and buy a house, no problem. Becouse if i do, i could make SO much money.  I know i could make a shit ton of money, but i cant, i need food, money for rent, transportation, clothes and so on. </p>
<p>It is like some people dont understand that it is not normal to be 20 years old and have 1 million dollar in loan (1 house to rent out and a apartment where they study).
There is many young people that do not see how secure their economy is becouse their parents got &quot;lucky&quot; when they were younger.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I loved your point about reaping all the social benefits but then voting against it when they are older.  Both of my parents were legit able to pay there way through college....  as in they didnt take out loans and when they graduated they didnt owe anyone money for their degrees.  </p>
<p>So now they are the CEOs and higher ups who think, oh, my education wasnt worth that much, i value experience over education.  So now all the young people graduating college with no help from uncle sam are strapped with thousands and thousands of debt and then they try to find jobs from baby boomers who undervalue their education so they cant get a job.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's also the context of a summer job being able to cover tuition. Housing isn't the only thing that has outpaced inflation and wages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People forget that in America, college used to be free. When boomers say they paid for school by working during the summer, it wasn't just because school was cheap, the state paid for their schooling. Now students are responsible for most of that cost after budgets were slashed. </p>

<p>State funding drop is the biggest reason for increase in school cost

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even when it wasn't free it was still really cheap. I went to a state university in the early 80's and my tuition and fees were roughly $2500 a semester. Imagine leaving university with only $3000 in student debt. Of course it was easier to start my career and my adult life. </p>
<p>I was born at the tail end of the boom, but I still can't get over people in my generation who don't get that things have changed in a massive way for millennials and not for the better. The folks that still think you should get a summer job to pay for college like they did  just have their collective heads up their collective asses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also disallowed student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy, which the previous generation commonly did as well.</p>
<p>The actual reason I believe that tuition is so high is because the government didn't focus on making college affordable, they focused on helping 18-19 year olds take out huge loans to finance something they couldn't afford and didn't understand.  Promising better careers and better futures to kids who didn't know what to do with their life, everyone took the bait. Schools could charge whatever they wanted and kids would take whatever the size loan.</p>
<p>If schools worked on making college actually affordable and lowered the costs so people could actually pay for the education with a summer job, we would have been better off. Instead, they created federal loan programs that indebted a generation and allowed little room for forgiveness.  It was a garbage trade off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of all that, they bought a house on a single income... not a double income like it's expected (at minimum) today... FFS it takes $100K MINIMUM to buy a house... it breaks down to about $500 a month before taxes/water/gas/electric/etc... that's easily $800-1000/month when you only make $356 a month at minimum wage... that's not including vehicle, insurance, phone, gas for the vehicle... etc... so that $1000/mo breaks down to you have to work 3 months to pay for the GD house FOR EACH MONTH YOU LIVE IN IT... double that for dual income and you're still short $288/mo WITHOUT electric/water/phone/internet etc... so there's absolutely NO WAY you can buy a house at minimum wage in any major market (much less the high priced markets) without outside assistance...</p></div>		</li>
