			<div class="markdown"><p>stand beside the board and with one foot, snap the tail off the ground. what you will see is the nose of the board shoot up into the air, with the tail likely staying on the ground or close to it.</p>
<p>with an ollie, when you jump off your back foot it causes this to happen. you then use your front foot to slide upwards on the board (towards the nose). this causes the board to level out, or the tail of the board is pretty much forced further upwards into the air because of the front foot motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody ever fucking told me the back of the board had to hit the ground. That makes so much sense now. Fuck.</p>
<p>Edit: okay, you don't necessarily have to hit it on the ground. I don't need anyone else telling me this, lol.</p>
<p>Also I don't need anymore in depth tips on how to ollie, thanks though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly in practice, yes.  </p>
<p>But the physics work without it.</p>
<p>If it's hard to picture than being true, imagine if the board continued in a more drastic curve in such a way that that it was much longer before it would touch the ground.  Maybe like the fork example above (one seriously messed up looking board tho)</p>
<p>There quickly becomes a point where the pivot ocurring against the front foot would bring the back up without touching. </p>
<p>Someone who can get a very high clearance can likely do it if they held back, but they would not go as high</p>
<p>But since height is key, no one really does it that way</p>
<p>Also, here-</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct- it's actually easier to Ollie, and you can Ollie higher on skinny light board with a shorter tail-  that never hits the ground but instead pops with a greater force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I thought by driving my raised foot down fast enough, it would lift the other end.</p>
<p>My friends kept telling me &quot;you just gotta pop it and slide your foot up&quot;. Fuck, I'm mad now and I gave up 18 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just step on the tail while standing on the floor. The boards want to make backflips. When you stand on it and you do a ollie, all you do is keeping it from backflipping with your front foot.</p></div>		</li>
