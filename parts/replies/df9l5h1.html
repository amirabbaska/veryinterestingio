			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a guy who was trying to make it a thing about 10 years ago, but it's illegal in many states today.  Your stomach sends some of the alcohol directly to the liver, so it takes far less alcohol to begin feeling the effects when it's vaporized vs drunk.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are vaporized alcohol bars in Europe where you enter a room of evaporated alcohol for a certain number of minutes (they time you so you don't die) and it is easy to get quite drunk in a very short amount of time, I suspect because the alcohol is being absorbed by your mucous membranes/skin all over your body at once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall a time where &quot;eyeshots&quot; were a thing. It turns out alcohol is absorbed quite  quickly in our eye tissue capillaries. But alas, absorbing eyeshots led to significant discomfort. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So badddd.. basically what is happening the cocaine and alcohol metabolize in your liver  and create this super drug called cocaethalyne (some spelling variation) its Coke+ethanol=extremely toxic. It feels great and after a while you will only want to do Coke and drink.  I think it's somewhere in the 80% of cocaine toxicity cases in the ER - the patients were using both as opposed to just cocaine use without alcohol. It's extremely cardiotoxic.. meaning it's bad for your heart.. I explained in the comments below that there is a huge problem with cocaine in that it works on the sodium/potassium ion channels (they control the electrical and mechanical pumping of the heart) so basically that means the electrical conduction your heart could suddenly loose power... sudden cardiac collapse and death.. not a &quot;classical&quot; heart attack</p></div>		</li>
