			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for OP (who probably tests individual seat designs) but most aircraft companies will certify a new type (airframe) with a live evacuation test. I haven't participated in one, but I've read test reports on several. It's exactly what you would imagine. Plane is parked and full of random employees. Everybody is just hanging out in their seats. Somebody gives the order to evacuate, and everybody GTFOs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol no, for us, anyway, we get a 5th percentile woman and a 95th percentile man who hasn't seen the aircraft and we have them escape from various points on the aircraft and evaluate the speed it takes for them to find an exit. </p>
<p>Other places might do it differently though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neat video to watch. It's cool to see the flight crew flip into survival mode.</p>
<p>Safety features like this that we take for granted are so cool. So much development and testing for something that won't even get used in the majority of aircraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing that would have made this answer better is &quot;As a practical matter however it is only in a tiny minority of crashes where the position of your chair would have any appreciable impact on your chances of survival.  In the course of US aviation history there might be a hundred people, or fewer, alive today thanks to their chairs being in the upright and locked position.&quot;  Or something to that effect.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol but many crashes are survivable and there is significantly less injury and death because of these safety standards. </p>
<p>Not every crash is into the side of the mountain, or screaming at top speed into the ocean. Many are a simple landing gear failure where the plane has to land with no gear, or an engine malfunction, or whatever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but realistically if you have a simple landing gear failure is the position of the seat going to make much difference in terms of suitability?  99% of airplane accidents result in 0 deaths or 100% deaths.  But yes in that 1% where some people die there could be a few more, or a few less, based on seat position.</p></div>		</li>
