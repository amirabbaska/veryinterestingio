			<p>That's true, but shouldn't it be my body's instinct to notify me of any injuries? Or can my body recognize that something like a minor cut isn't much of a danger to my well-being? I am fascinated by how our body can make all these decisions without our knowing.</p>		</li>

			<p>Your body uses pain to let you know you are in danger, if the injury is not sufficient enough to register as a danger then you won't feel the pain till you see the injury, thus making it mental pain.<br><br>Think about this, your brain takes in about 4 billion bits of information every second, you are only aware of about 2 thousand of them. If you were aware of all of them you would never have time to live, you would always be reacting to outside stimulus. For this reason a lot of decisions are made for it, like pain not registering enough to classify as danger so its ignored by the brain. <br><br>Just think about this, if the brain had to deal with every single input of data you would feel every single hair move when the wind blows rather than the bunch, you would feel every single twinge in your gut when digesting your food, and so on. <br><br>In other words its a mechanism to help your brain cope with the massive amounts of data it has to take in. <br></p>		</li>
