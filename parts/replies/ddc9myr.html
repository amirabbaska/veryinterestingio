			<div class="markdown"><p>Silly question, but can a proton just drift off on it's own? Especially considering that the element has sexy electrons attracting it?</p>
<p>(Edit: Does it leave because it is more repelled by the collection of same charges in the nucleus?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the proton is occupying a single-particle orbital above the proton separation energy, that's exactly what they do most of the time.</p>
<p>&quot;Drift off on its own&quot; would better describe what happens for s-wave neutrons however. Neutrons have no charge, so there is no Coulomb barrier for them. And if the neutron is in an s-orbital, there's no centrifugal barrier either. So if the neutron is above the separation energy, there's nothing holding it in place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that mean the nucleus is so big there's a proton where electrons belong? Or are there other orbitals I'm not aware of? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, but only more questions. 1) If there are no forces holding it in place then how did it get there?</p>
<p>and 2) What does it do when it leaves? Rip electrons from other molecules? </p>
<p>And  3) Is it guaranteed to travel at near light-speed (due to it's mass) or can it be stationary?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm imagining a planet deciding to go in a straight line and not orbiting any more. Accurate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered something about the &quot;island of stability.&quot; The nuclear shell orbitals are occupied by protons and neutrons, which are themselves comprised of up and down quarks. So, are the quarks themselves following the orbitals? Or is it the nucleons? If it's the former, would it be possible to create more stable nuclei by injecting them with free quarks? Like, what would happen if we introduced a single up quark to a nucleus? Could we also do this with exotic quarks?</p>
<p>I find chromodynamics fascinating even though I really don't have a concrete understanding of it. But I'm excited about where the field could go in the future. Figuring out how to manipulate exotic forms of matter will probably be what allows us to get off this rock.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If that happens you have essentially a neutron star.</p></div>		</li>
