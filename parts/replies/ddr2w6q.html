<p>Microwaves work using EM waves to excite molecules - primarily water - in our food to convert EM energy to heat. They originate from the magnetron in your microwave and find their way into your food from some angle, but always start on the outside of your food.</p>
<p>Some foods, like hotpockets, heat up on the inside more than the outside because there is more water in the filling than the crust, but as far as the filling, the outside of the filling heats up first. This is why you can have a hotpocket that is molten hot lava and ice cold at the same time, especially if your microwave doesn't have a turntable.</p>
<p>Foods that are very large can have problems heating. Ever tried to cook a turkey or ham in the microwave. If you just stick it in there, you'll end up with a burned outside and a frozen inside. In order to cook these foods, you need to set the power lower and rotate the dish every so often. Rotating helps compensate for hotspots while lower power makes the microwave turn on and off, allowing the heat to transfer from the outside to the inside.</p>
<p>So yeah, microwaves aren't the opposite. They still go outside-in, but they aren't as limited as air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the frequency of the microwave as well. Common household microwave ovens are about 2.5ghz, which only penetrates into food about 2cm or so. Which is fine, because most foods aren't much thicker than that. It'll also depend on how dense and watery the food is -- it'll penetrate way deeper into a doughnut than a steak.  I believe there are commercial ones which run at 900mhz or so, and can heat foods much more deeply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are technically right (the best kind of right) that the heat input still is strongest on the surface, this does not translate in the surface being the hottest thing in microwaved food. In fact, the food is slightly hotter directly below the surface, because the surface is cooled by the air <a href="http://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/84643.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/84643.pdf</a></p>
<p>So while you are right that the heat does not come from the inside, the heat flow will be very very different. Opposite is technically wrong, but gives you a better idea of what is happening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. And when you set the microwave to a higher option, then you don't change the actual power of the microwave. Instead you tell it to be active more of the time.</p>
<p>A microwave goes on/off repeatedly during the heating process. High option means that it's longer on compared to a lower option in the same time interval. The time where it's off lets the heated part of the food warm the part that wasn't heated. A lower option gives more time for the food to warm the inside. This is the reason why you often use a lower option, but a longer duration for something bigger, compared to something smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that panasonic has &quot;inverter&quot; technology which does change the power output, instead of just periodically cycling on and off. IIRC, they are the only ones in the market to do this, other brands of microwaves perform as you have described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that another reason we cook is to make our food safe to eat. Most bacteria die well before 400 degrees, obviously, but cooking chicken at 165 degrees would take a VERY long time, so we crank it up a bit to help balance safety, speed, and taste/texture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cooking food had more to do with making it easier to eat than making it safe. Primitive humans had little trouble eating raw meat because they had stronger gut flora that could compete with and handle the bacteria present in raw meat more easily than we can today. Humans were eating meat long before we learned how to make fire, after all. </p>
<p>One of the more common foodborne illnesses, botulism, actually comes from contaminated food that's been left long enough for the bacterial wastes to build to toxic levels. Botulism is a by-product of eating spoiled food, and since primitive humans tended to eat most of what they caught when they caught it, and didn't have storage in mind, it was also less of a concern.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, someone figured out that if you cook the meat, it makes it taste better, and it falls apart more easily and is easier to chew. The fact that it also kills bacteria might have led to humans developing weaker gut flora over time, causing us to become more susceptible to foodborne bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>is easier to chew</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the primary motivator. It takes a ridiculous amount of time and energy to try to chew up and even more energy to digest a raw steak shank. Cutting tools can help a lot with the chewing part but cooking massively kick starts the digestion process. Fire was one of the primary steps in humankind's progress not because of disease but because it allowed us to gather far more calories from the same amount of food.</p>
<p>Surplus food is a large part of what fuels human progress. Every time we manage to produce a higher order of magnitude in food we've immediately followed it with a massive burst of technological advancement less than a generation later. Fire was one of the first things to start that cycle. After fire came agriculture. After agriculture came industrialized agriculture. As a general rule, the less of humanity involved in finding enough food, the more of us are available to do more useful things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't even need to cook it to 165 F if it's held long enough.</p>
<p>165 F is dry and not ideal. Bringing a lean chicken breast (2% fat)  up to 155 F and holding it there for a minute is plenty to kill off salmonella to a safe consumption level.</p>
<p>Once you're in the high 150s it only takes a few seconds to kill the bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you let it carry over at 155, the internal temperature will continue to climb to reach 160-65 in just a few minutes. </p>
<p>This is also true of all meats. Pull them ten degrees before they reach temp, tent and let it carry over cook. It all boils down to moisture loss at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok... so now ELI15.. what is the chemical reason why an ambient air temperature much above 425F will overcook, say, pavlov's turkey (while leaving the inside uncooked)?  What property of our normal foodstuff creates this situation where heat transfer isn't occurring from the air to the inside of the food?  if we had a microwave big enough to cook a turkey, how fast could we cook a turkey by using a (microwave start)x(oven finish)?  More practically speaking, could I cook my pizza rolls (I'm actually imagining frozen tater tots) in the microwave and then finish them with very high oven heat to crisp?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most foods are mostly water.  Air and water both have a different specific heat capacity.  That means that some volume of air at 425 degrees has much less energy in it than the same volume of water at 425 degrees.  So that means hot air isn't actually that much energy, and it is quickly transferred to the water without actually heating it much. </p>
<p>The other part is heat transfer, certain things like metal transfer heat very well, a 425 degree cast iron skillet will burn your hand right away.  Water holds and transfers heat well *(it holds heat very well and transfers heat better than air but not particularly well).  Air holds and transfers heat poorly (which is why many insulating materials have a lot of air in them).</p>
<p>Very hot air say 650 degrees will quickly heat up the outside of the food to that temperature, but the energy transferred will not be enough to heat the inside for a long time.  Water inside food also can't flow freely so it cannot dissipate heat evenly through convection *(and has an otherwise low heat transfer rate).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why opening the oven door and getting hit by 425 F air doesn't burn you. Air is poor at transferring heat energy which is why air is often used for insulating. (<del>air</del> argon between panes of glass[I was wrong about windows] , air pockets trapped by feather down in jackets, air between the layers in a thermos)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The em radiation range used in microwave ovens is good at exciting water molecules. Things get crisp in the oven or in a pan because the heat is working from the outside in. In an oven removing water from the outermost areas first, or in the pan exposing one side to significant heat (denaturing those proteins into tasty brown goodness). Microwaves penetrate most edible matter pretty evenly. It's mostly directionless heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our food, especially meat, is mostly water. Water has a heat capacity four times as high as air. That means that a mass of water takes 4 times as much energy to heat as the same mass of air. So, we can heat the air in the oven very quickly. Since the outside of our food is touching that air, it will be exposed to that temperature. However, since water heats up much slower than air, the inside of that food takes much, much longer to heat up to the same temperature (because it has to wait for the food in between it and the air to heat up first).</p>
<p>Microwaves work by shooting light rays into food that are able to <em>bypass</em> the outer layer, which is why the inside of food heats up quickly. </p>
<p>You could absolutely cook pizza rolls in the microwave and then finish them in the oven for crispiness. You'd have to experiment with the amount of time in each appliance to dial in the perfect pizza roll. In fact, many recipes call for slow cooking meat, and then finishing it in the oven at high heat to give the outside crispiness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you want to sear something quickly (without going too deep) , make sure it's dry, no excess moisture outside. That water is stealing energy as it evaporates, cooling your cooking surface, which gives more time for heat to transfer further into your food. </p>
<p>Searing quickly is important for sous vide cooking, where your food is already cooked to how you want, you're just applying the search almost like a seasoning or garnish. </p></div>		</li>
