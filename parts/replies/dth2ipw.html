			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the topic of a myth busters episode and this was pretty much the conclusion. The angle makes the difference. However it has to be quite the angle to keep the ballistic trajectory as I understand.</p>
<p>Edit: No, with a quick search seems like a small angle would still be able to keep the trajectory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik horizontal velocity is not impacted by anything other than air resistance, right? So any significant value when it's fired will be deadly when it lands, even if its terminal velocity isnt very high. </p>
<p>I havent looked into this much, so if I'm wrong please correct me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much of an angle is required for the bullet to fall with lethal velocity? 10° off from perfectly perpendicular to the ground? 5°? 1°?<br />
Or simply anything greater than 0°?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if you can set up an exact number due to things like wind, or each bullet shape acting differently.  The most important factor is if the bullet tumbles end-over-end.  Once it tumbles (spinning end-over-end, like the opposite of a spiral throw in football), it gets subjected to a lot more wind resistance, giving it a fairly slow terminal velocity.</p>
<p>I'd say (tho it isn't scientific) that 10° could even be non-lethal, but you may not be able to say that about every bullet.  If you did it hundreds of times, you'd see some retaining their trajectory while most end up stopping and then fall.  It's just easier to say that a bullet fired perpendicular from the ground will eventually stop (due to gravity) and then head back downward, which will guarantee it tumbles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, as long as the bullet rotates predominantly around the longitudinal axis, and not the normal or lateral axes, it will return to earth with lethal velocity. But if it starts pitching or yawing, it will encounter too much resistance and become a non-lethal projectile. And there are too many variables to predict for a general case what angle will or will not confer those flight characteristics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree it varies with the bullet; most likely to start tumbling it has to stall, and to stall it has to slow down enough to start falling at an angle of attack higher than some angle which keeps it stable.  A bullet fired at a 45 degree angle eventually stops going up, but it has lateral velocity that's a significant portion of that at which it was fired, so it doesn't have occasion to stall.</p>
<p>It also depend son the center of mass of the bullet-- if the bullet tends towards a tumble (because it's tail-heavy, so it takes less of a push off-center to get it to veer) then it'll be unstable at higher speeds than a nose-heavy bullet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's just theoretical. I doubt it's possible for a human to fire a gun perfectly vertical. And there's also wind currents too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's the OP's question.  In explaining that it must be exactly vertical to get that result is a way of differentiating between a falling object and one with a ballistic trajectory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure they meant 'straight up in the air' in the colloquial sense.</p>
<p>As in, the total horizontal velocity of this shot is negligible compared to the vertical velocity.</p></div>		</li>
