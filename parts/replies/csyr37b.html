			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Vegetarian fed&quot; labels came up after people found out farmers were feeding byproducts from other animals to chickens (usually byproducts from cattle). Some were even feeding ground up chicken (those who died) back to the birds. Remember or did you ever hear about Mad Cow Disease? That started when byproducts of cattle (including spine and brain) were ground up and fed back to cattle. Laws were created limiting what kind of animal byproducts could be fed to meat animals (chickens can no longer eat chicken byproduct, cattle can no longer eat byproducts from cloven-hooved animals). Then the &quot;grass fed beef&quot; marketing took off once people realized cattle were being kept on dirt lots and fed primarily corn/soy based foods. Chicken marketing turned to &quot;vegetarian fed&quot; because it is true and sounds better. Vegetarian fed really just means a corn/soy diet. It is nothing special and there is plenty more put in their feed including antibiotics, etc... </p></div>		</li>
