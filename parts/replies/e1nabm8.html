<p>A lot of people might say that ISPs advertise speeds in terms of bits to make their products look faster but...</p>

<p>Keep in mind that this applies to many things. For instance, drive makers using decimal gigabytes instead of binary gibibytes that operating systems incorrectly call gigabytes. The entire 1024 = 1k convention is due to the fact that address spaces of binary machines are always powers of two, but there is no physical reason for mass storage to be like that as well.</p>
<p>Not to say that &quot;sounding bigger without delivering more&quot; is not playing a role in why a particular practice continues, but it is not the reason it came up in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to be pedantic that's <em>kind of</em> correct now, but not totally. The IEC established a new set of SI prefixes for binary numbers in 1998 but basically no one has adopted it in common use AFAIK; I don't know anything about the history besides that though.</p>
<p>One KB (KILObyte) is 1000 bytes, one GB (GIGAbytes) is 1000 KB, etc. In this context the correct prefix would be KiB and GiB for kibi- and gibi-bytes respectively (1KiB = 1024 bytes).</p>

<p>So if you buy a disk with advertised 100GB and it formats to ~93GiB and change you didn't <em>technically</em> get screwed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Time to be slightly pedantic in reddit tradition - removable and hard drive makers. SSDs end up following powers of 2 because we make the drive bigger by sticking two smaller ones together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so sure about that. 120, 250, 500, all these are common SSD sizes, and none of them are powers of two. While they may have, say, 256 GiB internally (I honestly do not know), they only expose 250 GB (i.e. 2.5e11 bytes) to the user.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>baudrate is actually the number of &quot;symbols&quot; tranfered and has nothing to do with audio in particular. Lets say we represent the alfabet (which has 26 characters) in bits, we would need 5 bits to represent one symbol. A baudrate of 100 symbols/second would mean 500bits/s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One baud is only equivalent to one bit per second if one signal state only transmits one bit.</p>
<p>One counterexample would be Quadrature amplitude modulation, or QAM for short. 16-QAM specifically transmits 4 bits per state (16 because 2^(4 bits) = 16 states).</p>
<p>Some Wifi specifications use 256-QAM transmitting 8 bits per state.</p></div>		</li>
