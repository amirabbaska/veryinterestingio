<p>Typically, its best to wash the cut with antibacterial soap (like Dial) </p>

<p>In the US, isn't antibacterial soap now outlawed (to normal consumers)? Because of the massive introduction of antibiotics to the environment leading to resistance?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter. Regular soap works just as fine. The antibacterial properties of antibacterial soap is overexaggerated anyway, unless you actually use a true desinfectant like chlorhexidine. Most of the antibacterial properties comes from washing away the bacteria, which normal soap is excellent at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibiotic and anti-bacterial are not the same - all soap is antibacterial to a degree. The US is also unusual in that you can buy antibiotic creams like neosporin over the counter - in the uk for instance you would buy antibacterial cream (like germolene) to put on a cut rather than antibiotic </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember they are in the process of outlawing it because research has shown it doesn't produce significantly better results in the cleanliness of the whatever it's washing. Something like &quot;comparison if normal soap to antibacterial soap is inconclusive&quot;. So that combined with what you said is why they are outlawing it. I'm not sure when it happens. I thought it was like 3-5 years maybe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add a question here because it has always bugged me.</p>
<p>I came across a motorcycle accident a few years ago. I ran over to give first aid to one guy motionless on the ground. He did not have a pulse, so my first instinct was to start CPR; however he also was lying in a very large pool of blood. I hesitated because I didn't know whether to do CPR with such high blood loss. Should I have just done CPR anyway or was it not going to matter no matter what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>U/Edi17 is correct, to an extent. If it's a trauma situation and the pool of blood is massive and they don't have a pulse, you'd probably be doing nothing but draining him more. </p>
<p>The protocols have changed from airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) to circulation, airway, breathing (CAB), for the fact that if you don't have anything (blood) to circulate, the rest is irrelevant. Homedude was probably already gone. ): it sucks to want to do something but not be able to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Odds are his heart stopped because of the blood loss. If you had started CPR, you would have just been pushing the rest of his blood out on to the road.  </p></div>		</li>
