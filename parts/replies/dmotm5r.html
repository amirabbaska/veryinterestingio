<p>black hole = tangly wooly carpet of essentially one single long string above a horizon. Hawking rad is tiny normal strings detaching from said carpet. As it loses energy it shrinks and &quot;unravels&quot; and becomes a small string (i.e., a particle). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, but these three words are a little light on description. By destroyed, do you mean converted entirely into photons and emitted randomly into the space around the black hole? Saying it was just &quot;destroyed&quot; implies that there may be some violation of conservation laws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very long time.  Very.  Long.  Time.</p>
<p>In fact a black hole with the mass of the moon that formed at the Big Bang should be winding down right about... now.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, complete dissolution of a black hole down to that size is a very slow process.  A stellar black hole with the mass of the Sun would take some ridiculous number of years to evaporate.  Literally estimated to be 2.098×10^67 years.</p>
<p>Primordial black holes, which we speculate are the only black holes we are aware of that can actually form with less than stellar masses only take a couple of billion years to evaporate.  The problem is that the only way we believe that you can get a less than stellar mass black hole was via the Big Bang, so they're probably not being formed presently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that they aren't evaporating now since the CMB is hotter than a blackhole. So they're ingesting more energy than they're emitting. Until the universe cools down a lot more then this process won't even start. </p>
<p>But that was a number of years ago I read about that so I may be completely wrong. </p></div>		</li>

<p>ok, but in comparison to a nearby observer, or an outside observer ? Time slows down near a BH due to gravity warping spacetime. So is it a bazillion-jillion-garbillion years <em>if you were standing right outside the event horizon</em> ? Or if you were at a really far distance away ? </p>
<p>There must be some correlation between this and how objects &quot;freeze&quot; and &quot;time stands still&quot; at the event horizon. Previously I'd seen videos saying BH's &quot;break a hole&quot; through spacetime, or they are &quot;infinitely deep&quot; holes in spacetime. But if the BH eventually evaporates, maybe they're not &quot;infinitely&quot; deep at all ? Maybe they're astronomically (pun intended) deep, maybe they grow exponentially, but are finite, and eventually the &quot;hole&quot; in spacetime flattens back out as matter gets released due to Hawking ?</p></div>		</li>
