			<div class="markdown"><p>This. We only &quot;require&quot; a balanced diet if we wish to maintain better health and increase longevity. You can totally survive on a crap diet of one or two staples for decades, but it won't be nearly as healthy. You can pretty much eat something like grilled chicken and green beans forever. But there are obviously health benefits to ingesting other compounds from differing food sources, and humans are able to eat quite a variety of foods to find that benefit. We've got nothing on your average rat in the diversity of what we can process, but we do pretty well. But it's in no way necessary, you can survive for a long time on something like bread, rice, or potatoes almost exclusively , as various cultures around the world have shown at various times throughout history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are confusing an average life expectancy with a median.</p>
<p>There is no time in human history were it was normal for adults to die as 35 year olds.</p>
<p>The average was low because of infanticide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really isn't true though. We obsess about our diets and since it is something we <em>can</em> control it is advisable to do so but eating a not-great diet really won't kill you young. You could eat a very basic and not particularly ideal diet from birth but if you got your basic nutrients (and in any modern society you will) and don't overeat too much, you'll likely live almost as long as someone with an ideal diet.</p>
<p>Exercise and not being overly obese are far more important than &quot;healthy foods&quot; from a medical perspective.</p></div>		</li>
