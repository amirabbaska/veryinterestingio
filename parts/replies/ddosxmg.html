			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, dimming an LED bulb actually works by turning it on and off again very quickly (usually, some dimmers work in other ways). So not only does the LED not care, it's actually made to do it. But this goes back to the more complex circuitry u/viskerratio is talking about.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the same theory behind the expanding and contracting of materials based on heat also apply to the components of an LED light? <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o1zp6.jpg" target="_blank">They have many parts.</a>Isn't the usual cause of LEDs going out a piece of it breaking rather than the &quot;lights&quot; themselves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it does, but to a much lesser extent. Household LED bulbs do get quite hot during operation, painful to hold and can cause mild burns in some cases. However, they don't get anywhere near as hot as the tungsten filament in an incandescent bulb, which typically reach about 4600 degrees Fahrenheit. So there is stress caused in the circuitry by the heat of LED bulbs, but it is much less than what an incandescent experiences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To emphasize the point, the <a href="http://www.centennialbulb.org/" target="_blank">Centennial Light</a> has been on for 115 years, primarily because it's temperature controlled and no one is turning it on and off (or bumping into it, for that matter).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But for fluorescent tube lights like they use in offices and shops mostly, turning them on is a huge drain on their ballasts. Flicking one of those on and off as fast as it will respond will wear out the ballast prematurely.</p></div>		</li>
