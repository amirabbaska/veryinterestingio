			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we have an idea how many stars existed in our region of space before our Sun?</p>
<p>Obviously the previous star was more massive than ours. And I understand (in general) stars with greater mass have shorter lives. It is possible there were a few stars that lived and died before our own, but do we have any way to know how many?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but pedantic. &quot;Our region of space&quot; refers to a section of the galaxy that is of some arbitrary area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars move in and out of our &quot;region of space&quot; all the time because the stars of the milky way aren't orbiting in any particular order. The stars aren't nearly as ordered in the milky way as the planets in our solar system. So I would be fairly confident that we would have a really hard time to calculate backwards and find out how many stars were close to &quot;us&quot; before the the sun was formed. The sun orbit's the center of the milky way once every 250 million years, that means that it has completed about 18-19 orbits in its life. That means that the sun has travelled about 2.9 million light years since it formed. A lot can happen over such was distances.</p>
<p>But We can make estimations from what we know about galaxy formation and star formation and the amount of mass in the galaxy, because the mass doesn't really change that much, or we can account for it.</p>
<p>I guess your question boils down to &quot;Can we know anything of the star that created our solar system and can we know if it also created any other stars and in that case which ones?&quot;. Unfortunately at this point in time the answer is a resounding no.</p></div>		</li>
