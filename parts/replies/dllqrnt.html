I think that one of the most exciting things in the Galactic center is the Event Horizon telescope project: <a href="http://eventhorizontelescope.org/" target="_blank">http://eventhorizontelescope.org/</a>. If it is successful, astronomer’s may be able to see the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy.

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give you another answer, while I wouldn't say it's necessarily going to be the most <em>important</em> discovery, finding out what is responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst" target="_blank">fast radio bursts</a> might be, for me, the most interesting. They've been written about for a decade, and depending on what's really going on with them, it could give us insight into a lot of astrophysics, or it could be pretty anticlimactic. So, the suspense is killing me!</p>
