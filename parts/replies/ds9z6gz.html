			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also for this reason that many birds dislike having their feathers touched. They've spent ages carefully cleaning, preening and rubbing oils over themselves for water-resistance, scent marking and anti-parasitic properties.</p>
<p>And then we pink mammals come along with our chubby, Cheeto dust covered fingers and want to handle them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a neighbor who was the classic grouchy guy, we were in town homes at the time so we would encounter him pretty regulalry. Anyway one year my parents decided to buy him this red songbird with promises to help with feed and cleaning and stuff. He loved that bird, and would just listen to it chirp all day.</p>
<p>Someone tried to hold it or touch it once and he got super pissed for reasons you listed. It was actually cool to see him protective rather than aggressive. </p></div>		</li>

This is a problem living on an island, and the was they catch fish is to wait for a booby to come up with a fish and then brigade the shit out of him until he drops it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn. These motherfuckers are ruthless. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frigatebirds have to find ways to stay aloft because they can't land on the water. Since their feathers aren't waterproof, the birds would drown in short order. They feed by harassing other birds in flight until they regurgitate whatever fish they've eaten and the frigatebird takes it</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Realistically not so useful.</p>
<p>They can stay aloft for weeks, and (in the Galapagos at least) are more likely to follow YOU around and just chill above your boat for ages because the wind hitting the boat generates an updraft for them to relax in. Additionally they know boats sometimes toss scraps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the Galapagos cormorants don’t have it either, and are flightless, and need to stand around a bit in the sun after each diving attempt to catch fish. </p>
<p>So they will just stand around, wings spread, drying. Adorbsable</p></div>		</li>
