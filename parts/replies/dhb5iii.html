			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, lack of sunlight and a source of vitamin D will certainly make you deficient.  Rickets comes to mind as a result</p>
<p>To answer your original question, sunlight absorbed by the epidermis, vitamin D precursors produced and absorbed in blood stream eventually make their way to Liver, and on to your Kidneys where the active form of vitamin D is made.
However active vitamin D production is much more complicated, involving the parathyroid gland and parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is also involved in regulating Calcium levels in the blood serum. When blood calcium levels are low PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels, and signaling the kidneys to continue to make active Vitamin D.  Now vitamin D can signal increased absorption of calcium in your GI tract. Thus restoring equilibrium of blood calcium levels and stopping secretion of PTH and halting kidneys from producing active vitamin D. </p>
<p>Side note. Calcium is a BIG importance in overall health, most people forget that calcium plays a major role in nervous system and muscular system functioning. Not just bone health. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would you recommend as a source of calcium? I've always thought of milk as a good source but recently I've heard from a few people that milk is not a good source and that it can actually strip your body of calcium. I don't know enough to make a determination one way or the other but I'd like to hear your thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there is a type of fungus that can derive its energy from ionising radiation with melanin in Cernobyl.</p>
<p>Could the same mechanism work in humans?  We have melanin too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am only a protein biochemist, so no idea on the fungi. As far as I understand, autotrophy in animals has never been recorded so far. (Fungi are not animals.)</p>
<p>Melanin is just a pigment; it cannot really do anything on its own. For complex processes to occur, the involvement of proteins (which are coded by genes) is absolutely critical. Depending on what proteins the fungi employed and whether humans possess genes for very similar proteins, what you described may or may not be possible. In practice, however, humans would just eat the radiation-absorbing fungi rather than waiting millions of years evolving into the first case of animal autotroph ever recorded.</p></div>		</li>
