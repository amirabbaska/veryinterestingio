I study econometrics so yes i agree that there are unknown factors. But it is this type of language which makes people give up on understanding macroforces. I think our scientific community has sacrificed our ability to communicate, because we are absolutely obsessed with measurement. Measurements are important of course but when dealing with complex systems your never going to refine your answer to some perfect answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The history of macroeconomics is the history of theoretical economics that do a great job of describing the past, but a terrible job of predicting the future. Starting with Malthus.</p>
<p>I want macro to be good, and a lot of really smart people are doing a bunch of good work, but it's wrong to treat macroeconomics the same as an empirical social science. We can't measure capital well; we can't compare countries well; there aren't natural experiments to exploit; sample sizes are too small; and if it actually worked then we would have been able to develop more than just a couple of what are essentially island nations in south-east Asia since WW2.</p>
<p>I get what you're saying about people picking apart what are essentially pretty good studies, just with the odd flaw here or there. You're never going to get the perfect natural experiment or account for every variable. But that's a defense of good microeconomics studies; or pharmacology; or a bunch of work in psychology. But we're nowhere close to that level in macro.</p></div>		</li>
