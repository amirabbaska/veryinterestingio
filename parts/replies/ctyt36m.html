<p>Really? The problem is stated as a differential equation. It also wasn't solved correctly until after Newton's death.</p>

<p>The problems arise when there are multiple bodies interacting with each other. The position of Mars influences the position of Earth, but Earth influences Mars. This moves both planets into new positions at the next instant, where they influence each other again. Before Calculus this could not be calculated.</p>

<p>I don't mean to downplay his achievements, but Newton did not come close to solving the 3-body problem. It was something he thought about, but not the focus of his work or the motivation to develop the math he did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you misunderstand. His first example is describing an object of negligible mass in constant gravity. It is relatively easy to measure the rate at which something falls to the earth, and then algebra can be used for any general case.</p>
<p>As you said, for two bodies exerting forces on each other, that is a differential equation: calculus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can actually get the answer from trigonometry and geometry, things the Greeks were exceptional at. They did not abstract it to arbitrary gravity, the concept of gravity as we know it did not exist. Given a fixed gravity (as was thought) and knowledge of trig functions (Quick check says 2000 BC Babylon) the equations can be found through trial and error, after Archimedes and Pythagoras it was much easier. </p>

<p>True, what he did was plot the paths of the stellar bodies. The difference in subtle enough that in my extremely casual expression I misspoke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is somewhat debatable. There were some concepts from Calculus around, but they had not been put together. They were also far from complete.</p>
<p>A couple of examples. I remember a thought experiment from the Greeks. How do you measure the outline of a human hand? It turns out that if you have infinitely many infinitely small particles that you can measure it, but the Greeks had never found a way to achieve this. It wasn't until Calculus that a reliable solution was achieved.</p>
<p>I don't remember who originally observed this one. The double pendulum. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum</a> gives an explanation. But again while the device is ancient, and there was some effort at a solution, the solution wasn't complete. The double pendulum is shockingly difficult to solve and the solution is relatively recent.</p>
<p>So there were some glimmers of Calculus before, but nothing that we could genuinely say was Calculus as Newton discovered it.</p>
<p>Edit: spelling and</p>
<p>I almost forgot the Antikythera Mechanism. Basically an ancient Greek sky calculator. Getting it right requires Calculus. The Greeks tried and using their methods got shockingly close, but they still missed. The difference wouldn't be noticeable for quite some time. Newton's Calculus allowed for vastly higher precision.</p></div>		</li>

<p>has it been solved? <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/DoublePendulum.html" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha (19)</a> says that the differential equation can be solved numerically</p></div>		</li>
