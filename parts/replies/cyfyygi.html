<p>Coumarin (90%+ of all fragrances made in the last 100 years have this one)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many perfumes seem to share a common element that I can describe as &quot;perfumy&quot; in the sense that the only time I experience that scent is in perfumes. It's not a particularly nice element, it's sort of &quot;window-cleaner-like&quot; and does not remind me of any of the pleasant natural scents one find in nature. Could it be that's coumarin?</p>
<p>The analytic nature of your post about perfumes reminds me of the book <em>Perfume</em> by Patrick Suskind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing I know about coumarin: it is an insecticide. It smells exactly like vanilla, but better. The FDA has banned all importation of vanilla from Mexico because they just couldn't get them to stop adulterating it with coumarin. I have tried it. Oh boy, is that good! But it's poisonous.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you know how much coumarin you would have to consume to actually be poisoned?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost all designer colognes smell the same to me because of that perfumy smell. Niche colognes have that smell a little less. Once you go niche... you truly can't go back. It's an acquired taste, but after you've acquired it you begin to wonder how the hell you ever wore designer colognes like Armani Code and Gucci Guilty (YUCK) before hand. Then you realize ALL designer colognes smell 95% the same to you. </p>
<p>If you can, get your nose on <a href="http://fimgs.net/images/perfume/nd.8705.jpg" target="_blank">Guerlain Tonka Imperiale</a>. Spray it on your wrist, wait a minute or two, then sniff it. That is the least perfumy perfume I know so far. Such a beautiful natural scent without that perfumy smell you're talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where does one find niche colognes?  What's the difference while I'm shopping that I'll see between &quot;niche cologne&quot;, &quot;designer cologne&quot;, and &quot;cheap generic cologne&quot;.  I don't really know anything about cologne, so feel free to dumb it down for me.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could say the same about wine, but people still attempt to itemize what you smell in it.</p>
<p>Wine usually doesn't contain anything more than just grapes and yeast, but you wouldn't say a wine tastes 'grapey'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol scotch is the same way. I am quite the scotch aficionado, and you are highly encouraged when drinking scotch to search your mind as you smell it for familiar notes. Anything that you can liken it to on any level. 70% of scotch is aroma association. Then taste it keeping those notes alive in your mind, searching for more. </p>
<p>It can be a very pleasant experience, and it is amazing the notes you can find beyond &quot;fermented grain in a charred oak barrel for a decade and a half&quot;. Caramel, dried fruits, nutty tones, earthy tones, etc. It is surprising the familiar smells and tastes that come from such a simple process that contains none of the notes that the products end with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how much of that is just illusionary? A neuron in your brain looking for sense memory accidentally opens the &quot;caramel&quot; drawer instead of the &quot;chocolate&quot; drawer and now you believe you taste caramel, even though there isn't a bit of either in the beverage to begin with.</p>
<p>When I hear people talk about wines, scotchs, brandies, etc. like this I immediately wonder how much of it is just in their heads entirely unintentionally made up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I will paypal you the admission price to whatever fancy wine-tasting event that you are willing to stand on a podium and say <em>those exact words</em> in front of.</p>
<p>EDIT: I will also contribute up to $150 towards travel expenses, if you arrange for your monologue to be recorded and uploaded to Youtube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>same goes for beers. Im a brewer, and I often have to describe my beers. Most people have no idea what myrcene or caryophellene are. I know what hops smell like what, and what oils smell like what, and cater to it.</p>
<p>Even to my partners im often like &quot;yeah you can smell the centennial in this&quot; and they're like &quot;all i get is grapefruits....&quot; which is what centennial hops smell like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh? I don't get your objection. People who are interested in perfume do discuss the 'contents' of perfumes, either in terms of notes, what you can effectively recognise, or (more rarely) of materials/chemicals. It's just not finding its way into perfume ads because that would require some technical knowledge and interest from the target and it's way easier to flog some aspirational tosh. </p></div>		</li>
