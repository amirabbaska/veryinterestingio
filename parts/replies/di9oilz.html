			<div class="markdown"><p>Even countries with their own currency often have a 'peg' against the US Dollar. They'll say their currency is worth X Dollars and they'll buy or sell Dollars to make sure their currency remains at that approximate value. If the difference in value isn't too huge people won't be bothered to form a black market for Dollars.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes the government can't afford to maintain it's peg, or set it at an absurd number. In which case it's even worse for the country because a large black market forms and/or people won't send money to your country legally.</p>
<p>For example the legal Venezuelan currency is worth 1/10th of a dollar officially through legal channels. On the black market, however, you can get around 3,000 Bol√≠vars per dollar. As a result people are forced to use the black market to help relatives because they don't want to lose 99.6% of their value to do things legally.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I was just in Cambodia and was surprised to learn they us the u.s. dollar as their primary currency as well. I was told it's because the dollar is much more stable than their rial, and people trust the dollar more than their native rial.</p></div>		</li>
