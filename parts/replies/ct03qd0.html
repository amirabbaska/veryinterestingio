<p>Also, when taking organs from dead people, aren't we taking blood indirectly also? </p>

<p>If a family says no, the organ bank will not harvest organs even for someone who has an organ donor card.</p>
<p>Make sure you let your family know your wishes if you want to donate!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's crazy. Is there a way to get around this, as in some sort of legal document beyond an organ donor card? When I die, I don't think my family should be able to make any decisions about my body or organs that contradict my own. </p></div>		</li>
