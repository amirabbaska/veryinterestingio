			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems much closer to the truth than the current top answers. Those don't describe why many seem to instinctively do this.</p>
<p>When I was a kid and slammed my keyboard in frustration when my computer was being difficult, it was not because of &quot;percussive maintenance&quot; because slamming the keyboard does not change the inner workings of my tower. It's frustration.</p>
<p>The current top answers shows why we keep doing it: there are cases where we seem to be rewarded for doing this. My family's old TV, a nice big CRT, near the end of its light the image would get wonky. A good whack to the top of it would provide a temporary fix. Frustration led to me or my brother hitting the TV, we were rewarded when it worked, so it cemented in our heads that this is an acceptable fix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venting frustration is healthy if done in a safe way. It's also necessary. This stuff is said so many times but it's simple and universal. If you don't vent, eventually you become overwhelmed, and someone keeps picking at you... you very well may have a breakdown and go into shock and explode into what some call &quot;a big fucking scene&quot;, killing friendships, destroying relationships, wrecking lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that true? I know it's frequently depicted in media, but I've been under the impression that reacting violently when you're under stress just trains you to react violently with future stresses. </p>
<p>I am aware of a study that found that cussing when you're in pain makes you more able to tolerate it. So, I think there's some truth to what you're saying, but I think it's more nuanced. </p></div>		</li>
