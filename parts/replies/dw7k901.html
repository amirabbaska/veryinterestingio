			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course it's true that cancelling debt decreases assets as a matter of arithmetic. The real question is how that ends up affecting the economy. For capital supply, the assets of state-owned banks might not matter so much if the government plans to, for instance, downsize them and just let private bondholders come in anyway. Also, they could just reduce capitalization requirements and let them continue lending, just with fewer assets. These are the sorts of manipulations the party does all the time.</p>
<p>There are only two factors which can answer the OP's question. The first is whether capital will continue to be allocated correctly. The second is whether pensions are going to end up being paid. None of the intermediate steps matter in the end.</p></div>		</li>
