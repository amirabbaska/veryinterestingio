			<div class="markdown"><p>So frequency is perceived by humans as logarithmic. This is a fancy way of saying that an interval (the &quot;distance&quot; between two notes) is based not on the actual <em>difference</em> in Hertz between the two pitches, but on the <em>factor</em> between them.</p>
<p>For example, the interval of an octave is a doubling in frequency. An octave above 100 Hz is 200 Hz. An octave above 300 Hz, however, isn't 400 as you might expect (300+100), but rather 600 Hz (300*2).</p>
<p>Modern music divides the octave into 12 equal intervals, so there are 12 equally spaced notes in one octave. This is called 12-tone equal temperament, or 12-TET for short.</p>
<p>Why exactly are there 12 notes? Well, this system sounds good (because it contains certain intervals that sound good to the human ear), but it's not the only one and historical accident is certainly part of it.</p>
<p>In any case, many modern virtual synthesizers allow you to specify alternate tuning systems, so there's nothing stopping you from dividing the octave into as many or as few notes as your heart desires. <a href="https://youtu.be/xVZy9GUeMqY" target="_blank">Here's a song written in 53-TET.</a> It sounds... weird, I'll give you that, but pretty interesting too.</p>
<p>There are other systems too, like not dividing the octave into equal parts or straight up not using the octave in the first place, but you're getting into really weird territory here and it's mostly an unexplored no-man's-land where pretty much anything goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually aware of most of this, having experimented with writing microtonal music myself! I was hoping for some history or maybe some suggestion for note naming when the notes are...different. :P</p>
<blockquote>

<p>actually that one was one of the coolest tunings I've found! <a href="http://www.wendycarlos.com/resources/pitch.html" target="_blank">Carlos Gamma</a>, specifically. It divides every fifth (C to G) into 20 equally spaced notes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/GammaMonk1" target="_blank">it sounds lovely</a></p>
<p>I just have no idea what the notation would be, so I've been making up my own, wondering if there's a better way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, the notes in a piano don't cover all of the sound spectrum. There's sounds in between notes. Microtonal music is like the keys between the keys of a piano. </p>
<p>The only example I can think of right now (but there are many more) is music from India. Basically, it uses a lot more notes in a scale. This also means that you probably won't be able to play any microtonal music in a piano </p></div>		</li>
