			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest thing to have changed is that there's now no regulatory oversight when it comes to privacy and ISPs. Before the FCC took over control through relabeling ISPs as common carriers, the FTC loosely regulated the industry's privacy practices. Now the FCC has been stripped of its power to regulate and the FTC can't step in and take over since ISPs are common carriers.</p>
<p>Saying that they're able to sell all the same information is not quite right either. Verizon was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/7/11173010/verizon-supercookie-fine-1-3-million-fcc" target="_blank">fined by the FCC</a> for inserting headers into customer's traffic to help track them more accurately. Now, Verizon can start doing that again with no opt-out option and the FCC can't put a stop to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Verizon cannot start doing that again, Cellular services fall under a different category than Internet service providers and are still regulated by the FCC. Please don't spread FUD.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The FCC rule they repealed was only passed back in October 2016, and wasn't set to take effect until at least October 2017.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure that's an excuse that passes the &quot;sniff test&quot;.  Just because it wasn't in place <em>yet</em> doesn't mean that (a) it wasn't a good idea that people wanted, and (b) that people aren't necessarily &quot;out&quot; anything because of the resolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree it definitely would have been a good thing, and it sucks it was repealed.</p>
<p>My point is, nothing has changed.  ISP rules on how they collect and sell information remain the same.</p></div>		</li>
