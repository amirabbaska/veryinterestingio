			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is there air inside the vehicle moving at 0 m/s? Why it's there a clean envelope behind the vehicle moving at 0 m/s? </p>
<p>That seems highly unlikely for a car moving at 11 m/s with a tailwind of 11m/s. Can you post the simulations control file? I can't make sense of the location of the pockets of dead air. (Note, for those respond I am not saying the poster is wrong. I am saying I cannot personally make sense of the results with what information is at present available to me. Those are very different statements.)</p></div>		</li>
