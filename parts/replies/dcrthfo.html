<p>Cheers! </p>

<p>This seems like a pretty huge evolutionary difference to me, since evolution doesn't tinker with body plan lightly. Or maybe not - I am but a lowly microbiology grad student, and certainly not an expert in arachnid physiology. Are the lungs modified versions of some homologous structure in the lungless spiders? </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what I found with a quick google search. </p>
<p>They're unrelated to our lungs - it seems to be an open air pocket filled with folds of tissue that give extra surface area to maximize gas exhange. I'm not seeing anything about a type of &quot;breathing&quot;, so I think they just provide extra surface area.</p>
<p>I suspect this is what the other person was talking about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, book lungs can be absent, and gas exchange is performed by the thin walls inside the cavity instead, with their surface area increased by branching into the body as thin tubes called tracheae. The tracheae possibly have evolved directly from the book lungs, because in some spiders, the tracheae have a small number of greatly elongated chambers.</p>

<p>Well, I think it's rather likely that the lungless spiders <em>Caponiidae</em> secondarily lost their book lungs, but they still breathe through a pair of tracheal tubes on the abdomen. Almost every other spider family has book lungs. Ticks, similar to the lungless spiders, breathe through <a href="http://tickencounter.org/images/spiracular-plate.jpg" target="_blank">a pair of spiracular plates</a>. Not sure what kind of consensus can be made from this.</p>
<p>But there's certainly chance that the common ancestor of all spiders did not have book lungs, since ticks and a few other arachnids don't.</p></div>		</li>
