<p>You also mention [I assume] groundwater flowing at 250 m2/day. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/86ixxg/is_groundwater_ie_the_depth_to_the_water_table/dw5pvbg/" target="_blank">top comment</a> right now says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nicest fastest cleanest sand groundwater is going to have maximum velocity on the range of 3 feet a day</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you two might be giving significantly different values for groundwater velocity, but I'm too bludgeoned by the (m2/day) thing to know for sure.</p></div>		</li>
