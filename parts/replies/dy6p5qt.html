Oral hygiene also includes suctioning secretions, which can help prevent aspiration of bacteria, which may explain why mouth wash alone didn't improve mortality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What people forget is the patients that aren't so critical they're on a vent or in the ICU but still need self care help. Thanks regular oral care also greatly reduced the risk in pneumonia form aspiration food or beverages (ie it goes &quot;down the wrong pipe&quot; into the lungs). Dont get me wrong, it's always bad to have foreign material in your lungs but it's a lot more likely to turn to pneumonia is their teeth haven't been brushed and it contains a high amount of bacteria.</p></div>		</li>
