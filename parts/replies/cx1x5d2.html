<p>Kelley recalled a time he was on guard duty and repeatedly saw someone standing with a rifle in the woods, ready to sneak into camp. Upon closer inspection, he determined he was actually looking at a branch and shadows.</p>

<p>I feel like this is something I would probably do normally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have experience of this from my service. I actually was completely convinced that there was an OpFor group ready to attack and triggered an alert. (The hallucinations that preceded the episode probably should have been a cue of asking for a guard change - I had a lengthy discussion with some friends at the guard post before noticing that I was actually alone.)</p>
<p>Another of us made an arrest at another guard post. When the suspected intruder didn't respond to commands, he discovered it to be a small tree.</p>
<p>And yet another took a nap on a hot stove (ouch).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not military, but have had similar experiences. Worked on a rush project for 40+ hours non-stop, afterwards I was having computing-themed open-eye hallucinations, and every time I tried to think about anything unrelated to computers, it would (somehow) become computer-related.</p>
<p>That's the only way I can explain it. I was trying to speak to my girlfriend, and had to fight to make the right words come out. I could 'see' monospace text and data cells flying around behind my eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me and a buddy were put on guard duty and had to lay in prone position, pretty much impossible to stay awake. We had a bunch of skittles from mre's saved up for it. We would both check our watches every 5 minutes and make sure the other was awake, then we both eat a skittle. We both would get this weird &quot;feedback&quot; noise in our heads. It would happen as you get the feeling you are about to fall asleep but you fight it to stay awake. It was some weird shit.</p>
<p>Even worse was you had to go about the next day with everyone else as if you had a full night of sleep. On a positive note, as a civilian now, being tired doesn't bother me as much as those around me. When someone complains they only got 4 hours of sleep last night, I laugh a little on the inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it sounds perfectly normal to me too. Who hasn't misinterpreted a vague shadowy outline in the dark? Especially on watch, where (if you're doing it properly) you're specifically looking for threats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Architecture student here. I had no idea sleep depravation was this serious! Pulling all nighters is the norm at my school, and for most arch students really. We actually have an ongoing competition on who can go the longest without sleep, as of an hour ago the winning guy has done 43 hours, and counting. I have experienced some of those effects, bt one could get used to them, or develop some sort of resistance to them if you pull all-nighters regularly, no? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it can be medicated, but it's really bad without it. There are times when I'm trying to type a sentence on the computer and it takes me 30 minutes because I keep having microsleeps, then dreaming I typed it, then waking up and not realizing that I didn't type it in real life, then falling back asleep again when I try to retype it. Repeat until someone wakes me up or enough time passes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The symptoms of narcolepsy, or N as we call it on support forums, can be treated. The cause of the disease is thought to be autoimmune, with a similar disease process to diabetes. The cells in my brain that produce Orexin, a neurotransmitter that regulates wakefulness, have been destroyed. To treat the my EDS (excessive daytime sleepiness) I take Adderall. Other common drugs include other amphetamine salts, modafinil (Nu/Provigil) and methylphenidate (Ritalin).</p>
<p>Many people with severe N also suffer from a condition called cataplexy. Cataplexy (C or N w/ C) causes loss of muscle control upon experiencing strong emotion, such as amusement, sadness, or anger. I have fairly severe cataplexy and will collapse if you make me laugh when I'm not on medication. Cataplexy can be treated by SNRI's (Effexor) or, strangely enough, GHB (Xyrem). I am one of the only people in the world with a GHB prescription. </p>
<p>Personally, N has been extremely crippling. I have a Biomedical Engineering degree, but have been unable to work due to sleepiness, cognitive deficits, medication side effects, and intense depression. I was only diagnosed 6 months ago, so I have hopes that I will be functional once my meds are balanced. On a positive note, my medications are extremely recreational! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am with you on that. I almost got fired because I drifted off without being aware of it. Got tested and have narcolepsy with a specific WHO grading, now medicated it's better but slow days can be bad.</p>
<p>After years of napping away all the time and being called a slacker, heavy medicated depression I knew what really was wrong with me. I still am medication against depressions but nit as heavy as before </p></div>		</li>
