<p>Acceleration and force don't have to point in the same direction in space</p>

<p>Wait... Can you elaborate on that one?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>In Newtonian mechanics they do, in special relativity they do not. Trying to accelerate something in its direction of motion is much &quot;harder&quot; than trying to accelerate it orthogonal to it. If you have a force e.g. pointing at a 45 degree angle relative to the velocity for an ultrarelativistic particle you mainly accelerate the particle sidewards in the lab frame.</p>
<p>F = gamma^3 m a in the direction of motion, F = gamma m a orthogonal to it (where m is the (rest) mass). For fast particles, gamma is large.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I get that it's &quot;easier&quot; to accelerate something orthogonal to its direction of motion (for exactly the reason you give), just not how that can be a different direction to the force applied to <em>do</em> so.</p>
<p>It might help if you could put this into numbers (not looking for mathematical rigor here, a &quot;ballpark&quot; will do) - If a baseball is moving at .999999c, and I apply 100kN orthogonal to its direction of travel... In what direction is the acceleration?</p></div>		</li>
