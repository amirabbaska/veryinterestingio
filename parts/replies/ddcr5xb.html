			<div class="markdown"><p>The IUPAC defines an element to live longer than around 10^(-14) seconds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the fraction of a second which the proton interacts with the Pb nucleus (through elastic/inelastic scattering), would you consider it to be a Bi isotope or just a proton scattering off a Pb nucleus?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it's just scattering, you'd always consider them as separate particles. If it were some other reaction, like capture or a compound reaction, you could talk about a time where the particles merge into one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shortest isotopes with a direct application that I know of is Rubidium-82 with a lifetime of just 1.2 minutes: enough time to produce it, make RbCl, inject that into a body and use its decays in PET.</p>
<p>Nuclear fission leads to various short-living isotopes, their decays contribute to the overall heat production, but I wouldn't call this a direct application of those isotopes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't some of the newer elements tread on the borderline of this? They don't stick around long enough to do anything, just barely long enough to be measured. Hydrogen-7 has a halflife of 2.3×10^−23 seconds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclei outside the dripline have lifetimes around 10^(-23) seconds. But these are not the nuclides of interest if you're talking about making new <strong>elements</strong>. The superheavy isotopes which have been produced so far are well within the driplines. They have much longer lifetimes.</p></div>		</li>
