			<div class="markdown"><p>But if I pay a higher tax rate as an individual, my money will also be taxed again when i consume goods and services for my business and personal expenditures. The after-tax profit I make becomes someone else’s income and is therefore subject to additional income tax anyway.   </p>
<p>Whether the next party in the chain of monetary exchange is a shareholder or the private landlord I lease my plumbing shop from, it’s still being income taxed in the hands of a secondary entity, while only the incorporated plumber enjoys the tax relief. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, taxes get levied at every step of exchange. That's how taxes work. Exchanges are taxed once. A pot of money may be taxed thousands of times as it moves through the system, but no exchange is &quot;double taxed&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are now confusing income tax with sales tax. Besides, sales tax only affects the end user. So if you are buying goods to resell in you're business, you do not pay sales tax, you collect it when you sell it. Sales tax on goods (should) only happen once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct.</p>
<p>You would have to take the profit you made and re-invest it in your business.</p>
<p>Or not take it from your business and use these expenditures to reduce your buisness' taxes.</p>
<p>What you described is incredibly wrong - take profits to pay yourself, and then use those profits on the business. The amount you are spending never should have been treated as profit, thus you never paid personal income tax on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, in exchange for paying the corporate tax, the owner can't be sued for something the company did (limited liability/corporate veil). So if the company is sued and loses, all it's assets can be seized and sold off, but the owner keeps her house. Without the corporation, the owner can be sued directly and can lose her house.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That kind of goes to the question of what the &quot;deal&quot; society makes with corporations is.  You might say &quot;we give you liability protection and you pay more taxes&quot; is the deal.  However the real deal is this: &quot;You take a risk and open a business that is going to employ others, deliver valuable goods and services to the public, and we will limit the risk you take to only those assets you invest into the business.&quot;  </p>
<p>Corporate liability limitations exist because they encourage economic activity and risk taking - they don't exist as a tradeoff for paying more tax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That works for something small. Do big multinational businesses need that incentive? What about the ceos or directors that rotate every few years? Many aren’t looking for the best interest of the company but short term gains for shareholders and themselves. Most are just too big to fail when they fuck around with their customers and employees. </p>
<p>You and I starting a business from scratch with every last penny to our name then yes, we’d want that protection </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but how do you split up liability between shareholders?  If there's 10 million of them, but only 4 have true voting power, do you spread the liability across 10 million people?  Those 4?  Do you somehow pro-rate liability?  It's hard to say, so that's why you can't go after a corporate owner because there 10 million of them and no real discernable way to put 100% fault on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but there are plenty of instances where that's not true. </p>
<p>Consider large monopolistic ones like power companies? Power distribution companies (and ISPs in Europe) are regulated because they are natural monopolies. It doesn't make sense to wire up a house twice or one set of wires is worthless. So the company must lease out the wire at cost + small profit as set by a regulatory agency. No risk of failure, but still limited liability.</p>
<p>This is why LLCs don't pay corporate tax (but still get limited liability), to encourage enterprenuers. S-Corps experience way less risk, and so must pay for the privledge of limited liability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are limited liability entities that don't pay an entity- level tax. An llc for example, defaults to a &quot;pass through&quot;entity.
Biggest underlying difference is probably an access to public capital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that idea pretty much dead now? Business owners don't actually have any protection anymore. Everything is personally guaranteed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is not personally guaranteed -- that's negotiable. When I start businesses, i have no track record and therefore little leverage in negotiations with banks and landlords. After several successful years, I'm usually able to lease office space and do other things without signing a personal guarantee. Also, an important aspect of liability protection deals with consumer/customer interactions, in which no LLC or S-Corp. owner ever promises &quot;If you aren't satisfied, you can have my car and my house.&quot; :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  If you have a C corp you end up paying more in taxes than if you just put it all into your personal tax rate because you end up getting taxed twice on it.  This is why most small businesses use S-Corps now because you can avoid that double taxation.</p></div>		</li>
