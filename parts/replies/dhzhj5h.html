			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! One of the very strong connections between regions that can be surprising is that maize (corn), which originated in the tropics of the Americas, is supremely important in Southern and parts of East Africa. The most important source of calories. This is quite interesting, especially as those regions face increasing production challenges due to changing weather. Some farmers seem to be looking for alternatives, including &quot;reverting&quot; back to their traditional crops like finger millet and sorghum. Other efforts are being made to find maize varieties, most likely from the Americas, that are more tolerant to harsh conditions, and to breed these varieties with the local ones to make more resistant but culturally acceptable maize varieties. Another similar example is cassava, which is hugely important in tropical Africa and SE Asia, originally from tropical Americas. Or rice, so important in tropical Americas, being from Asia. In fact, I think most people are pretty surprised by the global story underneath our local food traditions. </p>
<p>In answer to your second question- yes, there are definitely places in the world that still eat more 'traditionally'; often places in rich centers of origin/diversity of crops, like West Asia. But a few important points- 1. no country was found to only eat food that originated in their region of the world; 2. eating 'traditionally' is not necessarily healthier (in fact traditional diets can be quite dominated by one or a couple of foods like wheat or rice; 3. it can be surprising in traditional countries, like Bhutan, that are still quite isolated from other parts of modern globalized society, that central foods are not local. One of the most typical dishes in Bhutan is a bowl of chili peppers and cheese!</p></div>		</li>
