<p>Without net neutrality certain sites would be split into two types similar to an HOV lane vs. slow lane.</p>

<p>Without net neutrality, that's the <em>best</em> case scenerio. Net neutrality protects more than that. It also protects actually going to sites. In other words, no net neutrality, no reason why Comcrap would allow you to view things like Netflix if they offer a shitty-netflix like service. They could charge you more, charge netflix more for the &quot;privilege&quot; of viewing netflix. </p>
<p>They could price their structure so that things like &quot;Facebook&quot; were add ons (Well, facebook would probably pay them NOT to do that) but sites like reddit which operate pretty effieciently? Yeah, they couldn't afford to pay the comcast toll, so comcast would likely say &quot;If you want to reach Reddit.com, it's only an extra $50/month! Also added in are the websites 'blumpkin-spainish.com, 'zombo.com', and 'digg.com'!&quot; </p>
<p>net neutrality is a huge huge deal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one of the better analogies I came across compares a tiered internet as a stepping stone to making the internet like cable TV.</p>
<p>You get some websites for &quot;free&quot; with the basic set-up, in this case definitely the sites from which your ISP gets revenue, and maybe others that can pay to keep themselves in there like Google.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to use Netflix, you'll have to pay Comcast for a usable speed (in my mind to compensate them for lost revenue from their cable TV service), same as YouTube, etc.</p>
<p>Now think about trying to download a file. You bought a $50 game online but it's a 10GB download? Better pray that the company is paying Comcast's ransom so you don't have to wait two weeks to get the game.</p>
<p>The other thing about tiered internet, is that it would absolutely annihilate media-based start-ups. YouTube, Hulu, etc. could have never happened if they had to pay upfront for the extra bandwidth they use. Quite possibly music sites like Pandora and Spotify as well. Every single website would have to pay a ransom to an ISP if they wanted to get a large customer base. Think of how impossible it is to create a new TV channel unless Oprah personally funds it, and that would become the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to point out, the difference in business could be incredible with only a very small increase in speed. Maybe someone could help me out with a link but I remember one of the giants like Google or amazon artificially added a delay to some links, and then tried to find the smallest time delay with a verifiable decrease in user interaction. They determined that it was well under 1 second. Anecdotally, sometimes I catch myself doing this (I skip any image from here that goes flikr for instance because it takes longer than imgur links.) </p></div>		</li>

<p>Google studies stated that adding a 500ms delay cut to a page cut traffic by 20%, and Amazon studies added that even a 100ms increase had a measurable impact on traffic.</p>

<p>This is exactly why I started using google instead of yahoo back in 8th? grade, I think around the year 2001.</p>
<p>The google homepage hasn't changed significantly in over 15 years.  It was always clean and simple.  Yahoo had links to all kinds of bullshit when all I wanted to do was search for something.</p></div>		</li>
