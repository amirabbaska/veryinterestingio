<p>Mining is a computational process, so it's completely unaffected. </p>
<p>Theoretically, ISPs could favor certain crypto trading websites. But they're not a direct competitor, nor owned by ISP/content companies, so they're not particularly at risk. They're also not particularly data heavy or sensitive to high ping (unless you're a high frequency trader).</p>
<p>Worst case scenario, ISPs would try to charge them a bit more overhead, and you'd see this in slightly higher trading costs. But even that's a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p>Crypto is safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd bet no one knows for sure. Not even the ISPs. This is uncharted waters for everyone.</p>
<p>However, my non-expert opinion is that attacking crypto currencies directly would probably be quite difficult and it's probably a low-priority issue for ISPs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it will be a high priority issue for banks and capitalist corporation. Cause anti-Bank and anti-trust is sort of the motto for  establishment of BTC. Probably 'll do things to decelerate its growth like putting a fee for accessing and trade?</p></div>		</li>
