			<div class="markdown"><p>Important! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_sector" target="_blank">The sector</a> is not the smallest unit, ie. the unit that is 0 or 1. Sectors are the smallest area that can be indexed and used for a file. If you create for example a small text file, you may see something like this in the properties: Size: 957 bytes, Size on disk: 4,00kb (4096 bytes). This is because the disk area is divided and distributed in blocks, so the smallest area you can use for the file is a single block.</p>
<p>Why this matters: consider saving something like phonenumbers or addressbook into a disk. If you make a separate file for everyone, you are actually using and wasting 4kb for each file, even though they are just couple of bytes long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Worth clarifying a few extra things though (You implied this but didn't state it outright): The sector represents the smallest unit you can receive from or write to the drive. Meaning that if you want to modify a few bytes of your file, you have to read/modify/write the entire sector that it exists inside of. The drive never deals in single bytes.</p>
<p>Also worth adding, file-systems are actually indexed via 'clusters', which may or may not be made-up of multiple sectors. So even if your drive has a sector size of 512 (Very typical for a HDD) the file-system may use a cluster size of 4K, and thus the smallest readable/writeable unit for the FS is 4K.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, that 4K is referring to the NTFS cluster size, which may be different than the sector size on the hard drive. Some hard drives do have a sector size of 4K, but 512 bytes is very common for older drives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 4096K blocks are a software limitation (file system/OS). It has nothing to do with the disk physically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect, or at least misleading.  Many (most?) consumer spinning hard drives are 4K block size. For a while the OS/file system/driver stack weren't ready and could only talk in 512 byte blocks so HDDs would be 4K internally but present as 512 to the host. </p>
<p>Edit:  a file being limited to a minimum size of 4K in that case is a software limitation. When a HDD needs to write something smaller than 4K it first reads the full 4K sector, modifies just the bit it wants to write, then writes the entire thing back out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SSDs which typically use NAND technology do have a minimum chunk of bits it can physically access, depending on the operation (read, write, erase). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A mechanical hard drive sector contains much more than a single bit (a one or a zero). They normally contain about 512 bytes (4,096 bits) of information.</p></div>		</li>
