			<div class="markdown"><p>I have skin picking OCD and it's awful. For a long while I didn't have the impulse control to not pick other people's skin so I would just sit there foaming at the mouth to pick some poor person's sunburn flakes off for HOURS. The longest time was about 7 hours straight on my boyfriend at the time. It's more instant gratification than endorphin release since I will pick any skin I see. </p>
<p>The OCD itself tends to make people chew on the inside of their mouths and their lips so if you compulsively do both, it would be good to go check it out with a licensed therapist.</p></div>		</li>
