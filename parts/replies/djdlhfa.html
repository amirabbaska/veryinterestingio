			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's my guess. I don't know how old you are, but when I was a kid there were rabbits everywhere. Now when I go rabbit hunting with my kid we might shoot 3 or 4 in a night. Talked to a biologist at the A&amp;M research center by my house and he said it's the fire ants killing the babies before they even get out of their burrows.  If they can wipe out the rabbit populations they can certainly clean up all the dead birds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wish we had more fireants here. </p>
<p>Used to see maybe one or two rabbits a week 7 or 8 years ago, now it's not possible to leave my cul-de-saq without smashing one under my wheels. The coyotes around here got some wasting disease so they all but died out, and the foxes are too fat and too few to deal with the rabbit explosion. The roads are practically paved with flattened bunnies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You said in another comment that you are in a heavily wooded area. </p>
<p>Other people made good suggestions, but they haven't yet said how dead animals are often very hard to see in unmowed grass and thick growth. </p>
<p>For instance, disc golf discs are brightly colored and throwing one in heavy woods can be mean a lost disc, you can almost step on them without seeing them. More so for an animal that is brown or gray. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm this. I was stationed in San Antonio for a few months for basic training, and then Sheppard 5 years ago. I was on watch one night (say like 1-2am) and I saw my first scorpion scuttle it's way across the cement pad was on. I'm from the east coast, never seen a scorpion before in my life - and stepped on it (because scorpions). No exaggeration, within an hour's time, I watched a swarm of fire ants come out of nowhere, and took the pieces of the dead scorpion away completely. </p></div>		</li>
