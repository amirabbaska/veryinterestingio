			<div class="markdown"><p>I own a coffee shop, and espresso can clump. Tamping is forced clumping and the puck holds it shape through the whole process. My grinder  also has a screen where it comes out to break up clumps. When we first bought the grinder it was worse because the screen is grounded and needed to coat with coffee oils over time. My serviceman told me that static electricity can cause the clumping. I'm sure humidity affects it too.
Anyway, when you make coffee, the solids are discarded instead of mixed in. That's why they don't clump. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a way of making coffee. The machine forces steam through very finely ground coffee, so it comes out thicker and stronger than regular drip coffee. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just adding that there are espresso roasted coffees out there. But they're just a (usually dark) roast that lends itself well to making espresso. You can make espresso with any type of coffee (as long as it's ground correctly) and you can make coffee using any method with espresso roast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC clumping espresso has to do with the grinds being so fine (lightweight) and the sharp edges created by the grinder, which allows them to interlock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're on the right track, but clumping happens in other powders that aren't &quot;water soluble&quot;</p>
<p>The phrasing you're looking for is &quot;hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity&quot;</p>
<p>Coffee beans contain oils, and grinding them releases these oils which coat a good amount of the grounds, which in turn makes them <strong>less susceptible</strong> to absorbing moisture from the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The roasting process is what determines the oiliness of the bean even before it's ground. A light roast will be a much more pleasant drink than a dark if you take it without all the trimmings, if you want it with cream and a dash of hazelnut syrup then dark all the way, but light roast has more caffeine, if that's what you're in it for, and tastes much better, and less bitter, black.
You can see it on the beans, dark roast is essentially &quot;Nearly burned&quot; and they have a shine to them that a light roast bean doesn't have, you're cooking all that oil out of the bean so that it's visible on the surface, then you grind that up and make more surface area.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I believe, at some levels powders are hydrophobic. My kratom powder will literally sit on top of the water for as long as it wants to (unless stirred). I've even seen it create pockets like the vantablack gif that hit the frontpage the other day. Shit's cool to watch but frustrating to consume. Especially if the water is cold or warm. When it's near-boiling the kratom submerges much quicker, obviously. </p></div>		</li>
