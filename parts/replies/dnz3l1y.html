<p>Untestable you say.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong some classical scientist made great advances but I reserve the right to call bunk when people like Aristotle put metaphysics before observation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer; trigonometry.</p>
<p>Long answer; Kepler had already deduced that a planet's distance to the sun share a relationship with it's orbital period.  Specifically [orbital period in years]^2 = [distance to the sun in AU]^3</p>
<p>By knowing the distance from one planet to the sun you can work out the distances between the planet's themselves at a given time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A technique uses the fact of parallax. The phenomenon that apparent position changes based on the line of sight.</p>
<p>If you look at an object, close one eye then close it and open the other the apparent position of the object has shifted.</p>
<p>Astronomy uses this on a larger scale along with some trigonometry to find the distance to the object.</p>
<p>I can go into more depth on the maths but idk what your looking for.</p>
