			<div class="markdown"><p>You have given me new hope :) I have varifocals but don't wear them because of the affect you describe. I usually only wear them for half a day or so before giving up. It's time to try again over a longer period :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Give it a try. Don't be afraid to have a rest, but do make it a fairly intensive period to allow your brain to calibrate to them. I can only say what happened with me, but it ties up with a number of other anecdotes too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also just got a pair of progressive glasses and the first day I took them home I was so upset (as they were super expensive). I am super attentive to detail and thought there was no way I would ever get used to them. I went back the next day to tell the doctor about my issues and he said not to worry and that I would get used to hem after about 2 weeks, just to wear them the entire day. </p>
<p>It’s about two weeks later now and while I am not 100% used to them I am like 90% there. I did not believe this would happen and was mentally prepared to go back and get single vision lenses. It’s amazing how the brain works.</p>
<p>Power through it! You’ll get used to them eventually. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Progressive lenses, also called multifocal lenses, progressive addition lenses (PAL), varifocal lenses, progressive power lenses, graduated prescription lenses, or progressive spectacle lenses are corrective lenses used in eyeglasses to correct presbyopia and other disorders of accommodation. They are characterised by a gradient of increasing lens power, added to the wearer's correction for the other refractive errors. The gradient starts at the wearer's distance prescription at the top of the lens and reaches a maximum addition power, or the full reading addition, at the bottom of the lens.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You persisted for two days? That's admirable! And I'm glad you got them to 'work' for you. The warping of my computer screen as I moved my head side-to-side was just too disconcerting so I gave up the very first morning and went back to using my single-prescription reading glasses.  </p>
<p>The instructions did say to put them on and leave them on, and I didn't follow that, so it is my fault that I didn't get used to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it is worth continuing. I was totally fed up with putting my glasses off and on all the time. At the end of two days I hadn't seen much change, it really did change overnight.</p></div>		</li>
