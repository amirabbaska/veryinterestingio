<p>Actually, capacitors and batteries are very similar. But the capacitor is charging and discharging all the time, while in use, thus it will worn out faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, no.</p>
<p>Capacitors don't rely on a chemical process to charge/discharge/store energy. Batteries do.</p>
<p>Batteries usually die/reduce in capacity sooner than capacitors (assuming both are decent samples). Capacitors also won't loose the amount of energy they can store over time the way batteries do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CRTs have what is known as a picture tube, its what they use to generate a lot of electron beams which are spread on the screen to make the display happen. The problem is that these picture tubes, like a lot of other tube type light emitters, need a very very high voltage to operate. We're talking several thousand volts here, for reference your mains socket is 220 volts (110 for you yanks) and even that can kill you.</p>
<p>So when we're talking about close to 4 to 5 thousand volts, its serious business. The TV itself has some sort of voltage multiplier or what is known as a step-up regulator (or a boost regulator) which generates these required high voltages.</p>
<p>The problem is that these high voltage generator circuits usually have an output smoothing capacitor, this capacitor is charged to several thousand volts and if you happen to touch such a capacitor and it isn't drained, it will discharge several thousand volts through your body. This really isn't a very pleasant experience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, capacitors are that reason. My family would always get hella nervous when my dad would open up the CRTs he would rebuild. The labeling of 'RISK OF ELECTROCUTION' made us nervous.</p>
<p>That being said, it was awesome to have 720p and 1080i in 1998.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i took a recording studio maintenance class a long time ago and the instructors demonstrated what a cap will do when it gets too much voltage (or current - i've <em>never</em> been any good with electronics or electricity). they blew up a giant capacitor by hooking it up to a whole bunch of 9 volt batteries wired in series - it sounded like a gunshot and pieces of it would have gone everywhere if they hadn't covered it with a metal strainer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my electronics lab my buddies and I hooked up a voltage generator in <del>series</del> parallel with a 10 Î¼F capacitor and kept jacking up the voltage until it finally popped. </p>
<p>You would think knowing all the theoretical EE stuff would prevent us from doing this. Luckily no one got hurt.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks /u/-Mikee. This is why my current job leverages more of the CS part of my degree. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My buddy's boss had a 32 inch TV go bad about 15 years ago. My buddy knew I liked to tinker so he got it for me free (his boss was happy to not have to pay to dispose of it). 20 minutes of googling,  a trip to radio shack for a $.50 capacitor, and 5 minutes of soldering later I had a fully functional TV. It still lives in my nephew's video game room to this day and works fine. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've got an LCD TV with bad output (a series of horizontal lines in the bottom left quadrant) and I've tried many searches over the last year or two but none that turned up any promising solution like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more likely that the edge connector has been damaged in a specific place.</p>
<p>The edge of the glass has metal traces etched into it, 1 for each row, and one for each column, with ribbon cables connecting from the circuitboard on the reverse. Sounds like one of the cables has gone bad, or the glass itself has blown some of the traces (overheated from too much current, from a failed transistor or resistor)</p></div>		</li>

<p>BUT I don't think what you're seeing is a normal symptom of bad capacitors, it may be the screen itself.</p></div>		</li>
