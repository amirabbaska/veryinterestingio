			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's what doesn't make sense to me. The gravity waves traveled a billion light years to reach us. If it followed the inverse square law, how would it be detectable?</p>
<p>Is the wave intensity the same as the normal gravitational influence exerted on Earth by the pair of black holes or is the normal influence stronger or weaker than the detected waves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wavelength roughly corresponds to the size of the interacting system. Significantly shorter wavelength would require significantly smaller objects to be detected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wavelength would be related to the changing velocity of whatever's creating the waves wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Like, with sound waves: you make the wave by vibrating an object back and forth, the faster it oscillates the shorter the wavelength, and because the object has mass, smaller objects are easier make oscillate faster.</p>
<p>Like... theoretically if you could rattle a black hole back and forth super fast you could make shorter wavelength right? It's not linked to size, but just the size of things that typically occur naturally? Is that what you meant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wavelength is equal to the speed of propagation divided by the frequency. In this case the speed is the speed of light and the frequency is determined by the frequency of the source. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am i right in thinking they can't really measure the distance, just the change in distance?</p>
<p>The change in the interference pattern of both bounced lasers lets you know something happened, but it is far from being able to tell the exact distance right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe their detectors <em>are</em> sensitive enough to measure the exact distance. You can see <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/avm_image_sqls/binaries/89/page/whitedata_strain_SNR_qscan_v11Vhigh.jpg?1506626321" target="_blank">images like this</a> and <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/image/ligo20170601d" target="_blank">like this</a> that show an upward curve. If I'm not mistaken, that curve is the amplitude, and the amplitude of the gravity waves is what they're trying to measure.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they measure the gravitational wave strain/amplitude based on the interference pattern which depends on the difference in lengths between the two LIGO arms.</p>
<p>Those curves are showing the frequency of the oscillations versus time--the amplitude is given by the colors as indicated on the right. The figures on the bottom show the amplitude vs time.</p></div>		</li>
