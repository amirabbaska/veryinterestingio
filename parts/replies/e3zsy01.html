			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic process is that they accelerate a bunch of gold atoms, that have been stripped of their electrons (so gold ions), to a very very good fraction of the speed of light.</p>
<p>They then concentrate the beams of ions using basically magnets to very small precise beams and direct them into each other, the collision packs a lot of energy into a very small amount of matter, causing a huge temperature. The ions basically melt and are obliterated and turned into the most basic components of protons and neutrons - gluons, and quarks. </p>
<p>The detectors can't directly see this, it only lasts a few trillionths of a second (maybe billionths?), and instead they detect the aftermath of the process. We have years and experimentation and theories based on the standard model of particle physics that tells us what we <em>should</em> see after a quark-gluon plasma cools down or whatever.</p>
<p>When the ions collide and break apart or &quot;melt&quot; they also release flashes of light - photons - and we <em>can</em> directly detect the photons. We can measure their energy (wavelength) and use this to determine the temperature of whatever emits them (think of a glowing ball of hot metal).</p>
<p>It's much more scientific than that, but basically that's how they do it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Though theirs cost a lot more than $10.</p></div>		</li>
