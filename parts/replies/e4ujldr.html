			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it reasonable to say then, that they are similar in feeling to menstrual cramps, but sudden and obviously much more intense?</p>
<p>Edit: because the only ones responding are salty women, let me clarify: I am also a woman. I have had been having periods since the age of ~12, and I have had cramps to the degree of being non-functional, maybe not nearly frequent enough to be considered chronic, but I <em>have</em> had period cramps where I couldn't function because of them. I was asking this because I wanted the perspective of a dude, since there is no way for me to know what my balls being punched feels like, <em>since I don't have any.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As much as this is a good question, there wouldnt be a way to find out. As a guy, I can tell you how painful it is, and how long that pain can last, but we can't both compare the pain because neither of us has the other reproductive parts.</p>
<p>We could relate it to a painful illness (shingles is hideous if you've had that) but my pain threshold may differ from yours :(</p>
<p>In any case, the pain from a kick to the testicles doesn't even have to be full contact. Just a slight graze past the very edge can be enough to cause a lot of pain. It's been a long time since I've had this pain, but I have what is called a varicocele (a testicular issue) which causes a similar pain, and it isn't sharp, more an intense &quot;dull&quot;(?) pain? It's also like a very bad belly ache higher up in your body.</p>
<p>Hope any if this helps:) and this is of course only my experience. Could be different for other men. Like periods are different for women :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the only proper answer. Hell I even register different pains very different. I was pretty awesome during labour (which hurt like fuck) but I don't do headaches very well. I rarely ever get them and the slighest headache just makes me feel miserable. I know people with frequent migraines who function sort of normally.  Holy shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do I get diagnosed with varicocle? I have a dull ache in my nuts fairly often and when I go to get it checked out they just do an ultrasound for any tumors or twisted testicle and when that comes back fine they're just like &quot;meh, see ya&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think possibly? While I've never had a nice solid punch to the balls it sounds like it makes sense<br />
Are period cramps a slow buildup which plateau or is it all at once? If its the first one you could maybe make an argument for saying ball hits are worse on average as it could be a similar situation as a frog in slowly heating water, because you can know its coming and &quot;prepare&quot;, as opposed to an instant and very painful moment which passes faster. Obviously this isn't to say that period cramps aren't painful or anything, I'm just saying that the intensity is linked to the suddenness. Something sort of interesting to note though is that even if we can scientifically answer that ball hits are more painful on average, that periods in general would still be worse as cramps are longer lasting, even when its not at its peak. Of course if its the latter, then this whole argument is done for and judging by your other responses and things I've heard, I'm certain you could easily argue that period cramps are worse on average.</p>
<p>Although as I'm a guy I don't know, and even if pain was objectively the same for everyone it wouldn't even be an easy to answer question, as not every guy's balls are the same, and not every punch will be flush and straight on into said balls; and not every woman's uterus is the same, nor does every period feels the same, so honestly this question is probably actually impossible to answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for trying! For me, it's usually the first one... On repeat. So they build up, are really bad for an amount of time, (they peak I guess) then go away. Now sometimes that peak is unbearable, consistently throughout my period. Other times it's barely noticeable. Sometimes it's back and forth between both. While I also haven't had a “normal period,” in a couple years because of the type of birth control I'm on, I did just get an IUD placed on Thursday, and the cramps during that first ~24 hour period were definitely up there, and I'm sure part of it was because I hadn't had significant amounts of cramping in such a long time that I “forgot” what they felt like. They are, however similar to what someone else mentioned in that it's a unique, lower abdomen type pain that feels (to me) sightly like being constipated... But not in the right area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been kicked very hard in the balls multiple times before and my immediate response was to basically collapse on the ground. For the first few seconds it is average pain like you have been punched but then the waves of pain come that spread all over your abdomen. They aren't specific to an area like cramps but are spread out and it's just a very dull pain everywhere. I'd say the worst pain comes 30 seconds to a minute after then slowly the waves die down and it leaves an ache that I usually have to lie down for and can last an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I read someone claiming to be kicked in the balls frequently I can never think in my mind &quot;why? How?&quot; I've never been kicked in the balls nor have any of my friends as far as I know, maybe it's a bit cultural? </p></div>		</li>
