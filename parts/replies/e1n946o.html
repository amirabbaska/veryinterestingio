			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK there hasn't been infrastructure built that can support the standards set for 4G (1Gbit/s). So if that is the case why are 2019 phones claiming to launch with 5G connections? Our LTE we have now is still a 3.xG connection.</p>
<p>What speeds can the demonstrators hit? I'm not in this field so maybe I am misunderstanding this :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't want to saturate with tech that's going to be crappy in 10 years. Makes it more expensive to upgrade. When we can just skip the middle steps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Infrastructure doesn't really matter. The fact is that 5g is demonstrably better and different enough to be considered the next generation.</p>
<p>Research/Development teams don't really care if &quot;the last one&quot; was taken up by the average consumer or company, they're just pumping out new stuff. The question is sort of like asking why Boeing made a new stealth fighter when the last one wasn't being used to its full capacity yet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a consumer, I don't care how fast my phone can talk to the tower if it's just going to bottleneck somewhere else. </p>
<p>More than that, I can already stream netflix fast enough for my little phone screen. For me, the next step is going to be tethering so I can play online games - and that's a matter of <strong><em>latency</em></strong>, not speed. I don't see any telecoms talking about latency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On another note, is my assumption correct that even if we don't have infrastructure to support 5G networks yet that a 5G attenna in my phone will greatly increase my FTP speeds in a mobile hotspot -&gt; PC connection?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those speeds that are mentioned in 4G are a theoretical maximum, meaning you're not likely to see those speeds consistently across networks and devices. Reality of it is if we even get somewhat close to it, and we are far ahead of the previous tech than it does count. I'm getting 150mbps down on T-Mobile LTE which is fantastic in my book. HSPA+ would only net me 60mbps at best, and 3G wouldn't be worth shit. Not to mention the older technologies have crazy latency. LTE brought along with it low latency connections and it works great, always getting sub 10ms response times. </p>
<p>Regardless, as others have said, just like LTE literally took years before it took off, 5G will be the same way. It'll be years before it truly takes off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow 150mbps if I'm lucky I get 35-40 from AT&amp;T LTE+ and it only lasts seconds before I drop to 10 or less :) and I believe for a high mobility device 150mbps exceeds the 4G requirement. The 1Gps was for low mobility. However there are other standards than just speed set out for what qualifies for 4G such as spread. However I have no knowledge on whether yours has the other requirements. </p>
<p>How does all this play into my FTP speed between PC and phone when I have PC on my mobile hotspot?</p></div>		</li>
