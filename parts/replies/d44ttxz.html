			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, assuming OP is using a DSLR, he should almost always shoot in RAW if he is serious about getting the best photos possible. In a RAW format, photos will almost always be the same file size.  </p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I meant roughly the same size, and it seems that each camera brand uses varying levels of compression in their RAW formats. I have a Sony A55 and almost all my RAW photos are 16.7-17.1 MB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, thanks to /u/robbak for the answer and to you for the precisation.<br />
I always shoot double Raw+Jpg and you are correct, although even in the RAW format I have some differences.  </p>
<p><strong>RAW:</strong><br />
In the <strong>daylight, short exposure ones</strong> they are around <strong>28-29 MB</strong>, while in <strong>the long exposure I get 35-38 MB.</strong>    </p>
<p><strong>Jpeg:</strong><br />
In the <strong>daylight, short exposure</strong> shots I get around <strong>9-10 MB</strong>, while in <strong>the long exposure they're 19-20MB</strong></p>
<p>Maybe even if it is uncompressed it has to do with the range of colors.<br />
A completely black picture uncompressed is more efficiently stored than an uncompressed picture where every pixel is a different color.   </p>
<p>Thank you for your answers !</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not &quot;uncompressed&quot;, they're just losslessly compressed. Like a zip file rather than a jpg. If they were literally uncompressed then you'd be right that they would all be the same size based on resolution and color depth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Huh, my long exposures (30s) are always roughly the same file size as my regular shots (16.7-17.1 MB). I guess my brand of RAW just compresses less than yours does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually am a studio photographer. RAW is unnecessary in controlled lighting situations where you're you know what you are doing. A good rule of thumb is you might want to shoot RAW if enlarging to anything greater than 16x20.</p>
<p>Look at <a href="http://photographyconcentrate.com/10-reasons-why-you-should-be-shooting-raw/" target="_blank">this article</a> explaining why to shoot RAW. A studio professional generally will not make those mistakes that RAW compensates for. And when you're shooting in studio, you preview your work onsite. There may be times where you do indeed shoot RAW.</p>
<p>Case in point, I once had a client who demanded RAW. I told him all of my work until that point was not RAW, but he demanded it for this nude shoot. I knew the format would be smaller than 8x10 so I argued for shooting JPG, but he persisted. He then wondered why he got 75% less photos than usual and I explained why. We now had a model and MUA who we had hired with two hours more of shooting time. We then went back through and deleted most of them, and shot in JPG, which he was perfectly happy with in the end.</p>
<p>A situation where I might use RAW (besides for extremely huge prints) is when I am working with another photographer or designer, who will share a <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jkost/tag/xmp-sidecar-files" target="_blank">Lightroom sidecar file</a> with me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are shooting so that no blacks are crushed and no highlights are blown out, sure. But I don't see how print size matters, even if you are doing wallet prints, the editing capabilities of RAW are very prevalent. Besides, highlight/shadow adjustments, even white balance adjustments are very helpful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because you have the title studio photographer doesn't mean you know wtf you're doing. Always shoot in raw. Always. It's a higher bit depth than JPG per color channel and thus you can make changes without destroying and damaging the image unlike editing a JPG.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is the correct answer I might add that this is not only true for Jpegs but for all compression algorithms, also the lossless ones. </p>
<p>Also I wanted to add the cause for the noise: Occasionally some electrons in the chip can be randomly excited and cause the same signal an arriving photon would have. The hotter the chip the more often this happens and the longer the exposure the hotter the chip. Therefore high end astronomical cameras cool their chips down, <a href="http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/117051/digital-camera-sensors-and-long-exposures" target="_blank">up to -55Â°C</a>, which allows them to take pictures with very long exposure times.</p></div>		</li>

I answered above. I checked and also the Raw ones have some differences, although smaller.  </p>
<p>About the random excited pixels, in Astrophotography they often do 20-30 shots and then do the median or something, to get rid of these artifacts if I'm not mistaken!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also another interesting fact about noise, it's analog.</p>
<p>In fact, the CCD is Analog.  It's much the same as analog audio.  There's a Analog-to-Digital converter, usually built on the back of the sensor which converts the signal.  Digital capture and digital signals are virtually immune to noise, we have noise in digital photos because the noise is captured in the analog sensor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Longer exposures usually are done in low ISO. That means much less noise.
There is no reason why JPG files for long exposures would take up more space. Most likely, OP is shooting different things when taking his usual shots vs. long exposures, so the other variables like subject and scene are likely controlling the file size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry mate, not true. </p>
<p>In a long exposure shot the sensor is &quot;on&quot; for longer, resulting in more noise (due to temp., mostly). You can shoot a 30 min exposure at your camera's base ISO and a 1 second exposure at the same ISO and have vastly different noise levels. Noise/grain most definitely has an impact on JPEG compression. </p>
<p>This is why many cameras come with a long exposure noise reduction mode. It's usually always on for JPEG, but has a low/med/high setting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both increased exposure time and increased ISO increase noise. ISO increases noise more.</p>
<p>If OP was comparing a short exposure during the day to a long exposure at night at the same ISO, the long exposure would have more noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it's dark. A short exposure will have more noise than a long exposure of the same scene. Longer exposure means more photons and better statistics. With less photons you have more variation from one pixel to the next. </p></div>		</li>
