			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't matter if you treat them as solid objects with some volume across which their mass is distributed, or as mostly empty volumes with all the mass in the center. The density of each atom is the same.</p>
<p>It's no different than if I have a container 1 cubic meter in size containing either 100 grams of liquid water or 100 grams of water vapor. Either way, the density of the container is 100 grams per cubic meter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but OP didn't ask about density, he asked about % empty. If you had a 1m^3 container with 100 ml of water, it would be 99.99% empty whereas the other one would be 0% empty assuming we define emptiness as sampling each cubic millimetre for water and saying the space is empty if we don't find any.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the two things that could (but ultimately don't) swing the balance in the universe's favor are neutron stars and blackholes.  </p>
<p>3e17 kg/m^3 density for neutron stars vs about 4e2kg/m^3 for hydrogen atoms.   </p>
<p>So 15+ orders of magnitudes difference.  And for black holes density does really even mean anything anymore.  </p></div>		</li>
