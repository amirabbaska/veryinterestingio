<p>How could you be listening to the phone call? If a Bluetooth device is being used for the call than it's not being used on the phone. That means there would be no back and forth possible meaning you aren't listening in on a conversation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how it works exactly, but with the bluetooth on and the phone paired, It'll just pick up the call and play it through the stereo. Many times I've gone out and informed them that they're broadcasting their call to the whole shop.</p>
<p>I think it's because I'm in a small shop. The customer is at most 8-10 meters away from the car. Possibly the car's system still thinks it should intercept and play over the hands-free system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely a conference call—the customer has dialed into the call, the call has been redirected to Bluetooth in the car, and the customer just thinks the call hasn’t started yet or there is something wrong with the conference bridge while he listens to silence on his phone waiting for the call to start. The rest of the conference call goes on without him in the mechanic’s shop.</p></div>		</li>
