			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah. I don’t live on a flood plain, so when we get flooding like that in a house it’s because the storm sewer has backed up into the house, so letting it drain out the sanitary sewer actually lets the house drain until the storm sewer gets cleared. It’s mostly basement toilets, but I’ve done it on 2nd floor toilets on a few rare, ridiculous situations</p></div>		</li>
