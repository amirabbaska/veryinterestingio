			<div class="markdown"><p>So that's why my news feed is inundated with videos. I can't stand it... they chow so much data, you can't play them in public without earphones, and almost all of them have unskippable ads halfway through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lately, at least on my iPad, they seem to have made it harder to scroll past them, as well— like the hit box for video content is extra wide. “Oh, it’s a video you’re scrolling past? Let’s full-screen that shit!” Ugh, no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not alleged. We've had Facebook reps that have come to my office (work at an ad agency) and tell us that we should use short form video as it performs better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's simply because it's recognized as video by facebook thus its algorithm gives it preference over the same content that is a still image. It puts it in front of more people. For reference, and forgive me if I'm not remembering this correctly, on any given post by a brand only like 10% of your audience will see it because FB only serves it to those people organically. Thus, the video that's just a still image on loop is a way to game the system a bit without resorting to playing for an ad on Facebook to promote. </p>
<p>Getting that ad money is what FB wants. It's like FB is saying &quot;you know, there are all these fans of yours who <em>could</em> see your content. If only you could pay to do that...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is their algorithm prefers video.  The still image in a video is being used by lazy marketers... it’s still a video so it gets better results</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the ability to turn off autoplaying videos is limited. The only way I've found is to keep it on mobile data only while Data Saver is enabled with the giant orange bar at the top.</p>
<p>I wish it was easier to find legacy versions of the app, before all this shit was implemented. </p></div>		</li>
