<p>Communicating with other healthcare providers for the purposes of your treatment doesn't require your permission. If you're my patient and I think you need surgery I'm not going to ask your permission to discuss your case with a surgeon. There's nothing in HIPAA that prevents that (it's in fact explicitly allowed).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you cite a specific section of HIPAA or precedent that supports that?</p>
<p>Because getting records from previous GP is to me 100% a patient care related disclosure that wouldnt require permission. There are disclosure consent forms that are used fairly often but AFAIK it's not a legal requirement, more of a CYA thing.</p>
<p>If a former patient's new PCP called me with a question I don't see a problem discussing their case.</p></div>		</li>
