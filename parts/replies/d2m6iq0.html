			<div class="markdown"><p>Bahaha, you're correct. I totally disregarded the spirit of this sub. My old biochem book has an image where it shows the water molecule inserting into the starch spiral. I suppose that was more of an ELI23.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wooo biochem degrees! From your post (&quot;...alpha glycosidic bonds, I believe&quot;) I'm going to guess you're not working working in the field. </p>
<p>What'd you end up doing with your degree/career?</p>
<p>I pursued further education and am now working health care administration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, nope. Definitely didn't go into biochem. I'm now a 3rd year pharmacy student that plans on going into the field of health economics/pharmaceutical industry. Interestingly enough, many people I've met in the epidemiology, population health, and health economics sectors pursued degrees in biochem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool, lots of room to make a difference in that field. A prof who was supposed to teach me is really involved in that field. Steve Morgan at UBC if you're interested.</p></div>		</li>
