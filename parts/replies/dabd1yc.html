<p>Oh, definitely--they don't last that long. A the (non-Walmart) grocery store I used to work at, the roasted chickens that weren't sold got turned into the deli's chicken salad, but certainly never placed out for sale again the next day.</p>
<p>Their sell-by time is measured in hours, not days--and as I said, sometimes they'll sell a few of them that are approaching or past their sell-by time for half off, typically (as you said) in the fridge section.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Walmart only has a few days on raw chickens. Once cooked they have a shelf life of 4 hours. Once they reach 3 hours they are pulled and put into the cooler or marked down and left to sell. Once in the cooler they have up to 4 hours to reach 41 degrees and under. Then they are labeled as cold chicken and have a 3 day shelf life. </p></div>		</li>

<p>in a related note: never ever buy the chicken pot pie from KFC. (unless you are interested in some really old chicken)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>worked in a deli. typically the raw chickens make it to the store with a use by date less than 5 days, so there is an incentive to overproduce. When cooked, they are kept only out for a few hours at a time before needing to be disposed of. This can still mean the meat gets used in other products like chicken salad, but the cooked chicken is a loss. So they are typically marked down an hour or two before their time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was just wondering about that!  So its true.  </p>
<p>So,  the chicken that is too old to be sold as-is gets handled by humans, mixed with mayo, tossed into a pan, exposed to the deli air, gets scooped out, and dropped into a plastic container that will end up sitting in the car under a hot sun for a while before being tossed into a fridge to be eaten a few hours later.</p>
<p>Not that there is anything wrong with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only keep hot cooked chicken warm for so long or it becomes disgusting dry garbage that nobody would pay anything for. So instead of losing a full $5 on chickens that don't sell quick enough, they cool them and sell them for $2.50. </p>
<p>At $2.50 they're either making next to nothing or even making a loss on the cold chicken, but that's still preferable to losing $5 on every hot chicken not sold fast enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the secret right there. It's the same as when airlines dump seats on discount last-minute ticket services, or really any other &quot;perishable&quot; commodity.  </p>
<p>They'd rather lose 50% of the revenue than 100%. That's just good business.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That $2.50 chicken would be a cheap way to make a batch of stock. You can put it in a crockpot with seasonings, the end of a celery bunch, two onion halves, and some carrots and let it go all day. It would be cheaper than buying boxed per ounce.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They'd never &quot;lose&quot; a full 5$ though. Most things are marked up quite a bit, anywhere between 50-200% so it's really the difference between losing 2.00-2.50$ (throwing the chicken away) and losing ~0$ (Selling around cost)</p></div>		</li>
