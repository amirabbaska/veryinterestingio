			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not certain that the fluid represents a physiologic defense mechanism. It may. However it's also likely that it's simply a consequence of the pathological process which formed the blister in the first place. Namely, that the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes that help hold the dermis together are destroyed in the trauma that incited the blister to form. </p>
<p>These proteins are like arms projecting out from the epithelial cells. They cause adjacent cells to stick to one another forming a coherent layer. They also prevent interstitial fluid from flowing freely through the tissue layer. The fluid pocket that forms is simply the result of the breakdown of these proteins. There are autoimmune disease that replicate this process - research the pathogensis of bullous pemphigoid for instance.</p>
<p>If you think about it, your skin when intact is a pad that protects the layers underneath it. A blister represents a dysfunction of that process. It's weaker than your skin and does a much worse job of
protecting deep tissue layers. This is because it's pathologic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally you should avoid popping a blister, as tempting as it is. It'll heal much faster with less chance of scarring/callouses. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Burnt both my hands with flames. One hand is badly scarred and one isn't. The scarred hand had the skin wiped off immediately and the other filled with fluid and was allowed to go down naturally until outer skin turned hard and flaked off like a scab eventually does</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the blister pops, then it can be prone to infection, and there is now an entry point for bacteria to enter. Ideally they should be left, but as long as you stop the activity that formed the blister, and maybe put some antiseptic cream on it, it should be fine if popped.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. But if you get blisters on your feet and still keep on walking without putting bandages or anything they will eventually rupture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ran cross country in high school and would get blisters constantly. I didn't have time to let it heal. Whenever I got one I'd lance it with a needle and drain it. I didn't do anything else to it because I had no time to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That question is often debated, when I went through the US army Ranger school,  everyone would encounter new blisters every day with how wet and how far your walking. They checked your feet 2-3 times a day for this very reason to be proactive. Even the medics were inconsistent with what they said about blisters. So you can do either one, but I'd say the slight majority agreed popping the blister was the best option, cutting off the dead skin, and applying moleskin around the edges of the blister, but not covering it. This helped prevent future friction, but allowed air to get to the blister to heal faster,  and ultimate your feet will callasce faster (good thing) </p></div>		</li>
