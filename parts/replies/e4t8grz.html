			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, using similar principles as photonic crystals: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic_crystal" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic\_crystal" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photonic\_crystal</a></a><br />
Another way would be to find a material that reflects the frequency band you are interested in then make it nano-structured to reflect (or in this case scatter) the light internally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is the problem of making it durable, too. As soon as you put a coating like resin on VB, it loses its capabilities </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vertical orientation of the nanotubes is to minimize reflected light. The high absorption isn't from trapped light, it's actually a property of carbon nanotubes.</p>
<p>I explain this further in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9a6s20/how_does_vanta_black_work_when_it_comes_to/e4tsd16/" target="_blank">this comment</a>.</p></div>		</li>
