			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it be possible that the baby has a preference for the foods their mother ate, not because she ate them during her pregnancy/while breastfeeding, but because the preference for those flavors are partially genetic? So the mother would be eating those foods, because she is genetically predisposed towards liking those foods, which is then potentially passed on to you.</p>
<p>For example, if a mother often eats a food she doesn't like during a pregnancy, is the baby still as likely to prefer it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some cases that may be part of it, but in  some studies  a number of pregnant or breastfeeding women were randomly assigned to eat a specific food, or to a control group (Carrot juice was used in one I read about). And consistently, when the babies started eating solids, they preferred the food their mother was assigned to eat. And it's pretty improbable they somehow managed to consistently assign  the specific food to women who already had a genetic preference for the food</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The research that leads people to conclude that babies like what their moms ate during pregnancy is experimental, not correlational. E.g. one of the most famous ones (because it was first) is Julie Mennella's 2001 study on babies who were prenatally exposed to carrot juice. Moms were randomly assigned to drink carrot juice during pregnancy, lactation, or neither. 4 weeks after babies started getting solid foods they got baby cereal mixed with carrot juice and their reactions were recorded. Babies who had been exposed to carrot juice prenatally or during lactation both liked the carrot juice cereal better than the control group babies. </p>
<p>Because it was randomly assigned, it is probably not just that the moms who were randomly assigned carrot juice were just really into carrot juice. </p>

<p>Since 2001, other studies have reported similar findings and this is also consistent with research using animal models (mostly pigs). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wheher or not you like foods is often due to exposure. Thats why we say certain foods have an acquired taste. </p>
<p>Thats also why some people of one nationality can be born and raised by a family of a different nationality in a different country, and will be partial to the foods of where they grow up, rather than from the culture where they are from. </p>
<p>But there are also genetic preferences for certain foods as well. Some things like coriander can have a really soapy taste for some people.</p>
<p>A strong distaste for foods can arise from overconsumption. It is conceivable that your distaste would come from over exposure in the womb, but I would have thought the flavour wouldn't be experienced by a developing baby.</p>
<p>Generally speaking though exposure to given foods, in moderation, makes people like them. Our taste is highly adaptable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a genetic component to the distaste of certain vegetables such as broccoli, brussel sprouts, and spinach.  From what I have read, there were certain regions that put a selection pressure to avoid those vegetables, due to high alkali content in the soil.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>I'm thinking about evolutionary benefits to that. I'd assume if for some reason you got displaced, or your environment around you changed, your diet may suddenly change. It may change to something less preferable, and so in the short-term the poor taste would encourage you to find your regular food. But in the long-term, if you're not able to find that regular food, it's beneficial to be able to tolerate it. Maybe it's beneficial to even enjoy it if it lacks as many nutrients as your preferred food, so you eat more, since over time you have started to lack particular nutrients. And also stemming from that, if you overeat on a particular food, then you'd be getting excess nutrients provided by it, so your taste will come to be averse to it.</p>
<p>Any merit to my speculation, or am I far off and there are other more accepted hypotheses?</p></div>		</li>
