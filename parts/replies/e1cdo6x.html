			<div class="markdown"><p>So to be clear, you are saying that live viruses will produce lifelong immunity while non-live will not? I don't personally know any adults that keep up with their booster shots. If so many adults are no longer immune to certain diseases, would that not cause outbreaks? I have heard this point argued and am not sure what to make of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The common non-live vaccines are diptheria, pertussis, and pertussis.  Immunity to those is fleeting. Not everyone loses protection but most do over time, 5-10 years or so.  </p>
<p>Tetanus can be treated by giving tetanus anti-toxin if you are not current on your vaccinations.  Diptheria and pertussis are seldom fatal in adults.  Un-immune adults do provide a reservoir for infections that can be spread to others, including those that are too young to be vaccinated (first 2 months of life) or are immunocompromised  and unable to respond to vaccines.</p>
<p>Every year in the hospital we get a less than 2 month old child that dies of pertussis.  They essentially cough themselves to death.</p></div>		</li>
