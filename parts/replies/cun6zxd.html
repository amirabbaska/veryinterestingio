<p>I'd double check your results, that sounds extremely unlikely. 99.9% probability is reached with only 70 people and you've got almost twice that number. Since your only match was an exact match (including the year) I'm guessing you are automatically sorting the data, check the sort isn't doing it by birthdate because that will put matching birthdays on opposite ends of the table, making it hard to identify. </p></div>		</li>
