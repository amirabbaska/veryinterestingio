			<p>Remember, same birthday here <em>only</em> means same day and month, not the same year of birth.</p>		</li>

			<p>One issue with testing this in the real world is that birthdays aren't evenly spaced out through the year.  <br><a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/SFJu7Iz" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/gallery/SFJu7Iz</a>  <br>Although, you did find some outside the main cluster. So there's that</p>		</li>

			<p>That actually makes it slightly more likely that there will be two people with the same birthday. Though not much more likely, because the variance isn't all that large.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Even if there was one large room there would only be one match.<br><br>I'd double check your results, that sounds extremely unlikely. 99.9% probability is reached with only 70 people and you've got almost twice that number. Since your only match was an exact match (including the year) I'm guessing you are automatically sorting the data, check the sort isn't doing it by birthdate because that will put matching birthdays on opposite ends of the table, making it hard to identify. </p>		</li>

			<p>that is exactly what made me check my numbers - year of birth was included in the original numbers. I stupidly changed just the formatting of the numbers rather than the actual number. Please see update above. </p>		</li>
