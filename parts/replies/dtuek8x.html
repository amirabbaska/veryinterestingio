			<div class="markdown"><p>Old English is <em>completely fucking bonkers</em>, from a modern perspective, but that's what happens when you try to look at centuries and centuries of changes all at once, and I say this while having a fondness for the language. It's a bit like looking at an F1 racer or supercar concept in order to understand the horse-and-buggy, and trying to pinpoint exactly when the horse was no longer needed.</p></div>		</li>
