			<div class="markdown"><p>By the time planets (solid objects you could stand on) had formed, the background radiation had already expanded and cooled below the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Space was already &quot;dark&quot; before the first planets formed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first planets would have been mostly hydrogen.  A surface to stand on requires heavier elements like iron.  The first rocky planets or asteroids wouldn't have formed until after the first supernovas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this answer.  I've never considered what the universe was like at that time.  Imagining space slowly cooling down and the colour of space changing over time.  That's mind blowing imagery.  Wow!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add some more detail:</p>
<p>•<strong>The Dark Ages</strong>: There was a period that lasted from ~300,000 years after the Big Bang to ~150M years after the Big Bang called &quot;the Dark Ages&quot;</p>
<p>This is the period after the formation of the first neutral atoms and before the formation of the first light-emitting stellar objects (such as active black holes and stars).</p>
<p>Space had become transparent to photons from the earlier hotter period of the Universe when neutral atoms formed, but those photons had already red-shifted below the visible range. No stars had yet formed to give off light. With only very diffuse matter remaining, activity in the universe has tailed off dramatically, with very low energy levels and very large time scales. Little of note happens during this period, and the universe is dominated by “dark matter”.</p>
<p>•<strong>The Reionization Period</strong>: During the period from ~150M year after the Big Bang to ~1B years after the Big Bang we see the formation of the first quasars.</p>
<p>The first quasars(supermassive black holes actively absorbing new material) form from gravitational collapse, and the intense radiation they emit reionizes the surrounding universe, the second of two major phase changes of hydrogen gas in the universe. From this point on, most of the universe goes from being neutral back to being composed of ionized plasma. Thus this period is referred to as the &quot;Reionization period&quot;</p>
<p>•<strong>The first Stars and Galaxies</strong>: It is in the middle of the &quot;Reionization period&quot;, around 300 - 500 million years after the Big Bang, that we see the very first stars and galaxies forming</p>
<p>Gravity amplifies slight irregularities in the density of the primordial gas and pockets of gas become more and more dense, even as the universe continues to expand rapidly. These small, dense clouds of cosmic gas start to collapse under their own gravity, becoming hot enough to trigger nuclear fusion reactions between hydrogen atoms, creating the very first stars.</p>
<p>The first stars are short-lived supermassive stars, a hundred or so times the mass of our Sun, known as Population III (or “metal-free”) stars. Eventually Population II and then Population I stars also begin to form from the material from previous rounds of star-making. Larger stars burn out quickly and explode in massive supernova events, their ashes going to form subsequent generations of stars. Large volumes of matter collapse to form galaxies and gravitational attraction pulls galaxies towards each other to form groups, clusters and superclusters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where exactly did black holes in the Reionization Period come from if stars had not formed yet? It would be my intuition that since the universe is mostly hydrogen at this point, masses of matter would undergo nuclear fusion long before collapsing into black holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the sun covers 0.000546% of the sky (wikipedia), then the intensity just after recombination would be 1/16 <em> 1/0.00000546 ≈ 11,500 times the intensity of sunlight at the equator at noon? (~16</em>10^6 W/m^2 ) (I was never good at optics)</p></div>		</li>
