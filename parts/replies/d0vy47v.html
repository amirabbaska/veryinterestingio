			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a look at <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RtsWWrI.jpg" target="_blank">figure 3 from the paper</a>, where they show the various types of knots they observed and label the sequence of kinks needed to obtain them. Even though the final knots may look pretty complicated, if you look at it more closely you can work out how they can form after just a few simple rearrangements of the kind I described above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to be careful when throwing around concepts like entropy in such situations, because it's easy for our intuition to mislead us. For example, in this specific example, entropy <em>is</em> part of the answer, but in a way that is not as simple as the often-quoted explanation that &quot;there are more ways for the string to be tangled than untangled.&quot; </p>
<p>The problem with that statement is that it's very wishy-washy. First of all, it's not true that there is just &quot;one way&quot; for a string to be unknotted. In reality when looking at all the possible microstates there are a lot of ways the string can bend and twist without forming one single knot. In addition, when the string becomes knotted it does so in <em>one particular way.</em> In fact, if the knot is large, it will actually impose a large entropic cost by preventing the string from being able to freely wiggle around in that area, <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.5134v1.pdf" target="_blank">as discussed in this paper</a>.</p>
<p>The best way to bring entropy in is by saying that knotting is often effectively irreversible. Because in a closed system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics" target="_blank">a spontaneous process must lead to an increase in entropy</a>, we can say that the total entropy of the system must increase. <strong>To put it more simply, strings have a tendency to be in a tangled state because it's easy for them to become tangled up but much harder to disentangle on their own.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, that sort of reasoning is counterproductive when we're talking about probabilities, and leads to people believing in weird paradoxes.</p>
<p>The different states have very different probabilities, and something like this: <a href="https://itsknotart.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/torus-011.jpg" target="_blank">https://itsknotart.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/torus-011.jpg</a> is not as likely as an untangled strand, even if we want to gloss over the fact that a strand's length, diameter, and stiffness all play a factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A figure 8 is just an overhand knot with an extra half turn before putting the end through. It's really simple! All the step-by-step instructions insist on showing it in a more complicated way, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/0CnYmY_B938?t=20s" target="_blank">This video</a> does an okay job of showing it. At step 2, if you put the loose end through the first hoop instead of turning that first hoop over, you'll have a normal overhand knot. The extra turn that they give the hoop in step 2 before putting the loose end through the hoop is what makes it a figure-8.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, the cable tangles but the knots only tighten when we pull in the cable to try to untangle them. So in a sense, we make it worse by trying to make it better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cross stitch for a hobby, and this happens <em>a lot</em> during the process. I've learned to take it easy and look at the knot instead of just pull the thread. Usually there's a point in the knot that can be pulled and dissolve said knot instantly, since the thread got there by itself, instead of pulling and making it worse. </p>
<p>Since then, I've applied this knowledge for most things that seem to self-knot: computer cables, electric wires, even clothing accessories. If it did it itself, don't pull the ends. Go to the knot and figure out how it got there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case it suggests an alternative solution to the problem. Rather than trying to prevent the cord from being tangled or spending time untangling it, being more careful when removing the cord from wherever you kept it might prevent the loose tangles from becoming knots.</p></div>		</li>
