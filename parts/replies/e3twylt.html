			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, not my specialty (and I doubt I usually make this distinction), but this <a href="http://cst.ufl.edu/taste-vs-flavor-whats-the-difference.html" target="_blank">UFL webpage of food scientists</a> (and <a href="https://bigthink.com/videos/the-difference-between-taste-and-flavor" target="_blank">others</a> including wikipedia) differentiate between the words:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste" target="_blank"><strong>Taste</strong></a> refers strictly to the sense that happens from your taste buds in your mouth (mostly on your tongue but also soft palette, cheek) and detect the basic tastes (salty, sour, bitter, sweet or umami).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor" target="_blank"><strong>Flavor</strong></a> is the overall sensory impression of the food that combines both taste and aroma (how it smells).</li>
