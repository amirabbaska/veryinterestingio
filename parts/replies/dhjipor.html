			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more the other way around: it's a crystal, whose defects (vacancies or interstitials, i.e. missing or additional atoms in the crystal lattice) Bose-condense and form a superfluid. The flow of that superfluid (which is a small fraction of the total matter--most will still be crystalline) has zero viscosity.</p></div>		</li>
