			<div class="markdown"><p>In all honesty I'm not sure many countries talk about or to soldiers the same way American's do.</p>
<p>We have memorials for war dead in the UK, and whilst we're a lot less concerned about the Nazi implications than Germany, it's definitely about honoring victims of war. Not soldiers.
You're unlikely to hear someone thanking an active soldier for their service.
We don't tend to have all those bumper stickers and 'support our troops' sort of things.
I think active members can use their military ID to get discounts or free entry into some places but yeah by and large, it's a dangerous job they signed up for and are in turn compensated for.
Soldiers and conflict in general are not glorified.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the misunderstandings American's have about things like this is the completely different way they treat their soliders and armed forces in general. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If funny about how perceptions differ, I was looking at the way Germans treat their military and thinking &quot;That's a million miles away from here in the UK.&quot; </p>
<p>Obviously I don't think we worship our military in the way that it seems like America does, but I think it's massively taboo here to have an opinion other than 'our braves boys'. The jingoism around the help for heroes campaign or the poppies means that if you are to question those things at best you'll be written off as a 'bleeding heart lefty liberal loon' and at worst physically intimidated. </p>
<p>I'd also have said that our war memorials and memorial services are very much about honouring our soldiers rather than the victims of war. I wonder if the difference in opinion is indicative of localised differences? I'm up north and grew up in a pretty working class area so maybe that affects what I see? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I live in another context since all my friends are studying at a rather left winged university, but just to tell you a bit about what can be said about the military in Germany: we have a left winged party wanting to end all military engagement and basically get rid off the entire army. Most people oppose that, but I've honestly never heard an argument that we should be proud of them or that this isn't fair towards those brave people. (In general, most people still oppose the idea of being proud of Germany in general). </p>
<p>My grandmothers sister had a son in the military and wanted him to stay there. Not because of honor or anything similar, but because of the good salary, an early retention and 'as soon as you got promoted a few times you don't have to leave the country anyways'.</p>
<p>Some of my friends think of the military as ethical wrong, soldiers are often referred to as people getting a ridiculous amount of money or being dumb. The discussion in the media covers three topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>the army only having 'broken' rifles or helicopters etc and similar things (new equipment being inefficient and expensive)</li>
<li>Neonazis (I hope that term is used international?) as part of the military. I don't know how many we have, but it is seen as a big problem.</li>
<li>Violence and abuse among soldiers, often with women as victims
Basically, we are criticising 'our brave men' always when speaking about them. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. Culturally, there's a lot more going on about honouring the dead and honouring soldiers in the UK. The whole British Legion and Poppy appeal thing are a big deal and even the fact that there's always a minute of silence on Remembrance Day (or the fact that there even is one) are signs that this is part of the culture. It's not <em>that</em> weird if kids are in the TA, there are tons of documentaries on TV about British soldiers past and present and how awesome the British military is and was (thinking of that recent BBC programme for example about tankers in WW1 or the on where they had D-Day vets tell their stories etc.).</p>
<p>It's very different in Germany. We don't do anything on the 11th of November at all, and while we <em>do</em> have a &quot;Volkstrauertag&quot; (people's day of mourning) literally nobody you'd meet in Germany could tell you when it is and they might even be surprised it's actually a thing. You will <em>never</em> see flowers or anything at a war memorial, and very rarely you might see a candle or something. WW2 does come up often in media but everyone is always very careful to show the bad sides of war, the war crimes, the atrocities, and not really any honouring of anybody except the victims.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oh localised differences for sure.
I used to visit a friend who lived near a military base and the feeling there towards soliders was massively different.
The guys on the army base might not have been from the area but the locals knew them and they were a lot closer to it when some of them didn't come back. </p>
<p>I've always felt our memorials were about remembering. They obviously honor soldiers but my personal feelings have always been the larger focus was on remembrance to avoid repeating it. Not glorifying and glossing over the awfulness of the current conflicts. </p>
<p>But if you come from an area where a lot of the younger generation are directly involved I can understand why you'd feel differently. And why those memorials and services are more about those actively serving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an American, it makes me sad to think that in this and in previous political climates, people would probably see honoring victims of war or as something negative or unpatriotic.  The only exception I can think of is holocaust victims and there are some in this country who disagree with that too. Really, saying anything about veterans or soldiers serving that isn't supportive is a pretty quick way to get booed out of a room, almost no matter the context.  If you have anything less than positive to express on the subject, you hate America.  This was even more so the feeling in the days after 9/11.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,  though there's a serious, constant demand for respect from the general public and big memorials and such, a number of our veterans are homeless or fighting mental illness or unable to get the medical/financial/social support they need, despite our military budget significantly dwarfing the amount we spend on anything else.</p>
<p>And that's kind of the tip of the iceberg when it comes to American attitudes about the military and war.  </p>
<p>I feel it's all pretty messed up, and that Germany's way of looking at war is significantly healthier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The core of the problem is the amount of the type of victims. Since the civil war there is a next to no civil victims for America. That's one of the things why 9/11 with it's 2k dead came as such a shock. For Germans over 80 a day with only two thousand civilians dead was lucky day of bombing.
I know it's sounds disrespectful but if you take away pearl Harbor and 9/11 in the last hundred years in America's wars there are almost exclusively soldiers dying. Every else it's mostly civilians hence less honoring of soldiers and more of all the victims. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People seem to assume if you're not 100% positive the entire time then you don't care.</p>
<p>I can appreciate the work, the job and the people doing it whilst still having negative feelings about the whole 'war' and 'loads of people dying' thing.</p>
<p>It does annoy me people only seem to care about the troops when they send them off, and when they come back dead. Anything in between is just ignored and left to struggle. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe not the same way, but I do feel that most countries attach a host of patriotic... attributes(?) to their military, and understandably so. The US may be an outlier on one end, but Germany is certainly one on the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I've never really seen that. But I guess that just proves the point in a way... the armed forces are doing this for themselves, but it's not really in the news or in public perception much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less than fifty german soldiers died during the Afghanistan war so whenever one did die it was newsworthy. In the case of your video where four soldiers died, that was kind of a big deal at the time.</p></div>		</li>
