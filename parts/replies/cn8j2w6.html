			<div class="markdown"><p>are there any adverse effects for a plant which stores an abundance of starch?  (strain on structural or vascular systems, etc?)  Or is it like a savings account for them, where having more stored (&quot;fat&quot;) is only positive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps the only downside would be that animals would be more likely to eat them to use the starch. But plants have known this for millions of years; why do you think they make sweet fruits around their seeds? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Plants can collect so much fruit or grain that they fall over. In rice and wheat, that's referred to as &quot;lodging.&quot; There are many causes to lodging, and hybridizing has improved the ability of these crops to withstand wind by increasing stiffness, but ultimately high-producing cultivars are still more susceptible to lodging.</p>
<p>The same thing could also be true of a fruit tree, just to give an example. If you were to have a particularly bountiful year and a given apple tree were to be laden with fruit and it collapsed during a wind storm, would it be attributed to the mass of the fruit? The wind storm? Insufficient pruning?</p>
<p>So, while not directly attributable to physiological effects of carbohydrate storage, accumulating too much fruit or grain could ultimately cause the plant to fail, i.e.: collapse, die, or otherwise drop its fruit or grain so that it could not reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There may be a more closely analogous example for plants getting fat than their storage of carbohydrates like starch. As you pointed out, plants and humans both store carbohydrates, we use glycogen while plants use a starch is a great example of this. </p>
<p>Plants also store fat, the same as we store fat in adipose tissue. Indeed, plants store lipids for many of the same reasons that we do, including the energy density, insulating properties, and duration of stability. Also, much like humans, there are reasons why carbohydrates would stop being stored and fats would begin being stored instead; specific metabolic requirements and indications of a requirement for long-term storage (in humans, long periods of inactivity with abundant calories).</p>
<p>For an example of a plant getting fat, we can look at <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.22807/abstract;jsessionid=7D86E4C15CF27D363D4A362A609F1F33.f04t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false" target="_blank">starch inhibited mutants</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We discovered that a dramatic increase in neutral lipid content and the neutral lipid/total lipid ratio occurred among the mutants under high light and nitrogen starvation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specific conditions can induce particular varieties of plants to overproduce lipid <em>in relation to stored starch</em>. We could compare this to a person with an over abundance of adipose because they do not regularly use and cycle glycogen stores. When the organism senses that carbohydrate storage is or will be inefficient, biological pathways are opened to facilitate long-term storage of high energy molecules. Indeed, we might remark that this plant 'has become fat' after a period of time, in the same way we would as humans, because:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, some growth impairment was observed in the low starch and starchless mutants, possibly due to altered energy partitioning in PSII, with more excitation energy dissipated as heat and less to photochemical conversion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The high-lipid storage individuals express physical deformations, as well as growth deficiencies. The plant suffers from an imbalance in the lipid/carbohydrate storage balance, several mechanisms are proposed for why this damage occurs.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: plants store fat as well, but I may have taken this question too literally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. How do you explain (using similar analogies) the processes that produce fatty fruits &amp; seeds? I'm thinking of Avocados, Walnuts, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That has to do with the energy density of the molecule stored. fat/oil gives ~9 cal per gram and carbs give ~4 cal per gram. So for a seed to start off with as much energy as it possibly can, with a limited amount of space, its much better to start off with a fat within the seed, rather than a carb. As for an analogy . . . maybe filling your car up with low octane vs. high octane gas, where the high octane will give much better performance, while at a higher cost, and the low octane will give less performance, at a cheaper and easier cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please keep in mind octane has nothing to do with energy density, also cars not designed to use high octane fuel will not benefit from them.  </p>
<p>A better car analogy night be Ethenol vs normal petrol (gas) , where Ethenol fuels are usually cheaper but have a lower caloric content.  Interestingly Ethenol is produced from starchy plant tissue </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A seed only needs enough stored energy to get the first leaf out and going.</p>
<p>After this, the plant then uses older leaves as &quot;carbon sources&quot;, i.e. leaves that can photosynthesize, while putting energy into making new leaves or growth &quot;carbon sink&quot;. </p>
<p>Then we get plants who have adapted seeds to only grow at certain conditions (temperature, moisture, etc) or novel ways to get seeds shifted (chillies are a great example). All the plant wants is to be put in an environment it can grow in without competition from other plants... Especially the parent, and is why a lot of plants evolved cool seed dispersion tactics. </p></div>		</li>
