			<p>While there is some breading, Apples have been cloned alot. Thats the only reason everyone in the US can get a granny-smith. If you plant the seeds from one apple, the resulting trees will be different.<br>  <br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_Smith" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_Smith</a><br><br>&gt; However, apples are genetic hybrids that produce new genetic variations in their seedlings. Because the Granny Smith is a chance (and rare) mutation, the seeds of the apple when grown tend to produce a tart green apple with a much less appealing taste. To preserve the exact genetic variation cutting and grafting are required. Thus, like the Navel orange and the Cavendish banana, all the Granny Smith apples grown today are cuttings from the original Smith tree in Sydney. <br>  <br>So 100% apples are far better than wild ones. But, they're simply clones of what could be naturally produced in the wild.</p>		</li>

			<p>yes.  I talked to a grower at the Santa Monica farmer's market and their produce was distinctively more flavorful (not necessarily sweeter, but it just tasted more like the fruit itself if that makes sense).  They said that they grew their orchard in a distressed manner, meaning that they watered it very little but that the land had a decent water table and this forced the trees to get their water from deep down in the earth.  The fruit are smaller and fewer but of more intense quality.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is generally true if you compare wild strawberies to cultivates one found in shop. however if you were to use same dirt and nutrients to grow both and restrain from using pesticide and other similar &quot;Shelf-life&quot; exptending chemicals you would find that the tastes do not idffere that much. the &quot;fake&quot; tastes from strawberries are induced by cultivation and not genetical breeding.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's actually the opposite:    <br><br> Animals eat fruit and defecate tree seeds contained within. They are more likely to choose sweeter fruit, so fruits are generally sweet.

			<p>Yup. Plants can collect so much fruit or grain that they fall over. In rice and wheat, that's referred to as &quot;lodging.&quot; There are many causes to lodging, and hybridizing has improved the ability of these crops to withstand wind by increasing stiffness, but ultimately high-producing cultivars are still more susceptible to lodging.<br><br>The same thing could also be true of a fruit tree, just to give an example. If you were to have a particularly bountiful year and a given apple tree were to be laden with fruit and it collapsed during a wind storm, would it be attributed to the mass of the fruit? The wind storm? Insufficient pruning?<br><br>So, while not directly attributable to physiological effects of carbohydrate storage, accumulating too much fruit or grain could ultimately cause the plant to fail, i.e.: collapse, die, or otherwise drop its fruit or grain so that it could not reproduce.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm interested in a response to this. Would a fruit bearing plant that had a large starch reserve produce a sweeter or more bitter fruit? Or are the sugar/energy reserves independent of the greater system, unlike say eating an animal by-product like foie gras that was purposefully fattened. </p>		</li>

			<p>Mostly unrelated.<br><br>Sweetness of a fruit is usually related to how much of the carbohydrates in the fruit are sugars vs how much are starches.<br><br>Plants build up starch reserves in fruit as an incentive for animals to eat it and, hopefully, transport the seeds some distance away. But if an animal eats the fruit before the seeds are ready then it's a waste.<br><br>So plants keep the carbohydrates in fruit locked up as starches until the seeds are mature. Then they release enzymes to break the starches down into sugars and the fruit becomes sweet. This breakdown of starches also helps to soften the fruit and make it easier to eat.<br><br>Often there are unpalatable chemicals like tannins in the fruit as well, which also break down when the fruit becomes ripe.<br><br>Exactly how much starch breaks down into sugar and how much of the unpalatable chemicals leave is dependent on genetics. The varieties of fruit we cultivate have been selected to maximize these traits. Wild fruits have tons of variation, and even plants of the same species growing under identical conditions can have very different tasting fruit.</p>		</li>

			<p>So in this sense, a perennial plant that had a larger starch store would have a better chance of surviving drought/winter and potentially have a more kickstarted spring season the following year? </p>		</li>

			<p>Just about. Perennial and annual plants of the same type (i.e., perennial bunch-grasses (<em>Pseudoroegneria spicata</em>) vs. winter annual grasses (<em>Bromus tectorum</em>) have different reproductive/survival strategies: perennial's invest a greater amount of resources into somatic tissues (roots, stem, leaves) than annual counterparts; annuals invest a greater amount of resources into making seeds. Perennials often also have more seed dormancy than annual competitors.<br><br>For example, bluebunch wheatgrass may produce 10 seeds per plant per year, but may live for 5-6 years. It's total lifetime reproductive output might be similar to cheatgrass, but cheatgrass may produce 50 seeds per generation in the same environmental conditions.<br><br>Winter annuals germinate in the fall, go dormant (usually) over the winter, and then really take off in the spring (your 'kickstarting' notion). Perennials often go dormant during late summer, 'wake up' with rain and cooler temperatures in the fall, and also get going fast in the spring. So, generally, the survival value of storing energy in the somatic tissues of the plant are more about long-term reproductive strategy than overwintering. Many perennial grasses in the American West are, on the other hand, <em>very</em> drought resistant for some of the reasons you mention (stored energy, ability to go dormant, and also highly dormant seeds).<br><br>More on annual vs. perennial plants can be found <a href="http://www.livescience.com/33266-whats-the-difference-between-annual-and-perennial-flowers.html" target="_blank">at this link</a>, although it is more interested in flowers for landscaping than ecology or biological principles :)</p>		</li>

			<p>It would be able to produce a LARGER fruit, or MORE fruit, but the composition of the fruit would be largely unaltered. The plant isn't just going to throw extra sugar in a fruit when that fruit's composition has been fine tuned by evolution, and an extra sweet fruit would not spread seeds as effectively. We &quot;civilized&quot; humans may have a sweet tooth but animals do not, they are after nutrients of which sugar is only one and the complex organic molecules from fruit are more important. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ok, so when plants are deprived of nutrients/energy they make lower quality fruit. This does not mean though that with an excess of nutrients/energy they can continue to make progressively higher and higher quality fruit. No, there is an ideal quality, and with excess nutrients they will simply make more or larger fruits.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Lycopodium" target="_blank">Lycopodium</a>
			<p>Right, in general there is an ideal quality and excess won't continue to improve fruit quality beyond a certain point. I just wanted to point out that fruit composition can be altered meaningfully outside the &quot;evolutionary ideal&quot;. Stress, nitrogen, pollination success, water, temp, sunlight,  etc can affect fruit size, number, and composition.  </p>		</li>

			<p>There may be a more closely analogous example for plants getting fat than their storage of carbohydrates like starch. As you pointed out, plants and humans both store carbohydrates, we use glycogen while plants use a starch is a great example of this. <br><br>Plants also store fat, the same as we store fat in adipose tissue. Indeed, plants store lipids for many of the same reasons that we do, including the energy density, insulating properties, and duration of stability. Also, much like humans, there are reasons why carbohydrates would stop being stored and fats would begin being stored instead; specific metabolic requirements and indications of a requirement for long-term storage (in humans, long periods of inactivity with abundant calories).<br><br>For an example of a plant getting fat, we can look at <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.22807/abstract;jsessionid=7D86E4C15CF27D363D4A362A609F1F33.f04t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;amp;userIsAuthenticated=false" target="_blank">starch inhibited mutants</a>:<br><br>&gt;We discovered that a dramatic increase in neutral lipid content and the neutral lipid/total lipid ratio occurred among the mutants under high light and nitrogen starvation<br><br>Specific conditions can induce particular varieties of plants to overproduce lipid <em>in relation to stored starch</em>. We could compare this to a person with an over abundance of adipose because they do not regularly use and cycle glycogen stores. When the organism senses that carbohydrate storage is or will be inefficient, biological pathways are opened to facilitate long-term storage of high energy molecules. Indeed, we might remark that this plant 'has become fat' after a period of time, in the same way we would as humans, because:<br><br>&gt;However, some growth impairment was observed in the low starch and starchless mutants, possibly due to altered energy partitioning in PSII, with more excitation energy dissipated as heat and less to photochemical conversion.<br><br>The high-lipid storage individuals express physical deformations, as well as growth deficiencies. The plant suffers from an imbalance in the lipid/carbohydrate storage balance, several mechanisms are proposed for why this damage occurs.<br><br><strong>tl;dr</strong>: plants store fat as well, but I may have taken this question too literally.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>That has to do with the energy density of the molecule stored. fat/oil gives ~9 cal per gram and carbs give ~4 cal per gram. So for a seed to start off with as much energy as it possibly can, with a limited amount of space, its much better to start off with a fat within the seed, rather than a carb. As for an analogy . . . maybe filling your car up with low octane vs. high octane gas, where the high octane will give much better performance, while at a higher cost, and the low octane will give less performance, at a cheaper and easier cost.</p>		</li>

			<p>A seed only needs enough stored energy to get the first leaf out and going.<br><br>After this, the plant then uses older leaves as &quot;carbon sources&quot;, i.e. leaves that can photosynthesize, while putting energy into making new leaves or growth &quot;carbon sink&quot;. <br><br>Then we get plants who have adapted seeds to only grow at certain conditions (temperature, moisture, etc) or novel ways to get seeds shifted (chillies are a great example). All the plant wants is to be put in an environment it can grow in without competition from other plants... Especially the parent, and is why a lot of plants evolved cool seed dispersion tactics. <br></p>		</li>
