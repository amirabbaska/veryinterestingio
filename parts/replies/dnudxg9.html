<p>While immunology at med school was a topic that was beyond my apprehension, I learned a coyple things.</p>
<p>Basically, the organism has 2 types of immune reaponse. Nonspecific response just latches to suspected cells and destroys them. Specific response ia response to stimuli the organism knows. For cancers, that are basically cells with degenerated dna, they change rapidly so it is hard for our bodies to work a pattern which it should catch and deatroy.</p>
<p>Also interesting to note is that we have thousands of cancer cells being created in our bodies each day. Dna repairs and immune system weed them out, though. </p></div>		</li>
