			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense to me that humans, being the top of the food chain, would have noisy offspring. I heard humans have an instinctual reaction the sound of a baby crying, that basically tells us that &quot;something is wrong and you must do something to fix it&quot;. It's why we get so agitated when we hear a baby crying when we can't do anything about it. So we don't need to be right on top of our babies all the time; they tell us when something is wrong.</p>
<p>But also, while individual babies are helpless, they also tend to be around other humans, and since humans in groups are fucking dangerous, it's a warning to any wannabe man-eaters. It's like an alarm klaxon blaring:&quot;Danger! Humans are near!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This does not explain why babies cry. While true it only states the fact that is not (or less) dangerous for human babies to cry as opposed as it may be for other animals.</p></div>		</li>
