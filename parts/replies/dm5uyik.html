			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I can't resist. There are only 4 epithelial layers of the skin, except in 'thick' skin, which has an extra layer called the stratum lucidum. Thick skin is only found on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Then there is the dermis, which itself has two layers. </p>
<p>Nails are just cells that have a whole lot of keratin in them. Skin cells will normally begin their life in the first layer of skin attached to the dermis, the stratum basal. As they rise, they begin to die, since the epidermis is avascular. As they die, they become filled with keratin. Eventually they reach the outer layer and remain for a time until they are sloughed off.</p>
<p>Nails are an accessory of the skin. Its just your outer layer except  with more keratin. They will completely regrow in 6-9 months. This is a factor in treatment for fungal infections also. You need to keep up treatment for that entire time, or you're not likely to rid yourself of the infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ran an ultramarathon and developed a blister under my toenail.  The whole toenail and nailbed was floating loose.  After the blister popped, the whole nail was detached, so I pulled it off.  As the resulting wound healed, within a month it had hardened into a thin nail layer.  A new nail bed had also formed, and a full thickness nail has been slowly growing out of it, overtop of the new nail layer.</p>
<p>I posted pics in a comment below, in case anyone is morbidly curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I always thought that once a nailbed was damaged it was damaged forever (and I had a fear that it would happen to me and I'd lose a fingernail forever).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally it does. However, I recently smashed my toe bad enough to kill the nail bed, where I learned that between six months and a year I will fully regrow an entirely new nail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since everybody is telling their own nail-related horror stories, I'll share mine. When I was about 13, a kid ran past me and tripped over a chair, sending it crashing down onto my bare toe. By the end of the night, the toenail fully detached from my foot, leaving nothing but skin. After some time (it was so long ago that I really can't remember how long it took) a thin nail started to form back. It gradually thickened and hardened back to a regular nail.</p>
<p>EDIT: yes, &quot;hair&quot; was supposed to be &quot;chair&quot;</p></div>		</li>
