			<div class="markdown"><p>I googled this out of curiosity and found <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-be-allergic-to-humans" target="_blank">this answer</a>. In short: you can only be allergic to a protein you don't make, which rules out most human proteins. However, it's possible for a woman to be allergic to semen (!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shiiiit, good point. I'm glad my dust allergy is super mild. It seems to flare up sometimes when I drink wine, or around my boyfriend's longhaired cat, but it's never been bad like it was at the time I got diagnosed. Adult-onset allergies are weird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you heard of &quot;allergy shots&quot; for people? Essentially we can do a similar process for animals. Immunotherapy is the closest thing we have to a cure for allergies.</p>
<p>Edit: Additionally, one can use antihistamines and steroids</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to get my dog tested at a specialist because he would get so itchy and scratch so hard that he would cut his face and bleed all over.  At night, he would constantly wake me up because he would cry while scratching.  After the test, we found that he is allergic to basically everything, including people and cats.  The vet was able to create a vaccine that helps take the edge off his most severe allergens and he's been doing a lot better since then.  The vaccine is probably something he will need for the rest of his life and consists of a tiny 0.25cc injection once a week that we administer at home.</p>
<p>Aside from the vaccine, he does have a few other lotions and potions to help when he's itchy between shots also.</p></div>		</li>
