			<div class="markdown"><p>I hated <em>Gatsby</em> when I first read it. I was thinking about how much I despised every character and how the lives of these people were totally vapid. Why should I care about these rich fucks? Their problems weren't my problems. They weren't even really <em>problems</em></p>
<p>Months later I realized that was the point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing I haven't seen mentioned is these books are wicked short. So it's easy to fit them in to a curriculum. It's why they teach of mice and men and not grapes of wraith. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is there a consensus of Frankenstein being a dry read? I personally find it to be one of the most entrancing novels I've ever read, and make a habit to re-read it often. Is it the slow start of the story? Or what? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've personally never been much of a fan of it. The writing style is certainly entrancing, but many find it boring - and Victors self-centred 'tortured genius' spiels are really boring imo. I think it's a personal thing tho. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We read Frankenstein and Dracula consecutively. After finally getting through Frankenstein, Dracula was the most interesting book I had seen at that point. I loved the epistolary style and found all of the action and the characters interesting and pleasing to read about. Plus the book has enough symbolism and literary themes I could talk about it in class.</p></div>		</li>
