			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely have seen hawks drop fish and turtles in our pasture before. Also have fish in our little pond. Always assumed it was due to that. Alligators find their way in too, and we're a mile from a big lake but every year there's a 3-4 footer in our little pond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. There was a story of a shark that was found in an isolated lake here in Florida. They believe it was dropped by a bird when it was small and eventually grew into an adult. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trout (like most freshwater fish) are broadcast spawners...they don't become pregnant.  For trout specifically the male makes a redd (nest), the female comes in and releases her eggs in the redd and the male (and potential multiple males) then release their milt onto the spawned eggs.  External fertilization.</p></div>		</li>
