			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may add to your great point.  Filing taxes in the manner suggested is super easy, even with today's tax code, if you work a standard job, or even multiple jobs, and receive a W-2 from your employer.  The IRS even did make this simple by making a 1040EZ form which you simply transcribe a few boxes and mail it in.  Most states have a similar type of form.</p>
<p>This is form that TurboTax advertises they'll let you submit federally for free.  </p>
<p>The second you earn income; from a side business, gambling, prize money/gifts, inheritence/estates or you support a family member financially, bought a home, got married, donate to charity, had kids, got divorced...tax codes add up.  Could the tax code be simplified to fix this?  Probably, but that's a whole 'nother conversation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The uk tax system is pretty simple.</p>
<p>You get a tax code like 1100L.  Times the number by 10 to get your tax free allowance, the  letter means something and it is usually L meaning standard.  If you are entitled to extra tax free allowance you contact hmrc (her majesty's revenue and customs) and they adjust the code and let your employer know.  Your employer takes the taxes PAYE (pay as you earn) and feeds that back to hmrc.  Hmrc automatically check what you paid versus what you should have done each year and you get a letter with a cheque if they own you money and they adjust your tax code to compensate if you under paid tax.  The same with interest from the bank.<br />
I never have to file taxes and probably never will.</p>
<p>This is different if you are self employed, but that is less common than working for an employer with a payroll department.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The UK system doesn't allow as many deductions as the US system.</p>
<p>In the US -- without going into obscure deductions -- you might claim Earned Income credits (for low income), Education credits, Child Tax credits, Saver's Credits, mortgage interest credits, residential energy credits and mileage credits.</p>
<p>We don't have these in the UK in the same fashion.  While we do have things like the married couple's allowance, if you want to claim it, you'll have to make a claim.  All the itemised expenses you can claim under the US system are as near as damn it unavailable under the UK tax system.</p>
<p>This is why we can operate a simplified system in the UK.  I don't imagine you'd get much traction if you told Americans that they could have a simplified system, but the result would be they lose all those deductions.</p>

<p>There are nearly five million self-employed people in the UK.  Obviously you are right in that that's significantly less than the over thirty million people in employment under PAYE.  It's not exactly uncommon though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brit here. The UK system is pretty great (and I used to knock it, until my regularly-employed friend in the Netherlands told me she needed to hire an accountant to do her taxes) but the Swedish system is definitely the best and most efficient one I've encountered. They even sent my deductions cheque back to the UK after I'd left. Splendid. </p>
<p>Taxes in Singapore (where I currently reside) are pretty straightforward here, too, but it seems to depend on whether your employer is willing to file on your behalf. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its nice that the only time I've ever heard this was from a comment on reddit.com/r/eli5. Im 24. Good thing I know how to graph functions though, I actually use that in real life. Really if taxes are something everyone ever will have to do every single year...... Why are there even &quot;tax experts&quot;? Why do people pay H&amp;R Block or TurboTax millions of dollars a year for something that should simply have been taught to people in middle/high school? When they start getting jobs? Fucking <strong><em>RETARDED</em></strong>, no if, ands, or buts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think is the threshold, then?  There are countries in the 50M-100M range that just send out a form to sign every year.  50M is no problem, but 300M is too many?</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that we <em>just</em> missed the boat on this, that our population grew past the threshold just as cheap computers made it feasible.  Or that tax officials in the UK got it done because they're just more energetic than tax officials in the USA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes. In Denmark most of it is automated for a regular employee (if you are, say, an entertainer you still have to file your income but most of what you earn is registered because our main bank accounts are linked to our social security number - take that as you will). </p>
<p>I say most because you can still write off some expenses as work related and get some money back, but it's more of a yearly tweak on your taxes than a total write up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The IRS could send out pre-filled tax forms tomorrow that have all the information regarding how much was withheld for the worker and have the taxes calculated and ready for you to sign and send back. Something like 40% of workers could just sign it and send its back as most people's returns are very straightforward and another large percentage would only need to make minor changes.</p>
<p>However, because we live in a corporate-run democracy, we can't have nice things: <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing" target="_blank">https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-maker-of-turbotax-fought-free-simple-tax-filing</a></p>
