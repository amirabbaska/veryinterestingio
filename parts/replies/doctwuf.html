			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern nuclear weapons use lithium-6 deuteride, which producers tritium when irradiated with neutrons. The fission reaction is used to &quot;breed&quot; the fuel for the fusion reaction. The castle bravo test showed that enigineers understimated the ability of lithium7 to  breed tritium, resulting in a more powerful explosion than expected.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not too many years ago there was a crisis in the us nuclear weapons maintenance because the reactor in South Carolina that was used to produce tritium was retired. US stocks of tritium were decaying away without replacement. This suggests at least a portion of the us arsenal does use tritium directly rather than breeding it from lithium 7</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The decayed tritium from nuclear weapons is actually the main commercial source of the stable isotope <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3" target="_blank">helium-3</a>, used in neutron detectors and for reaching really cold temperatures.  Since there are fewer weapons being stored by the US and Russia and the demand for helium-3 is high, the US DOE has started making tritium just for helium-3 production.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Given the lifetime of tritium that is very forward-looking.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is a by-product of heavy water reactors anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this mean it could explode or that it could leak radiations and stuff? In the first case a nuke war would be even worse, as we would have random explosions continuously even after the war.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You'd have to be a lunatic to design a bomb that could do that.</p>
<p>Bombs are designed in such a way that a non-critical amount of material is made into a critical amount of material. Introducing one piece to another, or using a shaped charge to compress it for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear warheads have many safety systems that physically prevent them from accidentally denoting. For example, many warhead rely on compression of a thick shell of fissile material. One safety feature that prevents this types of weapons from detonating is to fill the hollow center of the shell with ball bearings. In this case the ball bearing will prevent the fissile shell for compressing enough to denote in the unlikely event that the compressive charges accidentally fire. To arm the weapon one has to physically remove the ball bearings.</p></div>		</li>
