			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, not so much that the black hole 'sucks' stuff in. But in a few other comments, people mentioned geodesics, which are basically the shortest path from point A to point B in a curved spacetime. This is why light 'bends' around massive objects. It's actually just going straight like light always does, but straight (the shortest path) happens to be a curved geodesic in these cases.</p>
<p>Black holes though, had so much mass confined in such a small space, that all the possible paths or geodesics inside the boundary of the event horizon actually point towards the center. So it's not that it's sucking material in, it's just that one you move past the event horizon, there isn't an out any more. All geodesics lead deeper toward the center.</p>
<p>Crazy right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes me wonder what it would look like inside the event horizon of the black hole. Maybe the actual mass would be brightly lit?</p>
<p>Does all the energy from the light hitting the black hole do anything? Seems like it should just get hotter and hotter as more light is pulled in but none can be radiated away</p>
<p>*sorry meant none can be radiated away as blackbody radiation, I forgot Hawking radiation :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were inside the event horizon, if you looked toward the singularity (the mass at the center) you'd see nothing -- because there are no paths for light to take toward you, all the paths light can take lead toward the singularity.  If you were looking out, toward the event horizon, you'd be able to see things, though they'd be significantly distorted.</p>
<p>The energy from the mass &amp; momentum entering the black hole does radiate out via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">Hawking radiation</a>, but it's incredibly slow -- the event horizon of a black hole ranges from very cold (like 0.00000006 K for a solar-mass black hole) to preposterously cold (1x10^-14 K for a supermassive black hole.)  This is such a slow radiation that they'll actually be heated by the cosmic microwave background rather than cooling over time.  There's not really any sensible way to define the temperature of the singularity itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation. The intuitive understanding of the space and time should actually be counter-intuitive. The gravity, or effect of mass might be better seen as the curvature of space than a force in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The technical details it it even weirder. Gravity isn't affecting the light but rather the space (and time) around the black hole. The closer you get to the event horizon the greater the effect. Once you cross the event horizon, it isn't so much, you don't have the speed to get out, but rather, every direction points inward.</p></div>		</li>
