			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to state that even though we know what SSRIs do specifically (keep adding hay to the beacons of Gondor), we don't know why this cures depression or other disorders.  The fact that they take weeks to work is one of the problems: they start blocking the reuptake of serotonin almost instantly, so if it were as simple as &quot;more serotonin = healthy brain&quot; then they would cure depression almost instantly.</p>
<p>To keep going with the beacons of Gondor analogy, it's like if the beacons stay lit for a few weeks, the economy of Rohan, which had been stagnant, starts growing.  What connection is there between the beacons and Rohan's economy?  We don't know.  All we know is that somehow there is a connection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be incorrect there. Robust evidence shows that SSRIs do increase remission rates in major depression of adequate severity, as compared to placebo. They don't cure it in all or even most patients, but some responders just respond like hell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very good simplified answer. To add to it, everybody has slightly different brain chemistry (resistance to and proliferation for chemicals, and production rate as well) and different brain physiology (the architecture of the brain...space between, number, and paths of neurons).</p>
<p>In cases where neurons are spaced further apart, SSRIs can help ensure delivery to the receptor neurons. In cases where production is limited, they can allow the same effect with less total serotonin.</p>
<p>Where SSRIs tend to be ineffective is in cases of neural resistance to serotonin, which can be caused by genetics or with histories of heavy substance abuse (among other things, but these tend to be very common).  However, with significantly altered brain chemistry (again, can be genetic or caused by chemical brain damage) they can cause some of the severe side effects that the warning labels list, such as suicidal thoughts or actions.</p></div>		</li>
