			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, while we often talk about education funding in national politics, much of a schools funding is raised through local taxes. So money collected from a district stays in that district. </p>
<p>That policy sounds pretty fair (you're paying directly for the schools in your own community), but it unfortunately exacerbates the larger issues of racial and economic inequality in America. America's housing is incredibly segregated along the lines of wealth and race, especially for a country that purports to have laws against such things. </p>
<p>So this general rule of localities shouldering the burden of funding for their own schools results in schools in already rich (disproportionately white) districts getting more funding while schools in poorer (disproportionately non-white) districts struggle to make ends meet. Schools with fewer resources provide less opportunity for advancement. They earn a reputation as a &quot;bad school district.&quot; People who have the means to relocate switch school districts to wealthier areas in the best interests of their children, taking their potential tax revenue with them. The cycle continues. Inequality grows. </p>
<p>It's a pretty pervasive problem across many sectors in America. Too many people see equality as something we've already achieved by nature of being American rather than something we will always continue to strive for. So, when the time comes to make new rules within our existing systems, we demand that those rules apply to everyone equally without taking into account the inherent inequality that already exists because of these flawed systems. </p>
<p>A similar example is affirmative action, or college admissions policies that contain diversity quotas. You often see the argument that these policies are unfair because they factor demographics into a process that should judge people on merit. But, that argument never properly addresses the fact that a candidate's &quot;merit&quot; is inherently affected by existing inequalities across demographic lines.</p>
<p>The demand for equal treatment is a completely understandable notion, but equal treatment across an unequal playing field often just exacerbates existing inequality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>America also spends more on education then almost every other country. Founding.</p>
<p>But as you say is not equally distributed.</p>
<p>School funding should be based on the number of students not the property values of the surrounding area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I get this and agree to it to a small extent, I personally do not feel that I want to throw my tax money into schools that my kids won't go to. I believe I have a right to choose a neighborhood that has either very little taxes to pay for the school district, or I pay more taxes and my children go to a better school. I also understand the reality of some schools not bringing in very much money, due to income inequality, but I couldn't tell you how to solve that problem.
This is also coming from someone that chose to live in a community where I am the minority if that matters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it is time value of money.</p>
<p>A teacher stops by Target on the way home to grab a box of pens. Sure they could submit that receipt which the process takes a half an hour, then push it through their HR department for a couple months until the reimbursement goes through.</p>
<p>All that for $3.50?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really not what time value of money means - that is a term of art related to growth rates of money over time in finance.</p>
<p>Despite that, the conversation about school supplies is less about buying a single box of pens for the teacher's use - it's more about buying $50 worth of art supplies for the class, or $30 in microscope slides, or $200 worth of pencils for a math classroom over the course of a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anywhere I've ever seen won't reimburse purchases that are already provided by the office, and something not provided had to be approved before purchase....</p>
<p>But when you're talking about an underfunded program to start with if they don't have the budget for supplies, where is the money going to come from to reimburse?</p>
<p>Teacher: I need construction paper and markers.</p>
<p>School: we don't have the budget for it because the school bus needed maintenance, sorry. </p>
<p>Teacher: ok, I'll buy it and you can reimburse me. </p>
<p>School: no</p>
<p>Teacher: here's the receipt, please pay me </p>
<p>School: are you daft? We said we didn't have the budget. </p></div>		</li>
