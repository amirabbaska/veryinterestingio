			<div class="markdown"><p>S'true, There's a lot of rare earth metals there that are essential for modern technology. Although tbh there is probably more buried in the landfills and waste dumps of the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>while I don't see the evidence for there being more buried in landfills and waste dumps I will say the reason it's there is probably because it's more labor intensive to segregate and sort out the plastic and other unwanted parts from the little amount per unit of valuable minerals there is, it's cheaper to just mine fresh uncontaminated ore from the ground in massive quantities like they do now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may have a point. However based on the trend for <a href="http://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Landfills-Contain-Precious-Metal-Deposits-40-50-Times-Richer-than-Mines.html" target="_blank">gold being more plentiful in landfills than it is in mines </a> , and the prevalence of e-waste in the world. I stand by my point. Personally I think it's just an excuse for the world not to embrace recycling on a more massive scale, as well as to justify our existing mining infrastructure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read the same thing too... I believe once we got in there there were some USGS guys who took around, and published this.  IIRC I saw it posted on Slashdot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I remember the article it was the lead story on the front page and like 2 or 3 more full pages inside the paper, I was blown away by what I read in it. My opinion... and I was only there for a year and change so it's not worth much. The Afghans that are in power like things they way they are now, they grow and sell drugs and that's it. they would literally have to build (and I wrote build because there's nothing there now that counts as a country except a border drawn on a map) that entire country from scratch. There's no infrastructure no regulations no accountability, no rail, no reliable electricity, that country is in the stone ages. but they could if they wanted be the Saudi Arabia of lithium if they wanted. For that to happen the people in power would loose that power so it's never going to change. It's truly corruption on an industrial scale in Afghanistan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The infrastructure issue is also the key reason why countries like Ethiopia have famines... They could easily grow enough food, but without the ability to transport it, store it, market it, etc, reliably, nobody wants to grow that much... it'd just rot on the fields.</p>
<p>And yeah, Govt plays a huge part.  On the one hand, the Govt needs to be capable of establishing <em>and</em> enforcing laws pertaining to the industry and trade... as well as all the prerequisite infrastructure... Think the US Dept of Transportation for example.</p>
<p>On the other hand the Govt needs to delegate these things...  The whole idea behind the Banana Republic is that the rulers own an industry, much like running a company.  You can't have a single CEO run Google, GM Motors, Nestle, Walmart, and Johnson &amp; Johnson... it simply doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is how it is in more-developed but otherwise communist countries, where the Govt owns the companies and industries... but then you see further development as-in China, for example.... But in doing so the rulers have to release a large portion of their power to those they delegate to.  The Banana Republic is the situation where the Rulers have found a single revenue stream, and they realize that if they maintain all the control, they get all the revenue from that stream.</p>
<p>China and other &quot;state run&quot; agencies are a compromise because there is no single revenue stream... they need multiple streams, multiple industries... and that also means they need infrastructure.</p>
<p>When you run a Banana Republic, you don't need to even bother keeping people happy... the industry pays for enough arms and soldiers to ensure they don't rebel.... You only need enough infrastructure to keep the industry going, even it's only a single road from the mine to the harbor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I saw that too, seemed optimistic. My cynical self believes that it was just the kind of uplifting/positive article that is commissioned by a state department to influence moods or attract investors for an otherwise pretty hopeless region. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I remember reading something a while back about how Afghanistan could be a new world power from their ridiculous mineral riches... If they abandoned their tribalism mindset and embraced science and tech. <a href="http://www.livescience.com/47682-rare-earth-minerals-found-under-afghanistan.html" target="_blank">Here's a cool read about it</a></p></div>		</li>
