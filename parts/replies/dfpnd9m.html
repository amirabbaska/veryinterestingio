			<div class="markdown"><p>Celery is watery and bland, and a little bit astringent, but honestly it's mostly what he said: it's a scoop for the dressing. It's the dressing that really cools you down, because capsaicin (the molecule responsible for &quot;spicy&quot;) dissolves in fats, not water. When you drink water to cool off, you just spread the oily pain around, but milk fats coat the tongue and milk proteins actually bind to the capsaicin and help to neutralize it. </p>
<p>tl;dr Want to cool off after eating spicy food? Milk, yogurt, ice cream, bleau cheese dressing, etc. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Close! The fat in milk or in whatever it is you're eating/drinking after the spicy food does not bind with the capsaicin. Instead it <em>outcompetes</em> capsaicin for the spice/pain receptors in your mouth. So basically when you can feel the spice of a chicken wing, that's caused by capsaicin binding proteins (the &quot;pain receptors&quot;) on your tongue. When you feel relief after drinking milk, that's from the fat going to those same proteins, kicking out the capsaicin, and occupying those proteins themselves. </p>
<p>However I think you are onto something in that the fat in milk does help free floating capsaicin to dissolve better in water (I.E., your saliva, or the water that is in milk). As you said, capsaicin is largely fat soluble not water soluble, and the dissolved fat in milk helps wash away some extra capsaicin away from he receptors on your tongue. This is only secondary and minor to the above mechanism though. Competition for protein binding sites is the major mechanism of action for getting relief from eating ranch/sour cream/milk after you eat a spicy food.</p></div>		</li>
