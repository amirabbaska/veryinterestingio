			<div class="markdown"><p>In statistical mechanics, the particles, as an aggregate, are required to be distributed such that the number at a particular energy is proportional to its Boltzmann factor in order to define a temperature.  </p>
<p>Individual constituents, therefore, (essentially) must have a range of kinetic energies (the only exceptions being systems at zero temperature and systems with only a single energy (and the later does not really need a notion of temperature)).</p></div>		</li>
