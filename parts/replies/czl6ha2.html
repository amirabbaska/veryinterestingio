			<div class="markdown"><p>Oil companies typically pay a lot of taxes. </p>
<p>Every year one of the major companies will have an extraordinary loss that will cause a net loss and they wont pay taxes that year, or defer them to the follow year, and everyone jumps on the &quot;they dont pay der taxis!&quot;</p>
<p>If you look at a 5 year average, their tax rates are completely in line with what is expected (often higher than other businesses). Someone posted a great graph a while ago. I cant find it now, but even now sites with names like &quot;think_<strong>__</strong>&quot; are obfuscating the issue by saying &quot;look at what companies didnt pay taxes this year.&quot;</p>
<p>The amount of misinformation in corporate tax structure is astounding. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I had to take three law courses before I could really understand the basics of tax, corporations, and then corporate taxes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>perhaps if the tax system was not so complex it would be easier for people to understand these things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who want to attack oil companies like to throw around how big their profit was on a given year so everyone will hate those rich 1%er capitalist pigs and want to tax them more.</p>
<p>I just looked up BP on Wikipedia and their 2014 revenue was $359 billion. Their $4 billion net income that year is 1.1% of their revenue. In a lot of industries, that would be rough going.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cases like this are why we always need to be careful with buzz stats. Something like &quot;ABC Corp made $X billion last year and paid no taxes!&quot; </p>

<p>that would be stating the gross profit and when they do they say so. because it matters</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did several seven figures in revenue last year with my online business. My gross profit margin was about 35%, my take at the end of the year amounted to about 5.5%.  A lot of money sure, when looked at as a &quot;Walmart job vs. My business&quot; comparison, but when people hear what my &quot;revenues&quot; are they think I am wiping my ass with 1000 dollar bills. </p>
<p>No one ever thinks I have to pay anyone anything.</p>
<p>My brother, who I consider an intelligent person, asked me why I wasn't living in a mansion yet and driving Lamborghini's. I simply replied.. Government.  :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stating gross profit is horribly misleading to people who don't actually know what it is.  Operating profit is fair in some contexts, but by just stating gross profit you're leaving out very necessary costs of doing business.  Every business needs SG&amp;A to run, so ignoring those costs is foolish unless you are working within the company and analyzing plant performance or something like that.  If you're an established company and you aren't turning a gross profit, you won't be around for very long.</p></div>		</li>
