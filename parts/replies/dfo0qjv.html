			<div class="markdown"><p>That was sort of my assumption too. No mortgage and daily upkeepâ€‹ lightly done by family or cheap hired help. I'm just surprised that they are as old as they are...Like what brought about such a major investment back 40-60 years ago in this area. Some are literally across the way from another. </p>
<p>Another guess is that these do exist on a (slow moving but) major north/south road that, prior to major highways, may have been the only direct route. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there were lots of roadside motels that popped up along major roads and state routes before the Interstate system was built in the 50's-60's... there were more of them because travel took longer and because they tended to be smaller than today's highway exit motels. Many faded away, but some hang on.</p></div>		</li>
