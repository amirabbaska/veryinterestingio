			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend who experiences auditory hallucinations and she explained it as not hearing voices per se, but knowing that something was being said to her. Like she believed she could hear people's thoughts, but she wasn't really &quot;hearing&quot; anything, just understanding that a person was thinking something at the time. It makes perfect sense that a deaf person could experience a similar form of psychosis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually very interesting because I am certain most people grossly misunderstand hallucinations and psychosis, specially when you only know them from tv. Even people who I'd expect to have certain unserstanding of this can't undersrand them as well as I would expect, I think it's very different for someone going through the stuff than anyone who is not/ hasn't. Even me, before when I first discernibly experienced it, and when I look back I wonder if it always has been something latent in me and it just wasn't strong enough for me or anyone to notice. </p>
<p>I don't have auditory hallucinations, but Im almost sure I do &quot;hear voices&quot; more like a deaf person would. I think there's a stronger link between hallucinations and delusions than most people think or can see. I also think understanding this will improve mental healthcare, as I believe it has to do with neurological development and activity, looking at testimony from people with different levels and types of communication, culture and lifestyles and life experiences reassures me more that understanding the brain and focusing on neurological care is the key to more effecrive treatment than the primitive psychiatric medications and they way they are currently used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, I would personally call her psychosis delusion but her shrink uses hallucination instead. It makes you think about how arbitrary a distinction it is.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had auditory hallucinations of 2 types: the “thinking I’m hearing something” and “hearing it with my ears.” Both exist. </p>
<p>The <em>perception</em> of <em>having heard</em> something — a knock, a random voice saying a random word — is primarily caused by my brain being wildly overstimulated due to a sensory gating issue. I still get this if my autoimmune disorder acts up and I don’t give my brain white noise to appease it, eg when I’m falling asleep. Without any stimuli, it will invent something. But it’s clearly not real.</p>
<p>The <em>ears</em> kind of hallucinations , I had twice: once with a bad concussion, I hallucinated a sound that was often going on and which drove me nuts (the horrible commercial exhaust fan across the street). It was more of a “residue” than an invention, kinda like a PTSD flashback but with my hearing. </p>
<p>The second time was after a single dose of a medicine that wildly up-regulated my sensory processing issue (dopamine). Clear as a bell, I <em>heard</em> a TV in another room, with a crowd cheering, but knew that there was no such thing. It was wild and weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What she is having is not an auditory hallucination, but rather a specific delusion of thought insertion. Common in many types of psychosis.</p>
<p>True auditory hallucinations are perceived as if there was actually an external sound.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Slightly unrelated side-note, but I find it fascinating that people who are congenitally blind (never had eye-sight) are immune to schizophrenia. There are no reported cases of congenitally blind patients.</p>
<p>Here's an article about it: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201302/why-early-blindness-prevents-schizophrenia" target="_blank">https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-imprinted-brain/201302/why-early-blindness-prevents-schizophrenia</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your input! So are you saying that auditory hallucinations might be interpreted by a deaf person as immediately foreign? Might it be easier to identify or diagnose schizophrenia in that instance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unknown. It may be identified as something jarring but immediately foreign, I'm unsure. It also may change case by case. Good question. It's also dependant on how well the interpreter is relaying subtle information to the medical professional. There may be some things the deaf person does that the interpreter finds no meaning in and therefore stays silent. Other interpreters may find something crucial to relay, which may influence the doctor's approach and diagnosis. It's a big responsibility to know what to relay and how.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A basic question about sign language: does it translate word for word to and from spoken language? It often appears to be more general to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not word for word (English &quot;the&quot; to a signed &quot;the&quot;. In formal ASL, &quot;the&quot; isn't a part of the language because it is not necessary). ASL is it's own language that has unique grammar and vocabulary. Use of facial expressions and structuring can effectively communicate anything from another language into ASL. It's a very powerful language.</p>
<p>With interpreting, there are some moments that things from the source language (English in this example) might be changed or omitted from the target language interpretation (into ASL). This is mostly frowned upon in interpretations because interpretation aims to include all information and nuance from the source language to the target language. When you see people like the most recent Florida life guard &quot;interpreting&quot;, due to their skill in the interpreting process and the lack of vocabulary and knowledge of ASL, it appears very general because... well.. it is. He did what we call in the business, a &quot;drop&quot;. He dropped important information that kept deaf people in the dark about hurricane evacuations. The Nelson Mandela interpreter is an example people point to often as well. That interpreter claimed to have qualifications that they clearly didn't have, even to a person that knew no ASL. It appeared very general.</p>
<p>The short answer is, ASL is very complex and powerful. Subtle facial expression can change the meaning of an entire chunk of information. Interpreters and native ASL users must master these nuances to communicate most effectively.</p>
<p>I hope this helped answer your question.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed some fat fingered typing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be worth mentioning that there's Signed Exact English (SEE), which supposedly helps deaf people understand the English language better.  It unfortunately does not as ASL truly does help deaf people understand English better. SEE is exactly what it sounds like it should be; &quot;I am going to the store&quot; in sign language, which involves each and every word in the sentence. The ASL version of that sentence would be, &quot;I go store&quot;.</p>
<p>As for your examples for the &quot;ASL interpreters&quot; used during these situations like Florida and Mandela, my guess was that they forgot to hire a qualified ASL interpreter so they asked around to see if there's anyone who knows ASL. Someone probably volunteered to be one and did a horrible job at that. </p>
<p>That or they knew they were required to provide a qualified ASL interpreter but forgot to get one (which is quite often in my situation when it comes to getting one for doctor appointments, but I digress) so they asked someone who could pretend to be one and maybe no one will notice. They were wrong when they got called out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. How much nuance is it at all possible to convey? In any given language there's plenty of words and phrases that don't meaningfully translate into any other language without a minute of explanation. Or words that have special significance or altered meaning in a given context. And what about word play and puns and rhymes? Is there such a thing as poetry in ASL?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, that's very interesting. Is there beautiful poetry where the beauty lies with the physical hand gesture they way words may be poetic in their sound shape, rhymes, etc.? Is there a kind of ballet or rap?</p></div>		</li>
