<p>Also the mushrooms you see are just the reproductive organs of a larger fungal organism, the Mycelium.</p>

<p>Yep. When the ground gets super moist, the mushroom just sticks its dick right up there.</p>
<p>Edit: Poster below makes a good point - it's actually mycelia that are sexing up the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mycelium first produces primordia just under the ground surface. These are small mushrooms (baby dicks) where the cell division takes place. After a rain event the mycelium pumps water into the primordia causing rapid cell expansion. The baby dicks grow into triumphant king dongs and burst fourth from the ground. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I graze chickens on my farm and have noticed year after year more and more mushrooms popping up in the pasture. My take is that the fertilization of the soil creates better conditions for mycelium and thus better chances of mushroom reproduction in a positive feedback loop.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's absolutely correct. Fungi is a sign of soil health. Your chickens are ensuring the soil has the nutrients required to promote a balance of archaea, bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, algae, protozoa, and a wide variety of larger soil fauna, including springtails, mites, nematodes, earthworms, ants, insects that spend all or part of their life underground. Healthy soil sequesters a butt-tonne of carbon. So basically mushrooms are a present from happy soil!</p></div>		</li>
