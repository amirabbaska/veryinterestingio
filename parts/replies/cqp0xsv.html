			<div class="markdown"><p>It does over time, but as long as blood is flowing to the lungs and brain, the brain will be oxygenated for a significant amount of time.</p>
<p>Your lungs do not strip all the oxygen out of the air you breath, in fact for the average breath something like only 25-50% of the oxygen in the air is absorbed by the lungs.</p>
<p>It's when the blood flow is cut off or restricted to the brain that problems happen - as your body has methods of continuing to oxygenate the brain while you're not breathing by reducing blood flow to extremities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you hold your breath there is still air in your lungs and blood. It starts to be used up, but it's not 100% used up the second you hold your breath. If you train your body it can use that oxygen more efficiently than a normal person, allowing you to hold your breath for a long time (in this guy's case, 22 minutes), whereas a typical person might be able to do 1 minute or maybe 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me help you make sense of this.
The 5-6 minute rule for brain damage occurs when there is NO CIRCULATION of the blood, aka the brain doesn't get ANY blood perfusion. </p>
<p>If, for example, the world record holder for longest time without breathing suddenly has a cardiac arrest, after 6 minutes without circulation, most of his brains cells will be dead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I gather is that the oxygen levels in the breath you took go down slowly, and after about 5-6 minutes the breath you took is exhausted and you start getting damaged because there's no more oxygen circulating. With proper training, you can extend this to 7-8 minutes by taking deeper and more full breaths. However in the record, they used pure medical grade oxygen which increased their ability by three times by allowing as much oxygen as possible as opposed to the ~21% you're normally inhaling. Apparently the guy was in a tank of near-freezing water which lowered his need for oxygen even more.</p></div>		</li>
