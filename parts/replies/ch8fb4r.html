<p>Just to be clear, though, New Horizons is a much, much cheaper mission as it's part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Frontiers_program" target="_blank">New Frontiers</a> program while the Voyagers were part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_Program" target="_blank">Flagship</a> program. For comparison, New Horizons will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $700 million over the life of the mission; the Voyagers were about $1 billion in 1977 dollars, which is closer to $4 billion today.</p>
<p>Point being, New Horizons is very, very scaled back from what it could have been if it were a true Flagship mission.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine the additional instrumentation, imaging quality capable if they only had doubled its funding. A single trip could have beamed back enough information to study for decades, maybe longer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be honest, it already will. It's not exactly my field, but I'm friends with quite a few Pluto scientists who will be set for 10-20 years working on the data New Horizons returns.</p>
<p>Let's put it this way - we've never seen a Kuiper Belt object close up before. As it stands, <a href="http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2010-06-a-web_print.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> is currently out best image of Pluto, with a resolution of roughly 500 kilometers per pixel. At its closest, New Horizons will provide images with resolution up to 25 <em>meters</em> per pixel, i.e. 20,000 times better. It's going to change everything we think we know about Kuiper Belt objects.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Compared to the 12 years voyager took to get to Neptune it certainly seems like there has been some improvements made over the years.</p>

<p>New Horizons is about 2/3rds the mass of the Voyagers and was placed on a <em>really</em> fast trajectory - the math and rocket capabilities weren't all that different back in the Voyager days, but it certainly would have been more expensive and riskier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, horizons had a much higher initial velocity, in fact it is the fastest EVER man made object to escape earths gravity, so the voyager probes spent a lot longer time on the initial part of the journey than new horizons did, but due to the slingshots they are going to have a higher final velocity. Not sure on exact number but I think it's something like 4km/s difference between New Horizons and Voyager 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe Helios is actually the fastest by far, but it's actually a solar research mission so we used all that Delta-V to get it to drop in the gravity well to inside Mercury's orbit. New Horizons is still notably fast, and we didn't need as many gravity assists to reach that velocity as other spacecraft.</p>
<p>Helios: 70.22 km/s</p>
<p>Voyager 1: 17.46 km/s</p>
<p>New Horizons: 16.26 km/s</p></div>		</li>

Even if it had ion thrusters, the bulk of its velocity came from the giant rocket it was launched on, plus the gravity assist from Jupiter.</p></div>		</li>
