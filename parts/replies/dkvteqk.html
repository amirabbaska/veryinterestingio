			<div class="markdown"><p>It works for adults too!  If your nose was just two holes and you ended up pressing your face against something while you slept (such as a pillow, a leaf, or your mate or child), you might suffocate.  As it is, the shape of your nose keeps the area around your nostrils clear even when pressed against an object, helping you breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely right!  We do have a reflex that wakes us if we stop breathing while asleep, but for something where death is on the line it is nice to have the redundancy.  Consider a person who's unconscious because of a concussion, or because they've fallen in a coma.  Their waking reflex won't really work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which I understand was a huge energy/time saver, so it would make sense why the changes might have been that drastic (over a large period of time of course). </p>
<p>Edit: as in it was a benificial mutation that would give their decendants such a large advantage and push others out of the gene pool. Can I simplify the language every once in a while without people assuming I don't know what evolution is?  </p></div>		</li>

The ones that don't do anything also start to become less concentrated because the people with the good stuff kill them out or just steal their mates</p></div>		</li>
