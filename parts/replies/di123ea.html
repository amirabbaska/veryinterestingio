<p>Animals routinely do get sick from drinking contaminated water. Sick animals usually hide until they either recover or die, so you don't see them very often unless you know where to seek them out. (House pets like cats have this behavior mechanism, as well.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun fact: We also exhibit this. Hiding is a natural human response to gradual hypothermia. People dying in their homes from cold have been found under a bed, in a shelf, behind furniture etc. It's called &quot;terminal burrowing&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>re: point 1. - To expand upon which water sources are contaminated and which aren't, it isn't the colour of the water that determines whether it's safe. That is determined almost entirely simply by the colour and type of soil it's sitting atop. I would hope it's common knowledge that drinking from running water like a white water river generally carries a <em>much</em> reduced risk of illness than from still water like a small pond. </p>
<p>The average temperature of the surrounding area is also a factor, the warmer an area the more conducive it is to the growth of bacteria. Pathogens love the tropics</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is fast moving water safer to drink? I can understand it if the water is snowmelt (no time for bacteria to grow). But my favorite pond has tons of bacteria in late summer but the water exits over a dam and definitely produces white water at the bottom. Is the water at the top dirty and clean at the bottom?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It carries alot more oxygen which itself can kill bacteria. When water becomes stagnant it has alot less dissolved oxygen which bacteria likes. </p>
<p>Oxygen disinfects water in the same fashion as chlorine does but it doesn't occur in nature in a strong enough form to outright kill everything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a reduced risk in most cases. But if there's a contaminant upstream, it will move with the water. An animal corpse in a river will pollute it for miles, assuming It's decomposing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be dirty at the bottom too. It's not safe because of the speed, but because a fast moving stream generally won't be stagnantâ€‹, and it's standing, stagnant water that promotes bacterial growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is a fine detail that might be lost in the 5th point.</p>
<p>We haven't bread out the immunity, in the sense that genetically we no longer posses an immunity that we once had.  The immunity can be developed by exposure or passed from mother to child.  Since neither mother nor child was ever exposed the immunity isn't currently present in most people.  But many/most of use could develop the immunity again in our lifetime.</p>
<p>On the important once, we have the immunity from vaccines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, also I think an important clarification is that the immunity is generally in the form of intestinal flora, you can lose the the immunity during your life (my dad immigrated from India and now he gets sick if he drinks tap water when he goes back)</p></div>		</li>
