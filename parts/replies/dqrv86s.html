			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I know all about arrays and lists, this was more about me being curious if it's possible. (Also some applications, like Unity, limit me to storing only floats, ints and strings between scenes in a simple manner, before I have to start getting more complex and storing values in an external file.)</p>
<p>Gödel Numbering is rather interesting, I never knew about it. Though useless for my application due to the size of numbers it creates, it's still rather cool.
But thanks! I'll look into Chinese Remainder Theorems. The order never really matters so I'll try that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small nitpick: the Chinese Remainder Theorem is something that can be used to create a Gödel Numbering, which is (in this context) any way of defining a computable, injective function from sets or sequences of natural numbers to natural numbers.</p>
<p>Also these are not really practical due to how large the numbers get. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured that out now, seeing just how large the numbers get. Never knew about these theorems though. It's cool to know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you clarify what you mean about unity only allowing ints strings and floats to be stored between scenes? I use unity a lot and have never heard of or noticed this limitation, and have not had problems storing more complex values between scenes. Do you know about DontDestroyOnLoad?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah sorry, I was trying to limit myself to using PlayerPrefs as a function. (I know about PlayerPrefsX) but it got me thinking about whether this was possible.</p>
<p>Actually I didn't! Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
