			<div class="markdown"><p>Your best defense is certainly to prevent the ticks from getting to you in the first place. The permethrin-treated clothes are a good investment, especially since you’re a frequent backpacker. Otherwise, appropriate use of DEET, picaridin or other tick repellents are effective as well. If you’re overnighting then you’ll want to be prepared to check for ticks thoroughly and remove any if found. So a pair of tweezers would be a good tool to have on hand, along with any skin disinfectant and of course a way to wash your hands. - Dr. Michael Smith</p></div>		</li>
