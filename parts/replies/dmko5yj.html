			<div class="markdown"><p>I think op was asking why discomfort increases the longer you stay in the same position, not why sleeping on your back is &quot;scientificly superior&quot; sleeping position. When you start off in a position, the side you lay on experiences very little discomfort. As time progresses the and discomfort experieced by that side increases until you switch to another position and the pattern repeats. WHY?</p></div>		</li>
