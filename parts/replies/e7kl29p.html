			<div class="markdown"><p>Blackbody radiation. All things with temperature radiate energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation with a “color” based on temperature. It’s why you can be seen like a bright red sore thumb on an Infrared camera and why molten iron glows red/orange/white hot. Things have to be really hot to be seen in the visible spectrum.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, that makes sense. It is a function of T and not the not the energy absorbed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The graphic is not well done. What they mean is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the current global average temperature, the Earth surface emits 503 W/m². These are divided up into 398.2 W/m² which is emitted as radiative head (infrared radiation), 18.4 W/m² as thermals (rising warm air, I suppose), and 86.4 W/m² from change of state (evaporative cooling), adding up to 503.0 W/m².</li>
</ul>
<p>On the incoming side, we 163.3 W/m² from sunlight, which warm up the surface and 340.3 W/m² of IR radiation from the atmosphere. The second one is that part of the 398.2 W/m² emitted heat radiation that doesn't reach space but gets absorbed and send back down by the greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>In the end 0.6 W/m² more come down from the sun then go out into space. This causes global warming, That this is such a delicate balance is why global warming can get worse so easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are exceptions to the second part, I believe. Chemical reactions requiring heat/energy &quot;trap&quot; this energy within the structure of the resulting substances. Perhaps they break down later, releasing this energy again, but I think some are stable and don't break down without additional outside influences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That 0.6 is being absorbed, you'd have to talk to the people who did the study for ideas where that energy is going. </p>
<p>If I were to hazard a guess, some of it is going into biological processes and creating stored energy in the form of carbon bonds, etc, sequestering the energy as biomass. But more likely, most of it is going into increasing oceanic temperatures. Not surface temperatures, but the average ocean temperature.</p>
<p>I'd love to see exactly where it's going though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The straight physics side of this is called 'albedo'. Basically, if you shine 1 watt of photons on a surface, some fraction is absorbed as heating of that surface and the remainder is bounced back as other photons (possibly at different wavelengths). Things like water and vegetation have a very low albedo value while things like fresh snow have a very high value. In the earth's system, this can get messy as visible light from the sun can get absorbed/reflected by surfaces at lower, thermal, wavelengths which can then be recaptured by things like CO2 in the atmosphere and re-reflected back towards the surface; i.e. the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>This is further muddied by the fact that many real surfaces, especially plants, convert some of that incident power into things like chemical bonds which can act as 'batteries' and don't immediately account for incident/reflected powers and/or heating.</p>
<p>But, importantly, overall energy is always conserved. light_energy_in = light_energy_out + local_thermal<em>energy</em> + local_energy_stored_in_chemistry.</p></div>		</li>
