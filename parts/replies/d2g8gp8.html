My lungs are fucked. Even a mild old, if it gets into my lungs, can nag me for a week or two after the infection is over. My history made the condition worse, my environment slows the healing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often it's a secondary bacterial infection in the lungs/airways caused by a depressed immune system from the virus combined with all the mucus/phlegm that's built up in your airways. It's why you can seem to get better, then start getting worse again a few days later, with symptoms focused in the chest this time around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely not right is your post, all 'cold symptoms' are due to dehydration of sinus cavity due to dry air... Any other noticeable infection is irrelevant, that is a separate issue and will continue to remain in body after 'cold symptoms', sinus dehydration is improved, thus if one really has an infection that treatment needs further observation and treatment?$!.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top comment is largely rubbish. The infection usually starts in the throat and is spread by sneezing and coughing. </p>
<p>Also, it doesn't really spread systemically because the virus needs low temperatures to reproduce. The upper airways have these lower temperatures due to extensive gas exchange from breathing. Thus making the perfect environment for the virus to infect, survive and reproduce. </p>

<p>To add to this, this is why exercise can help prevent and end colds quicker. The activity increases your body temperature easily for about an hour a day or an hour a few days a week. This is effectively clean sweeping your body of any pathogens that may be building up to attack.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the reasons why our immune systems respond to infection with a fever.  Raising our body temperature makes it harder for invading bacteria and viruses to survive and flourish. Fevers also stimulate our immune systems into producing more white blood cells, antibodies, and other pathogen-fighting proteins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Not sure I buy this &quot;always starts in the nose&quot; explanation, then moves to the throat. I often get a scratchy sore throat first. Then ends sometimes with a runny nose. Could it move upwards too? If so, that wouldn't be too far away from this explanation. Just not dependent on the mucus gravity thing. I guess when you cough it could move the virus potentially upwards into your sinuses and nose</p></div>		</li>
