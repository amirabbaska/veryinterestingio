You can absolutely save the environment without compromising your lifestyle or economy, but it has to be done deliberate. The problem in the states is that a lot of powerful people run/own/are connected to big polluters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that our entire economy is tied to petro at the moment. Maybe the solution could be investing in other technologies on a larger scale? I  I can't see your average American jumping on the band wagon if it means prices will sky rocket overnight. </p>
<p>I would need clear cut outcomes before I could support this particular agreement. Again, I'm in agreement that something should be done, however I want to be informed about what exactly that is before I support this. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It depends. The Paris agreement specifically leaves open how you want to get emissions down. The idea is that a place like the US (which has a lot of cars, and drives a lot because it's a big country) , whereas other countries might take a different approach (for example, looking to use nuclear or solar power plants).</p>
<p>Basically, it just says &quot;get to x number. Don't care how you get there, figure out what works best for your country/economy&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would our corporations be under foreign oversight?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. It would be completely run by the US government. Mainly the EPA, although i believe there are other agencies also involved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would the price of gasoline/water/a pound of hamburger meat double?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. The changes in stuff like prices would overall be pretty small. To give a bit of context, we were on track to meet the agreement as is, with the changes the Obama administration already made</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would my taxes go up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's impossible to say. It depends on how the government wants to tackle the issue. So if they decided on say, a carbon tax, in theory, your tax could go up. Currently, that hasn't been politically feasible.</p>
<p>Mostly they've been focusing on things like power plants (particularly coal which has a lot of emissions compared to other methods). Generally that means requiring those coal plants to fit with scrubbing technology to clean their emissions, or replacing it with another technology. Another better efficiency on cars. ie, requiring car companies to develop motors that get say, 45 MPG instead of 35 MPG.</p>
<p>They've also done stuff like give grants for research into solar energy (to say, universities), or tax credits for people buying solar panels. It used to really expensive to install solar, and government subsidies paid like half the cost. As we've gotten better at making them, solar is on track to beat stuff like coal all on it's own, it's very competitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First:</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write this. I don't really follow politics regularly. It helps a ton when reddit readers answer my questions at face value. I'm tired of seeing reddit devolve into a pissing match about the federal government. It's great to get a flushed out answer. I now have a much better understanding of this agreement. </p>
<p>&quot;Americans will always do the right thing--after exhausting all the alternatives&quot;</p>
<p>Say we get to the 3 degree mark. Does that mean we will see a mad max scenario? Massive migrations/famines? What is the actual, no bullshit projection for the future? We go extinct?</p>
<p>Could we possibly invent atmosphere scrubbing facilities or something to control the weather artificially? Will gmos be developed to cope? I guess what I'm asking is how far are we from being able to control our planet's natural processes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was never determined, to my knowledge, what would change. Corporations would be under further oversight from whatever US agency would be put in charge. Not foreign oversight. All of those things would potentially go up in price, but they will in any case if all other countries do this. Ah, who knows with the American tax system....</p></div>		</li>

<p>True, but misleading. US, Saudis, and Australia are off the charts per capita. China is like 1/3 per capita but has way more people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth pointing out in these discussions that a lot of China's high emissions are due to the fact that they are the &quot;workshop of the world&quot; and manufacture a large proportion of the &quot;stuff&quot; people in other countries value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also &quot;it's industry not people&quot; isn't really accurate. The number of cars and the amount of electricity we consume in the US is a large factor of why our per capita is so high</p></div>		</li>
