			<div class="markdown"><p>Automation basically increases productivity. But if there is no demand, an increase in productivity does not mean a larger economy. For example, most people only need 1 bed. You could have an automated factory building millions of beds at an extremely low cost, but at the end of the day, if the population is not increasing, or the product is not failing, all of this productivity will be wasted since a person only needs one bed. This can be extrapolated to any good (cars, food, etc.) </p>
<p>The easiest way to increase demand on a country level is to increase population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah.</p>
<p>Less people participating in the economy = slower movement of capital.</p>
<p>Slower movement of capital = slower research and production.</p>
<p>AKA, a slowdown of the progress of technology.</p>
<p>Automation doesn't fix this. In fact, it's the reason why people are scared of Automation. If the 'common people' don't have money to spend, then the economy shrinks and no one is buying new things in order to incentivize new research &amp; tech.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Economies of Scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Automation in a society of post scarcity relieves people from mundane jobs freeing up more time for creative industries such as entertainment and technology. I think your perspective is one of a negative view of automation. </p>
<p>I know for a fact that automation and the implementation of 0.1 rainwater runoff coefficients generals a world of abundance, stepping away from the dystopia. I have written a paper that is relevant to the concept. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QFRCaNya-6SBTBGAMG8fAqXRGktS_E9LjsRshAC-Fos/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>It is less about movement of capital and more about mitigating the necessity of capital. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get the aging point. But regarding your first two paragraphs, if you reduce the supply of people and the demand that those additional people created, should it not somehow cancel out? I would think that it would affect a gross metric like GDP, but not a standard of living metric like GDP per capita.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the effect tends to be on the gross metric, though it can also have more direct effects on the margins (for instance, more people means more ability to specialize and larger markets for specialty goods. This &quot;evens out&quot; in a sense, but it also is why a city will have 100 different restaurants, but a town might have 10, eight of which are chains.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a problem simply because a reduction in consumption means unused capacity. You had to have the grills to supply 1000 people with burgers and those grills cost $100 a year to just keep in usable shape, regardless of if they are used. If you suddenly only have to supply 500 people, you still need to pay the $100 a year upkeep. Reduction in capacity is a huge issue unless it is planned for way ahead of time, like when they initially created the capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're forgetting social services. Most governments uphold their end of the social contract with taxes on single adults,(tax cuts for married folks and children to encourage having kids), and with taxes on business transactions.</p>
<p>As GDP shrinks taxes from corporate income or sales tax fall. Fewer people in the workforce means less income tax. Less tax revenue means the government either has to run a larger and larger deficit or cut services.</p>
<p>If a government cuts too much, it can trigger deflation of their currency and push people to spend less produce less tax revenue</p>
<p>If a government cuts benefits, especially benefits already promised, that their populace was counting on. Then you may push large sections of your population into poverty which stalls the movement of money in the economy and reduces consumer spending( because fewer people have money to spend on luxuries) which reduces tax income.</p>
<p>So it's a huge issue not because it's necessarily a bad thing, (it kind of just is). It's an issue because the economies of the world are based on certain assumptions, one of which is that the economy will generally grow or at least have a larger cashflow and that is based on growing population</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your population declines, wouldn't the benefits that the government needs to provide also decline? I'm sure there's some non-linearity to consider, as well as population-independent government spend categories like defense, but broadly, I would have assumed that government income and spend would both go down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sustainable birth rate is something like 2.3 children per family. Immigration helps with that number but many major, nations have a lower birth rate. In Japan it was last recorded as 1.46. In the US it was 1.84. In the UK it was 1.81. These numbers have a decreasing trend with time while developing countries experience population booms that emigrate to other countries.</p></div>		</li>
