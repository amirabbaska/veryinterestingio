			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow,
Literally everyone? Does that mean everyone should be exposed to the full risk of the market regardless of their age? Good luck when your 70, have all your money in an indexed fund and that index loses 50% of its value. Not sure you'd be singing the same tune. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be biased, but when it comes to the problems related to regulation in the market, there's always this kind of cacophony of why it's always going to hurt this or hurt that, but rarely, if ever, do I remember (again, maybe biases here) anyone in the industry going, &quot;<em>You know what?</em> Gosh. Yes. Yes. You're right. There are some things we could do better in order to limit potential fraud and deceit.&quot; Instead what seems to always be said is more akin to, <a href="http://media.veryfunnypics.eu/2014/08/funny-pictures-that-moment-when-you-realize-it-wasnt-a-fart.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;Whaaaaaaaat? Noooo. Noo, I don't think so. No. Well, hrmm.&quot;</a>  </p>
<p>Edit: I mean, maybe there's really <em>nothing</em> at all whatsoever that could be done to really benefit the most amount of people. That's a possibility. Pretty unlikely, I think. I'm sure it's pretty hard to identify the problem sometimes, too, though.  </p></div>		</li>
