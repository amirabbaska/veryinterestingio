			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why escape &quot;velocity&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. Interestingly, in French it's the escape &quot;vitesse&quot; (i.e. speed) and not &quot;vélocité&quot;, which is a bit clearer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the the particle was less than escape velocity it won't go into orbit. To reach orbit you need to accelerate at least twice- once to get your maximum altitude where you want it, and again to get your minimum altitude where you want it. You can't adjust your minimum altitude to any altitude higher than your current altitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  Another way to think about it is, your orbit passes through the point at which you last accelerated.  So even with no atmosphere and lower energy, any non-escape trajectory which originates from the surface will always intersect the surface.</p>
<p>Unless maybe the last &quot;acceleration&quot; was bouncing the particle off some other random particle (or satellite) which is already in orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. If an object's velocity is above a planet's escape velocity, then, assuming no friction, it will never orbit the planet. The orbital speed at a given height will always be lower than the escape velocity at that same point, regardless of the orbit (so long as the orbit is elliptical).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;nor will it ever be measurable at that scale.&quot; This statement has been said in so many ways about so many things in science, and yet every day some unmeasurable thing is measured, some unfindable thing is found, some unquantifiable thing is quantified. That's actually how science works, we look for the impossible things and then we do them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only on neutral hydrogen atoms - proton plus electron. The problem with individual protons is their charge - even tiny electric fields lead to forces orders of magnitude stronger than gravity.</p>
<p>There are ongoing projects to measure the gravitational acceleration of antimatter (antihydrogen), but that would be an antiproton with a positron.</p></div>		</li>
