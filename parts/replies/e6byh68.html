			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you have a billion tiny pebbles flying around a planet. Gravitational pull of the planet keeps them all spinning, but they are all messed up, spinning with different speed and in different directions. You, however, can take all speeds and directions and calculate an average for them all. </p>
<p>Each pebble, however tiny it is, has its own tiny mass and tiny gravitational pull. And that gravitational pull affects every other pebble flying by. As they all pull and bump each other, their speeds and directions slowly change and eventually become very close to that average speed and direction. And as more and more pebbles join the disc, pebbles outside are pulled into it stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>Edit: those pebbles also collide from time to time, which makes the whole process a bit faster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So imagine a super simplified version of a star with a cloud of gas/dust spinning around it in a sphere. For the sake of simplicity, lets say there are 5 objects orbiting it, all roughly the same speed and distance from the sun, on the same plane, 2 going in one direction, and 3 in the other. Eventually you are going to get a head-on collision that effectively stops 2 of the objects, and the 2 of them will fall into the star. Then 2 more will do the same, leaving one object, going in the direction that had the strongest orbit. </p>
<p>Now imagine that process repeated for every plane relative to the star. And then collisions bewteen objects on other planes. Each plane+direction will have a certain amount of energy they start with, and they will all lose energy roughly equally to collisions. Eventually, the planes with the lowest energy simply get everything knocked out of them, and they will disappear one by one, more-or-less from the lowest energy plane to the highest. And then, when there is only one plane left, it will be the one that started with the highest amount of energy. That might mean the highest average speed, or mass, or some combination.  But it will eventually dominate the rest, and either pull objects into that plane, slow them enough to fall into the star, or accelerate them enough to eject them from orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tl;dr: because conservation of angular momentum. </p>
<p>Any 3-dimensional system of particles will have a &quot;net&quot; rotation about some axis. </p>
<p>Basically, this means that over a long period of time, the motions of particles that aren't rotating around that axis will be cancelled out due to collision and gravitational interference, leaving a 2-D system that rotates about that perpendicular axis. </p>
<p>Essentially, the system will go from a cloud, to a flattened sphere, to a disk shape. Later, things tend to coalesce into planets as denser concentrations of particles clump up, exert even more gravitational influence, and sweep their orbits clean. Thus, this rather neatly explains the development process and eventual shape of solar systems and galaxies.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I find this property to be one of the most elegantly beautiful aspects of physics in general and orbital dynamics in particular.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on that, objects also dont have an even gravitational pull all round themselves as they rotate. So the &quot;shape&quot; of their gravitational pull tends to form a ring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, mostly because the rotational velocity causes the object to bulge in the middle. More mass in the middle, more gravity there too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all cause and effect at that scale. Since something of that size is rotating it's being streched. Take, for example, the Earth (or any of the other 7 planets) rotating around the Sun. If you give the Sun a &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; side, you'll notice that none of the planets actually rotate over them, we rotate at varying degrees to be sure, but it's the rotation keeping us more or less to the sides.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you cut a perfectly round cake in 4 even pieces, the straight lines heading to the pointy part form a 90° angle (or 194°F in American units - jk). If lines meet at a 90° angle, they are called orthogonal (in euclidean metric but ignore this bracket text). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I debated that.  Deleted it a wrote in a longer explanation not using the word orthogonal, but then thought it might be better to use it to keep the explanation from being too long. </p></div>		</li>
