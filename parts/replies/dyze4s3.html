			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any evidence on this? I really believe that this is actually true and works in both directions: If you can quickly process information and solve a problem, your memory might store less information as it is more effective (for this person) to quickly solve a problem new, instead of remembering the solution. Same for anything else: you can navigate with a gps, you loose your sense of orientation, cause it's easier to get to the destination with your phone. </p>
<p>Comparing myself with people that have better/worse memories. it seems that their &quot;problem solving ability&quot; (like maths, but for many different problems) seems to be related exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>I have no proof though and telling someone they might have a less efficient brain as they have a good memory, is not really a great way to open a discussion about this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the study backing my OC. Take it for what worth.</p>
<p>If you think about it, its beneficial to forget. If you remembered everything that you learned, experienced, etc., then you run into a problem where you could be holding incorrect information and newly learned correct information potentially creating a conflict or having to train yourself to think I learned this but it's actually this. Think Columbus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kind of believe it. I believe I have a very good photographic memory and can remember conversations from years ago but when I try to solve a math problem in my head its like I just forgot where I was in the problem.</p>
<p>If I right it down I can solve it fine and generally pretty fast. Also Iâ€™m horrible at remembering numbers but if I right it down I will remember it photographically.</p>
<p>And in school/college I would just look at the notes I made or were handed out right before a test and I would just basically see the page in my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with photographic memory isn't that the brain &quot;fills up&quot;, scientists are still unsure that is even possible, but that when you try to remember <em>anything</em> you don't just pick out the single detail you need, you remember every single moment and you end up remembering so much that it slows down being able to pick something out, it's there but you need to find it.  In a lot of situations this isn't that much of an issue (and can be helpfull such as in acting or reciting information), but in split second decision making, or utilizing information (ie college stuff at work, you need to utilize some formula or spatial reasoning) this often works against you, and makes you slower at doing mental tasks rather than faster.  All brains can work this way (lightning has struck people and they've gotten photographic memory afterwards) but we have mechanisms built into us for us to <em>stop</em> remembering un-important details.  In our modern systems of schooling and life it just happens this ends up not being debilitating, but it wouldn't have been so good in the past. </p></div>		</li>
