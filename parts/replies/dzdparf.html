			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this.  If you have division by 0 you can't have a field, so the things that do have division by 0 can't be algebraic, and end up being more geometric things where you aren't usually dividing and multiplying anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a much better answer than the current top answer, which mentions the projectively extended reals and Riemann sphere. Implying that the OP's idea is in fact done in mathematics is  misleading to a layperson, and explaining why the projectively extended reals aren't REALLY doing what he suggests (or, at least they break almost everything else he understands about numbers) requires introducing the definition of a field and analyzing multiple algebraic structures.</p>
<p>This answer is very useful because it considers the context in which the question was asked. </p></div>		</li>
