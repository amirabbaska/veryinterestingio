			<div class="markdown"><p>To even begin to do an analysis you would need to subtract the price of the above ground sections and connecting existing sections.  Frankly I would discard it as part of the dataset and only make apples-to-apples comparisons as there are plenty of other subway constructions worldwide, even in the London Underground system.</p>
<p>If we were to run some basic math, there's 26 miles of tunnels in Crossrail, so you're looking at a maximum cost of US$800 million/mile.  Assuming above ground sections, which are the majority of the length, are one-third of the total cost, that's about $500 million/mile.  The proposed NYC 2nd Avenue line is $2 billion/mile, indicating that the NYC line is very roughly 4x the cost per mile as Crossrail.</p></div>		</li>
