<p>The best current understanding of the big bang is that there was a region of space with a large but finite amount of dark energy that inflated, and then the dark energy decayed into the normal matter and energy we see today, without there ever being a point where anything was at an infinite density.</p>

<p>I'm confused here.  Are you saying there was no Big Bang?  Or is &quot;inflated&quot; another way of saying &quot;Bang&quot;?  And the &quot;dark energy decaying&quot; is the cooling down with matter forming?  Is this semantics or is there something distinctly different in this explanation that has deviated from the usual Big Bang description of a huge dense explosion?  Also, thanks for taking the time to respond to OP.  It's much appreciated by us pedestrians.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a big bang, but inflation is something that happened <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/" target="_blank">immediately prior to it</a>, or depending on semantics, it could be considered as the first or second stage of the big bang, with all the <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/relativity-space-astronomy-and-cosmology/history-of-the-universe/big-bang-expansion-not-explosion/" target="_blank">hot explosiony-but-not-actually-an-explosion</a> stuff coming immediately after it and being a by-product of it.  You're probably familiar with the idea that as we go back in time, the universe was smaller, denser and hotter, and this is what leads to the idea that if we go far enough back, the universe was an infinitely dense and infinitely hot point with all the mass and energy of the entire universe in a singularity, and often the idea is put forward that space and time itself began at that point 13.7 billion years ago, but this is lies-for-children, i.e. wrong.</p>
<p>The current understanding is that if you go far enough back, instead of arriving at a singularity, you arrive at a small patch of space not terribly unlike the space around us today, but that for some reason had a lot of something we call dark energy, though not an entire universe's-worth of it.  This dark energy caused an exponential expansion of this patch of space, making it become more and more spacious internally without actually expanding into the space around it (space is weird like that; don't worry too much about it).  After the initially small region of space had doubled in size at least 60 or so times, and possibly more, a phase-change occurred in which the dark energy field which was powering this inflation began to couple to the other quantum fields that permeate space, like the electric field, magnetic field and strong and weak nuclear fields, and began dissipating it's energy into them by producing unstable massive particles called inflatons that then decayed into a hot soup of other massive particles, which themselves decayed until what was left was stable particles like electrons, positrons, photons, quarks, anti-quarks, neutrinos and other particles that we're familiar with.  The universe was still expanding at this point, but the expansion started slowing down instead of accelerating exponentially now that most of the dark energy had dissipated into other quantum fields, and that brings us to the hot big bang that has a very hot, very dense universe that slowly expands and cools off over the next 13.7 billion years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a lot of assumptions about Dark Matter which is a construct to work around the apparent missing mass according to observations.</p>
<p>There's also the idea that gravity is emergent behaviour rather than a property and that we simply don't understand this behaviour on the ludicrously huge scale of the Universe much like how quantum physics shows different behaviours on ludicrously small scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're confusing dark energy with dark matter; they're completely different concepts that are independent of each other and the only similarity is how little we know about them.  Dark energy is the force that's causing the current acceleration in the expansion of the universe that started within the past few billion years, and the same dark energy, or a different but similar sort of dark energy, may have caused a very rapid and dramatic expansion of space 13.7 billion years ago.</p></div>		</li>
