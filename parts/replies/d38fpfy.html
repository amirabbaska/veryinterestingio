			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The problem is with physics not engineering. Due to the laws of optics a telescope of a set diameter has a given maximum resolution for the wavelength of light being observed. In other words if I have a 5 meter telescope that means I will never have the resolution of a larger telescope provided we use the same wavelength (or frequency) of light (ignoring any engineering imperfections). </p></div>		</li>
