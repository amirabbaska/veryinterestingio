<p>However, it would be very tiresome and inefficient to have to contract this muscle the entire time that you’re asleep.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I'm very tired, perhaps with a headache, I find it very hard to keep my eyes closed. I have found that very strange, usually tiredness makes it hard to keep your eyes open. Your answer suggests that the reason is that I'm doing it with different muscles and I'm not really relaxed, which would explain a lot. Is that correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll preface this by saying I'm only a medical student, but I believe that there are a number of factors (not all completely and well understood -- there is actually an ENORMOUS amount of info that we don't yet understand about brain functions) that could contribute to this feeling. </p>
<p>For example, stress (including your body being tired) induces the release of cortisol to help fuel your body during stressful times. So if you're tired, but not ready for bed, cortisol would tell and help your body to stay awake. Additionally, stress could cause unconscious facial muscle contraction resulting in decreased ability to relax and close the eye. It may also be possible that if you have a headache, the stress from the headache could be keeping you more awake or your body may be able to deal with the headache better if the eyes are open and fixed on something rather than having no visual input when your eyes are closed. </p>
<p>Again these are all just possibilities, but it's also possible that each of these may contribute a little bit resulting in the overall promotion of keeping your eyes open even when you're tired. I hope this helps a little bit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true. Let me just further clarify that Levator palpebrae is dually innervated by both autonomic sympathetics and CN III. Hence when you lose sympathetic innervation, you still have a slight ptosis (droopy eyelid) even if CN III is completely unaffected. </p></div>		</li>
