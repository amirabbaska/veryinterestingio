<p>Reminds me of the documentary series &quot;7 Up&quot; that has been following a dozen children for the past 63 years. In the first installment, the group of 7 year olds are shown playing in basically a pile of building rubble! </p>
<p>And before people start waxing nostalgic for &quot;no rules play&quot;: I grew up in the 70's in a poor area outside Boston and my school was next to a dump. I watched a kid go down a slide we made out of piles of trash and he lost a testicle when he smacked them into a 2x4 that poked up! Sure, extremely rare, but horrifying. There was no blood, just ungodly screaming. Then the jokes started popping up a few months later when we learned what happened; he was too embarrassed to admit it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If there are any parents reading this now-- let your kids on the playground as long as the surfacing (what's under the play equipment) isn't hard like concrete or a thin layer of sand. That's what really causes the injuries!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're correct, injury on a hard surface is twice as likely: <a href="http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/7/1/35.short" target="_blank">http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/7/1/35.short</a></p>
<p>The surface can definitely reduce the risk of fatal injury and TBI, but it doesn't eliminate it entirely. Playgrounds remain a common cause of TBI in children: <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/04/28/peds.2015-2721?sso=1&sso_redirect_count=1&nfstatus=401&nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" target="_blank">http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/04/28/peds.2015-2721?sso=1&sso_redirect_count=1&nfstatus=401&nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My scope of focus is on Canada, where playground-related fatalities are negligible, so I can't speak statistically for other countries, but only around 8% of reported playground-related injuries could be attributed to the equipment itself when used properly (which is a whole other area of debate). I think as a society we have to be realistic. Is it possible for kids to get hurt when they're swinging and jumping off what are essentially metal cages 8+ feet above the ground? Yes, of course. But kids also get hurt playing sports, at home, in school, everywhere. If we can channel kids' energy into playgrounds and keep them from playing in the streets and other alternative, more dangerous areas than they're a success, in my book. We have to take the good with the bad. Just my two cents :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember playing on a giant ship themed playground. The top of the ship, which was not meant to be accessible, was probably 20 feet off the ground, if not higher. Of course, if you were great at climbing (like I was) you could get to the top via improvisational methods.</p>
<p>That was good times. Yeah you could get hurt. But I never had any serious injury. Meh. Parents are too wussy these days.</p></div>		</li>
