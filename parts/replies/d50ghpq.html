			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're referring to how marketing uses the term &quot;neutral pH&quot;, yes.</p>
<p>If you're comparing chemistry's neutral pH (the correct term), with that &quot;pH balanced&quot; malarkey no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is a vapid marketing term. Coores Light is &quot;frost brewed&quot;.  Well, brewing requires mashing at 150 degrees, and boiling, so those obviously aren't frosty. That only leaves lagering, a process that every single lager ever goes through, at just above freezing. </p>
<p>Their slogan may as well be &quot;Coores light lager. It's a lager!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
