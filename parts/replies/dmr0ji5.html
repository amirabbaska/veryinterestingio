			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn really? I use hydrogen peroxide like crazy. Is there any good time to use it? Specifically when there's a scab and it turns red (infections?) or any other time? When the wound hurts is when I use it the most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally hydrogen peroxide is not recommended. Just saline or regular water to irrigate dirt out. If you have an infection hydrogen peroxide won't clear it. You would need a topical antibiotic or if cellulitis then oral or IV antibiotic. </p>
<p>The wound healing process is pretty complex. But involves cells called fibroblasts to come from the periphery of the wound and extend over. This can look red and white. Most people think this is infection and wipe it off. This only prolongs healing. In fact in wound care clinics the scab is typically removed as the scab actually prolongs healing as well. </p>
<p>Now every wound it different and there are different ways to care for different wounds. So it's hard for me to elaborate on all of it. But generally if you get a wound irrigate it, apply a small amount of triple antibiotic ointment if it was a really dirty wound. Then dampen some gauze with saline and wrap the wound. </p>
<p>An uncovered wound takes twice as long to heal as a covered wound. The wound should also be damp but not soaking wet. Wound care is a pretty large emerging field in medicine. For a long time wounds were not properly cared for. However a lot of research is being done and we learn more every day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you come into the ED with a laceration, we don't pull out the peroxide. I don't think we even have any. We clean it out with forceps or brushes if there are bits in it, then irrigate the hell out of it with sterile water or saline. Then we sew it up. </p>
<p>Research shows tap water is just as effective. </p>
<p>Ditch the peroxide and just irrigate for a while. Go to the hospital or urgent care if it needs to be closed, or was from a dirty source (human or animal bite, rusty metal, knife used on raw meat, etc). Or if you haven't had a tetanus shot in the past 5-10 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Knew someone got a piercing and dabbed constantly with peroxide. For months it never healed, just constantly dabbing it. Year later it's fucking exactly the same and finally friend gets it looked at. Doctor just said stop with the peroxide or it'll never heal dumbass. So no peroxide and in days it scanned and then fully healed in about two weeks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a brown bottle and a clear bottle. The brown one is hydrogen peroxide and the other is 70% isopropyl alcohol. You explained in your top comment that the brown bottle is bad for wound cleaning. Should I, instead, use the clear bottle? because that also states it heals minor cuts/burns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isopropyl alcohol will kill bacteria but will also kill good cells that are needed for healing. In addition alcohol causes skin to dry out which would impair healing time. </p>
<p>In general the current recommendations are saline irrigation for most minor wounds. If there is large chunks of dirt in there then something like hydrogen peroxide or alcohol can help break that up. However those shouldn't be used on a daily basis to clean the wound as it will delay healing by killing the good cells that are trying to cover the wound. </p></div>		</li>
