<p>Run a Barbell based program. I would highly suggest <a href="https://startingstrength.com/get-started/programs" target="_blank">Starting Strength</a>, and get to learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYREQkVtvEc" target="_blank">how to do the Deadlift correctly.</a> </p>
<p>It's a movement that's impossible to do correctly without a flat, arched back - I got my deadlift up to the 200s and was really surprised when I didn't even have to think about correcting my posture; standing tall just happens naturally now. And reading through some of these comments, it's probably because my &quot;posture muscles&quot; just got stronger along with everything else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just tagging on to point out that from a posture and health perspective you don’t have to go heavy with deadlifts. If you want to lift 200 pounds, it’s the exercise to do it with, but if you just want to be healthy kettle bell deadlifts with 50 pounds will do you just fine. (Work your way up to it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any known negative effects of this recompression?  </p>
<p>I started rock climbing at 32 with horrible back muscles and posture.  I did not start working on my posture a few years in.  I had tried many times prior and it was incredibly difficult and uncomfortable.  After developing the muscles, it was still a little uncomfortable, but so much easier to work on.  </p></div>		</li>
