			<div class="markdown"><p>184 neutrons, 114 protons. It's on a so-called island of stability (like lead before it). Basically nuclear physics is similar to electron shell physics in this one aspect. There are shells of a particular configuration of the nucleus that impart stability to the nucleus</p></div>		</li>

<p>In many cases, neutron-rich isotopes are unstable and radioactive (true for the heavier elements, not so much for lighter or ones that aren't as neutron-rich). This means that they wouldn't exist indefinitely and the more exotic an isotope is, generally speaking, the shorter the half-life is.</p>
<p>Another thing to add is that stability is an emergent trait that varies for different environments. Relatively speaking, there does exist an environment that allows for something to be stable that wouldn't typically exist in another environment. For example, consider degenerate matter that exists within a neutron star and think about the likelihood of that matter here on Earth in our normal conditions.</p>
<p>To sum it up and to answer your question: yes, heavy and exotic elements can exist in the universe that aren't made synthetically but it isn't always feasible to observe them. Statistically, we acknowledge the possibility. In regards to the mention of stars and black holes, there are many types of stars and remnants of stars that exist without being a black hole that create many interesting types of matter and compounds.</p></div>		</li>
