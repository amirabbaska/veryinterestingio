			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the new ones are really sophisticated. For some people the new pacemaker/defibrillators monitor the condition of the heart and keep it within a broad range. So if your heart is going along normally it stays out of the way. But if it goes too slow the pacemaker can speed it up, if the rythym goes irregular it can straighten it out, and best of all if the heart stops it can give you a jump start!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandfather was un one of the original case studies that was started back in the 70's at st Joseph's hospital in Atlanta, ga. Every few years they'd upgrade his equipment. He went from 2 separate units in his chest &amp; then they gave him a single unit that we used to joke had a lifetime warranty. </p>
<p>Back in the prehistoric days, he used to have to hold his home phone receiver over his pacemaker and defibrillator to send a beep type signal to some machine to the dr office. </p>
<p>Also though, when he died, the defibrillator kept trying to jump start his heart back up &amp; it was a little sad to see him dead, but his chest kept moving him to start back up. The nurse put a heavy duty magnet on it to stop it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>heart stops it can give you a jump start</p>

<p>Isn't that a myth perpetuated by media? You can't restart flat liner with electricity. You can try with stimulants but not electricity </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand that's for big bursts from an outside defibrillator - they're trying to fix an irregular rhythm but if the heart is completely dormant that isnt going to work. The pacemaker could damn near run the heart itself with the newest models having leads attached to different areas of the heart muscle able to control the movement and flow of individual chambers. That statement I made is a necessary oversimplification since I don't understand enough about exactly how it performs its task on a technical level. What I do know is that on two occasions so far when my dad has gone in for his checkup and they've downloaded the log data from the device they've pinpointed times where his heart stopped while he was asleep and would have stayed stopped if not for the device. Effectively, the device recovered him from what would have been a fatal heart attack. Beyond that you'd have to ask someone in the cardiac technology sector for specifics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um that's not entirely true. Many pacemakers have an electrode sensing patient's own rhythm. If they detect it, they don't produce an impulse - there's no need to. If one doesn't come within a set interval, they send one of their own. </p>
<p>The most common type is j believe vvi, the first v referring to venteicular sensory electrode, the 2nd to the venteicular stimulating electrode, the i means it's inhibited by its own impulse. </p></div>		</li>
