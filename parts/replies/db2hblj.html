			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I think makes this question interesting. We're talking about gravitationally bound bodies but on what timescale? The earth is currently bound to the sun, but a body passing through at the right time could change that. So any answers are really only true today. At a different stage of cosmic or galactic evolution, they might be different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was about to say exactly this - they'll probably be somewhat rare. If I remember wel Fomalhaut is only a few hundred million years old, which is pretty young (the average star in the 'hood would have ~5-8 billion years)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just out of curiosity, what are you searching for, specifically, that this is the solution? What specific case or question are you trying to answer, and does it lead to your potentially answering something larger?</p></div>		</li>
