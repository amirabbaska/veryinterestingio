			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that if there target audience is women(works for men to) then they are most likely trying to social proof themselves. You ever notice that when a guy is in a relationship all of a sudden other girls begin to like him?, yet beforehand they didn't?, it's because of social proof, he's already shown himself to be worthy, and thus now they want him to. </p>
<p>The same applies to the shows, you get a bunch of people outside shouting and screaming, then it shows that these people are 'important' and that people care and that people love them. Then there little animalistic instincts start kicking in and the show is more appealing than it previously was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the big difference is, that I said it works for men, where as he basically said women are easier to manipulate than men. Also it's not what you say, but how you say it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This same phenomena of social proof is strong when you feel like you are having a shared experience with another group of humans.</p>
<p>For example, do you feel slightly more satisfied watching a tv show or movie live, versus DVR'd/Netflixed/downloaded? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are enthusiastic and they're enthusiastic about the thing you like to do in the morning and there's an elaborate ritual where you pretend that your life isn't a sad shell of what you wanted when you were a teenager.</p>
<p>A lot like the shots of screaming, crazy crowds in a pro sports stadium!</p>
<p>And yes, this can be extended to virtually any demographic, even many of the quiet shut-ins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of something I saw in the NBA finals last night. The final game was being played in Cleveland but fans of the Warriors were at the arena in Oakland to watch the game on the giant TVs (which is weird enough in and of itself but whatever).</p>
<p>When the broadcast cuts away from the game to the Warriors fans in Oakland they cheer &quot;wooo!&quot; when they realize there is a camera on them. They're cheering for the cameras. I think about 4/5ths of cheering and enthusiasm that you see on TV is like this, purely performative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh, yeah, now that Today is literally four hours long, it gets more and more obvious as the morning goes on that they couldn't care less how many men are watching. At least they sorta kinda pretend like they're aimed at everyone at 7 am (but at the same time, who's going to care more about the latest trending Twitter topics at 7:08, males or females?), after about 8:30 they drop all pretense. The 9-10 hour is just pablum, and Kathie Lee and Hoda from 10-11, well, its very existence speaks for itself. </p></div>		</li>
