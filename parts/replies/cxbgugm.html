<p>Serious question. If supernovas emit visible light and gravitational lensing bends light, are there space rainbows?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a great fucking question.</strong> In general relativity, gravitational lensing is independent of wavelength. All photons are bent the same, and there is no dispersion, so there are no space-rainbows. </p>
<p>However, there are a <em>lot</em> of theories that are modifications of general relativity that include wavelength dependencies where general relativity does not. If we somehow observed a space-rainbow through lensing it would be evidence for physics beyond Einstein, though to date it's never been seen.  </p>
<p>Any person who observes such a thing would not pass Go. They would not collect $200. They would go directly to Nobel Prize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unsure, but if you are traveling at great enough speeds (close to c) the light from the stars in front of you gets blueshifted, while the light from the stars behind you get redshifted, so you will see a &quot;starbow&quot; going from blue to red from the front of your ship to the back!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, but that's a totally different effect. That's the doppler effect and affects all light uniformly, he's talking about sorting light based off of wavelength, like a prism does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there is no direct path.  The spacetime is all bent all around that stuff.  Like there is no straight line through a forrest, the trees all get in the way and create multiple paths, some of which happen to be shorter.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So am I correct in understanding that the reason we know we'll see a SN in 2016 is because we've already seen it happen from one of the shorter paths so we know we'll see the same SN <em>again</em> on the longer paths?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So wouldn't it be more correct if we rewrite the OP title as &quot;<strong><em>The same supernova that we've seen before will be seen again in 2016</em></strong>&quot;? The original one seems to convey that we've seen a preview of the supernova and next year we are going to see the REAL thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no direct path in this case. Nothing is getting to us travelling in a perfectly straight line the entire time.</p>
<p>Making up numbers here, but let's say you have one going at a 98% direct path and another gonig at 98.1% direct path.</p>
<p>All of a sudden one of them arrives in 2014 and another in 2016. So we discover it happened sometime long ago as of 2014, but we can tell from lensing of that the other path has not quite reached us (it still looks like a star pre-nova).  And likely some way we can calculate the effect of the lensing to tell that one path is about 1-2 years shorter than the other, thus giving us the estimate on when the second will reach us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since a supernova is about the same brightness as a large galaxy like our own, we can generally only see a supernova with the naked eye if its host galaxy is also visible to the naked eye. That means the Milky Way (and its satellite galaxies) and Andromeda might have visible supernovae, but for any more distant galaxies you would need a telescope.</p>
<p>This galaxy is billions of light years away, and impossible to see without a very large telescope.</p></div>		</li>
