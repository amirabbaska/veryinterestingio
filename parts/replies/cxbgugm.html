			<div class="markdown"><p>...but how can we see the bent light before the direct light? That is, how is the most direct path not the shortest/soonest path?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there is no direct path.  The spacetime is all bent all around that stuff.  Like there is no straight line through a forrest, the trees all get in the way and create multiple paths, some of which happen to be shorter.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So am I correct in understanding that the reason we know we'll see a SN in 2016 is because we've already seen it happen from one of the shorter paths so we know we'll see the same SN <em>again</em> on the longer paths?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So wouldn't it be more correct if we rewrite the OP title as &quot;<strong><em>The same supernova that we've seen before will be seen again in 2016</em></strong>&quot;? The original one seems to convey that we've seen a preview of the supernova and next year we are going to see the REAL thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no direct path in this case. Nothing is getting to us travelling in a perfectly straight line the entire time.</p>
<p>Making up numbers here, but let's say you have one going at a 98% direct path and another gonig at 98.1% direct path.</p>
<p>All of a sudden one of them arrives in 2014 and another in 2016. So we discover it happened sometime long ago as of 2014, but we can tell from lensing of that the other path has not quite reached us (it still looks like a star pre-nova).  And likely some way we can calculate the effect of the lensing to tell that one path is about 1-2 years shorter than the other, thus giving us the estimate on when the second will reach us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So are you saying that if we point a telescope at one point in the sky, we can see this star in a pre-nova state, and if we move it juuuust a little to the left the same star can be observed going nova?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what exactly are we looking at when we choose to look at the different paths? Different types of light? Different objects? Are we pointing something in a different direction? Every path reaches us, so what are we looking at to see the different paths?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since a supernova is about the same brightness as a large galaxy like our own, we can generally only see a supernova with the naked eye if its host galaxy is also visible to the naked eye. That means the Milky Way (and its satellite galaxies) and Andromeda might have visible supernovae, but for any more distant galaxies you would need a telescope.</p>
<p>This galaxy is billions of light years away, and impossible to see without a very large telescope.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's insanely cool. Does it happen fast enough that we can record it and watch a video of it happening, perhaps sped up?</p></div>		</li>
