<p>Can you explain what this means in layman's terms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine code like this:</p>
<pre><code>startDate = '2015-12-01'</code></pre>
<p>Instead, you'd pull out the hardcoded value into a separate line of code:</p>
<pre><code>defaultStartDate = '2015-12-01'

startDate = defaultStartDate</code></pre>
<p>Now imagine 1000 lines of code, and you put all the hardcoded declarations at the top of the file, or even in a different file.</p>
<p>It takes more space in the code which <em>was</em> a problem in old systems, but it means you can easily find all your hardcoded values easily instead of having to search every line of code.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see! That makes sense, thanks. So that means that if you for some reason had to change the start date, you could just change it in that one place instead of going through the files and changing potentially hundreds of entries individually, right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not a hardcore coder, just do it every now and then as part of my job (AV control systems mostly), but even when I started back in 1997 this seemed like an obvious thing to do, and not just with dates. </p>
<p>Iâ€™ve seen commentators, comedians, even respected (ahem! I use the term lightly) politicians hand-wave Y2K like it was a lot of fuss about nothing. And I want to boff them on the nose. </p></div>		</li>
