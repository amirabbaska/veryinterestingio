			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly as contiguous rabbit noted.  But you can imagine that it was important for hearts to not be susceptible to cancer, because it is so vital.  Also, unlike epithelial cells (those lining organs like skin or the lining of the inside of the bowel) heart cells aren't exposed to the outside world or caustic agents like poisons, so they don't need to replicate themselves.  If epithelial cells didn't slough off and replenish, then you'd have all these damaged cells lying around or you'd scrape off all the skin on your knees.  Same with nerve cells, because the organization of the nerve is so important (you can't just connect one nerve to another because each nerve's function is relatively specific) it is important that they don't easily change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the problem. You have a heart attack, that tissue that died, is dead, and cannot be replaced with new healthy tissue. In fact, if bad enough that tissue that died can even decompose enough to burst open (myocardial rupture). </p></div>		</li>
