			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really how it's calculated. I used to work on the CMS experiment and my advisor worked on the actual temperature measurements. You're right that it's actually a calculation since we can't directly measure it. </p>
<p>The reason it can't work the way you suggest is b/c we have no way of measuring the exact volume that the energy is distributed over, the scale is way too small (10^-15 m). Furthermore, all of the energy of the collisions is not transferred into the thermal system. There is almost never a completely head on collision like this, they are typically glancing blows where only part of the initial kinetic energy transfers to the collision. Again, we have no way of measuring how much energy is transferred in an individual collision. </p>
<p>The way it's actually calculated is by observing what compound particles (particles made up of quarks and gluons, called &quot;hadrons&quot;) still exist inside the thermal system. At high energies the weakly bound particles will break apart into their constituent quarks and gluons and only the most tightly bound handrons will remain in tact. We have very good estimates of the binding energy of various hadrons so we can infer how much energy (i.e. at what temperature) would be required to break them apart. Thus, by taking careful measurements and determining the hadrons that are still bound together and those that are broken apart we can infer the temperature of the system. </p>
<p>A very rough analogy would be that if we had a system where only steam (i.e. water in a gaseous state) existed then we could be pretty certain the temperature is above 100C. If only liquid water exists then we can be pretty certain that the temperature is between 0C and 100C. </p></div>		</li>
