<p>Haha, I am guessing English is not your first language, but the way you wrote it is just a funny thought. The way you wrote it makes it sounds like the the authorities are protecting the reporters because the children and coach are the ones doing the attacking.</p>
<p>Everyone knows what you mean, though. You would just need to flip where &quot;scum&quot; and &quot;children/coach&quot; are. So it would read something like &quot;Glad the authorities are protecting the children and coach from these scum.&quot; or something like that. No big deal! Just thought I'd let you know in case you were curious how it should be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm interested hearing this after reading about the farmer whose rice crops were damaged by all the water pumped out of the caves onto her farm.  Commenters in that thread were commending her spirit and compassion and were saying that respect for others is a trait that is central to Thai culture.  Obviously there are all types of people in any one culture, but it just makes me think. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your perspective u/lunaticneko.</p>
<p>I saw an illustration made by a thai artist honoring the rescue, with an accompanying explanation on what the different characters symbolised (they were all different kinds of animals). There was a flock of birds flying against the rest of the characters, and they represented the media and thai bloggers who criticized the rescue. </p>
<p>I was quite confused, in my eyes the (western) media has been quite ethical - although the rescuers probably had some unwanted pressure and attention  even from the most well-meaning reporters. Maybe the illustration had some general critique towards all media, but after reading your comment I think it might have been aimed at thai media (and other disruptive reporters).</p>
<p>I was also very curious about the aforementioned bloggers. I tried to do research on the topic but I wasn't able to find anything. Can you (or anyone else) elaborate on that? Were their messages widespread/were there a lot of critical opinions? What was their ciritque about?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's the first one in the article. Sorry I can't check now if the characters explanation is there but mainly the different animals represent the different nationalities of the rescuers and the boars are the boys</p></div>		</li>
