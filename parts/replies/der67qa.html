			<div class="markdown"><p>Brilliant! The best thoughts are those when still slightly drunk. Lol. I love a shower when I am dying from a hangover. Glass of cold af water, steamy room, shower cranked up high...me laying on down in the bath letting the shower just rain down on me. If you try this you'll wanna roll over every now and then as you tend to get cold in the places the shower doesn't hit.
Oh and to answer your question- because they are difficult little people. Haven't grasped the concept of the shower.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm still like this in the morning. Sitting on the toilet browsing reddit with the shower running making the bathroom nice and warm, not wanting to get in the shower because it's a step closer to going to work. Then not wanting to get out of the shower because it feels so good and the air will feel comparatively colder</p></div>		</li>
