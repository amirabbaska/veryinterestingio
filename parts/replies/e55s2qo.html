			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess once you hit certain performance levels you don't need cheat as much or you can cheat in better ways. Think of say AA, with low resolutions you have lots of different ways to do it, with more performance you can use different methods, and at the other end if you manage to increase your resolution enough you could get rid of AA all together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the beauty of very high resolutions. When you start to get to where you literally can’t see the individual pixels then things like aliasing stop being perceivable. All I want is a display so high res that it’s physically impossible for me to see individual pixels at any distance without the use of magnification. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be very close to that with a 4k monitor.  I read an article about how most people can't tell the difference between a 1080p and a 4k television from 10 ft away.  The physical size of the monitor, the distance you are viewing from and how good your vision is would determine your max noticeable resolution.  In other words you can do that now if you get a small monitor with 4k resolution and sit far away!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They made it better by using fixed function hardware for ray generation and intersection, even then the ray count is simply too low for clean results which is where the tensors come in to run deep learning denoise on sparse ray results.</p></div>		</li>
