<p>Many of the detergents are &quot;surface active&quot;. What does this mean? Why does this work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can try to explain the surface active part. (any corrections are welcomed)</p>
<p>Surface active is other way to call the sufractants. Sufractants are responsible for the reduce of the surface tension of the solvent (in this case water)</p>
<p>What is Surface tension?</p>
<p>Surface tension (ST) in water works more or less like a wall to non polar solvents/molecules (every solvent has ST). The water molecules have a preference to side with itself than with the other molecules.
In structural mechanincs one of the &quot;stronger&quot; shapes in terms of resistance againsts pressure is the circular shape. If you see models of oil in water, the oil organizes in circles because it is the stronger way to resist against the ST.</p>
<p>Why is this important?</p>
<p>Because if we reduce the ST the amount of organic (nonpolar) molecules capable of being dissolved in water increases. The resistance decreases</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good old soap contains fatty acids. What I remember is that one of the ends of those molecules is polar (?) and another isn't and that's how they manage to attach to fat and other organic (not so polar) molecules and make them soluble in water (a polar solvent). Is this true?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yup is true. Fatty acids are aliphatic so one end is polar while the other end isn't. When they are mixed with water they form micelles (<a href="http://www.beautybythegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/micelle-1024x644.png" target="_blank">http://www.beautybythegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/micelle-1024x644.png</a>)</p>
<p>Imagine micelles as circle shape. The polar part are on the outside of the circle as a barrier (water is also polar) while the non-polar are kept in the inside of the circle. Any hidrophobic (non-polar) molecules in solution will be more stabilized inside the micelle.</p></div>		</li>
