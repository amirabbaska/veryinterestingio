<p>Salt content:</p>
<p>(Lowest) Potable &lt; brackish &lt; saltwater (highest)?</p>
<p>Assuming not agricultural or domestic - Can brackish water serve other uses; industrial process water, cooling tower, etc? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other poster is not entirely correct. I work in oil and gas and a load of Saudi and some Asian refineries and chem plants run on saltwater cooling. Process water probably not because of the heat and pressure (sodium cracking) but if your exchangers are sized up enough to prevent high skin temperatures, single cycle seawater cooling is possible- you spend more on pumps and biofouling control (algae and mollusks will clog your shit up). There are also a load of closed loop systems where they take a batch of seawater and repeatedly chill it, so it’s not a traditional cooling tower system. These types get expensive to treat because you’re always adding some kind of mitigation treatment to either the chiller or the seawater. The economics of it just mean that river/surface water is typically cheaper for folks in the US so they go there first. The plants in Saudi are newer and designed for saltwater use (sizing and metallurgy) and the cost to retrofit most MUCH older plants elsewhere does not meet the “3-5 yr ROI” required for most capital projects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, yes, potable or fresh water and saltwater or sea water could be thought as the extremes. Brackish water is when the salt content lies in between these extremes. Classification of waters is most frequently done using conductivity since it is directly related with salt content.</p>
<p>After treatment, brackish water can be used for industrial processes or in cooling towers (not talking about feasibility here, just the water quality permeating the RO setup). As mentioned above, the water can be further purified with EDI to reach ultrapure grade for specific applications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not too much, as most pipe and components are pvc and frp (except some metallurgy on the high pressure piping). The salt concern is mostly the fouling potential of precipitates such as iron, magnesium, and carbonates, and silica. Thankfully, a proper softening and pretreatment program will keep those in check. But it comes at increased chemical consumption and solids disposal costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The levels of salt in water determine the material of the pipe network that precedes the intake of the RO. For sea water, 316 steel is mostly prefered to withstand corrosion.</p></div>		</li>
