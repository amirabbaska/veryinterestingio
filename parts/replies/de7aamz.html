<p>I wouldn't say that you can assume your instrument does not contribute error. Every measurement you make with that instrument will likely be within that uncertainty it is certified to. On the user end, ignorant people completely ignore those affects. You are correct on the calibration side that the TURs mean that the uncertainty can have a negligible impact when calibrating. However, certain measurements always have issues. NIST can propagate UV measurements on the order of 5-6%. Manufacturers often claim better accuracy than NIST using electrical-only calibrations. Only recently have we convinced some of them to put&quot;relative to NIST&quot; in the spec.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great clarification, and I agree completely. I think we're on the same page.</p>
<p>I was probably unclear in my statement that it's important to do a proper study for a specific measurand.
A good example is a production line, say for a car. They have a torque driver for the engine mount bolts and has a required accuracy of 5% in order to get the bolt to acceptable specifications. If they also have a similar bolt with similar torque to hold on the bumper, but it's OK to get that bolt within 20%, it's not safe to assume that the tool used for the bumper bolt is OK for the motor.
In addition to accuracy, the operator can have significant impact. Also the Measurement setup. Say the bumper is wide open and easy to torque down, but the access in the engine bay is restricted and difficult. Even though you may use the tool with the proper accuracy, you may not be able to realize that specification. Hence the importance of doing a study to verify the tool, operator, and environment are all appropriate.</p>
<p>That's what I was trying to clarify, that only after doing a r &amp; r, possible control charts, or possibly other means can you assure your instrument accuracy will not affect the measurand in a significant way.
You're absolutely correct that grabbing any old torque wrench and yanking on those bolts doesn't assure you of anything.</p></div>		</li>
