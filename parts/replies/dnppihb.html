			<div class="markdown"><p>The fire hazard arises anywhere the Al makes a junction with a material of significantly different coefficient of thermal expansion. Over time the differing rates of expansion and contraction can lead to gaps forming between the two conductors, producing arcing which may serve as an igniton source. However, we now have a techniques to circumvent this problem or retrofit older homes that posses Al wiring.</p>
<p>While not quite feasible today, ill speculate that carbon based transmission lines could arise. These might use conductive carbons or conductive polymers to transmit electricity. Additionally tight-beam energy transfer by microwaves could also be used. Finally I have seen research into calcium nanoparticles being used within transmission lines which could reduce the overall amount of Al necessary - I'm sure there are variants on this with other materials. Not quite sure if any of these approaches could scale to the level of our current grid.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the solution is to make <em>everything</em> out of Aluminium, right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>How would this be done in a home with Copper-clad aluminum, short of tearing out drywall and redoing all of the wiring? The use of CCA in my house kind of terrifies me, and with any wiring I do I refuse to use anything other than <a href="http://www.kinginnovation.com/products/20/3-port-alumiconn" target="_blank">AlumiConn</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silver is such a good conductor that the Manhattan Project used it for windings in the cyclotrons needed to enrich uranium (copper was in short supply).  They borrowed almost 14,000 tons of it from the Treasury.  </p>
<p>During the manufacturing process, the shavings and scraps were carefully collected, and they ripped up and burned the floorboards afterwards to recover silver dust.  All told, only about eight pounds of silver was lost out of all 14,000 tons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, but the numbers appear to be radically different from what you've stated, according to <a href="https://www.pugetsound.edu/files/resources/7579_AmericanScientist-Article%20Treasury%20Silver.pdf" target="_blank">this Scientific American article from a few years ago.</a> The Manhattan Project actually lost eleven thousand (11,000) pounds of the silver checked out from the Treasury (about 0.036% of the total). However, this loss was offset (and then some) by the fact that they gained <em>1.5 million pounds</em> of silver back before the check-out even started - this occurred because the Treasury decided to pre-clean their machining equipment in order to facilitate careful tracking for the Manhattan Project, and in the process collected 1.5 million pounds of silver shavings etc. that had accumulated over the prior decades.</p>
<p>FWIW, I was also under the impression that only a tiny amount of silver was lost, but I think I actually got this from the movie <em>Fat Man and Little Boy</em>, which is chock-full of historical inaccuracies, unfortunately. 11,000 pounds lost is still actually pretty good given the scale of the project, and it wasn't like people were walking off with the stuff - a large percentage was lost in the melt-down process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh.  So this <a href="https://history.army.mil/html/books/011/11-10/CMH_Pub_11-10.pdf" target="_blank">booklet</a> on page 133 says that &quot;less than one thirty-six thousandth of one percent&quot; was lost.  That amount is how I got the 8 pounds (14,700 short tons total).  If you take 0.036% of the same, you get 10,584 pounds).  </p>
<p>At some point, the fractions got mixed up.  Not sure which one is more credible.  The booklet's amount (if I'm reading it correctly) should be 1 percent (0.01) divided by 36,000, or 0.000000278.  The article's amount is 36 thousandths of one percent, or 0.00036.</p>
<p>Which one is right?  Beats me.  I guess it might merit a dive into the booklet's sources.  </p>
<p>Edit:  I do agree that 5 tons out of nearly 15 thousand is still an excellent track record.  I'm increasingly skeptical that they could confidently say 8 pounds had been lost with all the uncertainties in measurement along the way.  I think the margins of error would stack up so that the amount could maybe be accurate to 500 pounds at best.</p></div>		</li>
