<p>Is this when they build large shopping plazas in an inconvenient location and half of them sit empty for a year, while the other half become a chiropractors office, shitty nail salon, even shittier pizza place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NIMBYs always say &quot;How dare you ruin my view! But what about my view!&quot; </p>
<p>They are the main reason why San Francisco is so expensive. They are the reason why San Francisco refuses to build upwards, and a major tech city is crammed into a bunch of old 3 story apartments from the 50's.  Much of San Francisco has a 40 foot height limit, which limits building height to 3 or 4 stories. </p>
<p>You bought a 50 inch 4K TV and you complain about the view? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are oversimplifying.  Another concern for NIMBYs is property value.  If the housing supply suddenly quadrupled in Mountain View with high rise apartment buildings property values could tank leaving a large number of buyers in the last decade upside down on their mortgages in city that is no longer navigable due to traffic from the population explosion.</p>
<p>It appears inevitable that it will happen eventually but to be blunt theBay Area / SF isn't ready for the population explosion that would happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course no one wants to.  But NIMBYism leads to something similar to Tragedy of the Commons. Of course no one wants a condo tower in their backyard.  And if everyone gets their way, there's no condo towers.  And that effects <em>everyone</em> negatively in the long term.  Do you hate freeway traffic?  Well, everyone is on the freeways because no one can afford to live in the city because no one allowed those condo towers to be built.  Are you worried about a stagnating economy?  Well, an economy might start stagnating if consumers have less disposable income, because every cent they have is tied up paying increased housing costs because no one allowed those condo towers to be built.<br />
Sometimes you have to separate what you want from what's better long term for everyone.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally only find NIMBY's annoying when they're obviously hypocrites. It's all &quot;Not In My Back Yard&quot; until they decide to sell up. Then all of a sudden they bitch to the city council about overly restrictive the regulations are because they've just found out that if they could build a 10 story apartment building in their area the home will be worth twice as much. Meanwhile the family that just moved in next door have become the new NIMBY's trying to stop this guy building an apartment building.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These people drive me insane. They are trying to build a tall building in the dt core next to a very busy train station in a city near me. And one guy was quoted as saying 'I feel like were building this to impress our neighbours, but why should we try and impress them?'</p>
<p>He literally didn't understand that density is about having a home. Not making cool fancy buildings, people are being priced out of having a place to live. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like Portland. I once saw someone complaining on Reddit that building a large apartment building on an empty lot across the river from DOWNTOWN would destroy the small town character of the area.... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My MIL literally cried when she saw that building go up.  It’s not like she was born in Portland (moved there from CA like everyone else), and though the building is kind of soulless, it’s hot completely horrific nor out of place.  Worse, that kind of attitude makes Portland less affordable for renters like her, though she’s never going to leave and will just continue renting rooms from entitled boomer friends in the country who are laughing all the way to the bank.</p></div>		</li>
