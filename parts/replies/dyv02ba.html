<p>I've never had it happen myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's anything like Prince Rupert's Drops, a higher temperature gradient will make it happen more frequently (i.e. forming a surrounding layer of ice before the centre can cool and shrink). So colder freezer and/or warmer water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve seen it happen dozens of times.</p>
<p>I have these silicone molds that make ice spheres for drinking whiskey.</p>
<p>The problem however is that the outside freezes faster than the inside creating quite a bit of stress.</p>
<p>Often I’ll pour something on top of it and it will crack violently and shoot liquid to the ceiling.</p>
<p>I discovered that if I freeze the mold while it is in a cooler inside the freezer it freezes slow enough to prevent this.  However it’s such a pain in the butt I’d rather deal with the small chance of an explosion haha</p></div>		</li>
