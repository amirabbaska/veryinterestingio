			<div class="markdown"><p>You oftentimes can still see it when you are close enogh; not every button he presses has to chance the beat (they listen to something on their headphones oftentimes to make sure it sounds good/matches the beat before releasing it to the audience), but you can see oftentimes when they manipulate something live. Also: just look at the DJ. Does he look really concentrated and in tune with the music, or just cool? If it's the latter, chances are he is doing nothing... Oh and mistakes! When they play live, they can happen. Thats why I love it sometimes when they mess up, because noone gives a shit if the set was great before, it just makes us appreciate even more that a single man or woman has us dancing like maniacs for the past five hours straight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the record sound/music is playing from the record, then manipulating the records is 'A' effect too, then turning knobs to make bass, treble, or highs go down or up, but of course turtablists do all of that, and add a beat machine to what they are doing too, which is all of these things at once, I should have mentioned the turning knobs before to make bass, treble, and highs go up or down, but I just have a loathing for Djs who cannot scratch, and mix like some turtablists can, I happened to be one in the 90s, a good example of what I'm talking can be looked up on YouTube. 'Dj Unkut Presents Traktor'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You must not be a dj. You'd be surprised how much djs are actually doing during a show. Yes some just act like they are pressing a bunch of buttons, but more often than not, they are completely engaged the entire show. So loading songs, pre-eq, beat matching, tempo matching, key matching, effects mixing, the list goes on. I'd recommend watching Laid Back Luke's In My Mind videos for more info on this. (I think thats what they're called) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, DJs mix records into each other, turntablists do scratches, beat juggling etc. You kinda say it yourself, but originally a disc jockey (DJ) just did the selection and playback on a radio station and later dance clubs. Nowadays there are so many technologies, techniques and styles that many DJs include turntablism or some other kind of performance component in their DJ sets.</p></div>		</li>
