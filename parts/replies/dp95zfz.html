<p>The argument though is that a pure hydrophobic surface actually increases drag due to eliminating a boundary layer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not the case. If the boundary layer were eliminated, there'd be no skin friction.</p>
<p>The problem is more complicated and probably has a lot to do with imperfections and non-water elements in sea water. Imagine a little piece of sand brushes up against the hull. It's hydrophobic, not sandophobic, so the sand might create a super tiny scratch. Even within the crevice of a hydrophobic scratch, you will have water suddenly changing direction and creating turbulent flow, which changes the pressures around the area. If those pressures are changed enough to surpass the envelope of separation, you will have a spot with the sudden creation of a boundary layer. Once a boundary layer happens, more turbulence and pressure changes will follow and may result in a chain reaction. If it happens enough, you could end up with more net skin friction even if the majority of the surface remains separated from the water, because you will have zones with boundary layers that have to perform more work to achieve a velocity gradient. Velocity gradients don't waste as much energy once they're already formed, but can cause an impulse once they are.</p></div>		</li>
