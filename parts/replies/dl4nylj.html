			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! This is the most helpful answer. I should have sentenced my question like you did.</p>
<p>I do remember that example of these sickle cells. If I recall it they are squared when watched under the microscope. Hence why the vascularity isn't optimal?</p>
<p>I never realized that our understanding of an organism (even a human) is that dependant on its environment. I had complicated the problem a little bit. </p>
<p>Thanks again for your time.</p>
<p>Edit: I needed to take a stepback so to see the broad picture. The Kansas-Kenya example did the job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, the cells are kind of half -moon shaped. So they get stuck on each other, especially at sharp turns in your vascular system hence the swelling. Interestingly the shape of the cells isn't what protects from Plasmodium infection (Cerebral malaria, the kind that kills you, is a Plasmodium parasite infection).  </p>
<p>The production of a certain kind of protein (heme-oxygenase 1 or HT-1) which is produced more by sickle cells makes carbon monoxide gas. Here's a quote that sums it up better than I can with the summery of two line of research that explain this mechanism: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110428123931.html" target="_blank">&quot;...Ana Ferreira demonstrated that when produced in response to sickle hemoglobin the same gas, carbon monoxide, protected the infected host from succumbing to cerebral malaria without interfering with the life cycle of the parasite inside its red blood cells.&quot;</a></p>
<p>So we can see here that we knew that sickle cell hemoglobin protects against malaria since the 1950's but it took 60 years to understand by what means the cells conferred an advantage. Then we can further note that interactions between OT-1, sickle hemoglobin, Plasmodium parasites, and carbon monoxide is again relating the composition of the sickle cells to their environment (the blood stream). Composition informs context. Context informs composition. And around and around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sickle-cell story gets even more interesting than that, actually, because both the severity of the disease and the resistance to malaria depends on whether you inherited a single copy (from one of your parents) or two copies (one from each parent) of the sickle-cell version of the gene in question.</p>
<p>Heterozygotes for the trait (i.e. people with one sickle-cell and one regular version of the gene) aren't (much) afflicted by sickle-cell anemia, but still gain some resistance against malaria. This contributes toward bringing up the frequency of the sickle-cell version in malaria-rich areas. Although heterozygotes seem to get the best deal considering the circumstances, the children of two heterozygote carriers will run a 25% risk of inheriting two copies and, unlike their parents, developing full sickle-cell anemia.</p></div>		</li>
