			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrating is the most important thing to do, but another trick, which I'm testing myself and seems to be working well, is taking N-Acetyl Cysteine supplement 30 min before you start drinking and the morning after. It's the same thing they give you at the hospital for acetaminophen overdose. It's a ready precursor to glutathione, which your liver produces to inactivate the acetaldehyde build-up from drinking (it has other purposes too, like being your body's main antioxidant).  I've read that NAC could actually function as a pro-oxidant if you take it while you are drinking/drunk, so take it only before or afterward. I got mine online, but you can find it in drug stores .. sometimes categorized under liver support. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd heard that before, but there's research out there which shows it might be more from immune factors than acetaldehyde.
&quot;These analyses showed that concentrations of various hormones, electrolytes, free fatty acids, triglycerides, lactate, ketone bodies, cortisol, and glucose were not significantly correlated with reported alcohol hangover severity. Also, markers of dehydration (e.g., vasopressin) were not significantly related to hangover severity. Some studies report a significant correlation between blood acetaldehyde concentration and hangover severity, but most convincing is the significant relationship between immune factors and hangover severity. The latter is supported by studies showing that hangover severity may be reduced by inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis. Several factors do not cause alcohol hangover but can aggravate its severity. These include sleep deprivation, smoking, congeners, health status, genetics and individual differences.&quot; from '<a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cdar;jsessionid=1ocr1f1v2j5va.x-ic-live-01" target="_blank">http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cdar;jsessionid=1ocr1f1v2j5va.x-ic-live-01</a>'
Based on my academic research (PhD in glycobiology working on gut microbiota) my theory is that it has something to do with intestinal inflammation. </p></div>		</li>
