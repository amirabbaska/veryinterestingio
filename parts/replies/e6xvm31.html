<p>When people talk about evolution it often seems like we're still operating from the standpoint of &quot;everything has culminated in this moment&quot; and that on the timescale of human history evolution is more or less nonexistent, when in actuality humans are an extremely powerful selection pressure and the animals that are common in everyday life are common because theyve adapted. Life is and always will be a work in progress. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a biologist here, and not meaning to criticise your reply. But I'm nevertheless wondering if that's an example for a species having undergone evolutionary change - as opposed to adapting behaviour to a sudden change of environment?</p>
<p>Perhaps a better way of asking the same question: have the crows changed or (only) their behaviour?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to know if it’s an evolutionary change until we see a speciation division. For example if there was a common crow species which was present all across the us and those in the Midwest were still grain eaters but those in the coasts were carion eaters. The two groups could diverge if the road kill ones were to develop genes which better allowed for meat comsumption</p>
<p>But this would take quite a while. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would be more interesting is divergent evolution of the 2 crow populations on each coast.  Both may evolve to be more effective carrion eaters, but differently, since the populations (presumably) are isolated from one another.  (Not a biologist just following this line of thought a little further...)</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not true, finding evidence of selection in the genes/genomes of humans/animals has been done many times. There are different ways to look for selection. One would be looking for a selective sweep in the genome of those birds who are eating roadkill/living around roads vs those that aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I strongly believe it's not due to natural selection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generational time for crows is about 5 years. So only 20 generations has passed since the introduction of the automobile.</li>
<li>Most crow species are thriving, meaning population increase, meaning less selection pressure.</li>
<li>Crows are adept social learners and generalists, meaning they have a flexible set of behaviours.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only natural selection occurring is that almost every species of the <em>Corvus</em> genus is thriving, while other genera are dying off. I would even go so far as to argue the genus is one of the fastest to adapt to modern human society, since it's one of few wild animals that live among us and are not regarded as pests (like rats and cockroaches).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crows around where I live, suburban neighborhood, I have never seen one get run over though they wander around the streets quite insolently.  So they understand what cars are and how to dodge them.</p>
<p>Use of roads: Some shorebirds in California have been observed dropping clams and the like on to pavement to crack the shells.  But (at least 25 years ago) only in certain areas, presumably from observation of a genius bird who figured this out from a probably accidental initial drop.  Viewed as further proof that many birds have cultural transmission.</p></div>		</li>
