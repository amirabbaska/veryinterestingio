			<div class="markdown"><p>I had one in my ear, just inside the ear canal. I thought an ear infection was coming on. So much pressure that I felt like I was trying to equalize me ears, and even just barely grazing my ear lobe hurt. I tried flushing with some warm water and using a q tip to see if I could press anything to detect inflammation, and felt immense pain. Then the q tip had pus and blood, and I realized it was a pimple. That three days was some of the worst pain I've felt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also adding on to this, depending on where it is, be careful with the pimple. There are some nasty Invaders living around the nose and sometimes a puncture let's them get in. The infections on the face can be really bad if they get worse and get to something important also in that area.</p>
<p>Not to scare people, just another reason you shouldn't be popping/self removing/playing with them</p></div>		</li>

it is dangerous because infections around the nose can actually get to your brain. it's very unlikely, and only happens after you've already got a deep abscess. but it can happen.</p></div>		</li>
