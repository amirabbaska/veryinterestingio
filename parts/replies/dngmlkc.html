			<div class="markdown"><p>No, Oxides are different because you can add water to them and get hydroxides (if it's a metal oxide) or acids (if it's a non metal oxide)</p>
<p>A Salt is an anion + a cation. (As long as the anion is not Hydrogen and the cation is not Oxygen or Hydroxi ) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a salt is actually any ionic compound formed by a neutralization of an acid and base. NaCl is the most common, but there are many other common salts, such as MSG or baking soda.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're wrong. Sodium hydride for example is a salt produced by the reaction of sodium and hydrogen gas at elevated temperatures. There are no acids or bases in this reaction as can be seen by the radical nature of sodium and the lack of any empty orbitals on the H2 molecule. The reaction is purely redox.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't correct, but it's kinda close. Neither sodium nor chloride is an acid or a base. Instead, sodium chloride is an ionic compound formed when sodium, a cation, combines with chloride, an anion, resulting in a net neutral <em>charge</em>.</p>
<p>EDIT: scratch that, I misunderstood what you meant by &quot;neutralization of an acid and a base&quot;. I thought you were implying that sodium and chloride were themselves an acid and a base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not what salt means.  There are salts that do not contain a metal ion.  Ammonium hydroxide( NH4OH), for example (there's a whole series of ammonium based salts).  Furthermore, there are salts containing two metals, like sodium silicide  (NaSi).</p>
<p>Salt (chemically) is an ionic compound formed by acid and base neutralization reaction.  Like ammonium acetate forms by acetic acid (acid) neutralizing with ammonium carbonate (base).  Ammonium acetate is a salt with no metal ion.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm going to clarify before someone jumps on me.  Salts are usually formed by acid/base neutralizations, but chemistry always seems to have exceptions.  The IUPC definition of a salt is an ionic compound containing cations and anions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, i put a pretty simplistic definition in. Talking about cations/anions and acid/base reactions means nothing to most people - but most people understand the concept of metal and non-metal...which makes up 90%+ of commonly encountered salts (as in, encountered in day to day life - not encountered in chemistry). For this discussion, it's fine</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sodium Silicide isn't a salt. It's a clathrate that consists of sodium ions bound inside of a crystalline network of silicon anions. </p>

<li>The majority of salts aren't formed by acid base reactions.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, but sodium silicide is not a clathrate. Neither NaSi, Na2Si, or Na4Si4 are clathrate.  Silicides aren't clathrates.  Most silicides aren't salts.  NaSi meets the IUPAC definition of a salt, where Na2Si and Na4Si4 don't.  Sodium silicides are precursors in forming clathrates like Na24Si136.</p></div>		</li>
