			<div class="markdown"><p>On of my chemistry professors was interviewed on a local news channel about the fallout from Chernobyl finally hitting our city after like 30 yrs, and kept trying to get a scary sound bite out of him about the dangers of nuclear radiation. He laughed at the reporter and said that he’d get more radiation from sleeping next to his wife that night. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Triboluminescence is an optical phenomenon in which light is generated through the breaking of chemical bonds in a material when it is pulled apart, ripped, scratched, crushed, or rubbed (see tribology). <strong>The phenomenon is not fully understood, but appears</strong> to be caused by the separation and reunification of electrical charges.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to speculate off of you.  Fast moving electrons can emit bremsstrahlung radiation (x-rays).  </p>
<p>The electrons jump from the tape back to the surface they were pulled from and since there was no air to help, they dump their energy of motion by emitting the x-rays.</p></div>		</li>
