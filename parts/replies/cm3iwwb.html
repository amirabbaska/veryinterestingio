			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I am a big supporter of Free and Open Source software and have released a few projects under GPL and LGPL. The algorithms for this, however, are part of a proprietary research project, and the bot code is not well compartmentalized from the analysis code. Open sourcing it isn't on the agenda for now.</p>
<p>That said, though, one of our potential paths forward includes publishing the research. That is still a long way off regardless, but if we go that route, open sourcing the code would become a possibility.</p></div>		</li>
