			<div class="markdown"><p>Related to the free running roll, you could also take the example of how the impact is absorbed before the roll or at a lower fall where no roll is needed. </p>
<p>The technique is basically like that of a spring, you start out with extremities extended (feet as well, landing on the tip of the feet) and with muscles relatively relaxed. Then as you impact, you start contracting your limbs while simultaneously tensing your muscles, bracing the impact as smoothly as possible, at the same time as bending all joints (ankles, knees, as well as contorting the upper body). So contracting the whole apparatus while applying increasing resistance by tensing muscles incrementally.</p>
<p>If done correctly, the impact should have been braced in a way that appeared completely smooth (as well as mostly silent). This might have the appearance of &quot;ragdoll&quot; or that little work was done to brace the impact, while in reality it's just a very smooth (but rapid) application of muscle tension. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend's mom was a professional ballet dancer when she was younger, and when we were in high school the mom was driving and was t by an 18-wheeler. She had severe whiplash, but the doctors speculated that she would have broken her neck if she had not had more joint mobility because of her extensive dance training when she was younger. </p></div>		</li>
