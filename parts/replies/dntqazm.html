<p>but running the same distance will burn more calories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1859586/?page=1" target="_blank">Some studies</a> have indicated that the amount of every expended while running is proportional to distance, and independent of running speed. Since running isn't fast enough that wind drag is significant (as it is with cycling), increasing running speed will proportionally increase energy use along with distance covered.</p>
<p>There's a discussion of the above paper in <a href="http://gsnider.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/fun-with-physics.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Walking can use less or more, depending on walking speed. The chart in the blog post illustrates this well. Walking very slowly or very quickly will use more energy than running per km.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a physics perspective, not a biomechanical one.  You do more work against gravity lifting your legs while running than you do while walking.  Basically because your feet come up higher, you're expending more energy over the same distance. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Storing energy in the achilles tendon stretch during landing and using it for forward motion is the main reason running can be more efficient in certain situations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Perhaps I misread it, but the chart you referred to in that blog post you linked tabulates the <strong>takeoff angle</strong> as a function of running speed (column-wise) and turnover rate i.e. steps per minute for a given speed (row-wise). </p>
<p>That being the case, what it shows is that walking very slowly has a larger takeoff angle than running, and by extension has a lower energy requirement. My reasoning is as follows, please do correct me if I've messed this up.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The final energy equation mentioned in that post is <em>E = (Dgm)/(2sin(2Î¸))</em> implying that the energy expenditure is inversely proportional to takeoff angle (and directly proportional to distance). Therefore, a larger takeoff angle would decrease the energy expenditure, since it is in the denominator of the right-hand-side.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Further, reading the table row-wise for a given speed, if one increases the steps per minute (I would assume that for a given individual, increasing the number of steps for a given speed means that they would take more steps per minute by decreasing their stride length), the turnover angle decreases, which from the given energy equation implies that more energy is expended the more steps you take.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> In addition, if we consider the table column-wise for a given turnover rate, the table shows that the takeoff ankle increases the slower you go.</p>
<p>From <em>(1)</em>, <em>(2)</em>, and <em>(3)</em> above, what I can infer from the data in the table is that the faster one goes (or the more steps one takes for a given speed), the more energy one expends to cover the given distance. So I'm having trouble seeing how for a given distance, walking very slowly consumes more energy than running the same distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would that mean with cycling, going faster would burn more calories per mile because the faster you go the more work you are doing to overcome wind resistance? I've been kind of curious about that because I just upgraded to a road bike from a hybrid bike and my average speed on my rides is about 2 mph faster. However some of that is likely from aerodynamics but I suspect not nearly as much as a more efficient riding position (that is, the riding position seems to allow me to put power more effectively into the pedals).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, if you're going fast enough. If you're doing 5kph, doubling your speed to 10kph will approximately double your energy use, since air resistance is still so low. At this stage, overcoming air resistance only makes up a tiny amount of the energy used.</p>
<p>But if you're going 30kph, doubling to 60kph will use much more than double the energy, since doubling speed will result in approximately quadruple the drag. At this stage, overcoming air resistance is the primary use of energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Road bikes tend to have narrower tires, which makes a big difference. As the tire deforms you're constantly bleeding energy into the rubber, which is lost as heat. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What is this all about? I'm not familiar with aerobic vs anaerobic metabolism in terms of efficiency. As someone who is beginning to lose weight and work out, what would be a simple summary of this concept, or even a good place to begin researching the difference? </p>
<p>Thanks.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Aerobic metabolism, creates energy from fuel while using oxygen.
Think &quot;Slow twitch,&quot; or running/endurance muscle fivers. </p>
<p>Aerobic metabolism uses oxygen to create &quot;fuel&quot; and Co2, which is why Vo2 max was really hyped in the 90's and early 2000's as the main indicator for endurance performance. Early on physiologist's thought that the more oxygen, the better and that's just that. It was also found that Vo2 is generally a genetic trait that you can &quot;unlock,&quot; with training. Think &quot;genetics load the gun, training aims and pulls the trigger.&quot;  In the last 5 years or so a widely adopted philosophy is that after a certain point Vo2 Max becomes less of a &quot;holy grail&quot; indicator of endurance performance. Things like &quot;lactate threshold,&quot; and one's ability to recover from repeated bouts of exercise tell more of the story.  </p>
<p>Lactate threshold put simply is the foggy line at which an aerobic exercise becomes too anaerobic to sustain for long periods. At this point you create more lactate than you can either, re-use as fuel, or clear from the exercising muscle. Crossing &quot;threshold&quot; slows aerobic and anaerobic energy production. Think of it like a big horsepower car over heating when run too hard for too long. This is more or less a direct parallel, if you think of a car sending coolant and oil through radiators to dissipate heat from the system, that is what your body does when it sends blood to the skin to be cooled - aside from the other places and processes it goes through along it's path there. </p>
<p>Understanding threshold training benefits for endurance runners has improved training plans for endurance athletes in many sports, but few more than cycling and running - mainly because cyclists and runners are able to closely monitor effort levels and train very specifically. Marathon runners in the 90-00 running boom would go on long slow runs almost exclusively to train for the marathon's mind boggling distance. Now, it's common to find marathon runners doing training intervals at &gt;80-120% of threshold to build lactate tolerance and push the point at which aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms cross. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But for the most part you're wrong. </p>
<p>Running or elevated heart rate's in general, increases basal metabolic levels for long periods of time (Search EPOC - &quot;Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption&quot;). Walking, for the vast majority of people with functioning cardiovascular systems does not tax the system great enough to cause it to need excess oxygen to aid in recovery. </p></div>		</li>
