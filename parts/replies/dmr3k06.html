			<div class="markdown"><p>And they don't fucking pay taxes lol. I was raised a pastor's kid in a small town church, my dad got paid 50K in a town in South Carolina when the average pay there is like 24K.  Plus had member give him one-time repeating donations personally, on the order of 10K or more. He didn't do shit either while I was growing up lol...made the church bulletin and sat up there during the services usually lol. So trust me...there's a lot wrong with the church system we have in this country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One other thing is that the demographics of regular church goers tend to skew older and old people have this habit of dying. It is a very frequent occurrence that when these older parishioners die they leaves portions and sometimes rarely the entirety of their estate to the church. This can be in the form of cash, but also other assets such as stocks, bonds and real estate. Religions and Denominations that have been at this game for a very long time such as the Roman Catholic Church have managed to accumulate vast quantities of net worth.</p></div>		</li>
