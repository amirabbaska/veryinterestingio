			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live, hospitals have &quot;white&quot;, &quot;red&quot; and &quot;green&quot; power outlets. </p>
<p>White is never protected, green is protected after a brief waiting time (waiting for the generator to roll up), red is battery backed.</p>
<p>People just plugged non important things like the computers (or even the monitors!) in the station office into red... And something like some patient's semi-important monitoring device into white, lol.</p>
<p>I was working in IT there. I always took a thought where I plug in stuff... Don't want to waste battery on shit like keeping a monitor run, unless it was in the operating rooms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my hometown there was an earthquake that took out the hospital generator. It was an hour or 2 before a replacement was sourced. The surgery was completed by cellphone light. The machines all had back up battery. And the next day they bought some large torches just in case for next time. </p></div>		</li>
