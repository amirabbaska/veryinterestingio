			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's also a missed aspect of the question of, &quot;where does the wave come from?&quot;</p>
<p>Because signals have a finite speed, and there's an overhead of how long the entire process takes to integrate into full FoF mode, that's where this wave of tension throughout your body comes in. Your brain is sending signals to different parts of your body to do different things, in different priorities, these signals take a split second to reach where they're going or even longer the further they have to travel. Each body part that &quot;activates&quot; does so at different speeds. What you are feeling is literally a &quot;wave&quot; of essentially energy that is causing noticeable changes in your whole body that you can feel as they occur. </p>
<p>Mostly the sensation itself is your muscles tensing slightly as an uncontrolled and &quot;not consciously asked for&quot; response is sent to your muscles which you weren't expecting, combined with adrenaline hitting what it needs to hit (if you've ever been injected with Morphine you can feel the warmth literally washing over you in a similar way).</p>
<p>Ever watch the Iron Man films? His armour isn't active immediately, it takes a second for everything to come online before it's fully functional. Same with us.</p></div>		</li>

<p>like when you feel a small tickle from something you didn't see</p>

<p>Like that time at the beach when I was out in the water, something pinched/scratched my foot pretty hard and my brain instantly told me &quot;that was a shark.  you should run out of this water in the most ridiculous fashion you possibly can while also trying to play it cool because no one needs to know about this since it was actually more likely to have been a small crab of some sort... but still you need to gtfo of this water because it was a shark.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
