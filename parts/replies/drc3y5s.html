			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks!!!! I hope I got the gist of it, I learned all this in a two week bootcamp at my university with our proteomics department within our institute of quantitative biomedicine, and it was AMAZING! I love this stuff. I'm super into structural bioinformatics and everything so this was like, super cool for me to see. We basically simulated the entire process in teams all the way from discovery to phase 3 clinical trials and had a simulated ODAC committee/FDA approval presentation with people from the industry and like, very established researchers at school. It. Was. Awesome. </p></div>		</li>
