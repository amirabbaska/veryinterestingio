<p>Here in western Canada, we have to aggressively humidify our houses to keep them above 3% in the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity differences are extraordinary. In houses of primarily wood the expansion and contraction effects are quite noticeable. 90% humidity in the summer makes all the wood swell to the points doors don't shut properly, while 3% humidity in winter causes some cupboard doors to just snap in half from the massive contraction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall going to Minnesota and walking out into the humidity for the first time ever and saying to my friend, What the hell is this? I feel like I just stepped out of the shower! He then mentioned the humidity and I was floored. I still can't stand high humidity, it makes it difficult to breathe. </p></div>		</li>
