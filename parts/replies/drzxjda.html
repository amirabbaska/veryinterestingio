			<div class="markdown"><p>The US Army Corps of Engineers publishes information about Great Lakes water level and hydrology. Right now the water level is above normal levels at this time of year. I believe evaporation is the biggest reduction of water. The thousands of square miles of the three similar elevation lakes. Lake Erie, Huron and Michigan, can take a huge gain or loss of water with minimal effect on water level. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun math, but you failed to account for the drop in elevation from Lake Erie to the falls, which is 2.7m according to <a href="https://www.niagaraparks.com/visit-niagara-parks/plan-your-visit/niagara-falls-geology-facts-figures/" target="_blank">Niagara Parks</a> also, the area surrounding Lake Erie is not a simple shape...as you gain elevation, your surface area will increase rapidly with the features of the surrounding terrain...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You second point I purposely ignored since it gets very complicated to model. The point was to give a rough idea and as such it's not really necessary for answering OP's question. I did simplify a lot of factors and this was one of them. There are a whole host of variables I haven't accounted (for example, other rivers that may flow out of Lake Erie which would increase in flow). It gets very complicated to model and I thought this would just give a good simplistic perspective of the effects a block would have. </p>
<p>I've added an edit mentioning your first point. I originally discounted that drop since I didn't think it would be very significant (less than the height of the banks). </p></div>		</li>
