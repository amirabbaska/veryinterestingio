			<div class="markdown"><p>Mildly off topic, but is there a critical mass that results in infection? I was under the impression one virus would be enough to infect the host body once it begins reproducing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had assumed the understanding that most disease vectors do not survive long outside of a host cell. HIV extremely so. In contrast to the common cold which can survive on a mouse and keyboard for much longer therefor in greater numbers be able to infect you. Most of the HIV virus will oxidize once it is exposed to air. Open your mouth, breathe. Saliva has an extremely low amount of white blood cells, even more so the specific T cells that HIV needs to replicate and survive. After that you've got the mouth and esophagus's mucus membrane that is actively pushing fluids and enzymes into the mouth, further reducing the viral load threatening you. Finally anything remaining is dropped into a sack of acid. </p>
<p>Considering all this, The extremely small amount of the HIV virus in infected Saliva poses no risk of infection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another question--if the virus needs T cells to replicate and survive, why is HIV so readily transmitted through sexual contact? Barring menstruation/open sores/other sources of blood contact, what does the virus actually transmit through? Is there just a large amount of the virus in those types of bodily fluids? How does it actually enter the body (again barring sores, etc) during sex, since to the best of my understanding it can't be absorbed through skin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm studying medicine and one of the courses I take is microbiology, and no one has answered this question for me yet. I'd love an explanation as to why we need more than a certain amount in order to infect. Is it that 1 can potentially infect the whole body but very unlikely and when we reach a certain amount we more or less can guarantee an infection, or is it something else? Thanks guys</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also consider the fact not all virus particles are actually infectious or viable. I donâ€™t know what the particle-to-PFU ratio for HIV is, but it can be up to 10,000:1 for other viruses. So an infectious dose &gt;&gt;&gt; one virus particle</p>
