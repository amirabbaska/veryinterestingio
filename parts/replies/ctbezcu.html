			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: /u/metalpub correctly pointed out my example is a UPS#, not USPS. I misread the post title. Oh well, I'll leave it if anyone's interested.</p>
<p>Sample number: 1Z1234560345674567
Broken down: 1Z 123456 03 45674567</p>
<p>1Z - prefix for all tracking numbers (don't know why)</p>
<p>123456 - Sender's UPS account number</p>
<p>03 - Service level (03 is &quot;ground&quot; for example)</p>
<p>45674567 - Actual package ID number. Always starts with a 4.</p>
<p>I'm just a user so I don't know the technical reasons, but that's the pattern. The service levels are pretty straightforward compared to the service (01, 02, 03, maybe others for early AM and express saver if that's still a thing)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm totally guessing here, but maybe: to distinguish their packages from other carriers?  (&quot;I'm sorry sir: that can't possibly be our package: all of our tracking #'s start with '1Z'.  Try FedEx.&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't all start with 1Z, but the large majority of them will. </p>
<p>If you use a hand-written label, the tracking number is gonna be smaller. The 1Z tracking numbers are only on printed pre-processed labels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you mention that, because believe it or not, USPS ships a whole lot of UPS's parcels and mail.  In fact, USPS ships FedEx's parcels too half the time.  During Christmas time when the amount of packages needing to be shipped gets realllllly far up there, UPS and FedEx just drop them off at the centers by the truckload sometimes just for USPS to deliver.</p>
