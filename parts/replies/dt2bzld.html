			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothetically yes: you could only &quot;fill&quot; it during big rain events and keep the downstream flow relatively constant. I don't think they would do that, though, because the purpose is to generate electricity as quickly as possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's absurd, there is no reason they wouldn't fill it slowly, especially to prevent military action. </p>
<p>Once full, the energy generation will be the same as if they filled it fast, and on a multi year project, an extra year of filling isn't that big a deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about that. They <strong>have to</strong> release the water, they have nowhere to put it once the dam fills up. I mean, they won't have to release the water of the initial filling, that would be counter productive. And there are other issues, like, they'll have to come up with some sort of treaty as to how fast they can fill it, etc. If Egypt has any power to complain (and act) now, they'll have that power later if Ethiopia doesn't respect their agreement. </p>
<p>But the main point I'm making is Ethiopia can't refuse to send water because they simply can't hold it forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming the water in lake can also be taken off for agriculture/utility/human use. During a drought where they're using more water than is being replenished, they could just not release any water or put it through the dam and send it off to their uses instead of down river.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they can do that now without a dam. </p>
<p>The drought thing is real though, and it'd definitely have to be negotiated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have to release the water to generate power from it.  If they just wanted to divert the water for their own use they could do that today without a dam.  Maybe they would want to send the &quot;saved water&quot; to Egypt because they don't want a war and instead want to just manage the regional resource?</p></div>		</li>
