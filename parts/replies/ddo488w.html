			<div class="markdown"><p>I bike because I can get around the city more quickly than if I drive a car. The reason you're being held up is because of stop signs, traffic lights and car traffic in general. If you weren't constantly approaching stop signs and lights there's no way you would be overtaking a cyclist over and over again. It's not the cyclist holding you up. Maybe it's annoying to give a little birth, but that's about it. A lot of cars are hurrying up to wait - for traffic lights and signs.</p>
<p>Quick Edit: I also bike because I don't own a car and public transit is $4-5/day for one round trip (or $100/mo unlimited). I put myself on an insane budget last October/November and cut out everything that's frivolous. I also get super depressed (year-round but worse in the winter) so having to bike to and from work at the very least gets me outside and exercising and feeling a little bit better. I think a lot of bike commuters do this regularly for similar reasons. We aren't trying to be a nuisance, a lot of us are just exercising the demons! Life can be hard.</p>
<p>If we were forced to file in line behind cars and couldn't travel up the right side of the road to the front at lights and stop signs, well...biking would really suck. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, It's filtering bikes. Living in a hilly area with a mandated 1 metre passing law, they are the primary hold up on my commute. Yes it would suck if you couldn't filter, but your lack of suck makes a lot of people suck suckier.</p></div>		</li>
