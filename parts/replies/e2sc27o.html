			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation, this concept is one that eluded me despite studying it. Your explanation helped me grasp it. If you don't mind me tagging another question, could you explain what Vars are? I know they're related to active and reactive power</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VAR is exactly the same as a Watt, but we use it specifically for reactive power. We could be using Watts just fine, but you KNOW when you see VAR that we're talking about Reactive Power</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VAR is the symbol used to describe reactive power. It is represents power just like normal W does, but the context of that power is different than W. </p>
<p>Also, to add to my explanation, the other posters explanation is mathematically more correct, in terms of the magnitude of I and V being out of phase thus the multiplication of I and V never reaches the true maximum in Watts it could given the power supplied from the source (V and I). Of course, the hard part in understanding based on just that explanation is  where does that reactive power go if it doesnt go to the load, and I believe it simply returns to the source (or, it can reflect between different components which is something you learn in a Microwave Frequenct course. Oscillations, Ringing, never a good thing. Always want a good match to reduce reflections.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just want to add 2 things: </p>
<p>var = volt ampere reative  </p>
<p>and if you see VA it's the apparent power </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t have to be back to the “source” per say. A lot of tuning of power systems mostly just evens out and averages power dissipation at the load</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to say that reactive power does not get dissipated per se. </p>
<p>Reactive power cannot do any work, i.e. move an engine, light a bulb etc.</p>
<p>The reason that the power companies care about reactive power, as you mentioned, is because it increases total current. </p>
<p>Lots of equipment, e.g. transmission lines, transformers depend on the current rating for the size of the wires used. Greater the current, the equipment will be bigger and costlier.</p>
<p>When you are talking about 100's of MW of power, the currents and costs increase quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lmk how I can word that part of comment better so it's more accurate! Always want to make sure I'm giving the right information out. I agree, it does not necessarily dissipate at all (maybe as heat a little bit but that's usually negligible). </p>
<p>In this case, where does that power go? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really go anywhere. Think about it like a giant cellphone battery. The reactive power is used to &quot;charge&quot; the battery. And then, a fraction of a second later, it is discharged back into the network. It doesn't <em>do</em> anything, but the power still needs to be provided. It's useless &quot;lost&quot; power, but it still counts as load/current.</p></div>		</li>
