			<div class="markdown"><p>At the same time wouldn't it be practically impossible to flap your arms with wings attached to them in a fashion similar enough to that of a bird to generate lift? Unless I understand less than I think, you can't get lift by flapping up and down, and the human anatomy is very poorly suited for routine motion akin to how a birds wings move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can turn your arms and move them in circles. That allows you to lift your wings pointing the feathers down, and then push down with the wings horizontal.
But yea you'd tire quite quickly. Birds are basically just flight muscles. That's tr major part we eat even in chicken that can't fly very well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well actually you can, sort of.  The wing itself can't go straight up and down, but if you let it passively pivot around the leading edge, then your arm could just go up and down. I don't have citations handy right now, but there's been work done on both birds and ornithopters that does a significant freaking of a bird's not-up-amd-down-motion happens passively, and you can get decent lift by only flapping up and down if you design the wings carefully.</p>
<p>Of course, human anatomy still isn't well suited to that either.</p></div>		</li>
