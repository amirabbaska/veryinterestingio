			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused by this statement. Can't you define a sequence A(n) = BB(n+1) and now your sequence grows faster? I assume something is hidden in the definition of &quot;sequence&quot; or &quot;steps&quot; that I'm missing here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It held the record of being the largest number ever used in a mathematical proof. It's so large that there really isn't any easy way to describe how large it is. Any method a layperson could come up with trying to classify how large Graham's number is, would fail and Graham's number would simply be too large for any of the classifications offered. Count how many digits there are? Too many to fit in the observable universe. Count how many digits there are in the number of digits of Graham's number? Too many to fit observable universe. Repeat this counting of digits of digits of digits of... etc process? If you started at big bang, and every picosecond tried one layer deeper into digits of digits of digits..., you still today wouldn't have anything that would fit the observable universe.</p>
<p>At this point a layperson typically gives up, but graham's number is still so much bigger than any of this does any justice to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a great Youtube explainer on the channel Numberphile regarding Graham's number.  I've watched it several times and the sheer incomprehensibility of the size of the number continues to amaze me.  My favorite tidbit about Graham's number is that your brain would (apparently) collapse into a black hole if you stored G's number in it due to the density of information (I probably don't have this quite right - but you get the picture).</p>
<p>I agree with u/tenthyr 's sentiment that a number setting Graham's number as its lower bound is sort of upsetting in a way that only attempting to contemplate the infinite can be. </p>
<p>[yes I know G's number or any other number pales in comparison to infinity, but once a number's sheer size saturates the observable universe, it's sorta in the same ballpark from this human's perspective.]</p></div>		</li>

<p>Knowing BB(10000) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The memory card doesn't give you this though, does it? It only gives you the Turing Machine specification for the BB-10000 winner. You would have to run that Turing Machine to its halt state to discover BB(10000), which would take slightly longer than forever. Or is having BB(10000) in theory good enough?</p>
<p>Also I thought that Busy Beaver's goal was to maximize the number of 1's written, not the number of steps taken. I guess they'r similar in conception, but I don't know that a halting TM that maximizes the number of 1's written would run &quot;longer&quot; than a halting TM that maximizes the number of steps taken. </p></div>		</li>

<li>The original post was not talking about knowledge of BB(10000), it was talking about knowing the Turing machine that will run that long. Instead of a ridiculous number we get a description of the 10,000 states that will lead to the largest amount of 1 written (or longest runtime, depending on your favorite definition).</li>
<li>How would knowledge of BB(10000) help you in any way? It is a ridiculous large number. What do you do with this number? In theory you can find all halting machines with up to 10000 states by running all of them for BB(10000) steps - in practice that is not possible within the lifetime of the universe and the impossibility to run or even save all these &gt;10^10000 Turing machines. I don't see how you could derive a practical application (even if we include mathematical applications as practical) from the notation of an absurdly large number.</li>

<p>Quoting: &quot;Suppose that you had a specification of the first 10,000 Busy Beaver machines...&quot;. Seems pretty clear-cut. :)</p>
<blockquote>

<p>No - in theory both S(n) and Σ(n) are not computable.</p>
<p>Yedidia and Aaronson obtained the first reasonable explicit upper bound on the minimum n for which Σ(n) is unknowable. Knowing BB(10000) (you're given 10k-state TM, it halts, etc.) implies knowledge of Σ(10000), and thus the inconsistency of ZFC.</p>
<p>So, with Σ(10000) unknowable, you don't know how long to run those TMs with 10.000 states (which is a lot) for.</p>
<p>Now, nobody's arguing for <em>feasibility</em>; indeed running those busy beaver TMs is intractable, as we could be waiting forever for them to halt, even if it is certain that they will. It's theoretical ramifications of a hypothetical.</p>
<p>PS. I'm assuming of course that <em>proof by construction</em> is accepted by everyone as a valid avenue to prove something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because we don't know BB(10000) and we cannot compute it. But if we would magically know it, where would be the problem with running everything BB(10000) steps?</p>
<p>If the discussed Turing machine doesn't halt, then ZFC is consistent - but we didn't prove it because BB(10000) fell from the sky, as far as I understand.</p>

<p>For determining the monetary worth of it, I would take that into account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think unknowable is the correct word here: We know that we can't use ZFC to prove the value of BB(10000), but just knowing the correct answer doesn't produce any logical paradoxes as far as I can see.</p>
<p>Sure, we can use it to prove that ZFC is consistent, but by using that magically produced number in our proof we're basically adding a new axiom, so we're actually proving it in ZFC + &quot;The value of BB(10000) is n&quot;.</p>
<p>However, as soon as we allow ourselves to add new axioms, we don't actually have to do all that boring work of watching a turing machine for an almost infinite amount of time to see if it halts - we could just add &quot;ZFC is consistent&quot; as an axiom and go home instead.</p></div>		</li>
