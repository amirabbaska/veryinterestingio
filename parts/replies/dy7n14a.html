<p>I'm dealing with an expensive mouthful of the results of insufficient care over a few years which appears to be, in part, due to the PEG I luckily had put in just before everything went all wrong. Every two hours? My mouth didn't get swabbed out every two <em>days</em> on a ward where nurses never had more than 2 patients/shift, never more than one conscious.</p>
<p>I'm still grateful as hell for all they did for me, especially <em>Edited</em>, <em>Reacted</em>, <em>Privacy</em>, and <em>Her too</em>, and I likewise won't apologize for reporting <em>Can'tLegallyName&amp;<del>Shame</del>ProtectOthers</em> to the Board.</p></div>		</li>
