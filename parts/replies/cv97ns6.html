			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add that the device described above is called a thermocouple.  It's the same device that is used not only to generate electricity, but to take extreme thermal readings, like in your oven, for example.  The voltage difference is measured, and thus the temperature difference can be determined.  </p>
<p>But to be clear, there is no Plutonium in your oven.  Sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting point to bring up is the safety factor devised.  </p>
<p>Ideally when you design something you give it a safety factor (extra load something can take, or extra power in can run longer on) because otherwise it would suck to have the device go out 2 minutes too early in a year long operation.  </p>
<p>EDIT: so as a result of using a safety factor you can overshoot by quite a bit, which really isnt bad for this case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres that but really 100% capacity is an illusion for anything. That capacity is normally reliant on room temperature conditions and other weird factors. Safety factors help muck up your loss in efficiency due to temperature, material exposure and other material properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to intentionally mis-align the HF Radios I worked on. The operators tended to crank them to 1000 watts (Max for this Radio) whether they needed that much power or not and they would burn through tubes way to fast. I aligned them for a max of 800 Watts, then aligned the Watt Meter on the front to read 1000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even if they had overshot with New Horizons on its 10 year flight to Pluto it still arrived a minute faster than they predicted when it was launched in 2004. I think it is a bit sad when we can launch a probe and predict its arrival time with it arriving a minute early on the outer edges of the solar system, but the gps on our phones can't be bothered to do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our personnal tech is totally different though. We can accurately calculate trajectories for awhile now and even with older computers can generate very effective models. At the end of the day figuring out the pathway is just a question of spending time to generate the needed velocities.  </p>
<p>Our phones have to factor is beinf anywhere and are limited in time interval. Your GPS dlesnt get to spend days calculating where you are because you need it now</p></div>		</li>
