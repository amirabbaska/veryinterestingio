<p>Doubtful.</p>
<p>European nations learned how expensive maintaining colonies were and how bloody and contested post-colonial wars were from 1945 through the 70's.</p>
<p>The US found it easier to maintain most of the benefits (economic and geopolitical) with only a fraction of the cost with the current system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would have certainly led to more war. Stalin would have been very concerned if the USA tried to be an all dominating force and would probably have attacked the US whilst the red army still had momentum and the Soviet airforce was in such a strong position, so to stop the risk of a nuclear attack.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I began researching this after the 2008 financial crisis and bailout. Every election cycle US politicians argue about the subsequent policy decisions with deficit domestic spending and international trade deficits. However, none of these policy decisions are a root cause or even make much of an impact. It all goes back to the US Dollar being the reserve currency. Even the old Petro-dollars cycle hinges on this. The problems are systemic and result from a currency serving two purposes instead of one in different overlapping markets (US and international settlement). </p>
<p>The problems are systemic and have also resulted in a currency war. China is leading the BRIC countries in accumulating gold to establish a new reserve currency already and there have been several moves and shifts in a currency war between east and west over the past decade. </p>
<p>If US, Japan, and European Allies would invite the upstarts to a seat at the table and let them include their currencies in IMF SDRs,then we might avoid World War III. </p>
<p>However, as a cynic I don't see any world leaders today stepping up with humility and vision to avert these crisises.</p>
