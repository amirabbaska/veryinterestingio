			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends in the dosage form and what the formula is. There is no clear cut answer.</p>
<p>Softgels. Roughly 1/3rd active to 2/3rd excipient ( ie oil, viscosity modifiers, emulsifiers)</p>
<p>Hard shell capsule. Can be mostly filler or very little filler. Say 100 mcg of selenium woukd be about 220 mcg of  sodium selenite and roughly 400 mg of excipient (fillers, lubricants etc) in a size 1 capsule</p>
<p>Tablets... Not so much filler but tableting aids. Depending on formulation can be mostly tableting aids to very little.</p>
<p>I can't make any recommendations for you. What I am familiar with may not be available to you in your country.</p>
<p>Even if we were in the same country I wouldn't make recommendations because I've formulated so many of them I risk upsetting my clients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you feel about some of the other comments that basically write off multivitamins altogether? I'm sort of mixed. I hear great things about people who take &quot;targeted&quot; multivitamins, but I also hear people in scientific communities that just bash vitamins altogether. I don't know who to believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you develop them, then who better to ask: Which studies show that taking multivitamins is healthier than placebo?</p>
<p>Or healthier than eating vegetables for that matter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, developing a multi is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle. Calculate the amount of input compared with what the client wants and advise the client whether or not they can have what they want or not. </p>
<p>As for the studies, for every study you find saying a multi is of benefit vs placebo you will find just as many saying there is no benefit because there was no data to indicate the multi was better than the placebo.</p>
<p>Vitamins and minerals will correct nutritional deficiencies but as others have pointed out how many people are truly nutritionally deficient?</p></div>		</li>
