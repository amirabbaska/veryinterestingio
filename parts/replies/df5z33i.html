			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons electrical wires have a circular cross section. First lets talk mechanics, that's an easy shape to draw the wire into from the stock. Also, sharper edges will increase wear on the jacket and are less durable due to work hardening if flexed repeatedly. </p>
<p>Electrically, if you are using AC you want the maximum surface area because the charge is actually carried along the outside of the wire. This is also called the skin effect. Because of this <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect" target="_blank">skin effect</a>, the charge tends to gather on points like bubbles in boiling water grow on scratches on a pan. DC uses the whole cross section but there is no advantage to having multiple types of wire.</p>
<p>To the original question, [Length / cross sectional area = Resistance] so pinching or having a narrow section of a wire would increase resistance there and resistance means energy is usually lost as heat. So a choke point might melt depending on the current involved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skin effect depth at 60Hz is about 8.5mm, or over 1/4&quot;, so for all practical purposes can be ignored on home-related wiring. The biggest wire size is 4/0, well under the point where skin effect becomes meaningful. Skin effect becomes more pronounced at higher frequencies.</p>
<p>Edit to add: The biggest wire size I'd expect to see in residential wiring would be 4/0. I've held pieces of the big stuff used in large commercial wiring, it was like holding oddly dense pieces of big rebar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The form doesn't matter, but the thickness (gauge, cross sectional area) does.  The smaller the wire more resistance is inherent over a distance.  Given a fixed current draw, if you were to decrease the wire gauge the current would heat up the wire which essentially is converting electricity to heat, which means less power reaches the load.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right for DC, but when you're dealing with RF current tends to gather on the outside do stranded wire will conduct slightly more than solid core due to increased surface area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up on this, I've got some flat chargers for my phone. They're super flexible, I assume that rather than a singular wire they've got several smaller gauge wires running in parralell, is this more or less efficient? </p>
<p>With the skin effect thing people have been talking about this says that it would be more efficient in terms of SA/V, but maybe increase the manufacturing costs. </p>
<p>If it's more efficient will this become the norm?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charger cords already have multiple wires in them. A flat cord just has them laid parallel instead. Romex wiring you would use in a house is also flat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your phone is also running at DC, so the skin depth is infinite. Skin effect only comes into play with AC. At 60Hz it's roughly 8mm, at 30MHz (Amateur Radio frequencies) it's on the order of microns, so copper clad aluminum wire is actually perfectly fine.</p></div>		</li>
