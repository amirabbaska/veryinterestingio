<p>From Oregon can confirm.  After spending the first 18 years of my life swimming in the Northern Pacific Ocean I thought I was in a damn sauna when I visited Florida and swam there.</p>
<p>On the plus side I now have a 25% resistance to cold.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water temperature seems to be the biggest factor in the formation of hurricanes. And yes the water temperature in San Diego is usually in the 60s (even in the summer), but this summer the temperature reached 80! I suspect that if this trend continues we could actually see hurricanes  from Mexico creep northward into our area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that the PNW coast is hit by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest_windstorm" target="_blank">an extratropical cyclone every few years (often in the wintertime).</a> They're not hurricanes--not as powerful or large or organized. But still a very strong damaging storm. </p>
<p>It's usually doesn't make headlines, though, because they tend to make landfall on empty, steep coastline and break up over the coastal range. <a href="https://www.outdoorproject.com/sites/default/files/styles/odp_header_adaptive/public/features/_mg_2280.jpg" target="_blank">The PNW landscape can really absorb a storm surge.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>The coast along Olympic National Park in the winter time is awesome. Being out there during a big storm, witnessing the power of the ocean from relative safety is pretty neat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in Seaside, OR for a pretty big storm. It snapped whole hillsides of trees like they were toothpicks between the coast and portland. All roads out were closed for days. No power or cell phones either for at least a week. I heard them announce 120 mph gusts on the trusty wind up radio. Intense for sure.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We get hurricanes sized winds in Alaska but they don't qualify for some reason. Lows too 822 millibar iirc maybe 922... </p>
<p>Edit: The storm, which maxed out at an intensity of about 924 millibars, in terms of its minimum central air pressure, likely tied the record for the strongest North Pacific non-tropical storm (in general, the lower the pressure the stronger the storm). According to meteorologist Jeff Halverson, writing for the Capital Weather Gang blog, this low pressure reading tied the record for the lowest wintertime pressure in the North Pacific Ocean since such records began in the winter of 1969-1970</p></div>		</li>
