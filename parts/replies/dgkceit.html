			<div class="markdown"><p>i think there's a better analogy. So you're throwing a party and a bully comes in a hurts you. the next weekend you're throwing a party again and you decide you're not going to let him in if he comes. It turns out the bully was wearing a disguise, hat glasses, new haircut, a strap on etc. you didn't recognize him so he slipped in and got into the party anyway, and you ended up getting hurt. cold and flu viruses change so your immune system doesn't recognize it. when your immune system finds out, its usually too late.</p></div>		</li>
