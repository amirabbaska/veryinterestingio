			<div class="markdown"><p>So, what we know of climatology and the how the Carbon cycle works is inferred knowledge from a bunch of proxies.</p>
<p>Starting way back, we knew there was very little oxygen in the atmosphere, due to the presence of Pyrite in very early rocks. When iron is exposed to oxygen, you'll know that it forms rust. No oxygen, no rust. So, the earliest sedimentary rocks we look at were formed by water with very low oxygen content, but which held sulphur, producing FeS2, pyrite crystals.</p>
<p>With the emergence of Archaea, the earliest life which consisted of chemotrophs (things that eat chemicals and spit out different ones), not much oxygen was freed, but photosynthetic organisms eventually evolved, and Carbon Dioxide in the oceans started to be converted to usable carbon and free oxygen. As the oxygen levels started to climb in Earth's seas, it quickly bonded to the iron dissolved there, creating insoluble iron oxides that settled out to create Banded Iron Formations (between 2.4 and 1.8 billion years ago (Gya)). These banding events happened in stages as the earth's climate changed, so creating alternating layers of high and low Iron oxide content. Wikipedia's got a lovely article on it.</p>
<p>Once all the iron in the sea had been depleted, oxygen started to form a major part of the atmosphere, but Earth's landmases were still oxygen deprived, and so most new generation was now sequestered on land, as the iron and rocks there started to chemically weather. This meant that oxygen levels stayed around 0.8% for a further Billion years, to 0.85 Gya.</p>
<p>Eventually, of course, even the landmasses were fully rusted, and this is where oxygen levels really started to increase. Multicellular, Sexual life had evolved in the meantime, and once oxygen was no-longer being used up by chemical processes in Earth's rocks, life really took off.</p>
<p>It took a further 300 million years until the cambrian explosion happened 542 Mya, by which stage Oxygen levels were roughly where they are now, but as plants rapidly moved onto and colonised the land, atmospheric CO2 levels took a huge hit and oxygen levels skyrocketed to something like 35% by the end of the carboniferous period.</p>
<p>The reason the Carboniferous period is called this is because plants, up to this stage, had evolved to produce lignin, wood, and could now trap Carbon. Thing is, fungus, the primary CO2 regulator, hadn't caught up to using wood as a food source, so for a few million years none of the wood rotted. It just sat there, in swamps, getting buried by new plants growing on top of it. This period is responsible for basically ALL of our coal and natural gas deposits, as it locked up ENORMOUS amounts of carbon below the ground.</p>
<p>When fungi got their shit together and started to eat wood, finally, the rest of life started to catch up, since fungi is edible whilst wood isn't, so oxygen levels steadily dropped to where they are today as more and more living things came around to use it, and more and more of the continents were eroded to form new Iron Oxide deposits.</p>
<p>The thing is, most of the carbon dioxide buried in the Carboniferous period never made its way deep enough to become part of the Earth's mantle, or to be thrown up again in volcanos, so it's all just sat there, and life on Earth has trundled along without all that carbon in the cycle since then.</p>
<p>Levels of Atmospheric CO2 have rose and fell thousands of times since, during periods of glaciation and greenhouse, and we can measure them in fossils, limestone, gas bubbles in ice, stalagmites and stalactites (speleothems), but they've never strayed beyond certain margins, because the amount of carbon in circulation has been roughly constant.</p>
<p>Dumping more carbon into the system by burning fossil fuels now threatens that, since there's no guarantee that the current amount of life on Earth will be able to absorb the enormous amount of CO2 we've added, and so the atmosphere is getting more and more CO2 rich each year. We've risen from 320ppm in 1956 to just over 400ppm now, 25% increase in 60 years, and this has tied pretty closely to a steady increase in average global temperature too.</p>
<p>This is because the earth loses heat as infra-red radiation, which all objects give off when they're warmer than 0 degrees kelvin, but CO2 is very good at bouncing it back down to earth, where the energy is reabsorbed and heats us up again, like the glass in a greenhouse keeping the heat from escaping (hence &quot;greenhouse gas&quot;). The ocean will eventually, over a few hundred thousand years, be able to dissolve a lot of CO2 as H2CO3, carbonic acid, which can be turned into limestone by rock weathering, but by that stage the world will already be extremely hot if fossil fuel use isn't cut down to practically 0% of the level its at now, not to mention having a sea that tastes like sparkling water.</p>
<p>So yeah, that's a <em>really small</em> TL;DR on how earth's atmosphere has changed over time, how the carbon and oxygen cycle work and why fossil fuel use is potentially pretty bad for us if you like the idea of life still existing on earth's landmasses. Acid rain ain't fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting for me how in prehistoric times wood didn't rot because the fungus didn't affect it yet. Now we think of rot as a natural process for wood, so its intriguing to think wood could just &quot;lay&quot; there for many years without effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat counterintuitive burning oil reduces the amount of gas in the atmosphere. The basic reaction is somewhere between CH4 + 2 O2 -&gt; 2 H2O + CO2 and 2 CH2 + 3 O2 -&gt; 2H2O + 2 CO2, closer to the former for natural gas and closer to the latter for oil. The water condenses over time, so we are left with 2 O2 -&gt; CO2 to 3 O2 -&gt; 2 CO2. In both cases the total mass goes down (only a tiny bit in the second case as m(C)&lt;m(O)).</p>
<p>Burning coal increases the amount of gas, as it mainly adds carbon.</p>
<p>I don't know what wins. At a few billion tons of oil consumed every year human activities are certainly more important than the ~100,000 tonnes of atmospheric loss.</p>
<p>Edit: There is also a secondary effect of more water in the atmosphere from increasing temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the thing about burning fossil fuels is that it doesn't actually add or subtract anything from the mass of the planet. The gas produced, over very long periods of time, will be reabsorbed by carbon sinks, whether those are in the ocean (forming carbonates like limestone), on land as in biological processes, or geological processes (stuff getting buried), so the net gain or loss of total atmosphere is effectively 0. </p>
<p>The stuff just sort of moves around on earth, sometimes in the atmosphere, sometimes in water or rock, but never actually leaving Earth, so we're not at risk of losing our atmosphere by burning Fossil fuels.</p>
<p>What we are at risk of, is heating up the atmosphere, which totally screws the biosphere up, killing lots of stuff and making it difficult to live, which is a lot more pressing than the chances of the atmosphere floating off into space.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I've just read Op's original question, and assuming this question is in relation to climate change, I'll provide a slightly more in-depth answer to that in a new comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question isn't does new mass be added to the earth the question is does new mass get added to the atmosphere. There could conceivabley be a way that the gas in the atmosphere is being resupplied from the mass of the earth through volcanic action, photosynthesis or any number of other actins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overall, it's actually very difficult to follow numbers. Due to active volcanism, plate tectonics and biological processes, we are constantly producing new gas, such as Nitrogen Dioxide, Methane, Carbon Dioxide and so on, and these are then reused by organisms, dissolved into the sea or buried to find their way back into the Earth.</p>
<p>This cycle nets us exactly 0 new gas, however, as it's always recycling the same atoms in different configurations over hundreds to billions of years, so the total gain or loss of new atmosphere is tied directly to the loss or gain of new atoms by radioactive processes, and to the loss of hydrogen when water is electrolysed by any sort of process, biological, natural or otherwise.</p>
<p>As for how much we lose to solar wind, this varies depending on a bunch of factors, such as our distance from the sun (tied to Milankovitch cycles), but the current figure is estimated at around 3 kilograms of Hydrogen and 50 grams of helium per second, according to <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/dcatling/Catling2009_SciAm.pdf" target="_blank">this article compiled for the Scientific American</a> in 2009. It's basically going to be a couple billion years before this becomes a big enough issue for us to worry about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth looses atmosphere at the following rates per second.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrogen 3 kg  </li>
<li>Helium 0.050 kg  </li>
</ul>
<p>Other gases at lower rates.</p>
<p>This is just the distribution of molecular speed due to heat, and molecules exiting with speed over escape velocity or 12.7km/s vanish forever.</p>
<p>It is easy to calculate. Given a temperature, a molecule with have a given energy distribution. Think a cloud of golf balls, billiard balls, and ping-pong balls. Only the very fastest will get enough speed to escape gravity. It will be mostly ping-pong balls. The physicas is accurate and well established. Some uncertainty in average temperature and actual gas composition due to solar wind, radiation, and chemical reactions (of for example ozone)</p></div>		</li>
