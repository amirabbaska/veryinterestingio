			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible that it is gone, yes, through merger with another galaxy or an encounter with a black hole (though I'm not sure how likely this could be seeing as it would be a <em>whole galaxy</em>). If it does still exist, it would likely look much different from what we perceive now, as we can only see it as it was since light left the galaxy all that time ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are observing it how it looked 13.6B years ago yes, who knows what the instantaneous snapshot of the galaxy looks like today, because that would require by definition some superluminal transport of information, which is impossible. We are only updated by new photons arriving each second and cannot 'see' a 'more recent' picture of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boy this stuff is so fascinating. I wish we would discover &quot;the secrets to the universe&quot; before I die but I imagine i would have to live to like 1000 or some such number. I'll be lucky to hear of actual active life (ie. Microbes or some multicellular microscopic being) on Mars. </p></div>		</li>
