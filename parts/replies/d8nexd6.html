<p>With the technology we have now I don't see how we could ever terraform Mars. We can barely control our own atmosphere. However, with the speed at which technology is advancing we might be able to do it in a few centuries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am not entirely sure but i think mars atmosphere is like 96%+ CO2 anyway, but there is another greenhouse gas we could produce which would warm up mars even better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, warming up Mars is going to be very difficult, not to mention also we don't just need to warm it up but also compress it, that is, to increase the surface atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>You want to turn a ~600 pascal atmosphere to a ~100,000 pascal one. That's a lot of added mass in gas. The mass exists out there, but it's difficult to actually get it onto Mars, or to get it out of Mars.</p>
<p>(NB. we probably could do with less, with better control over the gas mixture. E.g. you can use less pascals if you have higher percent composition O2. But still, you're talking about several dozen fold increase in atmospheric pressure and thus associated mass.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Eventually, maybe 500 years from now, maybe less, we should actually be able to teraform Mars, creating a livable atmosphere.</p>

<p>Is that even possible? I thought Mars is just too small to keep an atmosphere with it's own mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Mars is actually thought to have once had an earth like atmosphere of its own.</p>
<p>Mars lacks a magnetosphere, which means that it's atmosphere will be slowly stripped away by solar winds. This is theoretically solvable, most likely by just continuing to add to the atmosphere at the same rate it gets stripped away. I've heard of plans to create an artificial magnetosphere, but I have no idea how practical that would be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which would be incredibly easy. It was stripped away over millions of years, so our normal activity there would be plenty to sustain it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Its exceedingly likely that trying to get humans to Mars, let alone colonize it, will create huge tech advancement here on Earth.&quot;</p>
<p>why?  We have all the technology we need to do it right now.  it's just a matter of building big enough rockets, sending enough launches, constructing a space habitat, and sending it to mars and doing the mission.  name one problem that we don't already know how to solve.  we can put shielding in spacecraft. just make em heavier and send more launches.  Just a little engineering that needs to be done.</p>
<p>I mean, its generally true that spending money on developing new products is probably going to create some new technologies, but there isn't anything magical about spending money on developing mars mission stuff that makes it way more useful than spending that same money on say, biology or materials research  not attached to any mars mission.  I'd argue you are better off funding just research without all the costs of fuel and basic manufacturing on top.  You get the tech.. then when a mars mission is cheap and productive, then you go.</p></div>		</li>
