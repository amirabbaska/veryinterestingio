			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive definitely experienced that type of &quot;hibernation&quot;. I went to Michigan's UP for my birthday two years ago and despite it being August, the temperatures were mid-50's and it was raining. We had planned on camping and exploring the falls but it was too cold to be outside, so we set up our tent and were asleep by 7:00pm. Woke up around 10:00am the following morning to find it was still pouring, so we went back to sleep. Finally actually got up around 1:00pm. </p></div>		</li>
