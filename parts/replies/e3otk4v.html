			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;initial mass function&quot; is the distribution of the masses of stars <em>when they form</em>. When the gas clouds in a galaxy collapse to form stars, they form a small number of massive stars, and a large number of small stars.</p>
<p>But on top of that, the more massive stars don't live as long. Even though they have more fuel to burn, they burn it a <em>lot</em> more quickly (making them brighter and hotter). A star 8 times the mass of the Sun will live for only millions of years. The Sun will live for billions of years. And a star 1/8th the mass of our Sun will live for <em>trillions</em> of years.</p>
<p>So, not only are there very few massive stars to start with, but once a galaxy stops forming stars, those massive stars will quickly burn out and you'll only have the small dim stars left. But while age does matter, the initial mass function does mean that most stars are on the low mass end to start with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could one use this to come up with a method of “galactic dating” using the same principles of carbon dating to estimate a galaxy’s age; instead of looking at ratios of isotopes, one looks at ratios of star masses? Is this feasible and has it been attempted?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a healthy number of stars that have been around since the first creation of stars then? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if we want to perpetuate humanity for trillions of years, we need to find one of these small stars and orbit it much closer than we currently do with the sun. Is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>like some sort of maximum parabola. The plot points would be (from left to right) :
16, 25, 20, 10, 3</p>
<p>so the maximum total mass of stars occurs for stars that are 0.5 times the mass of our sun, following the mass distribution function used by the user above. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it hasn't displayed properly, but it's meant to be m to the power -2.35, so what it's saying is that the amount of stars of a given mass ( Φ(m) is a probability distribution) is proportional to the mass \^ -2.35 - you can plot it on   desmos.com if you don't know what that looks like.</p></div>		</li>
