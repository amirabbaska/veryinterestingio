			<div class="markdown"><p>When it first came out in the 80's, there <em>wasn't</em> a formula. Many different solutions were invented by different people, who each took a different approach to the Cube. </p>
<p>Trying to solve the Rubik's Cube on your own <em>is</em> exceedingly difficult. Nowadays, very few people develop their own solution because the &quot;beginner's method&quot; is easy to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 3x3 is usually a person's first introduction to the world of puzzles, and at that point very few people have the ability to figure it out on their own. It's honestly a pretty difficult puzzle if you don't already know the solution. It's a gateway drug, after the 3x3 there's a whole world of crazy geometries for you to figure out on your own, if you so desire! </p>
<p>However, if something like, say, the <a href="https://ruwix.com/twisty-puzzles/pyraminx-triangle-rubiks-cube/" target="_blank">Pyraminx</a> was the puzzle that started the craze, I think most beginners <em>would</em> be able to figure out a solution on their own pretty easily.</p></div>		</li>
