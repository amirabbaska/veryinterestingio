			<div class="markdown"><p>To really hammer in the point about &quot;if you answer a question, you can then ask a thousand more&quot;, there is a famous story about Max Plank being discouraged from majoring in physics (in the 1870s) by a professor because they thought physics was &quot;basically solved&quot;. There were just a few strange little things they didn't understand but those holes would be patched up shortly. Of course some of those few little holes turned out to be the launching points of quantum physics and relativity. Physics was not nearly done, like they thought.</p>
<p>With math, I don't think there has really ever been a time in all of the thousands of years of mathematical thought that a leading mathematician didn't understand the enormity of how much math they did not know. The questions-asked to questions-answered ratio is practically incomprehensible. Many of the questions asked require only elementary number knowledge to understand their statements, as many have told you already. You've been given a few lists of tremendous open problems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau%27s_problems" target="_blank">These four</a> are the ones that mystify me most, particularly the final one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand a little bit about a few problems you linked to, rest I cannot even pretend to understand. I once thought I might understand how the Fermat's last theorem was proved only to realize that it is beyond me.</p>
<p>Are there still any &quot;low hanging fruits&quot; in the field of mathematics you can think of, something that anyone with a basic degree and a computer can figure out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's lots of easily understandable open problems, but these are usually deceptively hard. Fermat's Last Theorem is a good example, simple to understand, basically need a PhD in math to understand the proof. One popular problem of this type is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture" target="_blank">Collatz Conjecture</a>. Many a naive new /r/math subscribers try to answer it, to no avail. Give it a shot yourself if you want, you most definitely won't solve it but it would be a really good learning experience and that's really the whole point of having unsolved problems. </p>
<p>Aside from this, there are more computationally intensive problems that will generally always be open. Like finding the next largest prime. You can use the <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/" target="_blank">GIMPS software</a> to contribute your computer to the search, and if the next largest prime is verified using your computer you win a couple thousand bucks. Good luck, the last 5-or-so have been won by the same guy who converts his university library to a huge prime-searching-bank during off-hours. <a href="http://www.primegrid.com/" target="_blank">Prime Grid</a> does a similar thing, but for a variety of different problems. These would probably be the easiest way to &quot;contribute&quot; to math, but if you want to learn math and do problems, pick up a textbook in a subject that's always interested you and have at it! A CS degree doesn't really cover enough math to have much of a vocabulary about it, but reading textbooks and just being actively curious about it can fix that. Who knows, maybe you'll think of your own problem and solve it, it's not unheard of (some standard statistics stuff was created and solved by someone working at a Guinness brewery). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you think a CS degree wouldn't cover enough math to expose the basic language of math? I am admittedly only tangentially related to CS, but from what I have seen people are actively working in (and pushing the boundaries of) logic, combinatorics, type theory, graph theory, proof theory, category theory, quantum theory, optimization, numerical methods, etc. It seems like the theoretical side of CS is very much steeped in the language of modern (and often cutting edge) math. </p></div>		</li>
