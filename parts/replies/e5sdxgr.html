			<div class="markdown"><p>This radiation cuts through you like butter. Any tissue shielding will be completely negligible. In fact it will just increase the dose because of dose build-up reasons.</p>
<p>But all of this is irrelevant anyway because in animal experiments you of course make sure you subject all of them to the same dose. (dose is a point quantity so size doesn't matter) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying there's any shielding.  I'm saying that large animals absorb more of the ionizing radiation, and suffer more ill effects,  because particles travel a longer distance through flesh before possibly exiting the other side.</p></div>		</li>
