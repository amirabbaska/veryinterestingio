			<div class="markdown"><p>Too bad it's wrong. Mao launched the Cultural Revolution recently after his monumental failure of the Great Leap Forward, in which he became the laughing stock of the Chinese People and was almost ousted from the Chinese Communist Party. (In fact he resigned as State Chairman in 1959.) He did, in fact, have many enemies in the Party after that incident. Mao was not some leader that the people of China blindly followed, contrary to wherever the hell that belief came from.</p></div>		</li>
