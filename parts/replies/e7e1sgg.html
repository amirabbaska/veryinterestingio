			<div class="markdown"><p>The latter is a &quot;perpetual solar eclipse&quot;, regardless of what the OP meant.   Forget about rotation for a minute:  if some body is perpetually between the sun and the earth then the earth is perpetually undergoing a solar eclipse.   If the eclipsing body is casting its shadow on the Earth then the Earth is seeing an eclipse.  </p>
<p>EDIT: The rotation of the earth causes the sun to rise and set but the sun would still be eclipsed throughout the day at whatever angle relative to the earth that it appears to be for you, as the eclipsing object is still between the Earth and the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a rotating earth, would the shape of visible sun change from sunrise until noon? Or would the location of the &quot;hole&quot; in the sun be the exact same?</p>
<p>I'm asking from dawn until noon because I imagine whatever happens would reverse after noon until sunset. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a total eclipse is technically a total eclipse for the whole planet, even if you’re not in the tiny sliver of surface that is totally blocked from the sun. You’d have to be really far away from the sun and have a huge moon-to-planet size ratio for the entire sun-facing surface to fully experience it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rotating matters because if the location of the eclipse is always moving around the planet, then it would not seem to be perpetual. </p></div>		</li>
