<p>We can mask it or alter it in ways that are pretty profound from a human perspective... but for a creature whose nose is literally 10,000 times better at minimum, perfumes, soaps, and deodorants do very, very little to mute our natural aromas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, this isn't really accurate.</p>
<p>Dogs have a lot more scent glands - about 125-300 million, compared to about 5 million for humans. Humans also have a lot fewer receptor genes - about 350, compared to about 1000 for things like rodents.</p>
<p>While this seems like they would indicate humans have a poor sense of smell, this is actually wrong. The problem comes from the fact that human noses are not constructed like the noses of most other animals like rodents or dogs; instead, our nasal cavities have a very different setup, which is immediately obvious looking at our face.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you remove about 80% of the olfactory area from a mouse, it won't have any different sense of smell at all. This is pretty surprising, given you'd assume all of that would be important, but in smell detection tests, it hardly makes any difference at all.</p>
<p>More surprising still, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10667993" target="_blank">humans actually are very good at catching scent of things.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When tested for thresholds to the odors of a series of straight-chain (aliphatic) aldehydes, dogs do better on the short chain compounds, but humans perform as well or slightly better than dogs on the longer chain compounds, and humans perform significantly better than rats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reality is that the way that dog noses are set up is probably to detect <em>different</em> scents than humans are set up to detect. Humans are better at smelling some things than dogs and worse at others. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC406401/" target="_blank">According to this paper:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A marked difference between the noses of primates and other mammals is that in nearly all nonprimate mammals, the nasal cavities contain at the front a much-convoluted filtering apparatus (formed by the ethmo- and maxillo-turbinals) covered with respiratory membrane. This filtering apparatus is a biological air conditioner (Negus 1958) with three key functions: cleaning, warming, and humidifying the inspired air. An important function of the filtering apparatus is presumably to protect the nasal cavity from infections. In many mammals, air drawn into the nose is often highly contaminated with bacteria from fecal material, decaying animal and plant material, and noxious fumes from the environment, all of which attack the olfactory epithelium. Rodents are susceptible to chronic rhinitis, which causes substantial loss of functioning olfactory receptor cells (Hinds et al. 1984).</p>
<p>This filtering, however, might have negative consequences for odor detection. Warming and humidification presumably enhance the odor-stimulating capacity of the inhaled air, but cleaning would remove odor molecules by absorbing them into the lining of the epithelium, an effect which could be large depending on the size of the filtering apparatus. If so, mammals with large snouts might have a large inventory of olfactory receptors at least in part to offset the loss of odor molecules absorbed by the filtering apparatus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's actually a number of reasons to suspect that humans might actually be pretty darned good at smelling when you get down to the physiology of it, and actual tests seem to bear out the idea that humans actually possess a pretty keen sense of smell overall. It is true that we cannot smell all the things dogs can, but it appears that dogs cannot smell all the things humans can, either - and many mammals are significantly worse than us.</p>
<p>One interesting hypothesis I've read suggests that one of the reasons might have been that a very keen sense of smell might have been useful for detecting fecal matter and the smell of mold, both of which can make us sick. Being able to smell the difference between spoiled food and good food, and being able to avoid poop, might have been large evolutionary advantages which drove us to be better at smelling those things, while our inability to track things like a dog might have been less important because we had other senses (hearing, vision) which accomplished those suitably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My old dog was deaf and blind before he died. He never knew when I got home until I touched him. After a while, I realized he probably couldn't smell me because my whole apartment smelled like me. He could, however, smell the leftover steak I brought home for him two weeks before he died.</p></div>		</li>
