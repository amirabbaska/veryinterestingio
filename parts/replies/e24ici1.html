			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. In contrast to the article linked at the top your article actually gives an explanation for why house cats have slit pupils while larger cats have not. It is not about how far they are from the ground, but that house cats hunt at night while the large cats are mostly diurnal. Tthat means the house cat needs a larger pupil to gather more light and multifocal lenses to deal with stronger colour aberration. In daylight a constricted round pupil would then cover part of the lens in these &quot;night sight eyes&quot; which is why they developed slits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly very good, although the physics of a constricted aperture aren't limited to spherical aberration. Narrow pupils probably evolved before the lens, much the same way that pinhole cameras were invented before cameras with lenses.</p></div>		</li>
