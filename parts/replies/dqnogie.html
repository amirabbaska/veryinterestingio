<p>Could you ELI5 this? I have a general idea what gain is...but what does it mean to have a million...gain? I don’t get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other replies to your post are correct about the idea of gain but not about how it applies in this instance.</p>
<p>If you put a 1,000 watt signal into an antenna with a gain of 1,000,000, it doesn't suddenly magically put out 1,000,000,000 watts.</p>
<p>In antennas, gain is about signal intensity compared to an omnidirectional antenna (an antenna that sends an equal amount of energy in every direction).</p>
<p>So, let's say you have an omnidirectional antenna transmitting 1000 watts. </p>
<p>You have a small antenna a long way away receiving this signal. The small antenna picks up 0.000001 watts of the signal (one millionth of a watt).</p>
<p>Now, you switch to a highly directional antenna, pointed directly at the receiving antenna. Instead of sending power out in all directions, the directional antenna sends all the power in a tight cone towards the receiving antenna. </p>
<p>Let's say that now, using the highly directional transmitting antenna, the receiving antenna picks up 1 watt of signal. That's 1,000,000 times as much signal as it got when the antenna was omnidirectional. The highly directional transmitting antenna has a gain of 1,000,000.</p>
<p>Note, however, that you get LESS signal in any direction the antenna isn't pointing - with the omnidirectional antenna, you got the same signal regardless of antenna orientation. With the directional antenna, if the antenna is pointed just a little bit wrong, the signal will be much WORSE than with the omnidirectional antenna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Mathematically, gain is literally Output/Input. So if you put 5W into a box, and the box spits out 50W, you have a gain of 10. Gain is also unitless, because Watts/Watts is just a scalar quantity.</p>
<p>Gain is often expressed in decibels, as gain can often reach large numbers (for example, around a million). To convert gain to decibels, you'd take 10*logBase10 of the amount. So, a gain of 1,000,000 would be 60dB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is almost correct. In the terms on an antenna, however, you aren’t increasing transmitted power, you are increasing effective transmitted power.</p>
<p>There is something called a point source antenna that radiates power equally in all directions. When an antenna has gain, in a certain direction there appears to more power compared to the “isotopic radiator”. Because of conservation of energy, there is now less power available in other directions.</p>
<p>Take the dish for example, just like a magnifying glass it “focuses” energy in one direction. When you burn a leaf with it, you are increasing the effective power per unit area. You do not however increase the power output of the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way to think about this is &quot;directivity&quot;. Imagine an antenna that transmits and receives equally well in any direction. This is called an &quot;isotropic&quot; antenna and used as an idealized model of an antenna with zero gain (in practice there are no perfectly isotropic antenna, but ignore that for the moment).</p>
<p>A good way to visualize this is a naked light bulb emitting light in all directions.</p>
<p>However all you want to illuminate is just a very small spot in a very specific direction. So what you do is, that you put the light bulb into a some contraption that focuses all the light coming from the bulb to go into a certain direction.</p>
<p>Now imagine you put a sphere around the light bulb. Without the focusing device the whole surface of the sphere is illuminated, but with the focusing device only a small spot. The ratio between the total surface of the sphere over the small surface of the spot illuminated is the gain¹ of the focusing device. So if the spot illuminated is one millionths of the total surface of the sphere you have a gain of one million.</p>
<p>In radio technology we hardly ever state gain in a linear scale though. We use deciBels (dB) where 10dB is a gain of 10×, 20dB is a gain of 100×, 30dB → 1000×, and so on. So a gain of one million is 60dB. It also works the other way round, i.e. -10dB → 1/10, -20dB → 1/100, -30dB → 1/1000, …</p>
<p>We also use dB together with some reference value to denote absolute power. The typical reference value is 1mW, and we denote that by dBm or dB(mW). If you look at your computers/phones WiFi control panel you'll see received signal strength given in dBm, usually that are negative values. -10dBm is 0.1mW, -20dB → 0.01mW, …</p>
<p>The license free spectrum used by WiFi is limited to a transmitted power of 100mW = 20dBm (with reference to a isotropic antenna, but ignore that for the moment, most WiFi access ports behave as if they are isotropic, because you want to have signal in every direction). Now if I look at the WiFi I'm currently connected to, it reports a signal strength of -32dBm. Assuming that the access point I'm connected to transmits at, say 15dBm that amounts to a signal &quot;gain&quot; of about -47dB, negative dB are attenuation. 40dB is 10000, 50dB is 100000, so the signal is about 1/50000th weaker just a few meters away from the access point. <strong>But</strong> both my notebook computer and the access point have antennas that are closer to isotropic, than directive.</p>
<p>I could however fit a strongly focusing antenna on both the access point and my computer and receive a much stronger signal on either end²·³. This is essentially how it works with deep space probes: Strongly focusing antennas on either end, with some 60dB to 70dB gain here on Earth and some 40dB gain on the probe.</p>
<hr />
<p>¹: The term &quot;gain&quot; in context of an antenna is a little bit misleading, because the very same term is also used to describe amplifiers. In German radio terminology the terms used are &quot;Gewinn&quot; (lit. &quot;winnings&quot; or, well, &quot;gain&quot;) and &quot;Verstärkung&quot; (lit. &quot;amplification&quot;), but in English for both the same word &quot;gain&quot; is used.</p>
<p>²: actually regulatory rules disallow that, unless I weaken down the signal below the permitted isotropic equivalent levels.</p>
<p>³: or I could &quot;whip out&quot; my amateur radio license move my WiFi frequency into the amateur band and operate according to amateur radio rules, i.e. include my callsign into the transmissions and don't encrypt and don't use it for commercial/political purposes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In theory, yes. In practice, not so much. This is a bigger concern with the Mars rovers (of which I was contributor). The signals <em>are</em> encrypted and the practice actually began with the Russian missions to Mars. This, to avoid any interception from the US. Voyager (both of them) are so outrageously distant that a hijack wouldn't be possible without NASA grade dishes - of which there is only one in the world that is still operational. Although the communication system includes a 3.7 meter diameter parabolic dish high-gain antenna to send and receive radio waves via the three Deep Space Network stations on the Earth. These modulated waves are placed in the S-band (about 13 cm in wavelength) and X-band (about 3.6 cm in wavelength) which provided a bit rate as high as 115.2 kilobits per second when Voyager 1 was at the distance of Jupiter from the Earth, and many fewer kilobits per second at larger distances. In reality, the data rate for Voyagers is measured in b/s - it's <em>very</em> slow and only sends back very limited telemetry data.</p>
<p>One final point on the vehicle hijack scenario, people have tried, the shuttle has experienced it and it became a much larger concern with the rover programs. We didn't need some goofball couchsurfer taking over a really expensive RC car on Mars. The signals are encrypted, to the point of ludicrous overkill.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I meant to say &quot;Russian missions to Venus&quot;, not Mars - clarification for any future readers. The Venera missions were done during the height of the cold war, this was a very real concern for the Kremlin that US meddling would potentially sabotage the mission to disgrace their program. In actuality, the Venera program yielded very spectacular results and was &quot;first&quot; to perform many exploration landmarks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An ELI5 of this would be instead of sending just binary 1's and 0's to the spacecraft, they would send a &quot;Vector&quot; to represent a 1 and a &quot;Vector&quot; to represent a 0. If you don't know what those vectors are, the spacecraft wouldn't be able to decode the signal, and hence won't act on the transmission you've sent to it.</p></div>		</li>
