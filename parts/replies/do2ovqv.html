<p>One is that their guidance components use GPS to guide them into their targets. This is in fact not true. These missiles must reach their target and relying on GPS might harm their chances of that happening if the GPS system where to be attacked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many missile guidance systems which can rely on GPS information for course correction. The Trident II (D5) SLBM is one such example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the majority of ICBM/SLBM use celestial navigation (The positions of the stars) to guide them into their targets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The primary basis for virtually all ballistic missiles, especially ICBMs, is interial navigation. The guidance system contains a gyroscope that is either spun up prior to launch or maintained in a continuously running state on an air bearing. Only a handful of missile guidance systems incorporate astral or celestial navigation, typically those found on submarines and aircraft as launching from a moving platform requires course correction; the Trident I did, the Trident II does, the Minuteman III does not, and the Peacekeeper did not. In every such case, astral navigation compliments inertial navigation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They don't have to be super accurate. A circular error of probability of half a mile is acceptable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The required CEP of the Minuteman III and Trident II are 200M and 90M respectively. The wildly inaccurate multi-megaton ICBMs of the 60s and 70s are long gone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another common misconception is that the warheads have some communication component that offers an ability to communicate with it after launch and give a recall or cancellation ability, so if a missile is fired in some sort of accidental launch scenario it can be communicated with and made inert or to blow itself up without going nuclear. This is also not true and is a myth perpetrated by Hollywood. The risks of an enemy finding out how to communicate with the missile and destroy it would be too great. These weapons are designed to be the ultimate and last deterrent. The missile, once fired, communicates with nothing and no-one. It is a self contained system that once the button has been pressed, will carry out it's mission to it's final horrifying end unless it is somehow intercepted externally.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed this is a myth, but not for the reason that you describe. For a variety of reasons that are outside the scope of ELI5, establishing secure and coherent radio contact with a missile flying over hostile territory is extremely difficult and even more unreliable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll provide a correction here: there are 2 or 3 gyroscopes (depending on the type of gyroscope) along with 3 accelerometers. The point of these instruments is to measure the 6 degrees of freedom of the guidance system:  movement in x,y,z and rotation about x,y,z. </p>
<p>I believe what you are describing as being floated on an air bearing is a flywheel, which I do not believe is implemented in the trident II D5 or Minute Man III. </p>
<p>You hit the nail on the head with which missiles use star sighting and the GPS problems. There is a star sighting update that occurs during flight and it corrects the calculated position of the missile. </p>
<p>Also, the actual CEP numbers are classified, so do not take any claims at CEP as factual. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The Minuteman III gyros are on air bearing</p>

<p>FYI, Trident II does not have GPS, it's just INS with a star sight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found a number of conflicting reports suggesting the following:</p>
<p>1.) The MK6 guidance system is capable of maintaining precision without relying on external reference aids such as GPS</p>
<p>2.) The MK6 guidance system is GPS-free</p>
<p>3.) The Trident II guidance system is designed to receive GPS updates, and is capable of receiving GPS updates</p>
<p>4.) Trident II's stellar-inertial navigation system incorporates GPS updates, giving the missiles a 90 m (300 ft) CEP</p>
<p>5.) Trident II's did not incorporate GPS updates in their initial design, but this was planned as a later upgrade.</p>
<p>6.) The US Navy has been using GPS on test missiles for analytical reasons</p>
<p>7.) GPS navigation can be used by some modernised reentry vehicles for a ~10M CEP.</p>
<p>Obviously these individual reports are impossible to reconcile and I am unable to dig up any authoritative sources on the matter as they may not be public. I suspect that many may just be the result of poor source validation or a failure to properly delineate between missile guidance and reentry vehicle guidance.</p>
<p>GPS course correction would be especially useful on MIRV configurations because the reentry vehicles will each want to do their own thing. Accordingly, I suspect that it is available, but is presumed to be unavailable in the event of an actual mission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Submarine navigator here. Just for shits and giggles, and to keep to our old school roots, sometimes my watch team would go for most or our watch navigating solely by shooting azimuth's and navigating by celestial bearings using the periscope. Not super accurate but most of the time we could be within 1/2 mile radius after 6 hours. Of course we had GPS with trip wires set for safety, but it feels good navigating the same way they did hundreds of years ago </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should read “Command and Control” by Eric Schlosser. Then you will be really amazed on how close it really was...</p>
<p>Star sighting is pretty bad ass. You can get a good amount of info on it from the inter webs. Basically, the position of the missile is calculated by the inertial navigation system, so we know where a star should be. Then a few pictures are taken and the error between calculated and actual location is now known. With that info the missiles position can be corrected </p></div>		</li>
