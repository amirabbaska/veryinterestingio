			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to an apartment office to turn in an application. They required a SSN on the application. I wrote it on there kind of messily. As the clerk was processing my application, she came back out to us in the lobby...which had other people in it. She says to me &quot;I'm having a hard time reading this, so is this saying your social security number is...&quot; and she then proceeds to read my social security number out loud where other people could hear. </p>
<p>Crummy security procedures is right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I tried to write &quot;confidential&quot; but she said she couldn't do the approval process without it...</p>
<p>Well, if I get my identity stolen I'll know it was because a clerk read my SSN out to everyone in the lobby...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact - <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2552992/it-management/not-so-unique.html" target="_blank">SSNs, and TINs in general are not always unique</a>. In a data base of several million you'll likely run into several valid but not unique numbers. When you get to non individual TINs there is less uniqueness  - laywers use common TINs for IOLTAs on a per state level, Girl Scouts use a common TIN per council/region.</p></div>		</li>
