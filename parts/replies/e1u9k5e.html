			<div class="markdown"><p>No, bandwidth is bandwidth.  20Mhz is 20Mhz whether it's in the VHF band or the 5Ghz WiFi band.</p>
<p>That's an incorrect term, the term you want is either capacity or throughput.  And the reason lower frequency RF signals TEND to get lower throughput for the same bandwidth has more to do with noise than anything since most wireless telecommunication standards have defined resource spacing in time.  If they didn't, then a higher frequency signal with equivalent bandwidth would have higher throughput proportional to the ratio of the frequencies because they could have a higher symbol rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So 20Mhz of 64QAM at 150Mhz carries less information than 20Mhz of 64QAM at 14Ghz?  How does that work?</p>
<p>Engineering RF links, I've never once been asked for the carrier frequency when it comes to calculating throughput and occupied bandwidth.  Sure, it comes in when calculating free space path loss it's required, but not with throughput.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the wireless Telecom standards that we use define symbol length in time, they will have the same throughout.  However, if you don't define the symbol length as a fixed length of time and instead leverage the increased number of cycles per unit of time and instead define symbol length as the time for a set number of cycles.  </p>
<p>So for LTE the symbol length is 66.67us, but at 700 MHz a single cycle would only take 1.42ns, but a single cycle for 2100Mhz is 0.476ns.    So if you defined the symbol length in time as a cycle count you could theoretically have 3x the tput on 2100Mhz as compared to 700Mhz.</p>
<p>This comes with challenges, having a single defined symbol length makes timing and coordination easier, as well as keeps the Baseband abstracted from the transmit frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like wind resistance though. High frequency signals transmit with lower power and the objects that they pass through are more likely to absorb the radiation. If you crank up the power you may penetrate them but the signal then becomes unusable (think someone screaming in your ear).</p></div>		</li>
