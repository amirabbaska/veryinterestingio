<p>Just playing devil's advocate here, but when you're talking about extinct animals that no one has ever seen, how do you know if your guesses turn out to be right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: no. Birds and reptiles lack the sort of facial muscles that proboscid mammals rejigger to control a trunk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well not exactly trunk-like (I guess having a beak would preclude any sort of trunk appendage), but <a href="https://media.mnn.com/assets/images/2015/10/rooster-red-comb.jpg.653x0_q80_crop-smart.jpg" target="_blank">roosters' combs</a> come to mind.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the (male) elephant seal. Pretty much any mammal with a big fleshy thing on its nose gets called 'elephant <something>'. But would a less heavy, less muscular detail be detectable from a fossil, such as the schnozz of a proboscis monkey? I'm doubtful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>I suspect she made a argumental mistake.</del> Even without something as similar as an elephant skull to look at, there would be signs of tendons and muscles that we could definitely say meant there was some sort of meaty appendage there, that could do some serious muscle-work. We might have been off on the specifics, but there would be no mistaking it for a regular snout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right; maybe like a pig or manatee. Something meaty to grub around and grab food with, as these are examples of creatures we have with a meatier snout. We might assume they rooted in the dirt or mud. Incredible how much that single detail would change our view of mammoth ecology and their depictions in books! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm being a bit pedantic, but the premise doesn't mention mammoths. We could see the similarity between mammoths (of which several were preserved in ice in Siberia, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyuba" target="_blank">this one</a>) and the elephant fossils and make the leap to elephants having trunks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we do have other mammals with trunks or trunklike nasal/labial appendages.</p>
<p>You'd have to rewrite the question to exclude elephant seals, dik-diks, and so forth.</p></div>		</li>
