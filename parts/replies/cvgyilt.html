			<p>The presence of perchlorates affects the stability of water. I took this photo of the slide show in the brief, which answers your question-<br><a href="http://imgur.com/p8MPGNs" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/p8MPGNs</a></p>		</li>

			<p>That is a fantastic graph.  Very clear without getting too dense in presentation.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I decided to look at the average temperatures to see what that really means for us and google gave me this <br><br>'While the average temperature on Mars is about 218° K (-55° C, -67° F), Martian surface temperatures range widely from as little as 140° K (-133° C, -207° F) at the winter pole to almost 300° K (27° C, 80° F) on the dayside during summer.'<br><br>So if the surface ranges from -133 to 27, and the range is -70 to 24. (celsius) How often is it actually within that range on the surface? I thought I heard that it would run for awhile, then evaporate mid way. Is that basically how we percieve this?</p>		</li>

			<p>That's only 3 degrees though and you're talking average temps which isn't a lot. Also it's conceivable that the  area of the flows never reaches the maximum. My thinking is these flows never evaporate or else the water would all be gone now. It probably just refreezes and slowly rises back to the top of the slope due to temperature fluctuating in the fluid. Just my two cents.</p>		</li>

			<p>I thought I read somewhere that the water was measured at -23C<br><br>Or was it that the temperature in the area was -23C, I don't recall.</p>		</li>
