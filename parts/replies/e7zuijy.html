			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Ash P. here. Fascinating question! I don't think we know of any other animals that have evolved the same erect stance that hominins show. If we look at other animals that are two-legged, they seem to do the &quot;upright&quot; thing really differently. Two examples might be birds (well, theropod dinosaurs) and kangaroos. They both hold their lower backs pretty horizontally compared with people and so they avoid many of our problems.</p></div>		</li>
