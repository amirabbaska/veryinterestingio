			<div class="markdown"><p>The convivial persona is something that develops as one grows accustomed to working in customer service, hospitality, and restaurants. Sure, some places offer training, but most of it is gained through emulating peers in the field.</p>
<p>One observes experienced coworkers having greater success with commissions, performance reviews, and tips and copies the behaviors and linguistic approach that others use. Eventually, it's like playing with any accent or role. I did over a decade in customer service/sales, less than a year in a call center, and recently began serving.</p>
<p>I'm from California, but I've lived in the Deep South for over 20 years. I tend to be extra polite and eager to please when I'm in a work situation where I'm interacting with a customer/guest. The various southern drawls I can wield are something I bring out because people respond to me more favorably and agreeably when they feel like I'm a local.</p>
<p>I think being able to be genuine helps immensely, as well. When you can convince people that you care about their inane bs with just a look and body language (or vocal inflection when on a phone), you will have an immensely better experience in these fields.</p>
<p>Side note: I actually started using the convivial persona to cope with my ongoing recovery from brain damage after an accident in 2015. It wasn't a conscious decision. I just started doing it without having to think about it. It feels like sort of a natural reaction to my life approach. My physical and mental therapists convinced me to always look for the silver lining in everything I do. I'm not saccharine and cloying to be around, but I tend to favor maintaining a light, pleasant presence. </p>
<p>EDIT: &quot;Inane bs&quot; was the knee jerk reply that came to mind before I even noticed it. It's been a long week and I was half asleep when I added to the discussion. A better answer is requests. I would very roughly estimate that 1/100th of my interactions over that decade of customer service were in regards to inane bs.</p>
<p>I developed the ability to let myself be enthusiastic about the goals and product aspirations of customers about two or three years into my career in customer service and sales.</p>
<p>I take pride in being able to turn an upset customer's/guest's experience into a good one; or, at the very least, getting them the help they need to find some measure of satisfaction with a place. It's not always pleasant. You can't please everyone.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a jerk is a jerk. Sometimes, that very unpleasant person is upset about something completely beyond your power to influence, or they have chosen you as the scapegoat for their personal problems. Those days, you really do slip into the nigh sarcastically saccharine persona. They will continue being unpleasant to even notice in that case anyways.</p>
<p>Regardless, as I've grown older, I've learned to enjoy interacting with people and honestly am not mocking them or being disingenuous. Once again, brain damage is a factor. I am notoriously oblivious to sarcasm these days. So, when someone gives me a sarcastic response, I treat it as legitimate nearly every time. It's very disarming to their original intent as they realize I am scrambling to meet their request. We have a good chuckle about it afterwards. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Am i the only person who finds this way of talking to be offensive.  It's basically a way of saying &quot;I'm being completely dishonest with you &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone that worked the food industry for years, we aren't being dishonest with you; it's our job to be a good sport while at work and be cheerful and friendly. At the end of the day, a lot of the time I fake til I make it, and a lot of the time I only have to have a convivial persona for only a moment, until I can get my actual happy self back. I feel like the happy self I am when I'm behind the bar/counter/phone is my legitimate self. I wouldn't want to speak to a grumpy guss if I came in for ice cream or whatever.</p>
<p>TL;DR: it's not dishonesty, it's just our job. Most of the time we legit like the customers that come in, so being nice is easy. I think the only time we're being dishonest is when someone is being an ass hat to us and we have to be the bigger people so we don't lose our job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's uncanny how defined that &quot;different persona&quot; can be.  Everything from body language and speech patterns to even the less formal moments (i.e. laughter) become entirely scripted, and it becomes easy to maintain once that precedent is set with certain people.  It's like the goal just becomes to never get caught breaking character.</p>
<p>I didn't even realize I did that so deliberately until a few years ago.  I got a call one day from a client while I was around some friends and without hesitating, answered it in my normal &quot;professional&quot; voice.  After the call, it was pointed out to me how weird it is that I completely changed the way I spoke and acted when I was on the phone, then just went on like nothing happened after the call ended.  I mean, I get why it's funny and all, but now I avoid making calls around other people.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Sometimes, it's just easier to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSG07IgmNyA" target="_blank">Gus Fring</a> (Spoiler alert: multiple scenes from Breaking Bad)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife has come by the office to eat lunch together a few times and she's said on multiple occasions that I sound gay when I use my &quot;phone voice&quot;. This is the first job that I have worked where I have been required to talk on the phone. My mom worked at jobs that required her to be on the phone with customers pretty much her whole life and she has an amazing phone voice. She taught me how to talk on the phone at a young age and I'm a bit of a parrot, so I just ended up mimicking what she does and got into that habit at around 7 years old or so when answering the phone around the house. </p>
<p>Roughly 20 years later and I cannot turn off the &quot;phone voice&quot; that I have developed by mimicking her. It's like a completely different personality that just takes over as soon as I pick up the phone. I got a promotion at work for being great on the phones and &quot;making customers feel like they are being taken care of with my calming phone persona.&quot;</p>
<p>A small piece of me dies inside every time I hang the phone up and I feel like I need a shower to wash off the &quot;fake&quot; that I have just slathered myself in after every call but hey, I'm good at it and it pays the bills. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After 30+ years in sales, and serving, I am in character in almost every transactional situation I'm in. My teenaged son has recently noticed this and it makes him so uncomfortable. He accuses me of being fake and mocks me mercilessly. He'll learn. </p>
<p>I hate making or receiving business calls in front of people I know because I they also notice how I change personas, and it makes me a bit self conscious. </p>
<p>On the other hand, being in a roomful of sales and cs people and watching everyone turn it on and off whenever they pick up the phone or meet a client is entertaining.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But when I'm not at work I'm pretty much the exact opposite, I keep to myself, don't talk a lot and when I do it's definitely not in my &quot;bar voice&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked as both a server and take out at my old job, and my server persona is very over the top friendly and helpful. For takeout especially I had to work my personality hard to try to get people to give me a few dollars, since most people don't tip on takeout food. Serving I had actually tried before using my normal personality vs my server personality and it truly made a difference, IIRC around 5% average, bc usually id make over 20% (bc I was extra and a cute high schooler) and if I didn't use my serving personality it'd be around 15%.
I've always said serving is selling food and your personality. If you have a good one people tend to give you more money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same issue. I've had some success combating that shyness when taking to new people by telling myself &quot;treat them like a customer&quot;. I'm in customer service and when a customer visits in person my job is to show them around and get to know them, personally, so that we can develope longer lasting business relationship with them. (At the point that they visit our shop we pretty much know everything we need to know about their machine.)</p>
<p>It's actually how I forced myself to talk to girls that I was way too shy to talk to before. I'd treat them like a customer and get to know them. </p></div>		</li>
