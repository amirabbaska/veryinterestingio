			<div class="markdown"><p>oh okay, that makes a lot of sense thank you very much! how are ratings measured? just purely how many people are watching or is it a ratio or some measurement divided by another (like # of viewers/a certain area or time or something like that)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nielsen has these devices (I can't remember what they're called) that hook up to your TV. This device will record what show you're watching and when you're watching it. So whenever you go to watch TV you'll have to signify which person(s) are watching. That's how they get age/sex demographics. </p>
<p>They have two different ways to measure: ratings and shares. Ratings are the percent of people watching a program out of every person who owns a TV. Shares are the percent of people who are watching a certain program out of only the TVs that are on. (Hopefully that makes sense, haha).</p>
<p>Nielsen takes a cross-section of families in the United States to select their samples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does one get a Nielsen box? I've never known anyone with one nor have I ever heard of where to get one. If it's the only way these networks can find out who is watching what, how come I've never seen one?</p>
<p>I grew up in a middle class household near a large city in the US so I'm not in the middle of nowhere. I feel like if an industry like TV relies so heavily on this device I should have probably encountered it at least once in my life. But nope.</p>
<p>No wonder Netflix is doing so well, they know exactly how many people have watched what program how many times. It's like everyone has their own Nielsen box with Netflix. How is it possible that the only measuring options are 1:10,000 or 1:1?</p></div>		</li>
