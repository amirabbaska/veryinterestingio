			<div class="markdown"><p>but for real, this is the answer. Ice cream is mixed as it's frozen; air etc. keeps the crystals small, as well. when it thaws, some of the air is lost; and if it is refrozen without mixing the crystals are allowed to grow as large as they want; think juice popsicle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, but pressurized air is also actively injected into the mix as it is being agitated. The amount of air mixed in is called overrun and can be adjusted. The best part is that the creamier more expensive one that everybody loves just has more air in it.  That's right we are selling you air.<br />
I work for the biggest ice cream company in the world, finally I have input lol</p></div>		</li>
