			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, thank you! At my old job we had 2 groups of people, one who hated the water at work cause it tasted funny and would grow bacteria in our bottles and everyone else who thought it was fine.  My bottle would always smell bad after I filled it up at work and I eventually stopped and only brought water from home and magically my bottle never smelled.  </p>
<p>I 100% guarantee those water machines were never cleaned and that's why bacteria would always grow if I filled up at work.  I always assumed it was the filter or something on our side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious what the danger to the bacteria is: short-term, long-term or both.</p>
<p>I ask because I'm a Peace Corps Volunteer in rural Ghana. I've been refilling plastic water bottles with water from my filter so that I can put them in my mini fridge to be cooled. If I take the bottle out to drink I've learned that I need to keep the top open or the bottle will start to smell funky very quickly. And I don't wash them hardly ever. I try and rotate bottles every month or two but I've definitely been drinking this funky smelling water for nearly 2 years. Also, the &quot;water sachets&quot; (plastic water bags) often sit out in the sun all day before being put in the cooler to sell and I've drank a few thousand of those.</p>
<p>So I'm curious if I should be happy to have avoided any major short term consequences of this lifestyle or if I've potentially done some long term damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I thought about that.  It isn't killing anybody, so it is making our immune system stronger I guess.  But it would just make your bottle smell nasty.  </p></div>		</li>
