			<div class="markdown"><p>There is two 'accidents' in naval research history in which researchers were detained to a bar for 24 hours with the requirement of drinking a pint per hour. This was purely to decrease the biological half life (make them pee) and reduce the dose they recieved. They had to pee in buckets and their clothes and chair were taken away
as rad waste. I have had this confirmed by several military and research personwl but never seen the proof.</p>
<p>I like to think there is a cask buried in idaho with a single pair of tighty whiteys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually sounds kind of horrible. The fear of the harmful material in my body, the boredom of having to sit in one spot for 24 hours, the continual alcohol intake, which would almost certainly enter the &quot;this is too much alcohol&quot; territory after a few hours... This doesn't sound like something a person would go through on purpose, when a day off and a little extra pocket change could get someone basically the same experience without any of the bad parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>24 pints of beer over 24 hours isn't  &quot;this is too much alcohol&quot; territory for most people. You'd have a buzz, then a headache, and a nastier headache the next day, but that's about it.</p>
<p>I think most people would struggle more with the sheer liquid volume (more than 12 litres) than the alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Per legend it was not on purpose. Both were walking with samples without properly closed containers and tripped slopping it all over their open  faces.</p>
<p>If your going to take alot of dose its the best way but that has more to do with how much it sucks to be decontaminated than 24 hours of beer intake and pissing in a corner being a good time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a wonderful thing to know. After googling credulously, it seems beer has been used to increase the water turnover after exposure to tritium in several other places, including Los Alamos!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have heard similar stories. People would get coupons for the local bar after exposure.</p>
<p>Pretty sure people still do it so that they can go back to work sooner (although tritium exposure happens way less these days)</p></div>		</li>
