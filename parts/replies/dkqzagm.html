			<div class="markdown"><p>Urologist here.  In general, the healthy bladder does in fact empty to completion.  To say that it &quot;keeps some&quot; is a mischaracterization.  Some residual is acceptable and of no consequence.  Incomplete emptying, or retention, can be problematic in some cases (but not always).   A volume for what constitutes retention has been the subject considerable debate however a recent white paper by the American Urological Association has defined this as 300 mL or more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooo I have a question! Is there any truth to the &quot;breaking the seal&quot; thing in regards to drinking? Also when you do start peeing and have to go over and over again after what seems like a very short time is your bladder full with more pee waiting to get in it when you go to the bathroom and then filling it up again quickly? Or is it more like the new pee is just made that fast when your drinking heavily?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is &quot;keeps some&quot; the same as the urine stream stopping and starting again with some force? Sometimes I seem to stand there and have 2 or 3 different full length pees per &quot;session&quot;, though this usually happens when I am slightly over-hydrated after the gym or in the morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add my issues to this, I was surprised how muscular the bladder is, and how it can contract.   As part of a kidney stone issue, they put a stent in my ureter, and commonly, this causes the bladder to contract, and quite a bit. Definitely enough to make you feel uncomfortable.   They provided several medications for the contractions, and had to keep up on those or felt miserable.     </p>
<p>Also had the ultrasound measurement when I had prostate problems, and the prostate can be another cause of not allowing you to completely empty your bladder.   </p>
<p>Neither issue is fun, BTW.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a stent in for kidney stones, it basically felt like I was going to pee my pants, every second, of every day, for two weeks until they took it out. I remember it as being pretty painful, but I was also working on passing like 6 stones, so I'm not sure if I could've pinpointed it as bladder contractions. I get pretty bad menstral cramps, but only occasionally can't get out of bed because of them. With kidney stones I start throwing up almost immediately, and pretty much have to go to an ER right away</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a uterus-bearing person and I once had a &quot;bladder spasm&quot; a few months after having a baby.</p>
<p>I'm told the trigon muscle at the bottom of the bladder has nerves that register one sensation: having to pee. So the spasm felt like a series of weird electric shocks in quick succession which hurt but also felt like needing to pee. Never felt anything like it before or since. Quite bizarre!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be a good comparison, but I couldn't tell you as I'm limited in that feature.    But somewhat like the lower intestinal cramps after eating the 'blazing hot heifer' wings, without the afterburner effect.</p></div>		</li>
