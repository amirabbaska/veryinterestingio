<p>I get pretty anxious, so I basically always occupy myself with something, even or especially if I am trying to relax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Showers tend to be the only time of day when I'm not actively trying to keep busy, and as a result, are often my most relaxing moments filled with the most clarity. </p>
<p>Definitely a sign I keep myself busy too much. I feel like this is probably a common problem for a lot of people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are many different ways to practice meditation but the one that most people typify as classic meditation involves actively watching conscious thoughts as they bubble to the surface from subconsciousness, and it requires a high amount of effort. in fact, during bouts of this highly conscious aware attention it is possible to break out in a sweat. </p>
<p>However I definitely agree, the results tend to be a profound &quot;housecleaning&quot; for the mind/active thought process of the brain</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The meditation in which one practices silencing thoughts is known as tranquility meditation. Another form of meditation, and considered more important for enlightenment than tranquility meditation, is insight meditation. With this meditation the goal is to think about Buddhist teachings and to really internalize them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when I go outside and smoke cigarettes once or twice every two hours I think,  I zone out and stare at cars passing by. if someone else is outside I talk nothing about work and just nonsense topics. while zoning out ideas randomly come to light and I feel more refreshed with new perspective on the task at hand. my brain hurts if I don't and I'm dead after work if I don't.
