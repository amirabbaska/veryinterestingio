			<div class="markdown"><p>When I do this, everything sounds like I'm underwater. So then I hold my nose and close my mouth and try to inhale, then everything sounds normal again. Are my ears backwards? I have a lot of ear issues, so I wouldn't be surprised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a small passage in your sinuses that lets air in called the Eustachian tube. It allows air in behind your eardrums. </p>
<p>When this tube is filled with sticky mucus, and you blow pressure into it or suck it out, it turns into a sticky one way valve. If the pressure is too high or too low it will cause the issue. </p>
<p>Both negative and positive pressure in your inner ear will make you very dizzy and sick feeling, and just suck all around. But if it’s only a little bit too much or too little, it just makes your hearing worse. </p>
<p>When you hold your nose and inhale, it’s correcting a high pressure problem and relieving the pressure. </p>
<p>If you do this in the shower after spraying a bit of water up your nose to get it just a bit moist up there... it will soften some of the sticky mucus in the passage and help your ear regulate pressure more easily. It will also hurt and possibly cause an infection. </p>
<p>A safer alternative is to use a neti pot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you have a cold or flu? It's pretty common to have the middle ear fill with fluid, which takes about two weeks to clear up. It happened to me a few months ago and I lost about 60% of my hearing in that ear, but in exactly two weeks it was fine. For the few days leading up to that, it would come back for a few minutes to half an hour and then go back. <em>Super annoying!</em></p></div>		</li>
