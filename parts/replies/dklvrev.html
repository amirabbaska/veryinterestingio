			<div class="markdown"><p>To me they are the same thing. It doesn't matter how awesome your content is, when you present it poorly it comes across poorly. Also, I'm struggling to understand why you'd ask a question expecting and waiting for one specific answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not waiting for or expecting one specific answer, thanks. I'm merely trying to generate discussion. I worked for a PR company in Toronto for around 7 years, and we'd never let copy with typos, copy problems, etc out the door - which is why I'm so curious as to why it's allowed now. That's all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They may be the same to you, but market trends seem to indicate that they aren't held at an equivalent value for most consumers.</p>
<p>That said, there is a ratio that we're working with.  Traditionally content that was say 95% grammatically correct was standard.  As more people generate content we've seen it slip to something like 80% grammatically correct with no loss in value and reduced effort to produce.  I don't believe that the same can be said of content that is 20% grammatically correct as the meaning of the content is harder to convey.  This leads to a less valuable product to the consumer since they can't understand it as easily.</p>
<p>For example, lets say you are running a blog that blogs about different types of plastics.  Your main source of income on the blog is ad views.  You write a post and every post will gross you $100.  You decide to hire a copy editor for $25 a post.  After a while you look at your profits.  Now your gross per post is $110.  Your net used to be $100 since you did it all yourself, now your net profit is $85.  As a business, why would you continue to spend money that decreases your profits?  You have increased the time it takes to deliver the product and you are making less money per post.<br />
(This is all assuming that you are spending the same amount of time on creating each post.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be amazed how many people care about well-edited material. When you notice it, and many readers do, it takes you right out of the story. I got the last book gig that I did because I purchased the book as an interested reader and was appalled at the wretched editing, or lack thereof, enough to complain to the publisher. They asked me to do the second edition!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My 9-5 gig is corporate. We get occasional complaints, usually meritless, about &quot;broken&quot; grammar rules in our copy (though to be fair, they without exception come from bored South Florida retirees). </p>
<p>Again, know your audience. Marketing materials that are customer-facing had better be top-notch, because it'll reflect poorly on the business and product if they aren't. But as we've seen with Internet-based news, even big names like CNN, we'll tolerate errors in news copy. </p>
<p>Most of the news copy you see online is taken from audio transcripts, so that's how the errors are generally introduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the correct answer.</p>
<p>Question: are you willing to pay more (or pay at all) for gramatically correct content?</p>
<p>Let me answer that for you: the answer for 99.99% of the people is &quot;no&quot;. This means adding somebody into the cycle to check for errors adds cost without a corresponding revenue, creating a negative business case. Since these companies are for-profit and this would go against that, they don't do it, simple as that.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind there <em>are</em> some areas like high quality newspapers where people do still expect this and will actually pay for it, so it does happen there. But for free content? Nah.</p></div>		</li>
