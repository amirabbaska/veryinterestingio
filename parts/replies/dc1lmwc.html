			<div class="markdown"><p>For reference, 900,000 km is further than going to the moon and back. They're pretty far spread apart! You could fly through the L4 zone without ever seeing a close trojan asteroid, let alone hitting one. Super-dense asteroid fields only exist in galaxies far, far away.</p>
<p>I double checked your math (converting au to km first) and got a slightly higher value of <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(4%2F3\)pi*r%5E3%3D4.687%C3%9710%5E18" target="_blank">1060000 kms</a> between trojans on average. </p>
<p>Edit: Depending on how large or small we want to consider the L4 and L5 zones, that number could still be higher or lower. For example a torus would probably be better model here than a cylinder, but both shapes only approximate the actual shape of the swarms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many thanks. Not to push it, but I wonder, per the question posed below by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/theqmann" target="_blank">/u/theqmann</a>, if there's a way to estimate the average distance between any asteroids large enough to totally destroy Lucy, say a billiard ball sized object, while it's puttering around L4. I wonder if  the size and quantity of asteroids obeys something like a power law  function, maybe a Pareto distribution. </p></div>		</li>
