			<div class="markdown"><p>I think all he did was say that there's a different linear time line that is imaginary, rather than the timeline we already accept.</p>
<p>But as someone previously unfamiliar with the concept, I have no idea why or how anyone would do this, so I'm no better off than before the question was asked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's literally what it is, instead of 5 seconds you have 5i seconds.  In physics, you regularly deal with imaginary quantities, like electric fields, but it you obviously can't have that in the real world, so you usually see the magnitude of it in actual applications.  Imaginary doesn't mean it's not real, it's just......complicated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, so that's why, when algebra classes inevitably lead you to discovering imaginary numbers, they just tell you not to worry about what they are. <em>&quot;It's just 5i.&quot;</em> It's not an advanced physics class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still not real. It is <em>necessary</em> to represent substeps in mathematical calculations, but will never show up in the actual result (if it does, you either did your math wrong, or made a very horrible assumption [such as faster than c]). At no point will Current, Voltage, Resistance, Inductance, or Capacitance every have an imaginary value anywhere in the circuit, but you need complex numbers to do the math.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Fokker-Planck equation in Stat Mech (for the evolution of probability distributions in continuous space and continuous time) is basically identical to the Schrödinger Equation (for the evolution of a wavefunction in continuous space and continuous time) except with the coefficients of the time derivative term being different by a factor of i (and some hbars and 2πs). That's the main connection between stat mech and imaginary time from a physics perspective</p></div>		</li>
