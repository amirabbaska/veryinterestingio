			<div class="markdown"><p>Vitamins are found in fat cells. However, morbidly obese people often have hormonal, vitamin, and mineral imbalances which are offset a bit by consuming a lot of food. The obesity is (in this case) the cause of the issue but, at the same time, they cannot be completely cut off from sustenance without their bodies going into shock. </p>
<p>Edit: People are confused about &quot;shock&quot;. I meant shock as in their body is undergoing strain from other medical conditions which may lead to an untimely death before the starvation hits. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this interesting. If an obese person has started &quot;dieting&quot; (aka eating right) would their vitamins, etc be more balanced or do fat cells store these things based on when/what they were created from? If that makes sense..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further this, there was a study a number of years ago (I'll try to find time later to find it and link), that studied fat prone rats on starvation diets. What they found is the rats would still be fat at the time of death. </p>
<p>They did consume some stored fat stores, but their bodies worked hard to keep that fat stored and made it functionally unusable. This could have been a death due to comorbid factors as you listed, but iirc the authors postulated that they died due to lack of energy metabolism. Indicating powerful mechanisms that are not related to popular culture's simple energy in and energy out simplification of fat metabolism.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'll go looking for that paper after I get several more Pomodoro's in and have stacked up a break large enough to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP, if you want to, you can look into this question very well with experiences of people in the concentration camps in WW2. Sadly, this experiment has been repeated millions of times. Anecdotally, what I have read is that the skinny people tended to live longer, but I can't offer an explanation as to why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been medically documented cases of people who decided to just not eat for a year to lose weight.  We're talking about people who are grossly obese (500 lbs+) here, not the guy who's carrying around 20 lbs or so they want to lose.  It's definitely not healthy but given the correct vitamin supplements, it's been done before and people survived. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are studies (can't find or name them at the moment) that demonstrated that a severely reduced calorie diet slowed down ageing.  If you get all the vitamins/minerals from tablet supplements, that is.<br />
It was first spotted when a group tried living in a 'bio-dome' for a year.  They soon found out they couldn't grow enough food for themselves, so the medical team gave them essential vitamins and they persevered with it.  Tests on the very thin subjects showed cell ageing was very much slower and would add a few years to their lives if they continued with it </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a survivor theory that people who had a lifetime of practice going hungry did better. That makes sense to me, if your body is accustomed to periods of fasting, there would be less shock. </p></div>		</li>

<p>On the other hand, I guess he ate too much for many years in order to accumulate so many reserves. Hibernating animals would be proud.</p></div>		</li>
