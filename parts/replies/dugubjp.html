			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question... we you see the plant stem, it looks like they are planted individually, but how many rices are there per stem? Also, is rice a seed or does it just come from another part of the stem? Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, nice one. Short and simple video explaining the rice production process. I've made it to far too old in life to realise I didn't really know much about how rice was grown. I knew it was grown in water in paddy fields but until now never knew it grew to a meter tall and was like wheat with many grains to each plant. Just proves you can learn something from Reddit :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My family owns a Rice farm in Arkansas about 750 acres are in rice and 350 in cotton.</p>
<p>it varies year on year but, Yield is about 88 bushels of rice per acre in AR. </p>
<p>45 pounds of rice in a bushel. (3960 Lbs per acre)</p>
<p>44560 sq feet in an acre = .088689 Lbs of rice per square foot</p>
<p>.088689 x 16oz = 1.42oz per square foot.</p>
<p>A serving of rice is about 1/2 cup (3 oz dry)</p>
<p>so if you are looking at a field in the area a man can stand he is standing on one serving of rice... for one meal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also, its more or less a finished product after harvest. compare that to something like wheat, which takes far more processing to get into an edible state. </p>
<p>demand is also probably significantly higher (for food at least) since its the staple food in the most populous parts of the world </p></div>		</li>
