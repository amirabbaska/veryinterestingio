			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, my father worked on the F-117 program (U-2 and SR-71's as well) when he was working for Skunkworks. </p>
<p>He used to disappear for months at a time and couldn't tell us where he was going, or sometimes when he'd be back.</p>
<p>He later got pulled into Lockheed's aerospace division, and eventually was building payloads for the NRO (I remember him telling me after the NRO was declassified, he explained what they did and his role at a high level). Fun fact, I got to help design one of the NRO mission patches and didn't even know it. Apparently one of the gag's the crew liked to play was to rope their children into helping design some of the mission patches.</p>
<p>It was frustrating for him because you could tell he enjoyed what he did, but he just couldn't talk about it. I learned to stop asking about his job when he came home.</p>
<p>When he was tasked with unclassified projects that he could discuss, it was a lot of fun (Hubble, the Space Shuttle and ISS). I still have his engineer's handbook on the SSME's from his time at Rocketdyne. He'd show me all the drawings from the Space Shuttle and explain how it worked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah, nope. I don't remember exactly which one I did (I was like, 8 at the time).</p>
<p>Its funny whenever I run into the occasional discussion about the mission patches and there's a bunch of conspiracy theories around them because of their content. People think there's some sinister meaning in them. Nope, just a bunch of kids being crowd sourced for their design because their fathers were pranksters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, when you get briefed on security and the need for secrecy, one of the points they hit on is that you yourself may not be a big shot or running the program, but information you give an enemy could be the piece of the puzzle they need to confirm something else. So maybe you're a driver, and they ask where you drove and when. You have nothing to do with a particular program, but if you drove a VIP to a particular location on a particular day, that confirms something else they want to know. </p>
<p>But also, if the culture is &quot;no one says anything, ever&quot; a potential enemy may not waste their time trying to get information. If no one who works on a site reveals anything, even to their spouses, even when it's been declassified, it's probably not worth the effort to hang out in some bar or something looking for a source. </p>
<p>And of course, you encourage your fellow secret keepers to not reveal anything, because they know you're taking it seriously. And lastly, if there is a leak you can more easily figure out where it came from.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just recently, my wife's job took us overseas for 3 years, and we were able to get AFN television service. It was surprising how many of the PSA's they aired talked about OPSEC, and how any single piece of information might be the key that enables an enemy to stage an attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an &quot;Established Civil Servant&quot; in my country in a position that would yield no important information to anybody I can possibly think of. I still had to sign the Official Secrets Act which seems crazy when my job is in a technical field of education but every Civil Servant has to sign up to this act. I'm in the top secret area of works known as &quot;Plumbing&quot;. </p>
<p>If I were to contravene this Act then I can be fined or imprisoned for up to two years.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of that could break this act is by leaking information about certain political decisions that affect my department at work and leaking information to the press before the end of the press release embargo time or something.</p>
<p>I don't want to lose my job and get into trouble so I can imagine for people working on actual matters of national security, fear of prosecution and more likely patriotism plus professionalism would keep most people from leaking secrets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen anyone mention &quot;compartmentalization&quot;.  The practice of keeping the various moving parts of a secret project segregated from each other and people not having an understanding of what part of what program they are working on and how it fits in with anything else.  So you might be working on some computer program that helps assist a guided missile, but you never see the missile or even know you're helping to design a missile.  And you only get to see what you need to know about your part of the project.  You can spill the beans to a foreign power, but you don't really know anything so they don't even want your information.  </p></div>		</li>
