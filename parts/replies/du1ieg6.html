			<div class="markdown"><p>Roofs will accumulate dirt/dust/salt from regular wind so the snow isn't 100% pure once it lands on the roof. Falling snow has likely no salt at all based on how it's made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Snow by it's nature is dirty; if enough snow melts in-between snowstorms, it has a coating of black dirt on the top - it's all the particulate that the individual snowflakes formed around, and was left behind when they melted.  Even without the nature of roofs and gutters being dirty, anywhere that has a good amount of snow will certainly have these issues unless they are going up on their roof to shovel the snowfall off.  </p></div>		</li>
