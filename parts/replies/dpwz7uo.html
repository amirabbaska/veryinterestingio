			<div class="markdown"><p>To speak specifically to the EtOH point, ethanol distributes evenly throughout all tissues by diffusion. Concentration is a bit higher in the kidneys. It would very easily diffuse into the fetus / embryo. If the blood alcohol level is 0.08%, then the concentration in the fetus is 0.08%. </p>
<p>There is no known safe level for ethanol and experts recommend NO alcohol during pregnancy. If you drink enough to feel it, then it is damaging. If you drink less and don’t feel it, then you just risked your child’s health for no reason at all. Having a child means sacrifice and stopping alcohol for 9 months + 6-12 months during breast feeding is a relatively small one compared to the other sacrifices you will make. </p>
<p>EDIT: ethanol is more concentrated in breast milk and it has been shown even single drinks cause behavioral changes in babies like reduced feeding and lethargy. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, not drinking during pregnancy makes sense, just like you said - if BAC is 0.08%, then the fetus' BAC is also 0.08%.</p>
<p>But your reasoning does not hold up during breastfeeding. Let's say a nursing mother drinks some wine, at 10.00% ABV, and ends up with a BAC of 0.09%. That means her milk has a 0.09% ABV. <a href="http://evolutionaryparenting.com/guest-post-breastfeeding-and-alcohol-consumption/" target="_blank">That's the same alcohol content as <em>orange juice</em></a>! Are you going to tell parents that they're child abusers for giving their toddlers <em>orange juice</em>? Of course not! That would be insane, because with so little alcohol, the effects are completely negligible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The frame of reference for this question is different; you have to look at it from the persepective of the infant. Ethanol has no utility to the infant, it is just another noxious substance to be avoided. An infant liver likely does not process alcohol the same way (no I don't have a reference but infant livers do not process other compounds the same way as adults so let us extrapolate to consider that it may not handle alcohol the same way) and an infant brain is still developing. Therefore, if you want to maximize the health of the infant, you do not risk any controllable amount of noxious substance exposure as there is some risk and arguably a larger risk to the infant in terms of productive life than to an adult. Hence, do not drink and breast feed if you are doing your job as a parent and maximizing their best possible outcome. This is the frame of reference used to determine whether alcohol consumption while breastfeeding is appropriate for the infant.</p>
<p>Edit: and no, you are not going to tell parents they are child abusers for drinking and breastfeeding, you are going to tell them that if they want less problems raising their kids, they should limit or time their drinking while breastfeeding or give formula if that is not possible to limit the baby's alcohol intake as much as possible. Unless they have an irrational hate of the child, most people can be motivated if they believe they are doing something good for someone else, especially a baby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At all stages, egg to infant, the fetus is in contact with the woman's body (no air gap) and would have some alcohol exposure. I do not have a rate of diffusion for all the anatomical stages that the developing embyro then fetus goes through (Fallopian tube, uterus, implantation, placental attachment) but since alcohol is a small molecule that crosses membranes easily, the developing embryo is likely exposed to alcohol in the woman's body at all stages and possibly similar levels of exposure. Susceptibility to alcohol effects on development are highest earliest in development so the important time may even be before implantation.</p></div>		</li>
