			<div class="markdown"><p>But at any given point on the circle there's a unique &quot;forward&quot; direction, so I don't think that's it. Perhaps it's to distinguish the front of the spacecraft from the direction it's traveling?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mmmm.....maybe my brain is very not smart, but this didn't clarify it for me, at least not completely.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the scenario you described, the car is moving 'sideways' towards the moon, while I am belted in and oriented towards the front of the car?  So you identify 'forward' as the direction toward the 'front' of the vehicle, and 'ramward' as the direction of motion?</p>

<p>I could be wrong but isnt this a little misleading? As far as I know the ISS doesn't need to re-boost because of debris, it needs to re-boost because the air pressure is non-negligible at that altitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once saw a video where of the ISS crew mentioned that the reason needed to re-boost occasionally was because there is a tiny amount of atmosphere at that altitude. And it causes a small amount of drag. Thus slowing down the ISS and causing it to drop in altitude, a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is it. They can also orientate their solar panels and radiators if needed to produce a tiny amount of lift as well at their altitude, but they still require a reboost every once in a while.</p></div>		</li>
