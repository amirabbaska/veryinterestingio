			<div class="markdown"><p>I would bet against that, actually. Picture the differences between cursive and printing. There's similarity, but especially between the capital letters, there are sizeable differences that require memorizing different shapes in parallel. That's why cursive is something people learn with effort. I think aliens would notice differences in handwriting just as much as they would notice differences in our clothes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but &quot;more&quot; does not mean &quot;completely&quot;. It's on a scale from &quot;so familiar that I notice changes in the tiniest details&quot; to &quot;completely unfamiliar and therefore unaware of changes&quot;. The back of your hand is at the former end of the scale, and alien clothing might be near the latter end. But if it's recognizable as clothing, you can probably discern a few general features that vary from case to case, as you might with different models of their alien vehicles and different fonts of their alien handwriting. I mean, I can easily see different fonts of foreign languages. What would be so different about our handwriting to aliens?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the style. When I was a kid I was taught a certain &quot;correct&quot; style and told that the style using more similar capital letters was a less formal, &quot;incorrect&quot; style. I think we've naturally shifted toward the latter though, because it makes more sense. If the point of cursive is to maintain clean handwriting while being able to write fast because you needn't pick up your pen, then there's no point in adding swirls and awkward penstrokes to our capitals.</p></div>		</li>
