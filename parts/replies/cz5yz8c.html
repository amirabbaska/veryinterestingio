<p>Another curious feature of the distant scattered disk is the lack of objects with perihelion distance in the range q = 50â€“70 AU. It is yet unclear if this property of the observational sample can be accounted for by invoking a distant eccentric perturber such as the one discussed herein. Indeed, answering these questions comprises an important avenue toward further characterization of our model.</p>
