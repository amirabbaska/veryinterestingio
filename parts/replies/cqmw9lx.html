<p>Otherwise, they don't realy have any camouflage: changing colour is a way to communicate, not to hide themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But regardless of whether this is for camouflage or communication, this doesn't answer the question of whether changing colour is energy consuming for chameleons. Is it also muscles that control their colour? And if not, how much energy is spent on changing it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wikipedia says they change color for social signaling, reactions to temp changes and other environmental factors and also camouflage. Not linking it because I'm on my phone and  it'll only open on mobile for some reason. But yeah, camouflage is definitely one of the reasons according to the wiki. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually chameleon camouflage is awesome! There is a misconception that they use their camouflage to blend in with their environment, when really it's used to communicate with other chameleons.</p>
<p>Just as it is for many reptiles, it was thought that chameleons spread out melanin to modulate skin color, when in fact the actual process is much more interesting; indeed it is true that yellow and red pigments reside inside their skin which is known as pigment color.</p>
<p>The other contributer to the chameleons overall color is structural color, this is a cell that sits just below the pigment cell, and is filled with tiny 130nm crystals regularly arranged in a lattice. The chameleons can manipulate the spacing of the crystal lattice to change what wavelength of light will be reflected off of them. </p>
<p>Let's say the crystals are tightly packed together, which results in a reflection blue light - The photon enters the skin, passes through the yellow (or red) pigment cell, reflects off of the modular crystal lattice (in this case blue light) and back through the pigment cell, what results is that those two cells produced green light. They do this thousands of times over, across their entire body in synchronization. Of course the lattice could be spread more and more apart, effectively covering the span of visible light and even infra-red! This was recently discovered at the University of Geneva by physicists and biologists</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What color are octopus typically? I mean their natural, unaltered color.</p>
<p>When they change color is it easier to stay that color or easier to revert to their unaltered color? Meaning, is maintaining camouflage comparable to flexing a muscle continously, or is it more like doing a push up and BAM I'M POLKA DOT BLACK AND WHITE BITCHES?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the species. That's kind of an odd question haha but I can try to answer. Basically, cuttlefish, squid and octopus have cells on their skin that contain certain colours, and by &quot;opening&quot; or &quot;closing&quot; these cells, their overall colour appears different. Different species may have different colours or amounts of colours.</p>
<p>Imagine if your bicep was red when your arm was fully stretched outwards, and it turned blue when your hand tried to touch your shoulder. It's not that it takes a lot of energy, and your bicep isn't flexing hard, but it was still movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short Answer:
Yes, it takes energy. No, they don't get tired from it.</p>
<p>Long Answer:
The cells responsible for color change in cephalopods are called chromatophores.  These are cells which contain pigment.  When relaxed, if you look really closely you can still see the chromatophores with the naked eye (they look like tiny dark spots), and provide their &quot;natural&quot; color.  Typically their tissue or &quot;skin&quot; is white and the pigment within the chromatophores is reddish brown.</p>
<p>Each cell/chromatophore has its own muscles and nerves, which provide independent control of each chromatophore.  However, this limits how much direct control cephalopods have over their own color.  The nerves react to chemical signals and I have read articles suggesting that the nerves can to some extent can detect light, which allows them to match their environment so well, even if the surface isn't within the critters line of sight (e.g., a checker board on their underside).  Once the nerves are triggered the muscles contract, stretching and flattening the chromatophore, hence producing color change.  This is similar to a water balloon, when in its relaxed position it is thicker and prevents light from pass through, but the more you stretch it the thinner it gets and the more transparent it becomes.  What is even more cool is that the muscles are attached to all sides of the spherical cell, so not only can they &quot;pancake&quot; the cell the can make different shapes!</p>
<p>Like any muscle, the muscles attached to chromatophores have an antagonistic relationship.  When one contracts, its stretches the other in an opposing direction.  The tension from this relationship allows the muscle to reset, otherwise it would stay contacted.  Also, when relaxed the muscles well find some middle tension, but will tend to &quot;lean&quot; towards the stronger muscle.  Similar to your eyelids, where the muscle that opens you eyelids is slightly stronger, so when relaxed you eyes stay open.  Another component of cephalopod tissues and chromatophores is that they tend to be elastic, and provide energy free resistance to reset the muscles.</p>
<p>Of course activating any muscle requires energy.  However the amount of energy requires for this is negligible.  Especially when compared to the energy requires to move, reproduce or digest food.  Have you ever heard of someone getting tired from blinking or breathing or growing new skin cells?</p>
<p>What is really amazing is loads of marine organisms have chromatophores, like shrimp and fish.  These structures become really important in deeper parts of the ocean where less light reaches.  Some chromatophores can even emit light!</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that while they may appear similar, a chameleon's ability to change color is unrelated to cephalopods, and is really quite different.  This is referred to as convergent evolution.  This is also the term used to explain why cephalopods eyes are so complex and similar to ours, yet we share no recent ancestors.</p>
<p>In case you think this is a little long winded or I'm nuts, I would like to apologise.  I teach Invertebrate Zoology and I kind of when into lecture mode...but if you have any other questions about invertebrates I'd be happy to try and answer them...for science!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would probably be more akin to a semi-unconscious action like smiling than flexing skeletal muscle, though, ironically, cephalopods only have a vague central control over their own arms, which more or less function independently towards a central goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the kind of octopus, which usually depends on the environment it has evolved to live in.  For example, an octopus that lives mostly in sandy environments will probably be a sand color, and an octopus that lives mostly in dark rocky environments will probably be dark.  That said, they come in all colors.  Check out the Australian Blue-ringed Ocotpus</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a display at the Melbourne Aquarium here in Australia that features a cuttlefish. You can walk right up to him and stare right into his eyes. He put on quite a show for us, flickering his colours from black to white and then when we laughed he would swim in a figure 8 around his tank in a sort of satisfaction. I got a new appreciation of the level of intelligence of these creatures from what I sensed from that little guy.</p></div>		</li>
