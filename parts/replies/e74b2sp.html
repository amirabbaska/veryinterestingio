<blockquote>
<p>Generally most devices have only three sensors: an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a clock. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most devices, like your Fitbit, only have three &quot;senses&quot;. It can sense how fast it's going, how stable it is, and what time it is through its clock.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using these three devices you can measure 7 different values at a given time (XYZ acceleration, XYZ angular acceleration, and time). By gathering several data points you can then get a sense of movement and associate certain combinations of acceleration and time as types of movements (lets call these different features). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using these three &quot;senses&quot;, the device can sort of figure out seven different ways you might be trying to sleep. So how much you're moving, how fast you're moving, if you're sitting up, if you roll aroun in your sleep, or if you got up to go potty. And at what time and for how long.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By performing experiments in the lab with people you can fit these features (predictors) to an observed action. Now you have a model that takes in predictors and outputs an (estimated) action. Depending on the model you'll have a wide range of accuracy but overall it's pretty good. Another way to think about is linear regression (or y=mx+b) where x is a predictor and y is an action. Except we have hundreds of x's.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the Fitbit isn't the smartest little robot/computer. If the same sort of &quot;senses&quot; are used by smarter computers in a lab, the scientists/doctors/etc. can guess what you might do when you're trying to sleep. It takes these guesses, or predictions, and takes notes about what you're actually doing. And again, at what time and for how long. Depending how smart the robot/computer is, it can be more accurate and able to better tell the difference between rolling around in your sleep, or getting up to go potty. </p>
<p>Kind of like figuring out where someone's office is. You can count up the floors in a skyscraper to predict where their office is. And count the windows to see who has their lights on or if they have any plants in the window. When you're able to count how many floors up they are, the robot/computer can more easily figure out which office it's looking for.</p>
<p>So with the sleep tracking robots/computers, if they know what to look for, they're better able to tell you how you slept.</p>
<p>Probably not the <em>most</em> accurate. So if I'm completely wrong, I don't mind some nudges in the correct direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2nd blue line question /quote and answer</p>
<p>If scientist can use smart technology to decipher a sleep &quot;schedule&quot; of a person, then why are sleep studies still done with the EKG sticky things attached to ones head?  I would think that the latter would be more accurate. How did the smart technology becomee more advanced than a device attached to ones head to monitor brain waves?</p>
<p>Off topic, I know, but you seem really knowledgeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I loved tracking my sleep with a Fitbit but now I use an Apple Watch daily and often have it charging when I sleep. Are these iPhone apps that’s claim to be able to possibly record sleep accurate? I say passive, because I liked how the Fitbit would just know and I didn’t have to explicitly say “I’m going to sleep now.”</p></div>		</li>
