			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there's really not much more to say about it, lol. To reiterate the answer to the main question, you'll get some neutron capture, so some extra deuterium and tritium, as well as maybe some activated corrosion products/tiny bit of fission products, but on the whole it's pretty okay water. In some cases, it's reprocessed and used as &quot;controlled pure water,&quot; which is really only notable for its elevated tritium content, but it's still low enough that you can spill up to 50 gallons before it's a problem. This is typically used as make-up water for certain reactor systems, when normal sources are unavailable. PWR experience here, btw, so not too far off from BWR. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BWR water has very low tritium inventory compared to PWRs. A lot of my condensate is low enough that it doesnâ€™t screen as contaminated using a frisker. Gotta get something very sensitive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True enough, less density for the flux to activate. I currently work with tritium a little more directly, and it's weird stuff, man. Next to harmless until you get T2O, then it's super nasty, and there's nothing you really can do even if something gets tritium on it, because it migrates like a sunuvabitch. Anything that swipes dirty is going to swipe clean next time.</p></div>		</li>
