			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the only answers that actually addresses storage and not transistors in a processing unit! Seems like getting to a concrete number of the actual limit is tough given a lot of weird quantum mechanics stuff. Thanks for letting me know more about the creation of storage units. Fingers crossed robots donâ€™t take over any time soon!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also an effect called quantum tunneling in which electrons randomly dissapear and appear elsewhere nearby by no apparent reason. If we tried to imprint data in one atom thick sheets this is a problem we may in fact face because we still dont understand quantum physics that well.</p>
<p>There are also more short term limits as for the materials of chips as the smaller they get the harder it is to manipulate them. We are making headway in the manipulation of silicone chips and in a few years is suspected to surpass our current technology which is expected to fall off in the coming years.(this is why some have hypothesized that in 3-4 years there will be a stall in computing speeds and storage sizes until the new tech catches up)</p>
<p>But yeah the original comment is right
Quantum computing will be the way to go in the future</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. For those who don't understand why it would be an issue: Imagine a grid of atoms. If a grid node has an electron attached to it, it's read as a 1. If there's no electron attached to it, it's read as a 0. This would ideally work... Except that quantum tunneling means things can randomly switch from 1's to 0's, or 0's to 1's. This throws the entire system into question, because now there's no way (as far as we know) to make a <em>reliable</em> grid of atom transistors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We understand quantum theory quite well. It's quantum engineering that is tricky, because it's hard to control where all the little pieces are at the atomic scale. You're likely to get defects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not one to pick fights and i agree that the problem relates to quantum engineering but to say we understand quantum theory is a bit of a stretch as we still cannot predict outcomes of atomic interactions with the same certainty as say a car collision. We arrived to the stage of 'this phenomena occurs' but not to the level as to explain and predict said phenomena</p></div>		</li>
