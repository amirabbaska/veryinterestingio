			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer, and I think more to the point of what OP was asking. Followup; can you give an ELI5 on chromatic aberration? I'm not sure what focal distance means in that context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When light passes a transparent medium (water, a prism) it gets bent. The degree of the bending is dependent of color (aka frequency) of the light. That is why you see a rainbow pattern once light leaves a prism and the same applies to rainbows in the air, where the water is the medium responsinble for the bending.</p>
<p>Chromatic aberration is that principle applied to lenses. On photos you might see an object several times slightly offset and in different colours. That is not an error of the sensor or film, but the lens, which can't bring all different colors of an object onto the same pixel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am very short-sighted and rarely wear my glasses - instead opting for contact lenses - because my lenses are so thick. I've noticed that with my glasses, when I look at objects at the edge of the lens' field of view  that there's a red or blue outline depending on the side I'm looking through. Is that an example of chromatic aberration? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why, as a side note, most lenses, at least from the film era, have a little red index just past infinity. It's where you adjust your focus to if you're using infrared film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What determines which way the different wavelengths bend? Why does the array end up nice and orderly, rather than all over the place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.oemcameras.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/figure_01.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> photo, one shows chromatic aberration 'in action'. Take a closer look at the edges: The light with different wavelengths, thus representing different colors, got bent in different angle, failing to produce coherent image.</p>
<p>This happens, because lens are just... well, circular prisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You blew my mind with your comment about jumping spiders having evolved a system for chromatic aberration correction.
I searched a bit and found this excellent reading on the vision of jumping spiders:

Hope you will find it as interesting as I did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to that article it's much cooler than just correcting for chromatic aberration; they're actually exploiting it to pack more photo-receptors into a smaller space by layering their retinas! Very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's do the math! 10 objects per degree sounds very small - 0.1mm at a close focus - I might see it but not see any detail. Let's use the approachable reference that I can resolve objects to 0.5mm or 1/64&quot; on my machinists ruler, like the 0.5mm or 0.7mm ball on the tip of my ballpoint pen. </p>
<p>I think your 1000x factor was a little high - cats are maybe 400mm, spiders are 4mm, and spider eyes are proportionately larger than cat eyes. Using a 2000mm human instead,and assuming a spider's eyes are 5 times larger in proportion to human eyes, we get a ratio of 1:100. </p>
<p>Objects the size of a ballpoint pen tip to us would compare to objects  0.005mm or 5 um to a spider. Here is a list of some objects that size:</p>

<p>Interestingly, that includes an E. Coli bacterium - pretty microscopic, if you ask me - and the diameter of a strand of spider silk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey man. That link didn't work, but it's okay.. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre" target="_blank">here's one that does</a> </p>
<p>Eee: makes sense, because it says the width of a strand of spider silk is between 3 and 8 Î¼m</p></div>		</li>
