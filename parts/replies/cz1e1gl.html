<p>One of the coolest fringe benefits from this work was the discovery that mountains have deep, low-density &quot;roots&quot; that project beneath them into the underlying mantle.  They float like icebergs.  It was discovered because of the systematic effect the gravitational pull of the Himalayan Mountains had on the vertical line measured by a pendulum during the surveys.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty cool. It looks like it's based on multiple previous maps, though, rather than on triangulation itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that really blows my mind about triangulation isn't that the British were able to map just the position of Mt Everest (and all the other major mountains of the Himalaya) using triangulation, they were so exact they actually calculated the height of it by starting their triangulation at sea level. And they were only wrong by 33 feet!</p>

<p>&quot;One day, however, in 1852 at the Great Trigonometrical Survey office near Delhi, two surveyors—Radhanath Sikhdar and Michael Hennessy, burst into Sir Andrew Waugh’s office and Radhanath, with giddy excitement announced, “Sir, I have discovered the highest mountain in the world!” The news wasn’t released for another three years as the surveyors checked and rechecked the calculations. Radhanath’s initial calculation for what was called Peak XV was 29,002 feet, remarkably close to today’s GPS-calculated elevation of 29,035 feet (8,850 meters). Waugh also christened the mountain Mount Everest for George Everest, who himself thought it was inappropriate.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That 29,002 was actually calculated as exactly 29,000 feet. They thought people might think that was an approximation since it's such a nice round number, so they tacked on the two feet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even though it was on QI, I wonder if that really is true though. It would be a fun story to tell, even for those who did the calculation. I wouldn't be surprised if their oginal calculations did show 29,002; then one of them made up the story for a laugh. They certainly knew that, despite their accuracy in the calculations, their starting points and angles were sufficiently inexact that another measurement would yield a different height. They probably could have found a different height themselves, as they certainly do redundant measurements and take averages of the results.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've read that they initially calculated it to be exactly 29,000 feet, but they added the 2 feet so that people didn't assume they just rounded it to a nice value.</p></div>		</li>
