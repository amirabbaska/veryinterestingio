			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true, but also keep in mind Silicon(Si) which is very similar to carbon since it is just below carbon on the PT can also make 4 bonds that are strong. The advantage Carbon has is, bonds are not too strong and can be broken again and molecules can be reshaped and formed into something else which is a very important factor. Eating, digesting, basically making all sorts of changes in molecules. It is important to have a quite strong bond, but not too strong so that it can be reversed and changed later on. Silicon molecules containing oxygen or hydrogen next to silicon are a lot more chemically inert. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One major issue with using silicon chemistry for life is that the basic building block that plants use to make things, CO2, is a gas over a wide range of temperatures and pressures; the silicon analogue to that, SiO2, isn't a gas until very high temperatures (b.p. 3220K).</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to do chemistry with a gas (especially one that dissolves readily in your solvent system) than it is with a solid (and SiO2 is not particularly soluble).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isnt SiO2 quartz? I never thought about it but find it interesting that one of the most basic, cherished crystals there is is sort of an &quot;analogue&quot; to one of the most common and essential compounds for life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to point out there is a <em>massive</em> difference between silicone and silicon. Silicon is the element, which in solid form is very brittle and has a crystalline structure (the one you meant). Silicone on the other hand is a polymer (like plastic) and is the stretchy wobbly stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it would be detrimental for the &quot;accompanying chemistries&quot;. Lots of other compounds/radicals would be totally unstable. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen all play together very well. Move to silicon at higher temperature and it will play with the others reasonably well - but they won't play with each other well any more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question about silicon: it can normally not make long, stable chains, but I believe that siloxane (S-O polymers) can.  Could you make organic-type molecules that way?  Only every other atom could attach to things but that doesn't seem like it should finish it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silicon has the problem that silicon dioxide is solid at STP. Carbon dioxide is not. CO2 can also dissolve in a working medium (read: blood) but SiO2 cannot. That doesn't mean that silicon based life processes are impossible, but some things we take for granted that life do (respirating in this instance) become significantly more complex.</p></div>		</li>
