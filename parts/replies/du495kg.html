			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on what caused the stain (which would determine if the bleach increased the water solubility of the substance enough for it to dissolve much) and how you define dirty clothes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well depending on what you consider dirty, a 9:1 solution of water to bleach will clean &quot;most things&quot; (using this term very loosely). In a CBRNE investigation, once the samples/evidence is collected in bags, they are dunked in a bleach solution to neutralize or kill anything.</p>
<p>Source: lecture given by CBRNE investigator and<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3148627/" target="_blank"> this article</a> (regarding chemical neutralization at least)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best universal liquid decontamination agent for CWAs is 0.5% hypochlorite solution. It is prepared easily by diluting household bleach to one-tenth strength (i.e., nine parts water or saline to one part bleach). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really depends on what you mean by dirty. </p>
<p>When you have white cotton fabric and dye it green, is it dirty because of the green dye?</p>
<p>I'd think if the dye bled to other clothes, that's an easy &quot;yes&quot;, and if not, it's not dirty.</p>
<p>That turns into linguistics of &quot;dirty&quot; vs. &quot;dyed&quot;, vS. &quot;stained&quot; quickly.</p>
<p>Or rather, it's probably a very clean stain at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A tiny correction, but most conjugated systems just absorb light, allowing you to see that which is reflected. Only when the most common forms of energy release (rotation, vibration) are restricted do the molecules give off light (fluoresce). Most absorb/fluoresce in the ultraviolet range, which is why that mustard stain glows under black light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The long chain of conjugated bonds becomes like an antenna for visible light wavelengths. Imagine electrons being able to resonate back and forth across the length of the conjugated system. Typically, shorter conjugated systems = &quot;tuned&quot; for shorter wavelength absorption, and longer conjugated systems are tuned for longer wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bonds are arranged in a conjugated system.  On paper, the bonds will appear as alternating single and double carbon-carbon bonds.  In real life, the charge of the bonds is distributed equally among the conjugated carbons, giving each carbon-carbon bond a net charge of 1.5.  This distributed bond system can more easily absorb a photon because of the distributed nature of the bond, the extra charge is shared among multiple atoms.  When the photon is given off again, it is at a lower quanta of energy which gives the compound its unique color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In non-conjugated long-chain molecules, the electrons are confined to the space around each atom and thus have a fairly small cross-section. Conjugated systems are different because the electrons are distributed across the entire conjugated chain. Basically, this gives a larger &quot;electron cloud&quot; for light to interact with.  This is the same effect that gives graphene and other exotic conductive materials (e.g. the nanotubes that make up Vantablack) their unique optical properties. For example, a single-atom thick layer of graphene will absorb ~2-3% of visible light shone at it, which is pretty remarkable.</p></div>		</li>
