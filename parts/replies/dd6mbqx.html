<p>One, cloture to break a filibuster is 60 votes, not 2/3ds (67).</p>
<p>Second, obstruction of the Scalia vacancy isn't entirely unprecedented, as Sen. Henry Clay's Whigs orchestrated blocking a vacancy for <em>over two years</em> not for purely partisan advantage, but <em>personal</em> advantage as well as Clay was expected to win the White House.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I wasn't referring to the length but the context. There's never been a nomination that was held open like this one. (ie, before a new president was elected, a ban on all potential nominees by the president, etc).</p>
<p>There are some that are similar-ish, but none quite like it, and it's certainly not frequent</p>
<p>The time is not unprecedented, but certainly not normal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being unprecedented in the &quot;modern era&quot; is really not particularly significant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If i recall correctly, the volume of cases the court receives has been higher in modern years, so it's not meaningless. Not the end all be all, but it matters.</p>
<p>The best numbers i could find off hand were
&quot;In the 1950 Term, for example, the Court received only 1,195 new cases, and even as recently as the 1975 Term it received only 3,940. &quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a gamble that paid off for which the Republicans in the Senate will pay ZERO political price.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one is really arguing this point. Yes, it was a gamble, and yes it paid off. But it wasn't &quot;normal&quot; by any stretch of the imagination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol, sure not unprecedented as long as you go back to the 19th century.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all, of the 59 vacancies that occurred in the 20th and 21st centuries, only four persisted longer than 200 days. Six were between 150 and 200 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, the only vacancy longer after the 19th century, had multiple nominees considered and receiving votes before one was confirmed.  The current situation is unprecedented in the modern era.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being unprecedented in the &quot;modern era&quot; is really not particularly significant. It's happened before and it's happened for political reasons. It will almost certainly happen again. It was a gamble that paid off for which the Republicans in the Senate will pay ZERO political price. Had they approved Merrick Garland, their base, the people that put them in their office, would have dragged them out of Congress and burned them right on the Mall.</p></div>		</li>
