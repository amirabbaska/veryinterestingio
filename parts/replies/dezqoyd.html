			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: While this is 100% correct, I should add that synchrotron radiation is only produced at the bending magnets that keep the beam in the ring (and possibly at other insertion devices used to focus the beam), since sychrotron radiation is only formed when the beam is deflected. There will be no light comming from the sections in which the beam is going in a straight line.</p></div>		</li>
