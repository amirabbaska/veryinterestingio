<p>So true. When being on low carb or low fat diets I always got to the point where the &quot;demand&quot; on forbidden foods was higher than the motivation to keep going. Mostly after 3 months. Like 9 weeks ago I decided to just have a calorie deficit without any other restrictions. Every two weeks I even eat a 500ml Ben &amp; Jerrys ice cream. And now I am so close having a 6pack, where I was never before in my entire life (overweight from youth to about 24, now 30(M)). I don't like the feeling after a cheat day (feeling so full Blabla), so I just have a cheat meal here and there and I am totally ok with that. So looking forward crossing that 3 month diet-barrier.</p>
<p>+1 for just calorie deficit </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found that simple calorie deficit almost forces me to eat healthier, and you learn how to do that better over time. Classic example I tell people: I can eat 1 (just one) big frosted donut for breakfast on my &quot;diet&quot; and feel hungry 30 minutes later with a sugar crash. I could do that if I wanted. OR ... I could eat some eggs, an apple and some whole wheat bread toast with butter. That will keep me satisfied and my energy levels constant until lunch.</p>
<p>There's no gimmick. I don't even really work out or go to the gym and I lost 40 pounds over the course of a couple years that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this 1,000%!!! Spend a few days blowing most of your calorie budget on a single calorie-dense meal, and you'll find yourself running towards healthier foods with glee, just to feel &quot;full&quot; again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>99% losing weight is calories.  There was a nutritionist who did a study and ate out of a convenience store candy isle, nothing but twinkies and honey buns and stuff like that for 6 months and lost like 30lbs.  </p>
<p>If your body burns more calories than you take in, your body will convert fat or muscle to cover it, and you will lose weight.  </p>
<p>Now where that other 1% comes in, is over the long term, you need to make sure your getting the right vitamins, and &quot;macros&quot; which are the ratios of things like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.  The macros combined with weight training are what keep your body burning mostly fat instead of muscle.  </p>
<p>Of course, that guy would lose weight over 6 months eating nothing but twinkies,  but eventually he would get sick from being malnurished, so a gas station diet isnt recommended.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, but isn't calorie-counting even better in that case? Theoretically i can eat anything. Doesn't that mean more meal diversity in theory? Only thing that stops you is yourself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Amen, brother! No seriously, that's something I learned the hard way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if it helps...</p>
<p>one thing to remember about discussing dieting... generalizations are demoralizing and disrespectful.  you don't know what someone else's health goals are, why they're choosing to lose weight, why they've chosen that particular method, what other medical issues they're struggling with, or how long they've been at it.  a sweeping statement of &quot;it's all about the calories&quot; makes me see red immediately because in reality, the human body doesn't run on algebra.  it runs on chemistry, which is a much more complex and complicated process than just &quot;eat X &lt; burn Y = lose weight.&quot;</p>
<p>regardless of the messages from the diet industry, who is just trying to peddle the latest silver bullet, weight loss is not easy and presenting it as such is cruel.</p></div>		</li>
