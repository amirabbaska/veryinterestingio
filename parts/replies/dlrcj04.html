<p>I think a simple fan would do the trick. If I remember correctly, wind stressing the trees causes the tree to grow reaction wood, which is more rigid, thus helping support the tree. I'd compare it to us lifting weights to build muscle. Any thing that causes the wood to bend slightly would induce small tears in the fibers, and the trees  repair the minor damage with the more rigid reaction wood.</p></div>		</li>
