			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I brought a book to a publisher would I have to show sources to back up each claim? Or can a trusted historian with decades of being so write a book, bring it to a publisher and not be questioned on anything?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the field, the nature of the work, and the publication. </p>
<p>Here's an example that might clarify:</p>
<p><em>PLoS Pathog.</em> is a pretty high impact journal. When you see an article in it you know that it was reviewed for <em>both</em> importance and rigor. This means the editors and reviewers not only determined the information to be trustworthy (i.e. reliable) but also important. Just by virtue of being in this journal, the article is presumed important by many in the field. That's not to say it won't later be criticized or even proven wrong. </p>
<p><em>PLoS One</em> is a sister journal. It is lower impact, though. Articles are only reviewed for methodology, not importance. Just by virtue of being in this journal, you may be more skeptical of the impact or importance of the work. </p>
<p>Going lower: Conference abstracts. These are, for the most part, not reviewed at all. These may be super important or absolute garbage. You have to use your own logic and intuition to judge these, and shouldn't presume much.</p>
<p>At the very top would be a journal like <em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em>. The acceptance criteria for these are extraordinary, and people give articles in them a lot of deference.  </p>
<p>(I know you originally asked about history, but it's the same concepts. There's authorities in every field.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously a publisher isn't going to want to be associated with a fraud. So certainly they are going to do some due diligence to make sure that your work is what you claim it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In academic publishing, the publisher reads and edits it, but also sends your manuscript to outside experts within the field for commentary, criticism, and recommendations. You need to provide well-heeled arguments, with sources, or those other experts and authors will tear it apart. Since publication of scholarly texts is a (shockingly) competitive field, those readers will not be pulling punches or letting you get away with crap. In places where they feel there are weaknesses, they may suggest sources to strengthen or modify your arguments, but the publisher isn't going to proceed without the ok from at least a couple of their readers.</p></div>		</li>
