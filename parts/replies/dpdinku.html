			<div class="markdown"><p>Isostasy is also what helps mountain ranges created by faulting and folding to maintain a somewhat average height; folding causes rock to be compressed and thrown both up and down, creating deep mountain &quot;roots&quot;. As the mountain erodes and the weathered material ends up elsewhere as sediment, the reduced weight on that section of the plate causes it to rebound up via isostatic adjustment. Eventually the root material too is eroded and you end up with Morris style peneplains, but we're talking erosion on the scale of millions of years with no subsequent folding or uplift activity.</p></div>		</li>
