			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive a semi truck, a lot of people here are also forgetting to mention one big thing:</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance!</strong></p>
<p>Trucks are maintained far better then cars.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By law commercial drivers of Semi trucks have to perform something called a Pre-Trip. Which involves a lot of checking on wear and tear, checking your fluids and filters. Big companies often require paper records of these checks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its a pre-requisite to be able to do a pre-trip in order to take your road test. The pre-trip has almost every single part of your truck on it. So most drivers know how to keep a truck running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big companies do start pushing off trucks after a few years because maintenance costs start going up.</p>
</li>
<li>Trucks are worth a lot of money, so engines often get repaired / rebuild without meters being reset. </li>
</ul>
<p>edit:
Here is a video with detailed explanation of a pre-trip inspection:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to consider the toll father time takes on cars whether or not they're driven. It will take 7 years for a truck driven 100k miles a year to reach 700k, it would take 35 for a car driven 20k a year. Those extra 28 years will take an enormous toll on a cars parts, with rust taking a toll. Considering parts for cars can be hard to find more than 10 years after the car is made and how much car safety and features have improved, part of the equation may simply be that most people will ditch their cars before they hit 700k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuuuuun fact time:  They are called &quot;semi trucks&quot; because it is a shortened version of &quot;semi-trailer truck.&quot;  A &quot;semi-trailer&quot; is actually just the trailer, but it is a trailer that only has wheels on one end...otherwise it would be a wagon.  So the thing you call a semi, is actually a tractor, but refers to a trailer.    </p>
<p>Truck = tractor.</p>
<p>Trailer = Wagon = wheels on both ends.</p>
<p>Semi-Trailer = wheels on one end.</p>
<p>Semi-Truck = tractor that pulls semi-trailers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your 3rd point is very true. One of our rigs has 375,000 miles on it. The motor has about 25,000 and the transmission has about 40,0000. The truck wad built in 1994 and has only ever pulled oversize heavy equipment  so it's not unheard of to get a power train replacement at around  300,000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if this is the best answer. My criticism of it is that we have two grain trucks on our family farm that are still running with over a million miles on them. These are big diesel trucks but they are not driven like long-haul trucks. The max distance they go is about 30 miles and this requires many turns on country roads. They also are constantly stopped and started and moved short distances to position them properly for filling them up and emptying them out.</p>
<p>This is a sample size of two (well, three actually since we have another truck at about 700,000 miles) but this observation seems to suggest that semis' longevity has much more to do with their design and construction than the manner by which they're driven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree and it plays out the same way with the cars of Europe - Frequent starts and city driving haven't taken a toll on them either, besides frequency of maintenance of things like brake pads. Also, forgetting maintenance is less of a sin for certain engine designs, indirect injection diesels are robust in this sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Our previous fleet (recently replaced) was comprised of Type I ambulances built on Freightliner trucks. They all average 13+ years with anywhere from 150,000 to 250,000 miles. With the amount of abuse they've taken in city traffic (stop &amp; go, sudden acceleration/deceleration, sharp turns, and accidents) they've required quite a bit of maintenance to keep operational but certainly lasted longer/better than passenger cars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only true of OTR trucking. Many semis are not run in this fashion, and they still far outlast cars. I've known semis that were limited to 55 MPH, and never saw the highway that lasted decades. </p></div>		</li>
