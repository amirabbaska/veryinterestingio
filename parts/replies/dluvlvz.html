			<div class="markdown"><p>If you could completely clamp the injury above the aortic rupture and immediately reroute  the blood volume pumped into the aorta (note complications due to ischemia of all the organs supplied by the aorta) without causing a severe high blood pressure related injury, you might restore consciousness. In almost all cases however, yes, brain infarction occurs within a few minutes.  </p>
<p>Please understand, there is an 87% mortality rate associated with this, and the outliers in that group are minimal aortic injuries (e.g. a nick in the aorta compared to a complete severing) typically they lose consciousness immediately and never recover consciousness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You ever do a  whip-it? one or two breaths and you pass out.</p>
<p>Its why nitrogen is such a dangerous industrial gas.  You can't smell it and you are pass out before you even realize anything is wrong.</p>
<p>2 breaths is closer to 15 seconds than 3 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strange.  I always thought what determined instant death or not was your paygrade.</p>
<p>If you are just a henchman or storm trooper, death is instant, every time.  There is no such thing as getting &quot;winged&quot;.</p>
<p>If you are the arch nemisis you can die 2 or 3 times before  you die for good.</p>
<p>If you are between you wont die instantly, but can take an awful lot of damage while still fighting.</p>
<p>If you are the hero instant death is impossible because otherwise it would be impossible to say your last dramatic words.</p>
<p>Unless all the movies are wrong...</p></div>		</li>
