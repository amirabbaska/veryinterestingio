			<div class="markdown"><p>Every damn time I log on, I'm frustrated by seeing the same small selection of my friends' posts displayed, as well as posts from the same handful of pages. And whatever algorithm is at play isn't working in my case, as it's not routinely friends or pages I would consider most relevant to me.</p>
<p>I would kill to have a nice, simple, chronological stream of friends and pages, in the order they made the posts. No, Facebook, the fact someone commented on this post from four days ago is not more important to me than this other friend announcing their pregnancy. Thanks for trying, now stop.</p>
<p>Also, I m not more inclined to exclusively read posts by right-wing friends, and I have no idea why you would think so. Again, stop, now. Simple. In order. All pages and friends.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That’s all I want, everyone in my list, chronologically.</p>
<p>Nothing more. Nothing less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Facebook has the option to switch to a most recent feed rather than a top stories feed ... but they try their damnedest to get you to not use it.</p>
<p>If you switch to 'most recent' the setting may cache for you for about a week then for no apparent reason it switches back and you find yourself browsing 'top stories' without having noticed. For the next day or so then every time you switch back to 'most recent' Facebook will 'forget' to cache your setting.</p>
<p>There are 2 workarounds:</p>
<p>One is a browser plugin called 'Social Fixer'. I never liked using this because I found it made the whole page look ugly. Also Chrome seems to hate half the plugins it lets you install so there's a good chance when there is another Chrome update it will disable 'Social Fixer' for you telling you there are security risks.</p>
<p>What ended up working for me was I bookmarked the url you get redirected to immediately after you switch  to 'most recent'. It's the same Facebook URL except with this as an extension: '?sk=h_chr'.</p>
<p>So the facebook URL you use now is:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/?sk=h_chr" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/?sk=h_chr</a></p>
<p>I have that url saved in my bookmarks bar, so now every time I click on it I am guaranteed to go to 'most recent' rather than 'top stories'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it’s my irritation too. I cannot find shit with FB because of the way it’s “tailored” to me. Sometimes I find something funny and only later find a relevant way to share it with a friend. That post is lost in the void by that time. My mom wanted me to share something she found while going through her feed and I basically had to tell her it’s lost if the thing she saw was more than a handful of minutes ago. </p>
<p>It would be so much easier for me to simply search through a chronological feed. I lost track of friends who do cool things but don’t necessarily post as often. It becomes a feedback loop of frustration if I comment on anything political for a while. I basically exploit FB to stave off frustration (so I guess that would be it working) rather than keep up with my friends. </p>
<p>I have plenty of conservative and liberal friends, friends I agree with and disagree with, friends I haven’t seen in ages but still love and friends I see often but aren’t as close. It’s frustrating to completely lose track of people because FB assumes it know how I want to keep with my friends more than I do. </p>
<p>Honestly, I would actually pay for a chronological feed. That’s just how I interface with the world in general. I despise advertisements because for all their “optimization” few of them are relevant to what I actually enjoy. just give me a feed where I can keep up with my friends the way I want, darn it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well with Google I tend to want what's most relevant, not what's most recent, and they do have the option to sort by time if that is what you require.</p></div>		</li>
