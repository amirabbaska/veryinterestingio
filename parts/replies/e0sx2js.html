			<div class="markdown"><p>With headphones, you need to use your device to control the volume.</p>
<p>When you're feeding a signal into another amplifier, you want your source signal to be as strong as possible (without distortion) while controlling the volume with the second amp.  This  keeps your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio" target="_blank">signal-to-noise ratio</a> high, giving you a better quality final output.  If your device is relatively quiet, the 2nd amplifier will <em>also</em> amplify all the electrical noise on the wire, giving you a noisier result at the same playback volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other two people answering you, while very intelligent, are wrong. It’s not that his phone is cranking it up to Max when he connected to his car stereo. It’s just that it’s remembering what it was last time it was connected to the car stereo. If he turns the volume down, then switches to headphones, and then switches back to car stereo, it will start at the lower level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Line level works on a principle called Unity Gain. What it means is that all devices in the chain output the same signal level as it has in it's inputs. This level is at &quot;100%&quot;, it is always as strong as possible; this is called line level.</p>
<p>You can think of the audio chain like climbing a mountain. We start from weak signal and need to amplify it by a factor of thousands by the time we are in the speaker level. The stronger the signal is when we start, the less we need to amplify it. If we attenuate, turn down that signal right away it is like digging a hole before we climb on to the mountain. </p>
<p>One part of the challenge is that while we climb up, we are picking up small rocks from the floor all along the way and the ones we picked up from ground level are magical rocks: they get larger the higher we go. The ones from the bottom are the largest once we reach the top. The ones we collect near the top are still mere pebbles compared to that mountain... At worst case scenario, the rocks we carry end up larger than the mountain itself; then we have more noise than signal..</p>
<p>This is why we keep line level at &quot;100%&quot; all the way until we have to climb that mountain. And we go there in just few steps, in one device; inside the main power amplifier. All the way there we want to stay on a flat, solid ground. This is why the volume level adjustment is best to do just before or even inside the power amplifier. At the last possible moment just to avoid amplifying also the noisefloor along with the signal. And the noise is worse the more we dig and the higher the mountain is: if we have very low level signal going thru the system and then expect it to go thru the roof, the noise floor will be audible and at some point overpower the signal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the way we use our system makes digital attenuation at the source VERY convenient. This is, however, ass backwards. We get away with it because our signal route is quite amazingly clean these days. You may have power amplifier set up to max and it barely lets out a hiss. In fact, this was one of those things one had to get used to; i'm sound engineer and it use to be very convenient way to do basic checks; &quot;is this stack of PA active?&quot; and you used to be able to detect that 10 meter away... Now you may accidentally lean over the speaker to try to hear that hiss and it is actually close to max.. then someone taps on the line and you are deaf.</p></div>		</li>
