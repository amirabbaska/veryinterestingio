			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add to that that we can partially infer they &quot;see&quot; the same. Their eyes receive the same type of light as ours, and a lot of the emotional properties of colours are cultural associations, so even if their personal &quot;image&quot; would be different, it would still be the same experience, basically.</p>
<p>An interesting side note is the fact, that what colours you can perceive depends on the language you grew up with. Colour is a continual spectrum, and research has shown that your brain forms different &quot;sections&quot; as a child based on the names you learn. Some languages have more or less colour names, and people raised with them can differentiate more or less colours visually. So you know some people <em>don't</em> see the same as you.</p></div>		</li>
