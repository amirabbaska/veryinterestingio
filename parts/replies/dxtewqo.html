			<div class="markdown"><p>This requires an understanding of the muscles that control eye movements. To simplify it, there are 6 muscles that move the eyeball and 3 nerves (per eye). The nerves are called CN III, IV, and VI. I’m gonna leave out IV for this discussion and just talk about III &amp; VI. </p>
<p>CN III control the muscles that move the eye towards the nose, as well as up and down (which we don’t care about for this discussion). It also has other functions but, again, not important for this discussion. CN VI then, as you may have guessed, moves the eye away from the nose, or toward the side of the head. Both nerves have things called nuclei within the brainstem, which is where they originate and where the “control” is. </p>
<p>If the nucleus of CN III of the right eye becomes more active, the muscles cause the right eye to turn towards the nose (towards the left). </p>
<p>If the nucleus of CN VI of the left eye becomes more active, the muscles cause the left eye to turn towards the temple (towards the left). </p>
<p>There is a pathway called the MLF that connects the right nucleus of CN III with the left nucleus of CN VI, and vice versa. This way, when one becomes active, so does the other. This way, when you want to look left, both eyes do. </p>
<p>There is also a pathway in the brain that activates the right and the left nuclei of CN III. This causes both eyes to look towards the nose.</p>
<p>To finally answer your question, there is simply no pathway in the brain that activates both the right and left nuclei of CN VI. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense, but I can move my left eye to the right while separately (?)  moving my right eye to the left. We all do that to cross our eyes. If we can move them in opposite directions like that, it seems like we're capable of moving them independently, so why not move them opposite directions outward?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think crossing our eyes doesn't require independent eye movement, because it's still cooperative. In a way, you're always crossing your eyes at least a little bit (at least while you're conscious I guess) because you're focusing them on some non-infinitely-distant point in front of you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because you can be focusing on something far off to one side, where your nose is in the way of one eye, then as it moves toward the center of your field of view, you'll move the one eye that can see the object on its own until your nose isn't in the way anymore. Then they'll continue to move in unison.</p>
<p>What OP said in their first sentence is exactly wrong. We <em>can't</em> move our eyes away from one another beyond center specifically because we don't <em>need</em> to do it. Or to put it better, it wasn't/wouldn't be advantageous enough for it to stick under the laws of evolution.</p></div>		</li>
