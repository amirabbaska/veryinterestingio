<p>To some extent that is correct, it doesn't explain it all. The human brain is much much better to learn these kind of concepts than the best computer vision techniques. </p>
<p>A baby can recognize a real animal after having seen a few images of <strong>cartoon versions</strong> of that animal, that is so many levels above what artificial intelligence is able to do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's worth noting that cartoons are very much a human thing - the distillation of what uniquely identified the creature to a human. That's not the same way the computer thinks.</p>
<p>You could imagine, for example, training a computer to identify tigers, and then training another computer to draw images the first computer would identify as tigers. Are you going to get pictures a human would recognise as tigers out? Probably not. Would a second tiger-spotting computer trained on different images still identify the images from the &quot;tiger&quot;-drawing computer as tigers? I have no idea, and I'd be interested to find out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The cartoon is specifically what a human sees as the defining traits. A caricature. In a sense, a custom data template. The same can speed a computer's understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with your original point and I disagree with this example. How would a regularly functioning adult need to see both of those vegetables on more than one occasion to be able to tell them apart? They might not be able to tell you why, which I think is at the heart of the question about differences between machine learning and human learning, but that's a separate issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's a 1 to 1 comparison though, because a one year old baby has already had about 4000 hours of experience with recognizing things by sight. And that experience matters even if they haven't seen that particular animal before, because they've probably seen other animals that they can compare it to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's interesting, most people say calc 2 is the hardest of the three. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only because we teach them wrong.  Calc 2 is hard because of the scores of useless formulas which you will never use again (mass of a disk with variable density...okay).  It should be more about thinking through how to set up integrals and estimate the error in numerical approximation.</p>
<p>Calc 3 should be way harder, and it should have linear algebra as a prerequisite.  No one understands multivariable the first time around currently:  you have to actually learn it in your physics or differential geometry class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is... Cal2 is integrating pretty much anything and everything. Cal3 is integrating 3d functions and once you get cal 2, cal3 isn't as big a deal. I took both in college...remember next to none of it. </p></div>		</li>
