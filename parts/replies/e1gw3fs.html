			<div class="markdown"><p>This one is a little tricky, because both omega-6 (linoleic acid) and omega-6 fatty acids are essential (can't be synthesized) in animal diets. Given the original question, I don't think any person could practically avoid eating linoleic and linolenic acid for an extended period of time, so everyone would have a certain level of secondary oxidative compounds in their body. The extent of fatty acid oxidation is also heavily mediated by metabolic activity (excercise) and antioxidants like vitamin E and carotenoids. I don't think it's as simple as 'We can tell you ate X because we found Y in your blood.'</p></div>		</li>
