			<div class="markdown"><p>A similar difficult movement is to curl your middle finger under, place the hand palm-down on a surface, and try to lift the ring finger - the only person I’ve seen be able to do this even a little was a professional pianist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this is kind of interesting.. I’ve been playing guitar for 22 years, and I can easily do this with my fretting hand without any discomfort or stress at all, but my right hand just can’t cope. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't call myself an experienced guitarist (I've played sparingly for 3 years, mostly fingerstyle), but I can do this with my right and not my left. Which makes this <em>really</em> confusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. No way I could lift my right ring finger even a hair, but I can lift the left one pretty easily about half an inch to an inch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could do it on my left hand with great effort a tiny bit.  Trying it with my right hand I'm not clear how it's possible on the left.</p>
<p>It hurts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not always impossible! My left pinky is free to waggle about without the ring finger following, but my right pinky has to be chaperoned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can actually flex my pinky without the ring finger moving on my right hand. Likely due to the ligaments on my ring fingers last knuckle being torn in a football accident. Incidentally I no longer have the little wrinkles on that knuckle as it doesn't move by itself anymore.</p></div>		</li>
