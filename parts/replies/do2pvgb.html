			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of points on your (quite good explanation)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>remove component warhead parts and break down further. The radioactive material is often reprocessed into the nuclear power industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For much of the last thirty years, efforts have been made to reprocess nuclear weapons cores into what is known as MOX (mixed oxide) nuclear fuel. MOX is already in use in parts of Europe, with France being the only Nuclear power to use it. However, current MOX supplies are all made from waste fuels, not nuclear weapons. This might change in the future, but concerns about proliferation mean that any steps towards using weapons-grade nuclear materials in MOX will be taken carefully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>remove fuel component from missile. Liquid fuelled missiles are typically only fuelled just prior to launch. Solid fuel missiles are a little more complicated. Rocket fuel can be rather toxic depending upon the type</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solid rockets are often burned at both ends with an observer present. It's apparently quite spectacular, but also quite deadly — as you stated, the fumes are highly toxic, and the rockets were never designed to burn in one location (usually, the missile is moving while the motor is lit).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the silos/ mobile launchers can also be destroyed depending upon the treaty. Observers &amp; satellites monitor this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mobile launchers (planes in particular) are mostly destroyed out in the open to facilitate this. However, some platforms (notably, the B-1B) are de-nuclearized but unverifiable, because the proof itself is usually classified. Additionally, some road-mobile launchers in USSR service were rebuilt into other types of vehicles.</p>
<p>Finally, something nobody has mentioned anywhere here is what really happens to the weapons. Many people don't realize that the warhead gets removed separately and for the most part parked in a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/35°02'25.0%22N+106°36'33.0%22W/@35.0105695,-106.5507132,955m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d35.040278!4d-106.609167?hl=en" target="_blank">massive bunker</a>, just outside of Albuquerque. Most of the United States' decommissioned weapons are stored here because of a backlog in the facility that dismantles the warheads. Russia's disarmament is reportedly even worse, with dozens of poorly-guarded facilities across the country holding their backlog, which is also being dismantled even slower than the US'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>The Pershing systems were eliminated after the ratification of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty on 27 May 1988.  The missiles began to be withdrawn in October 1988 and the last of the missiles were destroyed by the static burn of their motors and subsequently crushed...</em></p>
<p>There was some talk of strapping 3 Pershings together to make a launch vehicle, but nothing came of it, all were destroyed by the treaty worked out by Reagan/Gorbachev.</p>
<p>Built and deployed at great expense, then recalled and destroyed, also at great expense.</p>
<p>Did you hear the one about the trillion dollar (lifetime cost) fighter plane that they claim will not obsolete until 2070?</p></div>		</li>
