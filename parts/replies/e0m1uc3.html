			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.  There are some situations where p&lt;0.05 is now mandated, but there's usually no reason that some other value couldn't have been chosen.  But at least the p value is statistical, whereas SS&gt;=30 is not truly statistical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More or less. The p &lt; 0.05(5%) has 1 possible reason: in a normal distribution, the distance between 5% of data points from the mean is &gt; 2*standard deviation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also add along with who you talk to, it GREATLY depends on what you're studying and trying to prove different. For genetics and finding SNPs, advisors have told me a sample size of 1000 is a general rule of thumb but that's still a rule of thumb. For differently expressed genes, we can sometimes get the sample size per population down to as low as 4 or 5. Plant response to the application of something can be between 4 and 50.</p>
<p>Generally speaking more is better, and sometimes no matter how many samples you take the response will NOT be normal prompting a nonparametric test, even after transforming data. I think 30 is an arbitrary number for those starting statistics. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If your sample isn't random, then even a sample size of 30 can give biased results.</p>

<p>30 000 as well. It's why polls have such a wide range. </p></div>		</li>
