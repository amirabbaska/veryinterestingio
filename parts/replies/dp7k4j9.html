			<div class="markdown"><p>I did reloading/bullet casting - one of the scariest things a bullet caster can face is the Tinsel Fairy - when a drop of water falls into a pot of molten lead. </p>
<p>If the drop manages to get below the surface at all, it will vaporize instantly and nearly explosively throwing molten lead <em>everywhere</em>. Bullet casters, at least the uninjured ones, are <em>very</em> paranoid about making sure the lead ingots stay dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any sort of molten metal casting really... You can find videos where just the residual water on the cast causes an explosion of molten metal.  That's why you're supposed to heat up the cast before pouring the metal in, so all the water is gone...  </p>
<p>Maybe to also lessen thermal expansion/contraction stressses too</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My buddy and I found an old <a href="http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/nhsm/NHSM071311.jpg" target="_blank">handheld mold for casting musketballs</a>, so we were testing it out to make some out of copper. I can't seem to remember the process we came up with, but for some reason it involves the mold getting wet. I made sure to boil the water out most the time with a torch, but once I forgot and we poured the molten copper in with a small amount of water still in there. If you look at the picture, when the grips are closed there's a small hole where you pour in the metal in and that's where the molten copper exploded out of into my face. It got on my face, glasses, shirt, the driveway, <em>everywhere</em>. I have the shirt I wore then and 6 years later it still has pieces of copper stuck in the fabric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite the same thing but I used to tin wires at work which is basically dipping the end of a wire into a small pot of molten solder (like this <a href="https://youtu.be/M02FbfUvg2I" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/M02FbfUvg2I</a>)</p>
<p>Because it was such a boring job I used to throw water droplets at the surface of the molten solder all the time just to watch them sizzle.</p>
<p>Was I at risk of the thing blowing up in my face??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While working in the aluminum factory I had this happen. Some rust on a spike we used to take samples.<br />
As it happens, rust contains quite a bit of moisture... Thankfully I was well dressed and not much exposed skin anywhere. Did leave some burn marks on my clothes and helmet though.</p></div>		</li>
