<p>At first it seems like it'd be near impossible to populate such a large area with such little diversity, but your post helps me make a little more sense of it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Sorry, Becky, I know you like Steve, but you're gonna have to have Robert's children. It's for the good of the colony.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Minimum risk&quot; is an entirely subjective threshold.</p>
<p>To threaten the survival of the population there's a very specific criteria: Issues caused by inbreeding have to so greatly threaten the population that the average fertility of a woman during her lifespan drops below 1;  In conventional pairbonding societies, that the average fertility of a woman during her lifespan drops below 2.</p>
<p>If we all inherit a gene that causes you to develop massive tumors between age 20 and 40 and then die before 45?  That's <em>not a problem</em> for the survival of the species, because it doesn't reduce fertility significantly.  If we all inherit a gene that drops average IQ 20 points?  Again, not a problem, doesn't reduce fertility.  If half of the babies come out with horrific congenital mutations and disabilities that require lifetime care?  Not an issue.  We've dealt with worse than 50% infant mortality even in historic memory (famines &amp; pre-antibiotic childhood illnesses).  We can expect to breed out disadvantageous gene combinations even with a very small pool, as long as we try and maximize fertility.  Without any intentional design, we've managed average fertility rates of 6 to 8 before.  With the benefit of drugs, modern medicine, and post-scarcity engineering we could probably achieve higher than 10.</p>
<p>It's subjective quality of life that NASA is concerned about.  Survival of the species you could probably do with a dozen people, or perhaps even down into the single digits.  It just wouldn't be sexy futurism that people would pay NASA to help achieve.</p>
<p>The only really reliable way to destroy genetic viability, which we understand from the massive eugenics experiment known as &quot;puppies!&quot;, is to backbreed over multiple generations, eg fathers to daughters to granddaughters to great-granddaughters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I’m not mistaken, the number was somewhere around 10k to reduce genetic deterioration to a reasonable, controllable level. </p>
<p>Which I believe has a lot to do with how “inbred” humans are in general. (According to scientists humans have survived 3 different extinction events, which lowered our numbers into the thousands each time) There was a TIL about how ant colonies spererated by 6 feet of water are more diverse than humans from across the planet. Fun stuff. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I assumed it was an old clip like YouTube randomly throws at me. I see now this was like 3 days old so not weird as I hoped. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Youtube keeps shoving Joe Rogen, Ellen DeGeneres, and the late night talk show clips down my throat. </p>
<p>Also any top 10, laugh you lose. And any other videos with a million views or more </p></div>		</li>
