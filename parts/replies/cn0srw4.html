			<p>&gt;I'm an electrician and earning 65k a year at 24 years old without needing to do overtime<br><br>I think this is possible here, skilled trades like that can make decent pay with out an advanced education, but a lot of people dont seem to go that route.<br><br>most people are pushed in to 4 years schools and are graduating with an average of 35K in student loans.<br><br>Then they are getting out and realizing that the job market is not quite as good as it once was.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's a lot of people that don't have the mechanical ability to be an electrician / plumber / whatever, It's not attractive to people to work out in the cold and use a freezing porta-potty on a construction site, and the trades limit the amount of people coming in to protect their high wages. You can't just decide you want to be an electrician, you need to find one that needs a helper, and then work your way up and eventually get accepted for one of the limited slots by the union. </p>		</li>

			<p>Oh sure i agree, thats what i refereed to them as skilled trade...but at the same time i think if a kid went and total their parents that they wanted to a be plumber over going to college they would freak out most because of reasons like this<br><br>&gt;It's not attractive<br><br>or its not white collar enough <br><br>or &quot;Alice's son is goring to be doctor why are you going to be plumber?&quot; <br><br>American society encourages people to go to school to get a 4 year degree when in in most jobs it doenst really seem necessary or could be reaplce by a two year degree or even a trade school type program.<br><br>Hell the work i am doing now i didn't need a 4 year degree for its just there are not trade school programs...<br><br><br></p>		</li>
