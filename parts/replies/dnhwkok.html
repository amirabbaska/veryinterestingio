			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  A lifting belt accomplishes the mind-muscle connection during lifts without the need for impact.  It's to help create awareness and &quot;feel&quot; the muscle so you can contract it.  I would agree with your sentiment.  Although it still forces the boxer to contract and thereby get a workout in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The belt isn't to help with the mind-muscle connection, it's to give your core muscles something to push <em>against</em>. Pushing against something allows them to engage more completely, and helps your core muscles to stabilize your spine under heavy compression loads. I can deadlift at least 505# with a belt; the last time I tried 400# without a belt, I ended up spraining my right transversus abdominus. (And LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH THAT HURTS...)</p></div>		</li>
