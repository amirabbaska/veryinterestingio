			<div class="markdown"><p>The clover bar landfill is closed because it is full.   The city still sends a large amount of waste to nearby landfills including much of the compost, which they are having trouble finding buyers for.  The waste to fuel facility still hasn't demonstrated it can run profitably.  The fact the landfill captures it's gas is good, but that is par for the course for landfills in the USA, under EPA regs.  While the facility is cool, it is still subsidizing the disposal of the waste everyone makes.  Well regulated landfills can be carbon neutral, have minimal impact on the environment, and while they do take up space, wildlife don't mind the fact they're at a former landfill after closure and they make decent parks.  Private landfills also more accurately price the cost of disposal encouraging source reduction not just diversion.  A growing hill in eyesight of a city is wonderful reminder of how wasteful we all are. </p></div>		</li>

Try and use a magnet on some different types of cans, you'll be amazed. </p></div>		</li>
