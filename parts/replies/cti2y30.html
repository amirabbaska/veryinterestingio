			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the difference between tech then and tech now. At the time (stated in another posting here), it was just 'okay, they're down.' Then a few hours later a grainy photo of them bouncing around.</p>
<p>Compare this to even just Curiosity, where we had effectively a descent movie within a few minutes of landing, instant video, etc. A manned mission today will be a media circus, with multiple cameras, six months of astronauts livetweeting and doing media events, constant coverage, etc.</p>
<p>And in today's world, nowadays there will always be access to these missions to the general public. I mean, I regularly look at the newest pictures from Curiosity, the next day as they're downloaded. So unlike previous missions, where the news was the major source of info, those of us who are dedicated space watchers will be getting constant updates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not a huge Twitter fan..  But I made an account JUST for them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To quote Stephen Pinker in his book The Better Angels of our Nature, after he discussed how most young children used to walk to school unattended, but now it's considered dangerous and neglectful of their parents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When 300 million people change their lives to reduce a risk to 50 people, they will probably do more harm than good, because of the unforeseen consequences of their adjustments on the vastly more than 50 people who are affected by them. To take just two examples, more than twice as many children are hit by cars driven by parents taking their children to school as by any other kinds of traffic, so when more parents drive their children to school to prevent them from getting killed by kidnappers, more children get killed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My theory on that is that it stems from the sense of power we get when seeming to take charge of our own destiny, and the fear that arises when we feel we are not in control during extreme situations. Of course these feelings don't stem from reason, so we end up with nonsensical results. People <em>feel</em> more in control when driving a vehicle, so we feel that we have more of a say in the outcome of random disastrous events than we do if our children were abducted and we were not around, no matter what the statistics say.</p>
<p>Same goes for terrorist attacks really. Compared to cars, heck even falls in the shower, the threat we face from terrorism is dwarfed by almost every other cause of untimely death. To alleviate the fear that such a loss of control over our destiny causes, we will apparently spend billions to try to prevent something that may as well be a rounding error in so far as its statistical significance is concerned.</p>
<p>I think this comes from our eternal optimism, which likely has evolutionary advantages. &quot;When push comes to shove,&quot; we rationalize, &quot;if I have anything to say about it, I will beat the odds.&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
