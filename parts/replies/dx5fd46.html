			<div class="markdown"><p>That hyper-vigilance you're talking about makes a ton of sense. I can sleep like a rock, as in my mother used to take my pulse if I napped as a teenager because I legitimately looked dead. However, the moment I had kids, everything woke me up, which was good when they were babies. It does make it quasi impossible to sleep with my husband though since he moves and snores. I have noticed though that if I'm sleeping somewhere and I don't have the kids with me (or if I have to take a nap while they're at school for example) I automatically go back to sleeping like a corpse.  So thank you for confirming what I've been suspecting. Any tips on being less hyper-vigilant while sleeping though? The youngest is 7 now, it's not like they wake up for feedings anymore but my brain doesn't seem to have gotten that memo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting over hyper-vigilance isn't easy. A lot is about training your mind to realize that things are ok and there aren't &quot;threats&quot; or &quot;something is going to happen&quot;. Often it's easier to work through these with a professional than going on your own. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so true. I have been military for 9 years, and the thing I learned is how to shut off. When my fire team partner is a friend I completely trust, I'm asleep within seconds of hitting the bag. 2 hr switching is average for my unit, and we learn to crash fast. But when I get a new partner that I'm not sure of yet, I feel the sleep deprivation so much worse. I feel like I'm still going to sleep, but it's not restful, and I wake up frequently to make sure he's awake and alert. Basically, I am telling my sub conscious that it's ok to check out hard because I trust my fire team partner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive been hypervigilant for almost 20 years now and I've never known what to do about it. Logically there is nothing bothering me and I already know nothing is wrong, I feel no conscious fear. And yet it's like my body is on a different page than my mind. It takes me hours to fall asleep every night and the slightest noise will start my heart pounding like a drum. I need to sleep with a loud fan for white noise because any sort of recognizable noise will grab my mind's focus and make me alert. Enough of a disturbance and it will just reset the clock, taking me another couple hours to fall asleep. </p>
<p>I think I trained myself to be this way when I was young. My dad was the mean kind of prankster which led me to be extremely scared of the dark for many years as a child. My parents didn't know it but I spent at least a couple years actually <em>afraid</em> to fall asleep, laying in bed every night with my eyes wide open and the slightest noise would put me into a panic. Catching myself with my eyes closed filled me with terror and I'd force them open again. Every night, sleep had to take me by surprise. </p>
<p>Eventually I got over the emotional aspect of it and by my teenage years I was no longer afraid of dark/sleep at all, yet the physical effects have remained ever since. I feel like I'm just fucked, never to sleep a full 8 hours the rest of my life. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I was miserable until I started using white noise.   That worked for years, until my toddler started noisily barging into the room at 4am and climbing over me to cuddle her mommy.   I'm hoping this will be a brief phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypervigilance is one of those things that takes time to work on, unfortunately. Definitely agree that talking to a professional can make a big difference. There are lots of self-help books (New Harbinger is a major publisher) and sites online for anxiety management, too, depending on your situation and what makes sense for you. Good luck :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't there a difference in how easily people wake up? For example my mom is a very light sleeper in a sence she wakes up the moment you make one little bit of sound. She has difficulty falling asleep. While my dad falls asleep in 10 seconds and he is unwakable by sound. Is there a difference in sleep patterns or an underlying reason why there is such a big difference?</p>
<p>Edit: i'm might have just read the first part. Soz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you did touch on something that wasn't in the post :) </p>
<p>There is a weird assumption that when people sleep, they're going to be out like a light as soon as they jump into bed. The reality is that it takes a healthy sleeper an average of 15 - 20 minutes to fall asleep. Sleep also isn't an on/off switch, it's more like a spectrum. Falling dead-to-the-world asleep the second your head hits the pillows can be a sign that you are overly tired or even sleep-deprived.</p>
<p>Basically, there can be unrealistic exceptions and beliefs around what normal sleep is supposed to look like. Of course that influences how people rate their subjective experience of sleep, but if that becomes a point of stress and rumination ('Why can't I sleep? There must be something wrong with me! Tomorrow is going to suck so bad!'), sleep quality is also going to suffer on more objective measures because stress is a very good way to disturb sleep.</p>
<p>(Obviously this is just speaking generally and your parents should talk to their doctor about any concerns!)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Such an amazing and foreign skill she has to drop into sleep.</p>
<p>P.S. and yes we are both sleep deprived...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard also that women are lighter sleepers than men. I assume this is because women traditionally had to wake up in the night to take care of babies and kids? </p></div>		</li>
