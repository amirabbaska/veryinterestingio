			<div class="markdown"><p>Climate change is a political issue because it affects economics through perception (voluntary fossil fuel divestment or stakeholder pressure) and possibly through regulation (tax/laws). </p>
<p>Government regulation is, in general, a political issue as is the fact that climate change is a global issue that must be 'squished' into a national framework by each country.</p>
<p>The degree to which a certain country would 'take reponsibility' for its global effect is also a political issue. For example, an extremely isolationist country would not care whether climate change affected other groups as long as it didn't affect them and would therefore not move towards emission control.</p>
<p>The kinds of changes that are required in order to manage climate change are all tightly linked to political views as to how a country and its economy should operate.
Unfortunately the science of climate change is complex enough and uncertain enough that it has been the easiest point of attack when arguing against the policy changes that would be suggested due to the implications of the science.</p>
<p>The implications of climate change are a political issue and that is what is important and should be debated in the public sphere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Within the climate change debate there are actually TWO relevant and inter-related questions: one <strong>P</strong>olicy/Political and the other <strong>S</strong>cientific. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>S</strong> - The Scientific Question: <em>Are human-generated CO2 emissions having a significantly detrimental effect on the planet?</em></p>
</li>
<li><strong>P</strong> - The Policy/Political Question: <em>Given the answer to S is yes, will Cap-and-Trade, Copenhagen, Paris etc properly address the issue?</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>The libertarian response to P is almost unanimous - NO.  This is for a variety of reasons involving concerns with the mechanisms of human action, economics, gov't intervention, etc.</p>
<p>While almost all people would agree that Question S should drive Question P, libertarians - particularly because of their attention to perverse incentives on human action - are more apt to suspect that the &quot;Tail is Wagging the Dog&quot;.  Generally speaking, many are concerned Question P may be driving the answer to Question S.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect you misunderstand that phrase. It is a fact that many political actors lobby primarily in their own best interest. Scientific funding is sometimes used to pervert the outcome of the scientific process (see the well documented case of the Tobacco Industry, the only slightly less well documented case of the Energy Industry, and the emerging case of the Sugar Industry). Simply put, people try to influence government and science to their own advantage.</p>
<p>The people of whom /u/fields is speaking are quick to suspect that something like this is behind any given campaign for government action.</p>
<p>For example, among the circles I used to frequent, it was observed that there have been people opposing industrial capitalism almost from the day it began, with their reasons changing through the ages, and suspected that &quot;liberals&quot; were funneling government funding into junk &quot;science&quot; aimed at, once again, demonizing industrial capitalism, this time in the name of &quot;global warming&quot;, very much in the way we now know the energy industry was actually doing from the other side.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon is intelligence about foreign countries. There has been a faction in our government that's been pushing for war in Iraq as far back as 1984. Ultimately, we didn't go to war on the basis of the case for the presence of illegal (by treaty law) WMDs in Iraq; rather, the case was made to excuse the invasion they'd wanted literally for decades. Why? Money, probably.</p>
<p>That's what /u/fields meant by &quot;their attention to perverse incenvies on human action&quot;. The academic field is &quot;public choice theory&quot;, which studies the correlation between the financial interests of constituents and the actual activities of the government. Study that sort of thing long enough, and you begin to suspect that the entire government is nothing but a cash machine for lobbyists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a political issue because it is a tragedy of the commons and therefore requires legislation to fix. As long as individuals have lower costs to themselves by getting energy that puts global warming gases in the atmosphere, and higher costs to themselves for using clean renewable energy sources, most people will stick with the option that has lower costs to themselves. One individual's carbon emissions save themselves money but make no difference to the climate as a whole. Only the choices of large groups of people make a difference. </p>
<p>The only conceivable way to put a cost on putting CO2 into the atmosphere is through legislation.  </p></div>		</li>
