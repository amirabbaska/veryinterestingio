			<div class="markdown"><p>It's due to the way the vocal folds behave when you whisper. There are roughly <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GQhgNyy.jpg" target="_blank">three ways</a> a healthy set of vocal cords can be positioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a. Normally, when you breathe, your vocal folds are in abduction (open) to let the air pass through your vocal cords without any obstruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c. When you talk, your vocal folds are in adduction (closed) so you can push air between them creating changes in pressure above and below your vocal folds, making them 'clap' together, creating sound. When you 'lose' your voice, your vocal cords can't close completely, so most of the time only air passes through.</p>
</li>
<li>b. When you whisper, however, your vocal folds are only closed for maybe two thirds, creating a kind of small, open triangle through which the air travels. This way, the vocal cords are closed in a way to obstruct the airflow enough to prevent it from exiting too quickly, but not closed enough to make your vocal cords clap together, thus creating soundless speech.</li>
</ul>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude am I the only one that finds it absolutely insane that we just instinctually know how to control these kinds of things in our bodies without ever really being aware that they exist? I meant there are a million other examples, of course, but speech/singing/etc. really blow me away, just because of the sheer range of ability and control we have. Crazy stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I would like to point out that it takes a LOT of practice. It takes years for humans to figure all this out, and after that, we (typically) so it every day, for everything we need to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can! I'm assuming two things here: that by 'cracks' you mean the 'sudden, uncontrollable shifts in tone' while speaking, and also, that you're a male.</p>
<p>When you go through puberty, a lot of things change in your body. One of the things that change are your vocal cords: in males they grow around 30% in shape and size, making them able to produce a bigger range of tones, expanding it with one whole octave. This process starts roughly at the age of 12 and takes about 6 months to complete. During that time, us males tend to experience voice breaks now and then. It's simply our set of vocal cords being inexperienced with its new, 'upgraded' self that causes these breaks. It's completely normal and will disappear over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only a guess, but I think it's because you're not engaging those vocal folds during whispering.  The folds seem to deal with tone, but a whisper doesn't need that.  You're just passing air up and out, and the words are formed by the shape/position of your lips, tongue, cheeks, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends how you're whispering. Whispering can have a small amount of voice/tone. This just means the vocal folds are not fully colliding and there is extra space between them to create the breathier sound. This kind of whispering is hard work for the voice (even if it doesn't feel that way) and should be avoided when sick. Speaking softly is a much healthier option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When your vocal cords are under-performing, attempting to add small voice tone to a whisper usually results in a silence or cracking/popping. Non voice whispering is created by making a constricted but fully open pathway for a hissing air sound which is made into speech at a monotone by the mouth. When you try to add voice tone you slip back into the failure of vibration due to the injury.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when you whisper, your vocal chords don't actually vibrate, its just a controlled release of air which your mouth/tongue shapes into sounds. that's why most people sound more-or-less the same when whispering -- there is no vocal chord involvement. and this also explains why you don't lose your ability to whisper when your vocal chords get swollen.</p></div>		</li>
