			<div class="markdown"><p>That's odd that you chose that example. Usually when I sip, and I think for others as well, the point is to entrain air to cool down the fluid. This as I'm sure you know is highly turbulent, which is also why sipping is frequently accompanied by an annoying noise.</p>
<p>I think a bathtub would be a better analogy. If you slowly dip your hand into the tub, you can tolerate a higher water temperature than if you thrash your hand around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does your explanation agree with the recent opnion from /u/avgjoe33 which speculated that the excess co2 was getting in the way? I'm reading this as the laminar flow you described. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not CO2 that gets in the way, the lighter fuel has already burned and the heat alone should begin the off-gassing process in paper that allows for combustion. But like I said, the hot gasses are prevented from contacting the paper. What heat is transferred to the paper then is what is radiated by the flame. Much less IOW.</p>
<p>There is a complex diffusion process that takes place at the interface that allows some hot molecules to approach the paper, but the process is relatively slow, allowng them to cool first.</p>
<p>It is in fact possible to construct a setup whereby a flame will actually cool something, due to the expansion/momentum of the gasses.</p>
<p>[edit for clarity] The concentration of CO2 is usually not high enough to starve the paper of oxygen required for combustion and keep in mind that paper already contains air in-between the fibres. More than enough to begin combusting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the setup where you can use a flame to cool something? It's not burying a 6 pack of beer in sand, and setting the sand on fire with gasoline? I saw that on mythbusters and it didn't work haha.</p></div>		</li>
