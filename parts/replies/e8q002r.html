			<div class="markdown"><p>Equally, I'm not pregnant but I guess my body just likes to fuck me up and usually from two weeks before my period I experience this and a load of other symptoms that make people go &quot;whoa are you preggers?&quot;. One particularly bad month hormone-wise I spent two weeks throwing up every time I tried to eat eggs (they used to be my favourite food and I ate them daily) and sobbing that I can't stand to look at/smell/taste my old favourite food. I still can't really eat them now and I'm gutted. </p></div>		</li>
