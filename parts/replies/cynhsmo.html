<p>Each zombie has a position within the map that is defined by its X, Y, and Z coordinates.</p>

<p>Well yes, but each zombie also has information like which direction it's facing, what model type it is, has it noticed the player, is it a smoker about to attack?, did it's tongue hit?</p>
<p>When you think about ALL that - repeated for every zombie, that still seems like a lot. Obviously it works though it's just amazing.</p></div>		</li>
