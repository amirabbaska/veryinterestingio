			<div class="markdown"><p>From a young age, I have been a prolific producer of earwax. I'm supposed to go in for semi-regular ear cleanings and what not, but I ain't got time for that shit, so I just spend a month or two of each year in a state of functional semi-deafness.  </p>
<p>A couple years back, the semi-deafness in my left year hung on with a special tenacity, and I spent a solid four months just not hearing anything very clearly. I'd just returned from Taiwan by way of South Korea, where I'd spent a solid three weeks getting drunk and sleeping on a buddy's couch. That's where the deafness had first started to creep in.  </p>
<p>I was massaging the area beneath my ear one evening to see if I could shift things around a bit when I felt a hard (but spongy) marble-sized mass. This I palpated for a bit with mixed fascination and terror. Still more horrified was I when I found that I could <em>move</em> it. It was coming out. I reached in with a pair of tweezers and took hold of it. I yanked.  </p>
<p>It was a black plastic earbud. I must've fallen asleep with my headphones in. I'd had an earbud lodged in my left ear for four months.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the nastier stories i've heard off-internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty damned gross, even by my standards.</p>
<p>A year or two before the earbud incident, I had my ears cleaned out by a proper Chinese doctor. He had a pretty warped sense of humor. In preparation for the rinse job, he put a paper collar around my neck.  </p>
<p>&quot;You know what we use this collar for?&quot;<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
&quot;Examination of vagina.&quot;<br />
&quot;I ... see.&quot;<br />
&quot;This one not used yet.&quot;<br />
&quot;Very good.&quot;  </p>
<p>After the rinse job, he took the big metal bucket over to the sink, where I assumed he'd just dump the whole thing out. Instead, he whirled around and came back over to show me its contents. </p>
<p>&quot;You are glad you not bringing this back to America, no?&quot; </p>
<p>Despite myself, I took a peek into the bucket. I won't describe what I saw in there. The human body is an amazing thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That happened to me at the gym once. I lost the earbud to one side of my headphones and replaced it with a spare one I had from an old set. It was looser than the first so when I took my headphones out the earbud stayed lodged in my ear. I couldn't grab it with my fingers because it was far enough in there, and every time I tried It would be pushed farther up. Luckily my wife had a bobby pin handy which I could use to pull it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is a q-tip bad in all cases?</p>
<p>What I do is carefully insert it so it does not touch the walls of  the ear as it's going in. Once it's as far as I want, I will lower it and scrap the bottom part of the ear with the q-tip in the external direction. </p>
<p>Doing it like this, I'm try to avoid &quot;shoving&quot; wax into my eardrum and trying to move it outwards. Do you think this works, or is it killing me somehow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been cleaning my ears with q tips for 20 years and I've never had an issue &quot;pushing wax further in.&quot; If anything it just gets caught on the q tip. YMMV but it's never been a problem for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No! While an ENT might tell you never to stick anything smaller than your elbow in your ear, I used to let things happen naturally and would end up with cashew size blockings every year. I've been using qtips every shower since early 20s and no issues.</p>
<p>Just be careful</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey that's better than bugs up your nose. Your nose is probably just as sensitive as your ear, but for someone like me with allergies, a bug might just feel like a particular itchy pollen grain. This summer while walking through the forest I suddenly felt a great itch in my nose and naturally started sniffling a bit. There were all kinds of spiders everywhere, and the thought that it might have been a spider crossed my mind. When I got out of the bush I gave a hard, loud sniffle and felt something hit the back of my throat. After a little cough into my hand, my speculation was confirmed...</p>
<p>Edit: spelling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>...that Ms. Frizzle turned the magic school bus into a small spider and used your nose to teach her students about boogers.</p></div>		</li>
