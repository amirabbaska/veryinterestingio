<p>Give away something really cheap for free and hope they will buy something else in the process.  Super-effective strategy for businesses that sell high-margin impulse products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every Christmas,  local Sheetz gas stations give away free coffee in PA. Every time I grab my free regular coffee - which, let's face it, they probably get for pennies on the dollar - I also order food from their Made to Order section. </p>
<p>Or I buy breath mints. Or gum. Never fails that even though the coffee is free, I still buy something. And it's worth a lot more than that free coffee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the size restriction is mainly to prevent them from running dry by people bringing in their reusable big gulps vs cost. I think slurpee machines are just syrup and water so if depleted its refilled but needs to keep churning until frozen which wont be immediate. The size restriction allows them to keep customers flowing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for 7/11 and yes, those cups were free- the number they sent was based on the size of the store, measured by sales volume.  I also recall there being a discount on the syrups on the order prior to the event and that a Slurpee machine repair guy would check the machines right before hand too.  Dunno if that was gratis or just a way to do scheduled maintenance.  But I could fix a soda machine, so could the manager- we weren't allowed to touch it, though- there were special maintanence guys we had to call.</p>
<p>Still, free Slurpee Day was never as bad of a mess as the hottest weekends of the summer.  And my 7-11 had a 6 barrel machine.  Oy ve. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not strictly related, but here in the U.K. one of our supermarkets Waitrose have our free coffee, all you had to do was have a Waitrose card and you could come in and get a cup of coffee. </p>
<p>They ended up losing an incredible amount of money and after a year they changed it to ‘free coffee with any purchase’</p>
<p>They continued to get screwed by people buying 5p plastic bags, or cheap bread rolls for 20p, and I believe they have made it a minimum purchase amount to get a free coffee. </p>
<p>Tl;dr, it don’t always work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also worth mentioning is what they're <strong>not</strong> paying for: the very expensive marketing and advertising campaign that is making sure everyone is aware of the offer and driving more customers through the door.</p>
<p>So they're normally happy with whatever they may have to pick up on their end of the cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at Build A Bear in a somewhat small town and on a week day we'd make about $500-$600. That day we made $8,500. We didn't end up selling out. We just had to cut the line at 8pm, our store was one of the few in California that kept the lines open.</p>
<p>Edit: I gave an estimated range and specified it was a week day instead. I feel like I confused a lot of you :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC they didn't realize what the demand would be like. </p>
<p>Apart from that it's worth noting that Build-a-Bear probably makes way more money from accessories and clothes and furniture vs. the bears themselves. It's like the free razor handle with the $20 blades, or the free printer with the $50 ink cartridge, or the $1 movie with the $7 soda, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Build-a-Bear did a promotion last week where they offered a new bear at the cost the same as the age of the child in line. So if you took a 5 year old, it would cost $5. The lines were so huge that local authorities shut many of them down due to safety concerns and Build-a-Bear cancelled the whole promotion only a few hours into the day, leading to a lot of upset parents and kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The promotion had two major aspects that could be seen as a disaster. </p>
<p>The first has been mentioned repeatedly in stores running out of product. </p>
<p>The second is the heat. Having that many young children out in the heat was dangerous. Parents should know better however that did not seem the case in areas with high heat indexes. So they had to close the stores and send people away with vouchers just for safety reasons.  </p></div>		</li>
