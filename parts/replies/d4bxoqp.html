			<div class="markdown"><p>That is amazing. Thank you for posting, I had no clue that's how some stingless bees reproduced. Really puts the lie to the idea I've heard before that lower forms of life aren't as caring about their offspring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was an interesting lecture and I didn't know any of it either until I heard it. I should still have the slides, Bee College provides a book with all of them but its at home and I can't access it right now. I'm sure there is more in the slides I have forgotten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean &quot;contact is maintained&quot;? Do the hives support each other with resources or something like that? Or do the bees not reject each other if they end up in the wrong hive or something like that? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you see the statement at then end that I have expended my knowledge of the subject and who to contact for more? I recall that contact was maintained between the hives, details I don't recall.</p></div>		</li>
