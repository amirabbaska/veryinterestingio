<p>The issue here is that you can't really diagnose a lab animal with depression. We know that putting animals through stressful experiences they have no control over causes them to stop fighting to escape those experiences, but it's really hard to make the leap from &quot;behavior similar to a symptom of depression induced by a laboratory protocol&quot; to &quot;actual symptom of depression in an actual human being.&quot; Additionally, depression in humans is thought to arise from interactions between biological susceptibility and environmental insults that will vary dramatically among individuals. Most lab animals are inbred, meaning every animal enrolled in the trial will be genetically identical to every other animal in the trial. So animal models of depression really aren't a good substitute for actual patients. </p></div>		</li>
