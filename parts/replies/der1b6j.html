			<div class="markdown"><p>Jesus fucking christ that sounds fun. So I can do <em>anything</em>? Like, to cross the troll bridge I could WhatsApp Elon Musk and have him invest heavily in the trolls renewables startup, giving him pride and purpose, turning his attention from the mundanities of bridge guarding to the exciting prospects of his freshly invigorated business, allowing me to pass by undetected? </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the beauty of it.  So long as your DM is flexible (and good at improvising), anything can happen.</p>
<p>In your scenario, Elon Musk would send you a reply that 'while your idea has great potential, he regrets to inform you that at this time, he has his attention towards generating sustainable energy through solar panels built in the magic schools - specifically the school of pyromancy.  As thanks, he'll send you his newest Model S (for steed, as cars don't exist in this realm), and after about 30 minutes or so a completely silent mechanical horse would arrive to your aide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude this game sounds amazing. Ok, so can I just say &quot;I have an android phone, Elon owes me from way back when I front him a few billion to start up space x and assuming the universe is infinite, somewhere out there is a version of Elon that has developed teleportation and he will be more than happy to give me a hand&quot;?</p>
<p>I'm fascinated by how lawless the game seems to be. I don't understand how it functions with such casual rules, or lack thereof?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My character is best friends with Elon, he owes me big time for fronting him hella bucks to start up space x. Is that reasonable? Sorry I might sound like I'm being an idiot but I'm fascinated; it seems like a game with virtually no rules?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, last pathfinder game I GM'd they were supposed to help a group of orcs escape from angry townspeople. They decided instead to kill the orcs themselves and skin them. Even the children, for Dwarf clothes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't played in a couple of decades, sadly, but I will always have the memories of my aspiring paladin who suffered a massive concussive brain injury and a consequent personality switch which led to his becoming a sadistic killer. One adventure, having passed the DM a note outlining my intentions, I persuaded my companions to leave me to guard our handful of captives while they went off to parley for their ransom. When they returned they found me sitting in our camp admiring my handiwork: I'd flayed and roasted the noble family we were supposed to be getting a fortune for. The DM, one other player and I found it hilarious: the rest were both enraged and pretty horrified and it nearly scuppered the entire game. However, the DM managed to get things back on the rails by having me brought to the attention of an impressed evil deity who proceeded to help us through that part of the quest - at the cost of my soul. I then experienced another personality shift as the terror of what awaited me after death became all-encompassing and intolerable, and by the end of the next adventure I was a wandering holy man attempting (no doubt futilely) to atone for my horrific sins through acts of charity and self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Such a great fucking game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They killed them. They killed them all. The orcs are dead, every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too. They're like animals, and they slaughtered them like animals. THEY HATE THEM!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recently played an Evil campaign with a group of buddies. DM told us that we needed to kill the evil overlord of a nearby town, we did so without much effort. He then told us that the townsfolk were so happy they had been saved. I laughed heartily as I asked the DM if there was a slave trade in this world.</p></div>		</li>
