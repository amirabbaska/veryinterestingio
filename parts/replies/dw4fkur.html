			<div class="markdown"><p>16 years ago, (took a year to learn how to walk, talk, taste and smell again) but play competitive sports, have a child, and you wouldn't notice to look at me I have been told. Modern medicine is nothing short of miraculous. (but to comment on the original I couldn't walk, as my muscles had atrophied from 200lbs 21 6'2 year old males to 97 pounds till 6'2 male, I could just rip the cords out)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah tons... one of the oddest things was trying to separate my dreams from reality... the medication weening and the lucid state of consciousness for the 3 days out of the coma was intense. My family would talk to me for the days in the coma so I guess I built a reality of the anecdotes they were telling me and my own dreams. Sadly I was quite convinced this had been my reality over the past months whilst in a comatose state, and I was pretty adamant for people to believe me, even though what I was saying happened to me was nothing short of insanity</p></div>		</li>
