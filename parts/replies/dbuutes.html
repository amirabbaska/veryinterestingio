			<div class="markdown"><p>On point number one.  In my town, Comcast was the only horse in the race for years for anything past 5 Mbps.  We had shitty AT&amp;T DSL but even at that price it wasn't worth it compared to significantly faster Comcast internet.  </p>
<p>Then AT&amp;T swept into town and ran fiber <em>everywhere</em> about 2 months ago.  I now pay $50/month for 1 Gbps internet.  Granted (just like Comcast's claims are bullshit) it generally tests out in the 400-600 Mbps range with a few times in the 800 Mbps range, but I'm still paying way the fuck less for way the fuck more.  Comcast is suddenly offering crazy deals on their service in my area to compete with them; my package was $212/month after taxes and fees, now it's $130.  Funny how a little competition helps to regulate pricing.  </p></div>		</li>

<li>Is a huge factor. I live downtown in decently populated city and I have three options for internet. I have 60k down 5 up for 40 bucks a month (50 if I didn't own my own modem). Family lives an hour north in a small town, they have only one option for broadband, and, from the same ISP, they pay 87/month for the same speeds. Neither of us have TV or Phone with them. Both are under the &quot;first year deal&quot; they they offer so prices will increase.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest reason is that there is no current use for speeds that fast. Remember that the US lagged WAY behind Europe/Japan before the iPhone was released. When Apple came out with its new phone and proved there was demand for mobile web browsing (which required a lot more bandwidth), AT&amp;T moved extremely quickly to upgrade its networks, and far surpassed what was available in Europe. Now the developed world has mostly caught up again. However, what's offered now is &quot;good&quot; enough for what people use their phones for. I get 20-50mbps with my carrier, and everything loads quite quickly (videos, pictures, audio, etc...). It's rare that I think &quot;shit this internet is slow, I wish it would load faster.&quot; In other words, carriers don't really have incentives to offer 200mbps internet. Realistically, what are you going to use it for? If next year a killer feature/app came out that required internet speeds orders of magnitude faster, I think carriers would roll out the upgrades.</p></div>		</li>
