			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking this as well.. Like yes we definitely anthropomorprphize dog features and behaviors but it's important to remember that we have also bred certain &quot;human traits&quot; into dogs and fundamentally changed their behaviors and appearance at a genetic level. This awesome documentary explains it better than I ever could

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats experience neoteny as well. People joke that cats consider humans to be their servants, but the truth is that housecats (even adults) actually live in a sort of prolonged kitten-hood, and view their owners like a kitten views its mother.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That explains cat behavior a lot. I guess this could be somewhat extended to dogs too, there was an experiment behavioral scientists made and the dogs in the experiment were faced with a problem: there were three treats under 3 lids. Two of the lids were loose so the dogs easily got the treats. The third one tho, was bolted, and the treat couldn't be reached. </p>
<p>The first thing the vast majority of the dogs in the experiment did was turn to humans for help, in different degrees. Some would just stare at the humans, some would bark, some would jump on them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's interesting to realize that cats only meow when they want to get attention from their mother, or a human. Adult cats don't meow at each other. </p></div>		</li>

<p>if you had to breed two different dog breeds to get the friendliest mother fucker alive, what two breeds would you choose?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely a Golden Retriever mix, probably with another chill breed like a Border Collie or something . I might be biased because I own a Golden, but the dude wouldn't hurt a fly and makes friends with every living being he meets. </p>
<p>Great question! What would you choose ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure you can really call border collies &quot;chill,&quot; they're intensely intelligent, but without the proper enrichment, they can be a terror. There is a statistic that border collies are one of the most likely to wind up back in a shelter simply because people don't know how to handle them. They are wonderful dogs with an unbelievable level of intelligence and work ethic, but not for beginner dog owners.  Golden retrievers, however, are pure love. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Golden/corgi mix. My mother has (she was mine too before I moved out) a lab/corgi mix. She's sweet, good with kids, conveniently sized, weirdly muscled, super intelligent, well behaved, was easily trained, has no health issues... But as she ages, she has the same sort of neurotic behaviour labs tend to get.</p>
<p>I figure a corgi and a golden would be the perfect combo. Except all the shedding....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be unnecessary to breed two dogs for this trait. The friendliest motherfuckers alive already exist. They are called Huskies. They are known to be so friendly, not just to humans, <a href="http://boredomtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/polar-bear-dogs-1.jpg" target="_blank">but to other animals as well</a>. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVaN0G8WnBI&amp;t=0m37s" target="_blank">They are also great with kids</a>. The husky I had growing up could not bark (but she loved to howl at the moon) so If you want a guard dog, DO NOT get a husky, they will invite intruders into your home for snuggles. </p></div>		</li>
