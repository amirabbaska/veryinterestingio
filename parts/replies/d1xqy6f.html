			<div class="markdown"><p>Teacher here. We're often told that students with ADHD need some sort of noise (like music) or movement (tapping/fidgeting) in order to focus because it calms the noise and distractions inside of them and helps them to concentrate on the task at hand. Non-ADHD students need just the opposite. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motion is important too. I burn out pretty quick if I'm just listening to music while say drawing, studying or writing and since my hands are occupied i obviously cant tap (not that it's every done anything for me personally...more of a leg jitterbug). But TV calms me perfectly. However I have to choose a show that I'm not too invested in so I don't wind up watching it. Law and order SVU was my go-too as a kid since half of it was just legal nonsense that became akin to white noise. However the ocassional fight or gun scenes or emotional moments gave me a consistent mental break to watch without being overly distracting or distracting me for too long a period of time. If I really want to listen to music though I'll find songs I already own on YouTube since they usually at the very least have an visualizer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Militarily trained cryptologic linguist here, who also has ADHD, I went through my entire 63 week Arabic  course, listening to music on headphones (whenever it was acceptable) while writing/reading things in Arabic. The non ADHD folks in my class were perplexed by my ability to listen to lyrical music, in English, while reading/writing Arabic. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've tried similar (not Arabic, reading French with English radio or vice versa) and I literally rage quit!</p>
<p>Was the volume down super low or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different forms of ADHD and different people need different things, but I have whatever form you have. I do most of my best work while watching a TV show or having some other narrative form on in the background. Silence absolutely fucks me up if I have to concentrate on something dull or repetitive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is spot on! My principal is huge on the fact that ADHD and non-ADHD students need entirely different learning environments. Besides music and standing/pacing, other proposed classroom accommodations include using exercise balls instead of chairs; sticking clear, plastic tubing on the end of pencils for students to chew on (kind of gross); and tying bungee cords around the legs of chairs for students to push their legs against. So many possibilities!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Teachers would get so fucking sick of exercise balls the first day. Kids just can't leave shit like that alone.</p>
<p>They'd complain, try to take it, kick it away while the ADHD kid sits on it, throw it on stuff and break everything. Then cry just because they haven't cried in a while.</p>
<p>Probably back to normal after having the ball for a week though. If no one has poked a hole in it by then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Programmer here, don't think I have ADHD but the way I've tried to describe it to others is that I can hear multiple conversations going on at once (but don't like to, since they sometimes get interesting), so I listen to music with lyrics to occupy that part of my mind enough that I can focus on coding. When I actually have to think hard, I have to switch to lyric-less music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, I'm a programmer too and I have the same problem.
On my last project with 18+ people in one &quot;open office&quot; room, working was hell at times. Try programming when you can hear (and undeliberately follow) 5-6 different conversations at the same time...  </p>
<p>Solution: Convinced my boss to get me a set of Bose QuietComfort Active noise cancelling headphones. Those things are heaven for me. They've helped a huge deal against my migraines too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should. Granted, solutions for ADHD differ among different types (for instance, &quot;inattentive type,&quot; vs &quot;hyperactive&quot;), but for me, Adderall worked wonders. I was always lethargic and scatterbrained. I couldn't focus to save my life unless I was in a high-stress situation. I actually functioned better when I was in the Army than I did as a civilian, even after I got out. I eventually got myself checked, and it turns out I'm the inattentive type. I got a script for Adderall, and it's been life-changing. I'm able to focus in the way I perceive what would be &quot;normal&quot; in others, and my energy and enthusiasm for things is what I perceive to be normal in others.</p>
<p>It made sense when my therapist described how ADHD brains work. The short explanation is that ADHD brains are under-stimulated. Normal things are boring and uninteresting to us, so it's hard to keep focused on normal, mundane things. Which also explains why we tend to do better in high-stress scenarios. We're finally experiencing something stimulating enough to hold our attention, and we focus like crazy!</p></div>		</li>
