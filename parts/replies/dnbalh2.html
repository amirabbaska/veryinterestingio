			<div class="markdown"><p>I could have actually mixed the two up. I often hear about the differences between &quot;right to work&quot; states and ones that don't have those laws. I figured there was more to it than just blocking forced union joining. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah its a common mistake. At-will employment basically states that either the employee or employer can end the working relationship at any time w/out reason. In theory this seems fair but a lot of people think that since the employee is more reliant on the employer (i.e. the employer has more power in the relationship) it is unfair to the employee that you can be fired at any time w/out reason</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think about the concept of two weeks notice for termination, since employees are expected to give notice for quitting? Employees being fired for poor performance or other more significant issues could be simply told to not come back to work. Biggest problem of course is that isn't &quot;fair.&quot; But is it worth it to prevent good workers from being fucked over by bad management?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this also makes contract work horrible because the contract period is a lie. They can end the contract at any time without any recourse on the part of the contractor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be careful taking this at face value. The &quot;point of contention&quot; mentioned is the core of the issue and glossing over it is why it seems like there should be &quot;more to it&quot;. The norm is that non-union workers <em>do</em> get the benefits of being in a union, not that they <em>don't</em>. This is because the union not representing non-union workers would further divide the workforce, so it is in the best interest of the union to do this despite it weakening the union through a reduction of membership (fewer people bargaining) and funding (fewer people paying dues). The typical alternative is no union at all, which is even worse for the workers. If this was not the case there would be no Right to Work laws. Their purpose is to weaken unions. At-will employment is a related issue in that it's the sort of thing unions fight against (or, more commonly, what they fight for more fair exceptions to).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also variances. I work for local government and am a union member (SEIU). There are some people who can opt out. They still pay a union due, albeit much smaller. They're protected by the union to an extent (Weingarten rights and such) but do not get to vote in any way, shape, or form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also makes the union less powerful as they don't officially represent all of the labour. Going on strike is not really effective if half of the workforce is not in the union and keeps going to work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They make it sound like it's good for the workers. Yeah..you have a right to work. </p>
<p>No, it's undermining unions by limiting their dues and memberships of new employees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they get the benefits of the union; the wages, the insurance, the pension that the union negotiated. Unions have been forced to defend these free loaders as well.</p></div>		</li>
