			<div class="markdown"><p>Hear hear. I know there's a rule in the sidebar telling not to explain like you're explaining to a literal 5 y.o. But if I want to read a copy pasted wikipedia article, I can do that myself. I remember when ELI5 had a lot people trying to be as creative as possible with how they explain complex stuffs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because there really is not a simple answer to this question. It takes several semesters to teach this to engineering undergrads, so it's not simple to just boil down to core concepts </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps it's a good opportunity to enhance your layman understanding. How would you currently explain how processors work? Which parts of the description above did you find the most confusing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry. Which part confused you? Basically, it's 0/1 inputs cascading through tons of logic gates to yield different different 0/1 outputs. We define what the combinations of input 0/1s and output 0/1s mean at a higher level.</p></div>		</li>

Maybe because I played so much MTG during <em>Alara</em>.</p></div>		</li>
