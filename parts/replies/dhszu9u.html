			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. That's quite probably the most insightful post I've read on this sub.</p>
<p>But it gets me thinking of a completely different problem, which is (I guess) outlined in the blog post but, alas, not clearly enough for me to understand.</p>
<p>If generating more energy does not help battling entropy, then... why generate energy? Philosophically, conceptually, why is such an abstract and trivial thing as the conserved quantity of time translation invariance so important on its own, that we have to do so much with it: get it from somewhere, store it in batteries, transfer over large distances? Why does doing anything interesting require the anything to have a large enough arbitrary-number-thingy-that-is-conserved?</p>
<p>Also, is the second law THAT universal? Can I formulate the ever-increasing entropy, temperature and energy for, say, Conway's Game of Life? What would that look like?</p></div>		</li>

<p>it's not really energy that you're interested in, but free energy (Gibbs' or Helmholtz' depending on the context). This is the true measure of your ability to do work and, and hopefully I'm not cornering myself into philosophy here, to sustain computation and process information. All that is &quot;worth&quot; to us is ultimately information processing and storage: for example a human being is only alive in the sense that it keeps memories and processes them. Or, also the mechanisms in his body carry themselves information in their structure; if that information were to be lost, he'd be dead. To preserve information he needs an input of free energy. Any energy does not work: you cannot live off the thermal energy in a system at thermal equilibrium - you need &quot;clean&quot; low-energy entropy.</p>
<p>This isn't true only of human beings or all living beings, but of all things we care about: ultimately it is the information in them that is precious to us.</p>

<p>yes</p>

<p>Entropy, yes. It is numerically dependent on what you define to be the macroscopic state, however. But once you agree on these few conventional choices entropy is well defined: entropy is Boltzmann's constant times the difference between the information you have about the system if you were to know the exact microstate, and the one you had if you only knew the macrostate. </p>
<p>The second law will not however necessarily hold because the Game of Life is not time-reversible (note: this is not time-reversal <em>invariance</em>. This is about the <em>possibility</em> of going backwards in time, not about it being the same as going forward). This means that microscopic information can be lost. (Example: a non-zero state can &quot;die&quot; in time leaving nothing, so entropy surely decreases).</p>
<p>If you do take a perfectly time-reversible cellular automaton (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critters_(block_cellular_automaton\)" target="_blank">Critters</a> ) then the second law exists and holds. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>Assuming the philosophy of worth part is all sound, why is free energy required to perform meaningful computation?</p>

<p>What are some meaningful macrostates that I can define for Critters, so that I could witness the second law firsthand? Would density of living cells per unit area work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that entropy can very well decrease in a closed system with a finite phase space. But it's the insanely unlikely* from a statistical point of view. So 2. Law of thermo dynamics should be seen as a statistical law. See <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincaré_recurrence_theorem" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincaré_recurrence_theorem</a></p>

<li>unlikely as in I remember some time ago some paper was published where someone calculated this time for a non-expanding classically behaving universe with a finite volume of our observable universe and I think it was on the order of 10^10^10^100 years or seconds (doesn't really matter at this point).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read (I think on Wikipedia) that eventually, given some ridiculously long amount of time after heat death, quantum fluctuations can bring about a new universe, thus implying a reversal of the second law. Is this true?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So when CMB photons get redshifted by cosmological expansion, you can definitely answer the question &quot;where does the energy go&quot; with &quot;energy is not conserved, because the metric is not time-translation invariant, period&quot;, but you can actually equally well say &quot;it becomes gravitational potential energy of the photons. The other masses in the Universe are getting farther from the photon and so its gravitational potential increases.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the GPE of <em>everything</em> is increasing in that way, isn't it? So you can equally well ask, &quot;where does the GPE come from?&quot;, and to this question you just have to say, &quot;it's being created ex nihilo by the expansion of space-time.&quot;</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During expansion, kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. When you throw a ball up, and it's rising, GPE is not being &quot;created ex nihilo by the rising of the ball&quot;, it's just that kinetic energy is being converted to GPE by the gravitational force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the expansion is accelerating, so both kinetic and potential energies are increasing.</p>
<p>edit: ah, when I said <em>everything</em> I meant the universe, not local examples like a ball being thrown up. Sorry.</p></div>		</li>
