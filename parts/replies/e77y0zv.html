I love video games in general, and i watched a street fighter competitive match(i played that game a fair bit) but i couldn't understand a single frame of that video and why people were loosing their shit at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well Rocket League is basically modified soccer rules with rocket powered cars. It's close enough to watching soccer that casual people could be interested. </p>
<p>Like, Madden tournaments don't have to change to stay relevant either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This ignores the fact that you've got years upon years of knowledge of sports and the physical capabilities of athletes to base any viewing of a sports play on, but lack that context for an e-sport. It's hard to grow up in America with access to television or with a family member who's fond of sports and <em>not</em> osmose some of that information. The average American is intimately more familiar with the workings of football or baseball than they are of even the most popular videogame.</p>
<p>Everyone has some basic idea of how fast a person can run. If you saw footage of someone running at some speed, you'd be able to tell from their own movements and how quickly they clear other objects (like painted lines on the ground) whether this person is hauling ass or jogging leisurely. You can do that because you've seen <em>tons</em> of people run, and you can run yourself. But pressing buttons with split-second timing in a precise but rapid sequence? That's something the average person could go their entire life without experiencing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It even goes beyond that, at least in some esports. I'm mostly (okay, basically <em>exclusively</em>) familiar with Starcraft Brood War. And at least in those events, you don't even <em>see</em> what the players are actually doing in the sense of seeing their hands; you just see the end result on screen. At least if you saw their hands, you could think &quot;that's really fast and I guess they're actually doing things at that speed&quot;, but it's usually hard to see that from the end result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. A lot of it comes down to with what people are familiar with. Its not fun to watch something you don’t understand. I grew up pretty much almost never playing or watching sports but played tons of video games, so consequently I can enjoy watching speedruns and esports as I can understand how they work and the skill required for them.</p>
<p>But less than a year ago I learned how to play tennis, and now I enjoy watching tennis. Now that I understand how the game works and have experienced firsthand what its like to be on the court and have great moments as well as fail miserably at a low level, I can appreciate it when its played at a professional level. Humans just like what they know.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, I don’t necessarily go out of my way to watch either, but I can appreciate them when I do see them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I've been playing this *MMORPG called Dofus for 10+ years and I catch myself sometimes not understanding at all what's happening. You need to have a huge knowledge of the game you're watching to truly enjoy it. My only exception was competitive LOL for me. Other than that, yeah it can get wild. </p></div>		</li>
