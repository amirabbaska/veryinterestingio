			<div class="markdown"><p>It can do this because what it's sending is very simple. For a remote, when you press a button it starts an oscillator and then modulates (turns off and on at specific times) a pattern on it, the pattern matches the button pushed and repeats continuously until the button is released. Any illusion that certain buttons trigger only pulse and certain buttons (FF) are continuous is maintained by the receiver. This means that the loss of a fragment, even if it's the first transmission is inconsequential. </p>
<p>Think of it like a man shouting:</p>
<p>Ve<br />
Dave<br />
Dave<br />
Dave<br />
Dav<br />
Ve<br />
Dave<br />
Dave<br />
Dave<br />
Da  </p>
<p>Dave is only listening for his own name, so fragments are ignored, and he is a patient man so doesn't get upset by the nagging. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's what happens if the remote isn't calibrated to your TV. It's yelling Dave repeatedly, but the TV is listening for Martin, so doesn't do anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the remote had a microcontroller in it, even the tiniest of the microcontrollers can &quot;boot&quot; in microseconds, which leaves you plenty of time to do anything such as reading the state of the buttons, since your finger tipically can't switch the button state (pushing them) faster than tens of milliseconds. </p></div>		</li>
