			<div class="markdown"><p>The events capable of producing these heavy elements tend to be pretty violent, right? So, hypothetically speaking, could an atom of 120 be created and then immediately be ejected from the system at relativistic speeds? And if so, would this make the atom appear to last longer before decaying to someone watching from an external reference frame?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it would appear to live longer to an outside observer. But it would still decay insanely fast if it was traveling at 99% the speed of light. Going at 99.0c dilates time by a factor of about 7. The half-life of element 118 is 0.89 milliseconds. So we would observe 6.23 milliseconds for the half life in our frame. Still not good enough to observe anything. The half lives of elements 119 and 120 are probably even shorter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually no, the way to produce superheavy elements is currently sub-barrier fusion reactions. This is fairly low energy fusion.</p>
<p>If you go above the Coulomb barrier, the probability of fusion gets much higher, but then you also have subsequent evaporation of particles from the fusion residue. If you're trying to go as heavy as possible, you don't want any particles boiling off.</p>
<p>The particles in the beam are relativistic but not <em>that</em> relativistic. Relativistic heavy ion collisions like the ones done at RHIC and LHC are fast enough to completely break apart nuclei into quark-gluon plasma. There's no chance of producing a superheavy nucleus there.</p></div>		</li>
