			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the gravitational gradients are higher for smaller radius event horizons (lower mass black holes) before crossing the event horizon. The high gradients are the cause of 'spaghettification', or the ripping apart of objects entering a black hole. Spaghettification happens with all black holes, but at different points relative to the event horizon, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon#Interacting_with_an_event_horizon" target="_blank">for supermassive black holes it doesn't happen until <em>after</em> you cross the event horizon</a> (in which case you're not getting out anyway).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In realistic stellar black holes, spaghettification occurs early: tidal forces tear materials apart well before the event horizon. However, in supermassive black holes, which are found in centers of galaxies, spaghettification occurs inside the event horizon. A human astronaut would survive the fall through an event horizon only in a black hole with a mass of approximately 10,000 solar masses or greater.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, smaller black holes are much denser, so they distord spacetime locally a lot more.</p>
<p>The swarzschild radius scales linear with mass - twice the mass, twice the radius. Contrast that to normal matter, where twice the radius=8 times mass. (Stars are more complicated to to compression, temperature). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it with this analogy- if you turn the earth into a black hole, and you were to hover above this new black hole at the same distance as the center of the earth is to the surface, you would feel the same exact gravitational pull you would if you were standing on the surface of the earth. This is because the mass is the same. </p>
<p>Now imagine if you turn a ball with a 1 meter diameter and a 1kg mass into a black hole and then stand where the ball's outer edge would have been. You feel almost no gravity from the black hole because at that distance the pull of gravity is the exact same as a the ball. </p>
<p>Now you reach forward 1 meter with your arm and &quot;touch&quot; the event horizon with your fingertips. In the span of 1 meter the force of gravity felt by your arm goes from &quot;almost zero&quot; at your shoulder to &quot;light can't escape&quot; at your fingertips.</p>
<p>If you wanted to use this 1kg mass black hole as a slingshot you have to calculate it so that you get close enough to be slingshotted by it but far enough that it won't tear parts of you off. You have to work with nanometers here. But if you add mass and the black hole is no longer 1kg but say the mass of Mt. Everest, you suddenly have way more leeway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. Just one question about black holes, since we all love black holes. I thought they were incredibly hot and messy systems, with the accretion disk being a very hot and tumultuous region circling the event horizon. In my mind, a black hole is anything but a cold quiet object. Is that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only the accretion disk, but the relativistic jets as well (if applicable). The jets are so powerful that they can stretch out into space for thousands or hundreds of thousands of light years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stuff falling into the black hole is hot, but black holes themselves are generally quite cold and quiescent. When stuff falls into a black hole, it accelerates on its way down the gravity well. It would stay cool if it just went straight in, (like a single hapless astronaut) but falling matter usually has enough angular momentum (sideways velocity) to miss the hole and start going around, and that's when it usually runs into other matter on the way in or slingshotting out. Those collisions heat the matter and tend to circularize the orbit, which is how an accretion disk forms. These collisions at relativistic speeds, usually between clouds of gas, are what heat it those millions of degrees, enough to glow in x-rays, and the relativistic cloud of swirling plasma can form magnetic fields strong enough to generate those polar jets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my idea as well, so a slingshot maneuver around an event horizon would involve going through the accretion disk right? Sailing right through a million degree cloud of insanity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on whether there's stuff falling into the black hole. An isolated black hole with nothing falling into it wouldn't have the accretion disk or jets.</p></div>		</li>
