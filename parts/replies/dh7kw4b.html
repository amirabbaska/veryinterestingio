<p>I also rest mine on the bottom and I've been breathing through my mouth forever. I don't have sinus issues other than lots of boogers, maybe that's why?</p>
<p>Either way glad I'm not the only one heh. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely far better for you to breathe through your nose; the nose filters, warms, and moistens the air before it reaches your lungs, and it also contains some nerves that are part of a feedback circuit that helps regulate the relationship between your breathing and your emotional state; it's also far better for your dental health, as mouthbreathing is a major cause of gingivitis. If you can, make every effort to breathe through your nose. I've been trying for decades, but the allergies always knock me down. You may have better luck!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do have sinus issues, and so I've breathed primarily through my mouth for most of my life, so that might play a part, but I know plenty of people who rest their tongues at the bottom.</p>

<p>That's the long and the short of it. Having your tongue at the bottom of your mouth is poor posture that makes it harder to breath through your nose and causes mouthbreathing. This in turn lengthens your philtrum and deforms your face in a way that makes causes sinus issues and makes it almost impossible to nose-breath, ensuring future mouthbreathing in a vicious cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting; I know for certain that allergies are the initial cause of my sinus issues, but if it's being exacerbated by mouthbreathing, I'd love to know more. Know any good links/search terms for more info?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It could also just as easily be the case that the sinus issues are the cause of the mouthbreathing. You can start at any point of the cycle really, but wherever you start the vicious cycle goes on and on unless you get some treatment to stop it. If it's not too bad you can treat it yourself by keeping your mouth closed and forcing yourself to breath through your nose, although in your case your sinus issues might make that hard/impossible to do.</p>
<p>For me just searching &quot;mouth breathing&quot; or &quot;correct tongue posture&quot; yields informative results right at the top. I'm not sure how good this source is but you'll find the info it gives corroborated by basically every other result you'll find(including those cited by Wikipedia for what it's worth): <a href="http://www.myfaceology.com/2012/02/mouth-breathing-and-how-it-affects-your-health/" target="_blank">http://www.myfaceology.com/2012/02/mouth-breathing-and-how-it-affects-your-health/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father's a dentist and I've researched this a lot. If you're physically able to keep your mouth closed and rest the tongue at the top of your mouth(some aren't due to facial deformation, e.g recessed chin), you really should start doing so. Mouthbreathing has terrible effects on your health and facial(especially dental development). Here's some idea of the difference it can make:</p>

<p>And here's the difference between poor and good tongue posture(notice the vertical vs forward growth of the face):</p>
