			<div class="markdown"><p>generally you should be able to cough it all out barring various brain and body problems but the water should go away if it's a tiny enough amount. problem is, even if the water is absolutely sterile, the routes it can take have bacteria (nose, mouth), so you might end up with a lung infection, coughing, extra mucus production, problems breathing, etc depending on how bad it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember once I was taking a shower and, half asleep, accidentally breathed some of the water while rinsing my face. I coughed and coughed but couldn't seem to get it all out. It was uncomfortable all day. Then I started coughing more, having coughing fits. Then I was feeling winded more and more easily, until even short distances would leave me feeling out of breath.</p>
<p>Eventually went to a doctor and was diagnosed with bronchitis. They gave me medicine that cleared it up. Maybe it was all a coincidence, but I have to wonder if bacteria from the water I breathed caused it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the problems would also be there in the case of aspiration of complete sterile drinking water.</p>
<p>The osmotic pressure simply is different, and that irritates the mucosa.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They just slowly absorb the water.</p>
<p>Otherwise breathing in fog would be deadly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about humid air, or the mist that sprays from humidifier?
When you're breathing in extremely humid air at saunas or spas, do they pool in your lungs as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lungs are already covered in fluid/mucus that's mostly water.</p>
<p>Ignoring the risk of infection through aspiration, largish amounts of water like a full gulp would simply irritate the inner lining of the lung through osmotic pressure. So until the water is mixed with the mucus it'll irritate the lungs.</p>
<p>In addition the lungs are pretty good at absorbing excess water.</p>
<p>That's why breathing in fog, or while inhaling for medical reasons doesn't harm you.</p></div>		</li>
