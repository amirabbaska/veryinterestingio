<p>They want you to sign up for something like a site that hosts cam girls and asks you to pay for shows</p>

<p>The most interesting time I ever came across this, the scammer actually was a cam girl on a legit cam site. She even gave me her real cam girl alias where I was supposed to buy a show because she &quot;had to sell so many shows and would hook up with me in return.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very unlikely. As soon as you see a large charge on your credit card you'd issue a chargeback, the credit card company would remove the charge, and after a couple times, they'd remove the companies ability to use their service.</p>
<p>It'd be much more effective to charge a smaller amount you're less likely to fight.</p></div>		</li>
