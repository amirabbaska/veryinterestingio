<p>You taught me something, too, that I wanna share with you. </p>
<p>I think that what makes good poetry good, or good anything into good anything, is the emotion you carry into it. I used to think that it was a function of math, like &quot;there is a perfect song; it just hasn't been written&quot; would have been something I would have agreed with, but you just taught me there is no perfect. Fuck I don't know how to explain this..</p>
<p>It's almost like there are &quot;spirits&quot;, or &quot;muses&quot; that are universal but not an immediately recallable part of ourselves; i.e, we can't &quot;summon&quot; them. Like yours would be named &quot;grateful sadness&quot;, and it's a very good and rare one. It's like we let things speak through us, but not just like we're possessed or anything, because it doesn't take over, it only colors our perceptions and informs our minds where we'd like to go next. Maybe this is where the idea of gods comes from. </p>
<p>And I'm rambling now.. Thank you, /u/FrancoManiac. Even if I sound crazy, you taught me something very freeing today. </p>
<p>Also if you remind me in two days I will buy you gold. I don't have any money at the moment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you were moved by it, and that you had some revelation through it. I'm afraid I'm still a bit out of sorts over it all to fully digest your comment, but I've favorited it and will return to it soon. </p>
<p>On another note, I used to e a housekeeper at a hotel. Godspeed, frontdeskman, godspeed.</p></div>		</li>
