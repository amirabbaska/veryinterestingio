<p>I think recently there has been photos of the event horizon of the massive black hole in the center of our galaxy, but that was with a very powerful telescope and a team who are specifically trying to catch the event horizon.</p>

<p>Do you have an image available? Did some searching but was unable to find it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been an effort to take better pictures of Sgr A*, but I'm not sure what the poster is referring to. I know of efforts like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Pointing_X-ray_Eyes_at_our_Resident_Supermassive_Black_Hole.jpg/1024px-Pointing_X-ray_Eyes_at_our_Resident_Supermassive_Black_Hole.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> which show an event, but you can't exactly 'take a picture' of an event horizon, as by definition it doesn't emit light. If you want to see a black hole, <a href="http://blenderartists.org/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=355165&amp;d=1421058463" target="_blank">the one from Interstellar</a> is actually quite good. It shows the accretion disk, along with the gravitational lensing around the hole. There were lots of issues regarding black holes and relativity in that movie but the image itself is good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It forms and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disc" target="_blank">accretion disk</a>. The black whole in itself doesn't have more mass (actually it's much less) than the star from whose core it originated (if that's how it formed). But since there is quite a lot of matter around, there will be friction. Friction means that orbiting matter slows down and eventually falls into the black whole. The energy lost through friction is quite significant. Up to 30% of the matter falling in can be converted into energy this way. That's the reason why quasars are bright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Matter is being sucked in. Any matter that isn't in the process of being eaten (decaying orbit) is simply orbiting or passing by. Due to the fact that black holes have tons of gravity, and spin,  matter doesn't fall in a straight line toward the black hole's center, but in a curve, which results in a disk. Some matter is flung parallel to it's axis of spin, which creates quasars and blazars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I had read somewhere fairly recently that black holes &quot;sucking&quot; things up was more of a myth. Any idea where that might've originated?</p></div>		</li>
