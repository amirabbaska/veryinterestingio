			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never experienced this either. And have had two sleep studies, one when I was a teen and one about six years ago after I quit drinking. There may not be any problem with your sleep cycle. Too many current thoughts forget our biological memory. A full sleep cycle is approximately ninety minutes. Getting full uninterrupted cycles is far more important than meeting this arbitrary number of eight hours a night. We are not wired to be sedentary for extended periods. I've found I have more energy when I spend less time in bed. Especially when I'm not sleeping/tired. But everyone has a different circadian rhythm. Spend time to nail yours down, it's worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. It is also why some people experience sleep paralysis - they may wake up in the middle of the night, fully consious but unable to move. Should be a rather horrifying experience</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forget where i read this, but every time sleep paralysis comes up, i say it.</p>
<p>You're supposed to hold your breath. This causes your brain to send emergency signals to wake you up to try and clear your airways. (i.e. cough)</p>
<p>Ive never experienced sleep paralysis, but i hope someone can free themselves from it using this way to confirm it, and im not just going around spouting useless nonsense.</p>
<p>E: I love hearing everyone's experiences, keep them coming, from what I can gather so far is for some the &quot;emergency theory&quot; works in some form or another. Everyone is of course different, and some people have sheer will power I could only hope to emulate. I tried doing some research online, and as someone said below not much research has been done on this, so hopefully this helps someone out.</p>
<p>E2: As u/ChronicPainGalore (and i think someone else but i didnt go check, sorry other person!) said, sleeping on your stomach may prevent it from happening, i myself normally sleep on my side or stomach, so that could explain why i havent experienced it. Maybe ill try and sleep on my back only tonight. Also more reports on focusing on a body part to move it, and then that causing them to wake up.</p>
<p>A shout out to those who experience it and are willing to test this and report back, hallucinations can be scary of course, but i dont think your body will willingly suffocate itself, thats the point, to cause panic and awaken yourself quickly. (DISCLAIMER: In your twilight state, dont die plz :D)</p>
<p>Another user pointed out below (i tried to find you, but i didnt realized the conversation this spawned which is awesome btw) being in sleep paralysis is like being in a dream state. So by realizing whats happening, you may have a better chance of awakening then panicing and holding your breath. </p>
<p>Silver lining for those who have it on the regular, i did some reading on lucid dreaming, and sleep paralysis is like a failed attempt at lucid dreaming (im paraphrasing loosely, please double check me before dream flying) so youre alot closer to awesome dreams then i am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, no one is gonna believe me but I actually love the sleep paralysis episodes. The adrenaline rush that you get once it's over is totally worth it and after the first few times, you can actually realize that you are in the middle of an episode and control how long it lasts (lucid dreaming?). At least that's how I feel about them.</p>
<p>Also iirc you only get them if you sleep on your back and will almost never get them if you are sleeping on your sides. I almost always sleep on my sides so whenever I sleep on my back, comfortably, I usually get an episode of sleep paralysis. </p>
<p>Do I need help? I can't be the only one who likes them? Please tell me that my software is not broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you mean.  I actually can (somewhat reliably) bring it on purposely.  I have this game I play with myself when I'm trying to fall asleep.  I start off telling myself to wiggle my finger.  Then I try to separate my mind from my finger.  The point where I tell my finger to move and my brain thinks my finger moved but I can feel that it didn't is the point I know I'm asleep.  It sounds really bizarre and trippy trying to explain, but is actually one of my favorite ways to go to sleep if I'm having trouble sleeping (like counting sheep, but not).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've only had one sleep paralysis event in my lifetime but I didn't find it terrifying. It was definitely melancholic and I felt like something wasn't quite right. It probably helped I had a roommate in the bed above me, I remember I kept trying to say &quot;hey&quot; to him but couldn't get anything more than my breath out. It was on my mind the whole next day tho, because I had some weird ass hallucinations during it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I quite enjoy them as well. It can be a bit disconcerting when it starts for 30 - 69 seconds but after that I quite like the feeling. My favourite is when it’s right on the edge of coming back when sensation is there but everything feels incredibly heavy. </p></div>		</li>
