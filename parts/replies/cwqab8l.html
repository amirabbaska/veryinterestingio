At the same time, it doesn't make the person that destroys that lock to take what is inside any less of a criminal. If I leave my car locked with the windows down, that's no excuse for someone to loot the contents just because it is easy.</p>

If you bought a Ford and looted it through an open window, would you expect to be sued by Ford, Or have criminal circumvention charges leveled against you?</p></div>		</li>
