			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer.  I can shed a bit more light on DC- electrons inside a metal are modeled as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_gas" target="_blank">fermi gas</a> and are essentially free to move.  In fact that's one of the defining properties of metals, that electrons inside them can move virtually freely aside from resistance.  That means that a DC current is indeed very uniform.</p>
<p>In non-metals it's waaaay more complex.  For instance graphite is an anisotropic conductor: electrons can move more freely in the planes of carbon than between them.  Obviously, electricity concentrates in those planes.</p>
<p>This also applies to metals, actually- only on a much larger scale.  Metals are almost all polycrystalline, and those crystals (typically on the scale of microns, but some can be millimeters wide) are themselves weakly anisotropic due to the directionality of the crystals.  You can take advantage of that by controlling the direction, size and other properties of the crystals.  Usually by squishing the metal in a certain direction.  Wires, for instance, are drawn through a die, which stretches the crystals to be very long in the direction of the wire and small in its cross section.  That makes them both <em>much</em> stronger (2-4x, depending on the metal!) and more conductive.  Electricity will have a slight preference for certain parts of the crystals, and will follow complex paths to get to its &quot;favorite&quot; spots.</p>
<p>More exotic conductors have much sharper paths that electricity follows.  Type II superconductors are the best example.  In fact- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:YBCO_vortices.jpg" target="_blank">here's a picture</a>!  That's YCBO, a cuprate superconductor.  Cuprate superconductors are the closest known to ideal superconductors, in many ways.  Electricity in YCBO flows <em>only</em> inside the cuprous planes of the crystal structure.  The superconductivity means that virtually no electricity flows through any other part of the material.  In fact, as the material starts to superconduct, electricity forms that swiss-cheese structure you see in the picture- unconducting parts are shunted together into vortices, while the electricity flows in between them.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it is quite uniform. Measuring the distribution will be quite hard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its very hard to measure it below the micron-nanometer scale.  For that you'd need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQUID" target="_blank">SQUID</a>s (used to take the picture above)- <em>ultra</em> sensitive magnetic field detectors.  You can also use tunneling microscopes to image the electron distribution to resolutions much smaller than individual atoms, but that only works for thin films.  Like, only a few atoms thick.</p>
<p>Above the nanometer scale (resolutions above a couple hundred atoms), you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoRVEw5gL8c" target="_blank">use an electron microscope</a>!  (Aside- I <em>love</em> how enchanted Ben sounds in the beginning!)  More electricity[1] in a region will result in a brighter spot on the image.  Basically it'll make the metal more reflective to electrons.  The same applies to capacitors- a charged capacitor will look brighter than an uncharged one, and you'll be able to see where the charge is.</p>
<p>[1]: really, a higher voltage.  You can't directly see the flow, but you can infer it from the voltage.  Negative voltage = reflects electrons, as like charges repel.  Positive voltage = dark spot, as it'll suck up electrons.  High voltages will usually mean bigger flows of electricity, but you can only be sure if you know the resistance of the materials.  Also note that electron microscopes will very quickly destroy electronics.  An electron microscope works by shooting very high voltage electricity onto the area you're looking at, building up a strong static charge at 10,000+ volts.  Meanwhile electric circuits are very carefully built to isolate and confine electricity, and most components can be destroyed by 2-3 volts in the wrong direction.  So... that doesn't go well.</p>
<p>The buildup of static charge actually makes it very hard to image nonconductive materials.  They build up a static charge rapidly, and then just reflect every electron shot at them, and the image looks like a big bright static-y light.  To avoid this, nonconductive specimens are coated in a super-thin conductive layer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be worthwhile to note that electrons don't actually move that far or that fast in an electrical distribution system. It is the electrical potential that moves at the speed of light. Think of a long tube filled with balls. If you push another ball into one end, a ball falls out the far end &quot;instantly&quot;, but the balls themselves didn't move very far at all. With an AC system, the electrons wiggle back and forth a short distance at 50 or 60 Hz. As a percentage of the electrons in an alternator, very few actually leave the alternator at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True!  Electrons also follow a somewhat random walk and can even have a probabilistic distribution in some cases!  I forgot to mention electron scattering above- it's somewhat related to drift velocity (the actual speed of electrons) and can really impact how electricity flows in materials.  </p>
<p>Aluminum has really high electron scattering- it used to be used for interconnections in CPUs, but has been replaced by copper.  Aluminum was really vulnerable to electromigration due to electron scattering, which would degrade it over time.  Copper is 10x more resistant, but scattering still means that the thinnest copper wires have a MUCH higher than expected resistance.  The newest generation of Intel processors use cobalt wires for the very thinnest parts (barrier layers) specifically to fight this.  Ruthenium may be necessary in the future- it has even lower scattering.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that for extremely thin interfaces (say, a copper film between two ruthenium contacts), spots where the interface is thinner actually have <em>higher</em> resistance!  Electricity will intentionally take the longer path just to avoid them.  Although, at that scale you also get into tunneling and ballistic transport, which are a whole other can of bears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about embedding NVs in the conductors as magnetic field sensors? (NV =nano diamonds from which a carbon atom had been knocked out and replaced with a Nitrogen Vacancy). There is a decent chance nano diamonds can withstand being mixed with molten copper. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In AC signals it is predominantly on the edge of the wire....DC. I think it is quite uniform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would that explain why resistance to AC is different than to DC? - as surface area goes up directly with radius but cross-sectional area varies with radius squared?</p></div>		</li>
