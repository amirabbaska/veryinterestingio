			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats an excellent explanation of how the battery functions. I really appreciate when people are able to explain science/engineering simply and succinctly.  I'm in the middle of a bit of a financial rough patch, otherwise I would definitely give you some gold. This expression of appreciation will have to suffice for now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we reverse this process then to recharge the battery? Your explanation makes it sound like we can reverse rusting. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically, oxygen wants to hang out with metal and make a rust particle. Metal has some electrons tagging along with it, and so does oxygen, and electrons don't want to be in an electromagnetic sausage fest. The metal sends off its electrons and parties all day with the oxygen (Releasing a lot of power as they go) before they get a mad hangover and turn into rust. The particle of rust already gave out all its power, so it really doesn't have much energy right now.</p>
<p>The electrons have to go somewhere, and just across the other side of a battery is a particle of rust. The metal and oxygen have been partying for two straight days now, and they want some electrons to come help clean up. The metal takes up the electrons, so oxygen splits with her own electrons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3BQSKAZOW0" target="_blank">So we can totally turn rust back into metal. Here's a neat video of it happening</a></p>
<p>That process is us adding our own power into a solution full of salt. Both our electrodes are copper, so the one on the right is rusting, and the one on the left is getting bigger.</p>
<p>There are neat tables you can use to figure out the right combos of metals, because you want a metal that's a kickass reactive rusting machine paired with a metal that's cool and collected. A reactive metal, like lithium, will be super reactive and powerful in metal, and super weak like rust. A calm and collected metal, like silver, will be pretty badass and electron-stealing when it's rusted.</p></div>		</li>
