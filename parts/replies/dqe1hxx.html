If you folded it based on which side was longer, then you'd end up with a stack of single atoms that you'd have to repeatedly split in half to keep going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.windows2universe.org/physical_science/physics/atom_particle/atomic_nucleus.html" target="_blank">An atom is 0.1 nanometers.</a></p>
<p>If you double that 103 times, you get 0.1 nanometers * 2^103 = 1.01412048 × 10^30 nanometers, or 1.01412048 × 10^18 kilometers. So your paper would have to be a quintillion km across to fold 103 times and avoid splitting the atom to fold again. (Technically, this is just dividing the paper in half and stacking the halves.)</p></div>		</li>
