			<div class="markdown"><p>Blimey, I had no idea that Electricity and Magnetism were of the same &quot;property&quot; so to speak. Pliny the elder knew far more of this phenomenon than me, and I like to think I had a reasonably sophisticated physics education in my school years. </p>
<p>The ancients were an incredibly intelligent people in many ways, and I often forget how clearly we stand on the shoulders of giants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think about it, there's no reason they should be any less smart than we are now. A mere 2000 years is nothing for evolution (especially in the lack of selection). The only difference is that we have more accumulated knowledge thanks to science and partly history and other reasonably rigorous fields. Raise a child in the jungle and you are immediately back by thousands of years. A bit scary, really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the cool thing. If you had a time machine, you could take a baby from the Middle Ages and raise them in a modern society and few if anybody would know the difference and vice versa. I think it would be especially interesting to see what someone like Da Vinci would be able to do with modern knowledge </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just finished &quot;The Beginning of Infinity&quot; by David Deutsch.
While not the originator of the theory, he gives a great explanation of how memes, as defined as &quot;replicating information&quot;, undergo an evolutionary process of imperfect replication and various methods of selection similar to genes. The difference is that the process is exponentially faster for memes. This explains the information explosion of the past few centuries while remaining genetically static.</p>
<p>The meme bit is toward the end of the book. It was an interesting (if a bit long) read, be warned it gets highly technical at times, about a wide range of topics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A rainbow? A little bit of the electromagnetic spectrum? Sorry but it's the spectrum of waves, including light, radio, x ray, etc. that propagate due to periodic changes in electric and magnetic field intensity (and travel at the speed of light if you will.) </p>
