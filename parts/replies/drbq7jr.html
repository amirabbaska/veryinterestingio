			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the operative word for the OP here is &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_screening" target="_blank">high throughput</a>&quot;.  While you point out that testing is done on cells, I would like to do a bit of justice to just how quickly and efficiently these screens can be done.  You can get experimental plates with more than 3000 &quot;wells&quot; (little holes for doing experiments) in them, as well as robotic systems that can do more than 100k tests per day.  It is entirely feasible to test 10 different doses of 1,000 different potential drugs against 100 types of bacteria.</p>
<p>It's also only going to get more crazy, with microdroplet systems.  In these, your system forms a huge number of little bubbles (effectively of water in oil).  You set it up so that each bubble is a single independent experiment, and run them through fully automated systems that allow you to create, experiment on, and analyze very quickly.  The currently fastest system I know of being published claims to be able to examine 200,000 droplets... per <em>second</em>.</p>
<p>E: This does, of course, only apply to tests that can be done <em>in vitro</em>.  If you are trying to develop a drug to treat something that doesn't have an <em>in vitro</em> model system, your first step is probably going to be studying it to try to understand it well enough to make a model system.  First figure out (molecularly) what you actually want your drug to do, then try to find a compound which can do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every big pharmaceutical company own a huge library of chemicals. I worked for a company synthesizing this libraries. In one year we were making more than 10.000 new compounds, doing also nmr and mass-spec of each of them. You could imagine that over years this libraries own by companies get just bigger. The way to go is called combinatorial chemistry, in short: if you mix 100 amines and 100 aldehydes you get 10000  compounds out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One caveat not mentioned previously is that there are multiple iterations where target molecules are slowly improved, they aren’t just randomly picking what to test for the most part (though to be fair sometimes this is done). For example, if there is a molecule that shows 20% is the desired effect in the first round of broad high-throughout screening, then the next iteration will focus on slightly modified versions of this molecule to try and increase the desired effect. </p>
<p>Some initial screenings will use results from previous studies to decide which type of molecule to include rather than just throwing everything at the cells to see what works. This would be useful if you were trying to develop a cancer drug, for instance, and you see that one of your drugs tested has a decent effect on an arthritis biomarker. Then if the company wants to develop a new arthritis drug in the future, you could focus on molecules similar to the one you found in the cancer trial.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a molecular biologist, I envy chemists for their properly controlled experiments. I wouldn't call anything involving living systems &quot;properly controlled&quot;. I'm sure chemists think the same about physicists.</p></div>		</li>

Then they have to recoup that money in a very short time due to copyrights ending. It's obviously more complicated than that but you get the idea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll be honest, it's my primary field of study, so I mostly know about it from grand claims and cool videos shown in conferences.</p>
<p>The cross-contamination thing should be improvable with better isolating solvents, or perhaps multilayer droplets.  I have no idea how to change out a buffer though.  &quot;Make the experiment fast enough to not be a problem&quot; is the best I've got there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah what this guy said. They usually use something called &quot;high throughput screening&quot; to throw the chemicals at the problem, before moving onto cell and animal models: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_screening" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_screening</a></p>
<p>To elaborate on the last point: about 90% or higher of these projects that develop drugs for a specific thing will fail. Usually because they either dont work very well or work well but make some people sick.  So if your taking a new medicine to treat your athsma, that will be a successfully developed drug and one out of either hundreds or thousands of unsuccessfully developed ones. So youre not technically paying just for the one drug, but the many that went before it and didnt work out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s much higher than 90%.  On top of that, many of the drugs companies put out don’t bring in enough revenue to cover their sunk costs of the failed tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even if they do develop something useful, their target market may not be willing to use it or is a very small market. This leads to being unable to pay back all of the crippling debt they've taken to develop the drug in the first place, even after charging an arm and a leg for said drug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you see what kind of money goes into something as simple as tissue culture, it starts making a lot of sense. </p>
<p>A drug company may have sunk millions and millions into the development of one specific drugs and then only has a limited oportunity to make up their losses untill the patent expires or some other company has reverse-engineered their drug without (legally) infringing their patent. On top of that, some drugs are just a financial nightmare to produce, monoclonal antibodies (e.g. Humira) are insanely expensive..</p>
<p>It's the same when people bitch about the production cost of electronics. Just because you can build a particular device for 200$ doesn't necessarily mean you can sell it at that price and expect to make money. </p>
<p>I admit that especially in the US some drugs are clearly overpriced but not nearly to the extent that some people claim they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something else I think people don't consider is the on-going testing of drugs even after they're on the market. Companies have to prove the identity and dosage of each lot of their product through release testing. They also have to do studies to prove that it remains at an appropriate dose and that it doesn't degrade into something else over the course of it's shelf life. And what about when Karen leaves her pill bottle in her hot car, is it still okay to take the pills? Pharma companies have to do testing to answer those questions. The entire process is extremely expensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drugs don't really need to be reversed engineered. If it's on the market then the structure is known. And since there's a patent there's a process for the synthesis as well. (obviously patents leave out small details, but any Chemist etc worth their weight will be able to recreate the drug from the patent and doing guess work on how the different reactions work out.</p>
<p>I mean before NMR and stuff that used to be a lot harder, but nowadays you just test every step to see whether it worked out or not and change your procedure to fit that. And once the general synthesis steps are known, you scale that up.</p>
<p>This is how it works for small molecules. </p></div>		</li>
