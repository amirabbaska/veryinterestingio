			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe to a point. My doctor is having me do this kind of. I have to get to the bathroom and then just not move for a second, and after that I can go as normal. But the idea is to kind of train away the urgency I guess? I started having issues with it after I had my second and last kiddo. He was 11lbs and I am not the same lol. He was a c-section but the pelvic floor is basically made of wet tissue paper at this point.</p></div>		</li>
