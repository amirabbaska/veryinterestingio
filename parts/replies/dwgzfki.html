			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the footprints on the moon tidbit quite interesting. From what I understand, it’s because the particulate has not been eroded and maintains many sharp edges, so when it was compressed by a human’s boot, these edges locked in place together. <a href="https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=1028" target="_blank">This article describes in more detail</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't need to have been locked in place, because there's little-to-no erosion forces on the moon. It doesn't have weather like earth, so whatever structures are created by meteorites, or in our case, human activity, stay there until one of those forces disturbs it again.</p>
<p>Unless you're just talking about the sharpness of the detail, because the particles are coarser and wouldn't slide over each other through the effects of gravity. Then never mind. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I recently heard there is a weathering process in the moon, in which dust is electrostatically charged by the sun, and creates a &quot;levitating&quot; dust effect complete with faintly flowing arcs of dust rising pretty high into the lunar sky. </p>
<p>In that sense, the moon has a very faint and tenuous atmosphere of dust. </p>
<p>Thus... over time there's a chance that this electrostatically-levitated dust, along with constant unfiltered tiny micro-meteor bombardment of the moon, will act together to fade and erase the footprints away. </p>
<p>From what I've read, nobody really seems to know how long it will take... most seem to agree that it would probably take at least a couple of million years to erase the foot prints. </p></div>		</li>
