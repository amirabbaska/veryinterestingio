			<div class="markdown"><p>Asthma differs from anxiety and allergic reactions.</p>
<p>Anxiety is generally psychological, and doesn't effect the physical structures of your lungs (to clarify, I am not suggesting that anxiety is any less real to the patient.)</p>
<p>Allergic reactions, specifically anaphylaxis, is a swelling of the upper airway, where as asthma is lower airway. Allergic reactions can however also have some lower airway involvement, however the emergency exists with the upper airway.</p>
