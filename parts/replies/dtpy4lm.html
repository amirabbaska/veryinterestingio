<p>It’s a court-martial (or plural courts-martial). “Martial” meaning related to war, deriving from Mars, the god of war. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not been allowed to use 50 Cal rounds on people is a myth. <a href="https://www.mca-marines.org/gazette/killing-myth" target="_blank">The myth was started by a idiot who was angry that 50 Cal rounds where been shot at them and tried to pretend it was a war crime</a>. This myth has been continued by the Marine Corp to make thier guys feel like badasses (or because they just parrot info and don't check it).  </p>
<p>It looks like the idea may have come from the fact that for tactical reasons the 50 Cal spotting round on a antitank recoilless rifle was ordered not to be used on enemy personal. Saying it's illegal is easier and more effective then saying don't waste your spotting rounds dumbass.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“It is often stated, sometimes even by military trainers, that it is illegal under the Geneva Convention to use the M2 against enemy personnel since it would cause &quot;unnecessary suffering&quot;. As such, most gunners supposedly aim for enemy troops' belt buckles, since those are technically equipment and thus permissible targets. However, there is no provision of the Geneva Convention that has ever been interpreted to forbid the use of the M2 on personnel. The misconception may have arisen during the Korean or Vietnam Wars when U.S. troops were told to use their M2s only on enemy equipment due to shortages of ammunition. It is also possible that a restriction during the latter period limiting the use of the M40 recoilless rifle's .50-caliber spotting gun to equipment only, since the M40 was meant to be used against armor and firing the spotting gun at personnel would have given away the M40's position before it could be used as intended, was mistakenly believed to apply to all weapons of that caliber and given legal justification.”</p>
<p>When I was Active Duty, we where told explicitly that aside from a Sniper rifle, Ma Duces where NOT to be used on personnel with the exception of last resort. It was even listed in our ROE/SOPs. Apparently that is a myth, but, it was still taught. </p></div>		</li>
