			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is how it works in practice:</p>
<p>Chinese firms sell things to the United States and get paid in dollars. The Chinese firm then has to turn it's dollars into Renminbi to buy supplies in China, pay workers, profit, etc. The Chinese Government only allows you to exchange dollars for Renminbi at a State owned bank, at the exchange rate set by the State. This exchange rate, however, is lower than the &quot;actual&quot; (more like theoretical) value of the dollars. </p>
<p>In this way the Chinese government exchanges a less valuable currency they control, for a more valuable one. This creates a huge surplus of Dollars that the Chinese state controls. </p>
<p>Here is where it gets really interesting. The Chinese need to find something to do with those dollars. THey spread it around somewhat, but the bulk of it is used to purchase US Treasury Bonds (the debt of the American people). This is where all the talk about the Chinese owning the debt comes from.</p>
<p>What makes this funny though is that under Obama, Bonds pay only a very tiny dividend, like 1.6%. They are so low right now, that the US economy can basically sell debt to China and pay nothing on it. A huge cost to a large institution like the United States is the interest they pay on their debts. By setting Bond prices so low, we basically are getting money for free. </p>
<p>We can take advantage of this current state of affairs by selling every low paying treasury bond China will buy and using the money to invest in long term infrastructure. Basically, we can take China's money, spend it on infrastructure to make us more competitive with them economically, then pay them back without interest. We get to make valuable investments with a high rate of return using money they invested poorly. </p>
<p>TLDR: Chinese control currency through state owned banks, but use all of the excess cash to buy US treasury Bonds. We could (should) that advantage of this to invest in the future of our country and then pay it back with little to no interest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Devaluation of the Renminbi results in a lower value for it and a higher value for the dollar vis-a-vis the Renminbi. So if anything they are inflating the value of the dollar.</p>
<p>And they park their forex reserves in treasury bills because forex reserves are there to pay for imports and useful in times of economic emergency. At the same time you don't want that money to sit idle. So you put them in the most secure and liquid form of investment you can find and that is treasuries. If they had any alternative investment available to them they would use it but unfortunately they don't. No other country has as large a bond market as the US does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really underestimating just how big those interest payments are.</p>
<p>There is no reason to borrow money if you can't spend it wisely and guarantee a return better than 1.6% a year and we definitely aren't doing that.</p>
<p>The chinese only own about 1 trillion of our debt which is a large amount but we aren't putting it to good use so them and others going to end up winning in the end once the interest payments start getting larger and larger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, devaluation also causes concerns with Chinese bonds, as well as using Chinese banks. If  and I really mean if, the Chinese intentionally devalue currency, suddenly your yield for bonds is devalued and your purchase power assets in banks is devalued, as well as yield for each terms interest, which causes concerns with many foreign investors looking to invest in China. Foreign investment in banks and bonds has been struggling because of this, and the fact that there are so many &quot;bubbles&quot; in businesses and real-estate, making it one of the least stable markets in the world. If you don't want to read news all day every day on Chinese business, government, provincial news, South China Sea actions ect, do not invest, at least not now.</p>
<p>Pretty much in my perspective as well as my companies perspective, it is a very volatile market, play it right you or your company makes a ton of money, play it wrong, and you are screwed. A lot of firms in the US, EU and greater Asia refuse to really invest much in Chinese firms, the only real option currently is for manufacturing. However, I broke my own rule with Alibaba, made a decent profit, but I check the price like a hawk many times a day for any sign of erratic fluctuations. A lot of corporations are worried about Chinese liquid currency purchase power, as well as less liquid assets.</p>
<p>On a fun side note, the Big Mac Index is one of the most accurate scales of PPP or purchase power parity, which is the determination of exchange rates for different foreign currencies. When I started as a trader, my boss told me of the index ,and apparently there really has not been a better tool ever. To this day a lot of corporations use it in terms of discussing foreign asset management and investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not entirely sure if this is true, some may disagree. However, if you devalue your currency, even though it does boost economic trade from your country it can also lower the living standard of your own people because now they cant buy as much goods from other parts of the world.</p>
<p>edit: For all the responders, who I cant respond to. I'm just saying that in theory, this is what happens. Not that it necessarily does. Every move economically speaking is a trade off, higher taxes or lower taxes? Stimulate an economy during a depression, and give out huge tax breaks or dont ? Arguably, 2 totally opposing viewpoints could have very good effects dealing with the same issue as long as it is implemented well. Obamas economic policies DID work, but also so did Reagans. Just remember this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>China doesn't even want their people to buy elsewhere. They can just: </p>
<ol>
<li>shut down to foreigners</li>
<li>ignore all copyrights and copy all foreign inventions</li>
<li>make them 10 times cheaper for their own people</li>
<li>devalue currency, export super cheap</li>
<li>undercut everyone on global market =&gt; make billions</li>
<li>invest said billions into infrastructure</li>
<li>repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>So the people are happy, because there's potentially 0% unemployment, they can afford the same high-end things (smartphones, clothes,...) as foreigners, meanwhile the government  and the businesses are happy because they make a buttload of money to further invest into making their country more awesome.</p>
<p>The only downside is that if the rest of the world can actually produce something that they can't copy, their people won't be able to afford it. But the companies can probably afford to copy it pretty soon. And they can't really travel abroad.</p>
<p>In gaming terms, I'd say we all got outplayed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The things you also need to factor in are the population size, the culture,  and their work ethics. They have a massive population so even if 10's, even 100's of millions of people are poor as shit, there's still a huge amount of wealthy people. Most of the country lives in rural areas and villages as farmers and factory workers for as little as $1-$5 per day. The city folk taking advantage of these replaceable peasants are making huge coin and even paying their city workers barely living wages. The cities are full of businesses and people so there are more than enough people with money to buy from other countries.</p>
<p>The culture. Chinese consider foreign goods to be far better than local goods and will literally go broke just to get an iPhone. They do this because Chinese are incredibly self centered and want to people to look up to them and give them face. Money is the most important thing to anybody in China so showing off your money is the best way of gaining face, so therefore foreign goods are more desired. Because of the higher health standards and production standards of western countries, they trust these products more </p>
<p>Work ethic. Chinese are super talented at saving money and bargaining. They can hoard massive amounts of money while living like misers and think nothing of it. They don't work harder imo, they just work longer hours. If you visit any business in China you will see what I'm talking about. Because of their ability to save, they obviously will have more money to spend on foreign goods. Look at any tourist group in a popular destination in your country. 80% of the time they will be Chinese. </p></div>		</li>

If say Canada, where I live, started doing this, sure we'd export more goods, but as a regular citizen I'd be pissed because if I wanted to buy a car, TV, appliance, or anything not made in Canada I'd would be very expensive to do so.</p>

<p>Yes, devaluing one's currency benefits those who export since there is more demand for their goods and hurts consumers who will have to pay more to get goods from abroad. This is a strategy called Export-Oriented Industrialization, which despite criticisms has been shown to be very effective in the industrialization of the four Asian Tigers, which might include a currency devaluation to kickstart local manufacturing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Canada</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Canada is an industrialized economy and thus has more imports than exports and will benefit less if it focused on exports by devaluing its dollar since it has less comparative advantage in manufacturing goods than developing countries</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the long term gain China hopes to achieve by doing this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through EOI and currency devaluation China wants to exploit its comparative advantage in manufacturing to become more industrialized.</p>
<p>Keep in mind currency devaluation is not a long-term strategy since you want to transition eventually to a consumer based economy and if you looked at the exchange rates, China has increased not decreased the Yuan since the early 2000s in order to ease this transition. The recent fluctuations are because of the instability of the health of its economy instead of a long-term strategy to get more exports and reduce its buying power</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

<p>Yes, but as the world's largest manufacturing economy they don't really need to import much in the way of finished goods beyond luxury items. Within that microcosm of the Chinese currency there's a booming middle class that can afford a standard of living fairly good by global standards. Plus, for stuff that can't be source domestically such as some raw materials (which are mostly coming from developing nations with weaker currencies economies than china anyway) the Chinese government can use some of the money made with their export surplus to subsidize things, particularly important sectors like energy.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That international companies from all over the world place huge amounts of capital investment into the country and build their factories in china driving enormous economic growth. In the long term as wages rise, both globally and in China companies will be inclined to keep those jobs in China where the manufacturing infrastructure is sophisticated and robust.</p>
<p>Companies could try to move their manufacturing back to the US at that point, but aside from the feels of seeing &quot;made in america&quot; stamped on the product it would wouldn't make much economic sense to pour billions of dollars into new infrastructure here when workers in either country cost similar amounts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right but that doesn't answer the question.</p>
<p>Chinese yuan is managed currency. That means the Chinese central bank buys and sells the yuan, as necessary, to keep the values near what it considers to be a beneficial level to China.</p>
<p>About 20 years ago that meant keeping its value low against the natural tendencies of a wealthy country's currency to appreciate. However, this trend has reversed in the recent years as political instability in China has caused people to transfer a large amount of wealth out and the currency had naturally depreciated. The Chinese central bank recently has been trying to keep the value of the yuan high against the tide of money flowing out.</p>
<p>When Donald Trump says that China has been keeping its currency too low, that information is at least a few years out of date.</p>
<p>There are a lot of costs to manipulating a currency which is why economists generally advise against it.</p></div>		</li>
