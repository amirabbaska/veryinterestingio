			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also add that some of the above either the entire art is or modifications are for sport only. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>In BJJ, guard is an advantageous position, because there are a lot of submissions when you have someone in guard, especially when a gi is worn. </p>
<p>In MMA, it's somewhat neutral, as the person in guard has striking advantage and the person that has guard has submission advantage.</p>
<p>On &quot;the street&quot;, one would guess whoever has guard (assuming everyone is of equal skill) has disadvantage, because they're laying on their back, exposing themselves to attacks from unknown assailants other than whoever is in their guard. They also leave their groin area vulnerable to whomever is in their guard. </p></div>		</li>

<p>While you don't want to end up on your back in the street, a closed guard where you break the persons posture down with your legs, hold their head and trape on of their arms isn't the end of the world, and gives you some good options for escape. </p>
<p>You won't ever 'pull guard' (as they call it in the sport) in the street but if you are knocked and the guy swarms you, it is a slightly better defensive position. If you can get there, you can make space, if you can make space you can get up and run. </p>
<p>The groin comment is weird though. Your groin is pretty safe in guard.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>In BJJ, guard is an advantageous position,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To nitpick:  It's not, actually.</p>
<p>It's not an automatic disadvantageous position like it is in wrestling, but it is merely neutral.  If you take down an opponent and end up in their guard, you still get takedown points.  If you pull guard, you get no points.</p>
<p>Whether it is advantageous or disadvantageous is only a matter of whether the person on the bottom has practiced attacking from that position better than the person on top has practiced defending and passing.</p>
<p>A BJJ practitioner, in a BJJ match, will very often pull guard against someone with a wrestling background because wrestlers have spent  a very long time practicing takedowns and less time practicing what to do from guard position, simply because the wrestling match would be over at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be mentioned that judo is an offshoot of jiujitsu and at the time that it came to Brazil the sport was like 20 years old, so the differences were largely philosophical. It wasn't a printing mistake..it's what people called it. They called it &quot;Kano Jiujitsu&quot;. It was later that it was clarified that Kano himself called the sport Judo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just another bit: Judo means &quot;gentle way&quot;. Which kinda hints at the whole &quot;no kicks and punches&quot;-thing. Getting thrown through the air by the force of your own movement and planting into the ground can be pretty intense nevertheless though (source: did ~9-10 years of Judo up to the brown belt).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One small adjustment - Aikido is <strong>not</strong> a tournament art. The founder expressly forbid competition of any form. These days, only one branch of it (Tomiki style) has any competitions at all - and there are dozens of different branches, so that's really saying something. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aikido is not the &quot; Touranment Form&quot; of aikijujutsu.</p>
<p>Aikido in its purest form is a distillation of Samurai jujutsu with all the attacks and elements of competition removed and a greater emphasis added to controlling your opponent's &quot;ki&quot; without doing your opponent any harm. </p>
<p>Incidentally, Kano sensei the creator of Judo and Ueshiba sensei, the creator of Aikido were contemporaries and had great respect for one another. </p></div>		</li>
