Oregon, for example, has higher naturally occurring lithium levels in its aquifers in some places, and those places have lower murder rates. A kiss of lithium would be largely beneficial worldwide in the water supply, for the most part.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, off the top of my head he was looking at urine and was using lithium as an independent variable. It's one of the cases in experimental psychology that is often taught to show how useful animal research can be and how easily the brain can be affected by a few molecules of a certain compound/element. Through his research, the lethal dose was also examined and those results are still followed to this day.</p></div>		</li>
