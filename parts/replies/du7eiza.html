<p>Withdrawal from a chemical causes the opposite of the chemical's effect, so when you don't drink coffee after getting addicted, the blood flow in the head increases, causing higher pressure, which leads to pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of curiosity, does this get 'fixed' by not taking in further caffeeine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a thing called &quot;Homeostasis&quot; and it basically means your body will do everything it can to keep things &quot;normal&quot;.</p>
<p>Picture two people pushing one another with the same force. They stay still, this is &quot;Stasis&quot;. If one person suddenly stops pushing, then the other staggers forward for a moment before they can compensate.</p>
<p>Apply this to something like a painkiller. It numbs your nerves so you don't feel anything, and your brain doesn't like this so it makes your nerves more and more sensitive. This is why people tend to take more and more as time goes on to get the same effect.</p>
<p>If you suddenly stop taking those painkillers, your brain 'stumbles forward' and now you're left with these super sensitive nerves and your whole body hurts. That's withdrawal.</p>
<p>Now the homeostasis starts working the other way, slowly putting those nerves back to their old settings, but it does take time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PhD in neuroimaging here. Brain entropy is at best a questionable mathematical construction. It comes from using the Shannon entropy calculations on resting fMRI data. fMRI signals, of course, are several degrees removed from actual neural firing, with poor spatial and temporal resolution. So this measure of brain entropy is quite far from any sort of actual measurement of anything the brain is really doing.  </p>
<p>In this paper, they look at the effects of caffeine. Caffeine is well known to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI activation. Whatever &quot;brain entropy&quot; changes they claim to have seen are likely just a consequence of larger observed fMRI changes, not related in any way to the cognitive effects of caffeine.</p></div>		</li>
