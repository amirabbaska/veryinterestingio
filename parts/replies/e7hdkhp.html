			<div class="markdown"><p>I just looked this up. Your fall was probably hard enough to damage the bone, but not hard enough to fracture it. The cells work to repair the damage, and oftentimes form a hard layer over the injury to protect it. You’ll notice this is a common thing on fighters. It’s really nothing to worry about. If you’re really concerned about how it looks, you can always see a surgeon to see if it can be removed, but then you’ll lose the potential cool story of how you rescued nuns when their bus crashed!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It blows my mind that our cells know when to stop at a certain overall shape/size, then 'pad' it if the bone is stressed or broken, and then to not grow back excessively if the extra 'padded' parts like Spurs are ground off mechanically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bone can be injured without fracturing. You end up with scar tissue on the bone, causing a permanent lump. <a href="http://www.scifighting.com/2014/09/05/33013/goose-eggs-gone-bad-avoid-permanent-head-lumps/" target="_blank">This article</a> talks about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this same thing. I fell off a bike when I was twelve and got a concussion and minor skull fracture on the back of my head. My head is permanently shaped differently now in that place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too! I hit my forehead hard on a post and got a goose egg, and ever since I have always been able to feel a dent line running down my forehead. Can't see anything with the skin but with my fingertip or nail it's definitely there. </p></div>		</li>
