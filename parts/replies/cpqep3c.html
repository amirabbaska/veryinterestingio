			<div class="markdown"><p>Followup question: am I right that, if nobody had a cold when they went up, and there wasn't residue from some previous sneeze for them to pick up, they couldn't catch a cold once in space?  If nobody had one, there'd be nobody to catch it from, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pathogens can't come from no where, so if no one going to space had any pathogens on them, and the equipment didn't either they could not become sick from infection, while in space.</p>
<p>That said this will never happen, because that level of sterilization would almost defiantly kill the astronauts, if we assume it is possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if this was repeated somewhere else. In Colonel Chris Hadfield's book he also talks about a period of time where all the astronauts are kept in quarantine before they launch. I forget the exact time period, but it's something like 1 or 2 weeks. It's possible to be exposed to a cold that could be incubating for several days, but doesn't manifest until after you've launched. Putting the astronauts in quarantine is a way to minimize possible contamination pre-launch.</p></div>		</li>

This <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23107825" target="_blank">Cytokine</a> article from 2013 (published by scientists with the Immunology Laboratory for the Johnson Space Center) discusses elevation of plasma cytokines in relation to shedding of herpes viruses in astronauts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shingles is a good example.  If you've had chicken pox, the virus can remain dormant for decades inside you after you've recovered, but if you have an outbreak of shingles (caused by the chicken pox virus) you become infectious again and anyone who hasn't had chicken pox around you can potentially catch it from you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the spirit of OP's question is this: &quot;For extended missions, let's say a group of astronauts go up and have no cold for the first month. Do they ever develop a cold after that first month even though they haven't docked with any other vessels since they went up?&quot;</p>
<p>The current answers imply that no, this shouldn't happen. The only way to get a cold is to bring one with you, and if you brought one with you then you would be sick within the first week (I say this because I assume the incubation time for all common infections is a week or less). </p></div>		</li>

<p>CAPCOM Number 1 (Deke Slayton): Okay. I think you ought to clearly understand there is absolutely no experience at all with landing without the helmet on.</p>
<p>SCHIRRA: And there no experience with the helmet either on that one.</p>
<p>CAPCOM: That one we've got a lot of experience with, yes.</p>
<p>SCHIRRA: If we had an open visor, I might go along with that.</p>
<p>CAPCOM: Okay. I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we haven't got them on. I think you're too late now to do much about it.</p>
<p>SCHIRRA: That's affirmative. I don't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have.</p>
<p>CAPCOM: Yes.</p>
<p>SCHIRRA: We tried them on this morning.</p>
<p>CAPCOM: Understand that. The only thing we're concerned about is the landing. We couldn't care less about the reentry. But it's your neck, and I hope you don't break it.</p>
<p>SCHIRRA: Thanks, babe.</p>
<p>CAPCOM: Over and out.[14]</p>
