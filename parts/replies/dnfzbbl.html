			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that not all nations have historically done this regular maintenence. The Soviet Union let many of their missiles fall in to disrepair and it is thought that a significant portion of them would have either failed to hit their targets or failed to launch entirely if that day had come. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, and in addition to countries not maintaining their current stockpiles, many of these historically neglected weapons are filtering down to small nations with burgeoning weapons programs. Quite often, because of engineering and language differences, maintenance schedules are further neglected until the ordinance is fired, at which time it usually fails catastrophically.</p></div>		</li>
