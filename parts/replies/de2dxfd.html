			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely practiced and actively adjusted my handwriting. </p>
<p>For example, when I was younger there was a trend among girls in my school (and elsewhere I assume) of doing a particular style of &quot;e,&quot; in which the horizontal bar in the center was drawn last, and slanted down toward the back of the letter. I actively adopted that style, and then actively changed it later. I went through a phase of capitalizing all my &quot;R&quot;s and &quot;E&quot;s as well. </p>
<p>I can't attribute it to anything in particular, but I definitely saw my handwriting as a mode of self-expression when I was younger. I wonder if, as kids type more, this will happen less or perhaps become less gendered? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I actively practiced my handwriting well into middle school and high school. My sister (who is more tomboyish) never did that and her handwriting is as messy as any guy's. I know many other girls my age also actively practiced to improve their handwriting. Gel pens were also very popular with girls when I was a kid, so that gave girls even more incentive to practice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're on to something here. IMO diary and note writing culture among girls is the real reason for girls to typically develop nicer handwriting. Girls always had artsy bubbly handwriting. </p>
<p>Funny anecdote... I developed bubbly artsy writing because that was the only subject I would get a B in and the girls would get As. Still have clean handwriting today and can bubble the shit out of it. GF doesn't understand how I have nicer handwriting than her lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in university and I'm still making conscious adjustments to my handwriting. Just a few years ago I started looping all my hanging letter instead of leaving them open. I think the most recent change was to my f's just about a year ago. Now I'm actively working on greek letters (I'm in engineering so I do use Greek letters enough to make this not entirely a useless exercise), and capital letters (I really don't like how I write capital Y, but I have yet to find a version that I do like). So yeah, handwriting has been a bit of an obsession for me since I was in 6th grade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were you an artsy kid? I actually changed my &quot;y&quot;s twice. First the two stroke typed y, then curved on the top and bottom, and then (and still) curved top, straight line down at a slight slant. My &quot;a&quot;s went from a circle with a straight line on the right to a typed &quot;a&quot; to the cursive &quot;a.&quot; But even now, I don't have much difficulty switching fonts. Don't know of anyone who does so though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, &quot;y&quot;s have such expressive potential! There was a trend among my close friends in middle school to do a curved top; straight, perpendicular descender; and a convex, curling, long-ass serif. Man, that thing was ugly :P </p>
<p>I don't have an issue switching &quot;fonts&quot; for a few sentences or even for a single writing session, but switching my regular, everyday handwriting took some work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a significant amount of time in middle school switching my a's from the circle with the line on the right to the typed a. My twin sister always had better handwriting at that age and she did her a's like that so I copied it to try and one-up her, but now I can't switch back lol. I've tried and anything other than the typed a just feels unnatural. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did as well.  I have &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;math&quot; handwriting now and all my Greek characters are neater than English.  Haven't taken the time to practice and improve my English block letters because it works, but not confusing &quot;t&quot; and &quot;+&quot; or &quot;z&quot; and &quot;2&quot; is nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you about fine motor skills developement, but I feel like you touched on a really valid point right at the end of your post about societal pressures that I want to highlight. Let's not discount society's bias toward &quot;neatness&quot; or &quot;pretty&quot; handwriting in girls and &quot;messiness&quot; in boys. Sugar and spice vs snips and snails. It's really hard to remove these pressures from the equation. I'm sure that it accounts for at least some small part of the end result. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, myself and many of the girls I went to middle school with spent A LOT of time practicing our handwriting. I think the reason was mostly that all the older girls seemed to have nice writing so we wanted to as well. That was probably the cycle of expectation ad infinitum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like the best answer. At a certain age most girls enjoy writing, while most boys hate it. Simple as that. I don't think that it has much to do with fine motor skills or hand eye coordination, but practice in a specific skill. When I was a kid 30+ years ago, most of the boys had other interest like woodwork and sports.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, did a Google search.. tho most non scientific sites agree with me, most research I found doesn't find a statistically significant difference between fine or gross motor skills in preschoolers.
Seems to be either that girls inherently enjoy writing more than boys in that age, or pressure from society pushing girls to be neat/ keeping boys from striving for something &quot;pretty&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I think enjoyment has alot to do with it! im a girl who's dyslexic but can draw really well  (so i got some fine motor skills) but I have and always have had terrible handwriting because it HATED it and felt like a failure when writing.  Being dyslexic I got to go to a special once a week dyslexic workshop and all of us (boys and girls) had terrible handwriting compared to our non dyslexic peers. However if i put the effort in (because of drawing skillz) and im copying a text I can pretty much imitate any handwriting and im good at drawing individual letters perfectly...just not when im actually writing from my own head/ not just copying the imagery of a letter/typeface. </p>
<p>Also anecdotally the best handwriting i've ever seen in my life (most consistent, even, neat, looked like it was written by a computer) was by a 15 year OCD boy in my formclass that year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience anecdotally backs this up. I was home schooled until the third grade and I had terrible hand writing. When I started public school, other kids made fun of it and said my handwriting looked &quot;like a boys&quot;, so I practiced it a lot until it was nicer and more bubbly like the other girls. </p></div>		</li>
