<p>It also means if a Walmart brand has the same active ingredients it's just as good as the brand name. Likely also made in the same place.</p>

<p>Not remotely similar, but my brother in law's dad runs a forklift in a roofing shingle factory. It's all the exact same shit, and when somebody orders a specific brand, they just slap a sticker with that brand on a package. Some brands have higher quality variants that other brands don't sell, but the majority of their product is highly overlapping. I now assume this of all products. </p></div>		</li>

Your $500 Prada glasses are manufactured in the same factory as your $200 ray bans, and also the same as a pair of $80 vogue.  Luxottica makes glasses for ray ban, Oakley, coach, Michael kors, Prada, persol, Burberry, Miu miu, bvlgari, Ralph Lauren, Oliver people's , Armani, Versace, Tory burch, and others.  There are variances in the materials and technology used, but in most cases your $500 Prada are not too different from a $80 vogue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also in the industry for a while (QC), and toothpastes (most consumer products for that matter) from one company typically share a basic formula. They'll make adjustments/additives for things like whitening, flavor, texture, etc but the main thing you want is an abrasive (silica). That does most of the cleaning.</p>
<p>Stuff that makes it sudsy is pretty much for looks, although if you follow some of the better whitening programs (rinse, strips, and paste) you can get pretty dope results. </p>
<p>The stuff that costs more generally falls in that category, so if you do your research you can get the results you want. </p>
<p>Weird thing I learned btw--the Crest chocolate toothpaste (I think it's the Be brand?) doesnt mess with your palate like normal paste. I don't think their marketing strategy points that out, but it's kind of nifty. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Its shaky, but then other companies get ahold of the test and challenge it in front of the FDA. So they self police because it's sorta the prisoners dilemma.  </p>
<p>Anything with a drug has to be a legit study, typically double blind with peer reviews and a known monograph material. There's a whole list of approved FDA otc drugs and claims that can be made. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government. Only an estimated <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-bust-bringing-reproducibility-back-to-center-stage/" target="_blank">0.15% of all published results are direct replications of previous studies.</a>&quot;</p>

<p>Richard Horton, editor in chief of The Lancet, recently wrote: <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1.pdf" target="_blank">“Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”.</a></p>

<li>Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.
One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/" target="_blank">All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic.</a> </li>

They give you a questionnaire but basically fill in whatever they wanted in the end. For example, I did one on a scented candle and the questionnaire would ask questions like how much did I like the smell from 1-10 and when I handed the answers in to the front desk they would say &quot;you answered 10 on that question, right?&quot;, and would change my answer if I didn't. They usually took 15min and were a great way to pay for the movies I watched afterwards. </p></div>		</li>
