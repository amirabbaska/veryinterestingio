			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I love Physics and Maths. This feeling of two totally different methods giving you the same thing. Obviously in Physics it's more like two numbers with the same order of magnitude for the most part, but still!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be, if there's dust or fog in the air. If we assume clear air, I don't think it would make much difference over 11 km. The candle might be slightly below magnitude 6 due to the air in front of it, but someone with good eyes can see stars a little below 6 if it's dark enough.</p></div>		</li>
