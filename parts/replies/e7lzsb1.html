<p><a href="https://vinepair.com/wine-blog/what-are-wine-dregs-wine-sediment/" target="_blank">https://vinepair.com/wine-blog/what-are-wine-dregs-wine-sediment/</a> mentions high priced wines include it on purpose but if you stored it upside down it'd be predominately in the first few glasses from the bottle.</p>
<p>In cheaper wines the sediment is unwanted and should never make it to the glass. How to do that? Avoid turning the bottle upside down.</p>
<p>If you give me a glass of wine with sour or smokey crunchy bits in it. I'm going to be disappointed in your pour. But then I'm not buying expensive wine.</p>

<p>Mentions that commercial wine from large operations avoid such. But home brew / local craft wine well that depends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on this idea. If this process is not followed properly wine can go sour. Since there is no moisture to keep the cork tight it will start to let in air and bacteria that will turn the wine sour. If stored properly wine can be stored indefinitely. </p></div>		</li>
