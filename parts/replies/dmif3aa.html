			<div class="markdown"><p>That second video raises a whole bunch of ELI5s: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is zero-time? Detonation? I only noticed any effect at zero-time in the last clip. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If that is detonation, why is there such a gap before collapse, and how are they able to predict it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does the ground collapse as if only a large circular concave disk had been removed rather than a big spherical hole.</p>
</li>
<li>Where does the material destroyed by the explosion go? Shouldn't there be jets of hot gas/ vapourised material finding their way out of any possible crack to the surface? Like that one time they sent that poor manhole cover to space? All I see is a few dusty plumes in the last clip, and in all other clips what looks like just dust kicked up by the 'collapse'</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) no idea, time of blast sounds about right, especially given 2)</p>
<p>2) the process of collapse is not instantaneous; an entire column of ground cannot just immediately accelerate downwards as one piece. Think of it how in traffic at a light, everyone doesn't accelerate at once, they can only go once the person ahead leaves them room to go. In a sense, the &quot;information&quot; about the fact there is now a huge hole has to propagate up to the rocks at the surface, which can only find out once the rocks below them have gone. This process is well understood by people who study this properly, so they can predict it based on wave propagation and knowledge of the ground composition/structure. To best see this with your own eyes, hold a Slinky at one end and dangle it with your arm outstretched. When you let go, the bottom of the slinky will not move until the top has reached it and propagated the information (it's the exact opposite situation force wise, but quite illustrative of the principle).</p>
<p>3) both are correct. Each column of ground collapses as far down as it can. Imagine a basket ball, and hold it still. Now, look at it from the side and measure the distance between the top and the bottom. Try measuring from about an eighth of the way round vertically down and you'll see that that distance is shorter. When you remember that that height is the distance that the height of the ground will change by, removing a sphere of material from underneath will form a concave surface, as though a large concave disk had been removed. Geometry.</p>
<p>4) Compressed, melted, vaporised and sent down the path of least resistance, be it through a manhole or through other cave systems. Probably the former and the latter, but I don't know the exact proportions of either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm guessing that it's so deep, and the type of material the land is (sand?), might actually cave in to fill the gap eventually reaching the surface. </p>
<p>would love a proper explanation though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's basically exactly right.  As the rock/soil collapses, the land above it can then collapse, and so it propagates upwards to the surface.</p></div>		</li>

<p>TL;DR: in the early days of underground testing, they stuffed a bomb in a hole, and capped it off with a manhole cover. Well, that wasn't quite enough apparently, and the explosion popped that cap right off and into space's ass at 125,000 mph.</p></div>		</li>
