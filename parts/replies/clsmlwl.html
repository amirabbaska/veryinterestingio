<p>An interesting alternative is that you deprive the developing tumor of new blood vessels, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiogenesis_inhibitor" target="_blank">anti-angiogenesis.</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bevacizumab" target="_blank">Avastin</a> is one such drug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of an idea I had that is almost certainly ignorant and bat shit crazy but I still think it's a pretty interesting plan: </p>
<p>What if we figured out what gene switches cause a cancer cell to be as aggressive and nutrient hungry as possible.  We then take some cells out , twiddle with their genome turning them into these super cancers and then reinjected them back into the tumor.  The theory is that they will then out compete and eventually completely supplant the original cancer.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately after curing the patient of their original cancer the super cancer will of course swiftly kill the patient itself.  The key would be to not just give the cells the super cancer genes but also give them an achilles heel gene.  It would effectively work as an off switch.  Like add a gene that will cause it to die if the patient takes a couple aspirin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many treatments build upon this concept.The tumors need a blood supply for nutrients and some medications are anti-angiogenesis treatments - stopping blood vessel production. Tumors will send signals to promote vessel growth (a key cancer mutation) and the treatment will block vessel growth leading to tumor death.</p>
<p>This is also how PET scans work, it measures the rate of blood flow (nutrients) in the body and tumors appear as bright lesions in the scan (The brain is also highly active as it requires significant energy).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That all seems reasonable, but that's also true of the brain too (after you're born, the neurons in your brain never again divide, and they are protected by the blood/brain barrier). So why do people get brain cancer more often than heart cancer?</p>
<p>EDIT: Someone mentioned the right answer elsewhere in this thread. Brain cancer occurs in the glial cells in the brain (which do continue dividing), not the neurons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like you said, the vast majority of brain cancer are from the glial cells, which are kind of &quot;supporting&quot; cells in the brain. But recent studies show that the neurons do divide, but in a slow rate, and even have regeneration properties, depending on what lesion they suffer!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also a lot of cardiac cells that are not muscle cells.<br />
I'm tempted to write more or comment elsewhere in this thread but I'm not sure there's a point. I study cardiac regeneration for a living and it's just confusing. A few years ago there was no regeneration, then there were some satellite cells, now maybe more cardiac stem cells. Blah blah blah, but makes for interesting literature and adult scientist fights.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This isn't true at all. For one thing, the brain doesn't reach maturity until around age 26 for guys and 24 for girls. There is cell division during this period. Young children (&lt;6yo) who undergo partial lobotomies grow their brains back. And neurobiology is increasingly showing that neurons do divide albeit slowly, over our lifetimes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially rather than dividing and creating more mass that way the cells themselves get bigger. This is for a couple of reasons. When you work out a muscle it uses a lot of energy so the body responds by increasing the amount of mitochondria in the cells (these are basically the power units of cells that generate ATP the cells energy source), it also increases the amount of myofibrils in each cell (these are the fibres used in contraction of muscles).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When any part of your body breaks, it usually grows back stronger (because your body figures &quot;This area will probably get hurt again, better make it stronger). Likewise, when you exercise, your muscles tear just a little bit. Every time they grow back, they get a little bigger and a little stronger.</p></div>		</li>
