			<div class="markdown"><p>Related question: How do we know that the amount of mass the star has is related to the amount of light it gives off?</p>
<p>Couldn't there be two stars of the same masses, but one star giving off lower energy light and another star giving off higher energy light? How could you ever know which energy a star will give off just by the mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some variation in brightness at a given mass. As /u/wolf_on_the_fold mentioned, the relationship between star magnitude (brightness) and mass is very well documented and is summarized by the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram he linked. A star's mass actually uniquely determines its entire evolution, so just from its position on the diagram we can get a good idea of its mass.
There are other ways of working out star masses from their orbits, which agree with these calculations, so we're reasonably sure they're correct. </p>
<p>We are also looking at the brightness of galaxies as a whole, which contain billions of stars of different masses, stellar classes, and ages, so any variations in individual stars are &quot;averaged&quot; out.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can understand that you can measure the star's mass from the orbit, but I don't get how the mass is related to light.</p>
<p>Is it just the obsevation that stars of certain masses generally give off certain frequencies of light? Is there an explanation of why this happens, if it's true?</p></div>		</li>
