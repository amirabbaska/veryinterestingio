			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm torn between the monkey explanation and the panda explanation. </p>
<p>But I think monkeys is a bit more accurate, because some of the light is being reflected to your eyes (hence why the lense is not invisible) but also some of the light is being refracted away from its original path, and not to your eyes, so that refraction would account for part of the shadow, and of course the brighter spot, I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh absolutely his is more accurate, there's no denying that whatsoever.</p>
<p>I was just offering another simple thought experiment that can give a different perspective on the question.</p>
<p>When it comes to what's happening more specifically, monkeys is where it's at.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think this is a <em>different</em> perspective, it's just another factor that is also true. One does not exclude the other.</p>
<p>Reflected light does not penetrate the glass, and thus reduces the amount of light hitting the target surface, and we call that a shadow.</p>
<p>After the reflected light is removed from the equation, we can look at what happens to the (remaining) refracted light, which is what Monkey's post details.</p></div>		</li>
