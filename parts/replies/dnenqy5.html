			<div class="markdown"><p>Shipping or by truck. Europe is encircled with sea, and there also is a sea between Scandinavia and mainland Europe. There are also rivers where ships can go. For example: coal going from the dock at Rotterdam to the Ruhrgebied in Germany over the river Rhine. Also, Europe is much smaller. Freight trains are only useful for long distances.</p></div>		</li>
