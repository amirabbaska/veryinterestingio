			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm... I think &quot;finding meaning&quot; is putting the cart before the horse, and perhaps a bit abstract or complex.  </p>
<p>Language may be an essential component, but I think at least as much must be <em>pattern recognition</em>.   </p>
<p>Particularly where pulses and rhythms come in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great link, thanks.</p>
<p>Also IIRC there's also an ex psych theory that dancing serves as a chance to demonstrate socially and sexually desirable traits - physical fitness, and a balance of creativity and social cohesion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely, there are all the social aspects of dance and the demonstration of physical fitness and even proving that you are free of genetic defects. It's the same for virtuoso guitar players or pianists. Even for novelists and poets. The social part is very interesting, and it is definitely part of it.</p>
<p>But it all kinda begs the question. Why do we as a society value that stuff? There is probably some fundamental reason why we appreciate these specific kinds of demonstrations of fitness as opposed to others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One theory (for art in general as you allude to) is it's its apparent uselessness that is precisely what makes it appealing, a la handicapping (aka peacock features). Spending time making art shows you are a person of leisure and therefore must have a lot of resources. And if other people are already oohing and ahhing over your art, it shows status and social leadership.</p>
<p>This might be where the 'sexy artist guy' trope comes from...like if you saw Vicki Christina Barcelona, imagine of Bardem's character were a cubicle accountant instead of a dude who makes random art at his villa. Somehow I suspect his character's seduction of the female leads would seem less plausible to most viewers, and his character less appealing to female viewers.  </p>
<p>As for dancing, it combines display of physical fitness with that lack of a practical purpose - as do sports, which also are perceived as a (male) sexual status booster. Dance is also at the intersection of athletics and art. AND it has this weird mix of 'showing creativity' (and potential for leadership when others copy your moves) while also showing a sort of tribal social cohesion (people dancing with synched moves, or at least to the same general beat).</p>
<p>Oh also dancing is a way to show social bravery and not caring that you look, well, silly if you really think about it. Acting unconcerned with others' opinions is a sign of status. </p>
<p>And that's not even getting into some of the more explicitly sexual dances, like grinding on the dance floor, or stripteases and bellydancing.   </p></div>		</li>
