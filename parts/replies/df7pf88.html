			<div class="markdown"><p>It might also be due to how subdural bleeds play out. A person with a bleed inside the brain would tend to hit their head, be fine a few hours, go to sleep, and never wake up. Prior to brain scans, people would likely associate the problem with the last thing the person did... go to sleep. And if they did have a bleed, you couldn't stop the. person from going to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be the case in an epidural hematoma rather than a subdural hematoma. Subdurals can take hours to days before there's anything visible on a CT, whereas an epidural is usually associated with a more profuse bleed which can definitely kill within hours. Not saying these are always the clinical courses, but more often than not it's the epidural bleeds that you really need to worry about &quot;dying in your sleep&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I argue it's the opposite. An epidural bleed usually shows symptoms within 10 min-4 hours, and would be more associated with the traumatic event and injury. What we really need here is a medical historian. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The NP at employee health says I need time to get rid of my headaches. It's just so frustrating. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow I think you just answered a question I've had for a long time. I don't have insurance or anything so I've never got it checked out, but I've had several concussions from high school and college football years ago and this is a daily, constant thing in my life. I had never considered that might be why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you serious?? You played those sports for a significant amount of time and never heard any of the news/publicity/science about head injuries? I don't follow any sports at all, currently or in the past, and I end up hearing about athletes that end up undergoing crazy personality changes after their head injuries, especially repeated ones.</p>
<p>I'm sure it happens less often than I think, it's very possible that I've read about the same athlete several times (as I said, I don't follow), but I still <del>here</del> (yay autocorrect) hear about them a couple of times a year. </p>
<p>Please get yourself checked out and see if they can do anything to help you. I've only ever experienced vertigo once, but used to get crazy motion sickness. There is nothing worse than nausea (yep, I would take pain over nausea), I don't know how you could live like that for years without getting checked out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, then you'd just have tons of idlers around the edge of the embark eating up FPS. What you want to do is set up an outbuilding that's just a room with a big lowering drawbridge. Whenever you get migrants, burrow them in there, forbid the door once they're all in, and have the lever pulled twice.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to take their stuff, have a retracting drawbridge as the floor instead of the lowering one, and drop them down a shaft to wherever you want their corpses. This approach won't do nearly as much for your FPS, though, since there'll be tons of corpses and assorted items.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a few years since I've been in school (psych &amp; neuro, but I now work in an unrelated field so I'm slowly forgetting details unfortunately) so forgive me if this sounds odd, but isn't it still possible to examine pupil reflexes even if they're unconscious? Just lift up their eyelids and shine a light, same thing is done for coma patients and they're unconscious for essentially the same reason; failure of the brain to maintain a conscious and activated state of mind. </p>
<p>My prof who taught the brain damage course basically said going unconscious is bad because it makes it more difficult to diagnose and know what's going on. Unconscious = automatic grade 3 concussion, but if they're not waking up they could have a grade 4 concussion and the medical team would likely have a more difficult time knowing what to do. And without being able to talk to the patient and see what they have difficulty with, it's best to impossible to tell what areas might be damaged without some sort of brain imaging. General rule of thumb, if you hit your head hard enough that you're a little dizzy that's a concussion and you NEED to go to the hospital, the risk of additional injury is MUCH higher when the brain is repairing itself after a concussion. We were shown a case study where a young boy was playing hockey, got a concussion but was told to &quot;walk it off and get back on the ice.&quot; He was hit in the head again, lost consciousness, and later died from bleeding in the brain / pressure buildup.</p>
<p>So glad I took this class, wear a helmet whenever I do any sort of sport where there's risk for head injury. As the same prof put it. &quot;Want to know what happens to your skull if you fall off your bike without a helmet? Go throw a watermelon on the road, your skull will react the exact same. Hint: your brains are the watermelon pulp.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, exactly. No need to be awake to assess pupils and as I've been saying pupils are definitely more of interest to me if someone is unconscious. I'm not too fussed about them if they're sitting, chatting to me.</p>
<p>What's quite difficult to get across is the difference between feeling sleepy / sleeping and being unresponsive. If I crept in to your house at 2am you'd probably still wake up with a creak in the floorboard. I want that same sort of response with a concussed person when I say their name and for them to then continue the conversation with me afterwards. If I need to squeeze hard on your shoulder before you even open your eyes, I'm concerned.</p></div>		</li>
