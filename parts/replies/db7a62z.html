			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I'm from they fine you $250 and charge you for the lawn service.  Thankfully it only happened to me once and I happened to mow it before the lawn service guys got to my place.  Only had to pay the fine.  </p>
<p>Now at my current HOA....yikes.  But I did the deal with the devil on that one by moving to where I did...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jesus I would never agree to live in a place like that. I rent and my landlord takes care of the lawn. If I owned my property I damn sure wouldn't let other people determine what I could do with it, much less PAY them when I don't play along.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the same thing happened to me! I broke my leg and was unable to mow my lawn for a month, so the city sent a guy to come over and mow. the guy mowed it, but he didn't ask for any where near as much as $1200. instead, he asked for about $3.50 and that's when i met the Loch Ness Monster.</p></div>		</li>
