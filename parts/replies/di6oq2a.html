			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really the biggest factor.</p>
<p>It's the same reason that you get into hairy territory when you are larger and larger as well... for example an elephant couldn't fall from very much height at all without breaking its legs.  The elephant's bone strength is determined from the bone's cross sectional area.... 2 dimensions.... whereas its weight is determined largely by its volume.... 3 dimensions....</p>
<p>In other words, the scaling of numbers looks something like this.  Of course, these numbers are just pulled out of my head and aren't accurate, it's more about the pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Person's bone - 5^2 = 25</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Person's weight - 5^3 = 125</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elephant bone - 15^2 = 225</p>
</li>
<li>Elephant weight - 15^3 = 3,375  (Jesus!)</li>
</ul>
<p>125 is <strong>5x</strong> larger than 25.... but 3,375 is <strong>15x</strong> larger than 225!  The point being, that numbers get larger WAY faster in 3 dimensions than they do in 2 dimensions as you scale up the 1 dimensional measurement that you're starting with.</p>
<p>And that's also why bugs seem so strong for their size.... it's the opposite effect.</p></div>		</li>

I saw it in a movie, so it has to be right</p></div>		</li>
