			<div class="markdown"><p>The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed.) gives the following etymology for <em>burgle:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A back-formation from <em>burglar</em> n., of very recent appearance, though English law-Latin (1354) had a verb <em>burgulāre</em> of same meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The earliest citation it has is from 1872, in Mortimer Collins's <em>The Princess Clarice:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The burglar who attempted to enter that room would never burgle again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next earliest is in an issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Evening_Standard" target="_blank">The Standard</a> from November of 1874, where it is passed off as an Americanism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New words with which the American vocabulary has lately been enriched; ‘to burgle’, meaning to injure a person by breaking into his or her house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mortimer Collins, for the record, was English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald_24_08_1867#page/n7/mode/1up" target="_blank">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> used it earlier, in 1867, writing 'The New York World has coined a new verb -- &quot;to burgle.&quot;'</p>
<p>I can't find an archive of the New York World, but it seems more likely that they coined it rather than this SMH article. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I became a linguistics major. </p>
<p>Another interesting language change is folk etymology -- basically when enough people make a mistake, it sticks. Usually this happens when words are borrowed from another language into English (e.g. Algonquian &quot;otchek&quot; (groundhog) &gt;&gt; &quot;woodchuck&quot;; &quot;cockroach&quot; from Spanish &quot;cucaracha&quot;). </p>
<p>There are some more interesting ones, though, like &quot;garden snake&quot; from &quot;garter snake,&quot; or &quot;catty cornered&quot; from &quot;cater (four) cornered.&quot;</p>
<p>Here's a big <a href="http://www.alphadictionary.com/articles/folk_etymology.html" target="_blank">list</a> of folk etymologies for anyone who may be interested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I remember as a child watching the cartoon version of The Hobbit and one of the characters says,&quot;Well, you are the burglar. Go down and.... burgle something.&quot;  I took that to be some pretty hilarious wordplay because no way was &quot;burgle&quot; a word.</p></div>		</li>
