			<div class="markdown"><p>I think if the person being tested believes it works it can have a similar effect in making the person being tested feel small and hopeless. &quot;We have the power to read your mind&quot; and that power differential is a little similar (not equal) to the one created by torturing a person... so maybe they get power boners a little bit you know? </p></div>		</li>
