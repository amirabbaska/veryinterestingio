			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember listening to a podcast on gym membership model (sounds boring I know but it wasn’t) and there’s a price point you can charge where it’s so little that loads of people sign up because it’s so cheap, but don’t end up going because the financial burn isn’t enough to make people guilty about not going. </p>
<p>Boring and not what you asked and I worded it weirdly but ¯_(ツ)_/¯ </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd be surprised if they didn't. It's common accountant practice to gradually write off assets with a limited time span for a reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of real estate and lack of equipment, I would imagine so. But you may also see a spike in the higher margin stuff like personal training, protein shakes (at higher end gyms), maybe special membership items like specific classes, etc.
I’m just playing devils advocate, probably not of that even makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a gym for a few years. Don't remember the exact numbers but I want to say we had around 830 active members, but saw around 300 unique check ins per month. Also sign ups picked up more around November partly from people wanting a winter membership and party from people not wanting to get labeled as a &quot;new year's resolutioner&quot;. Spiked for new years and didn't start really start
dropping til mid to end of February</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a poor perspective I feel, some gym companies have been called out for building their gym in a way where people sign up but rarely attend, such as planet fitness. For like $10 you can join them, they have one of the larger customer bases I've heard of but also the worst attendanc. People argue stuff like they do this on purpose by not having squat racks and stuff Yada Yada. I don't know their game plan but I do know for a fact I've had multiple friends sign up with them and then only ended up at the gym maybe twice a month before finally stopping their member ship. I am more curious as to how hard other gyms try to keep their customers coming back regularly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked a manager for a golds gym in Utah about attendance, this was around 2007. He said something like 13% of their members use the gym regularly. Here’s the interesting thing about the model: a gym couldn’t afford to operate if something like 80-90% of their customers attended regularly. Think about how busy your gym is at 7:00-8:00 AM, and at 5:00-7:00. Mine are always just packed to capacity. And that’s probably less than 20% of membership. If the population doubled or tripled during those times, there would be no equipment available, so the gym would have to buy more, expand size, etc. Machines will break faster, but they’re making exactly as much money as they are no. Profit margins would plummet and they’d probably go out of business. Inexpensive gym memberships only exist because the majority of their money comes from people who rarely If ever use the service. </p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s a good thing, or a bad thing, it just is, and it’s super interesting. A few people can benefit with low membership rates because a lot of people don’t mind giving away money. Weird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bro, gyms cant make someone come to the gym any better than a doctor can make a type 2 diabetic stop eating sugar to avoid death and a shit ton of meds.</p>
<p>Truth is the people that don’t come subsidize the people that do come. There are “at cost” memberships available at most gyms. LA fitness for example has $15 a day passes you can buy any day, you can also pay $75 for a membership that lasts only a month. But most people are sold on the fact that if they are joining a gym then they need to make it a lifestyle and pay for the $30 monthly that is cancel anytime with notice in most states. People arent going to come but that’s doubly at their detriment since they are paying for something they aren’t using and lowering their quality of life.</p></div>		</li>
