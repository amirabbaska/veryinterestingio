			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never understood the argument that the counter current heat exchange helps keep the feet from freezing. It lowers the arterial heart, so the feet don't get AS MUCH heat, right? However I do understand an advantage of increasing veinous temperature, to avoid super cold blood making its way back to the heart. Can you help me understand this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, the feet get less warm this way (but less heat loss also, as heat loss is based on the temperature difference between 2 objects).  The heart also gets less chilly blood returned to it, so less thermal shock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely agree about the thermal shock, I can understand that as a real benefit. I'm not sure about it reducing total heat loss though. Certainly so within the feet, but with extra heat loss in the legs. So the total loss is the same, it's just in stages. It might depend on if the heat transfers at a faster rate with greater temperature differential. Over a period of time it would obviously transfer more heat, but only when measured over a period long enough that it becomes significantly close to the outside temperature, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that it's not about warming the feet, it's about preventing heat loss from the bird as a whole. The feet are presumably better evolved to handle being frozen, since they're intentionally freezing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that does make sense. Perhaps it's just always been worded poorly in explanations I've seen. When I first heard about it, it was listed as an answer to &quot;why don't birds feet freeze?&quot; though, so perhaps poor wording has caused it to also be given as a poor answer to others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re on the right track- the benefit with countercurrent heat exchange is in reducing total heat loss to the environment by allowing the extremities to become colder.  In general the rate of heat transfer is dependent on the surface area and the temperature difference.  The extremities of warm blooded animals will always transfer a lot of heat because they have more surface area, but the rate of heat loss can be lowered by reducing the temperature difference with the environment.</p>
<p>However, they still need blood flow to provide oxygen and nutrients, so the solution can’t just be to cut off blood flow to their extremities.  Frostbite occurs in humans when blood vessels contract to prevent overall heat loss that can cause hypothermia, but in doing so it cuts off the tissue from oxygen as well.</p>
<p>Animals that make use of countercurrent blood flow use it as a mechanism to allow their extremities to drop to a colder temperature (reduce total heat loss to environment) while still providing them oxygen/nutrients of blood flow.</p>
<p>Here’s a better illustration of the gradient:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post! </p>
<p>So the bird generally stays warmer by keeping its feet at a lower temperature. Even with the scaly skin, how do the feet’s muscles still work then? When I’m working in the cold my grip strength is severely reduced and my body’s not intentionally cooling my hands. </p></div>		</li>
