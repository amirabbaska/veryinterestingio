			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Super helpful. Thanks!
I never thought about the perspective of that connection between the physical and spiritual in the church. </p>
<p>It's really just a downside though, since human understanding is imperfect, that some people get so carried away with praising the physical idols and everything that comes with it, that they forget why they are doing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent points. While church art is not a sacrament, it's similar to what I was taught about the institution of the sacraments: God knows that we are flesh and blood rather than ethereal spirits, so He gave us these physical, earthly ways of connecting with Him. The main difference here is that God made the sacraments, and man made the art, but the purpose is basically the same.</p></div>		</li>
