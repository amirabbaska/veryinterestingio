			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, but it is a very crude approximation. To speak about solids you need large enough chunks of crystall, at least hundreds of molecules wide. Forming such structures above the melting point is extremely improbable, they are torn apart by thermal motion. But a few molecules can form a bound state for a very small time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there's always a few molecules trying their hardest to come together while the rest are interfering. There's a metaphor there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. Im actually not sure. In my mind, it would not freeze because although SOME of the molecules have lost enough energy to &quot;freeze&quot;, it will be bounced around by the others until the majority of molecules are ready to freeze. </p></div>		</li>
