			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this answer:</p>
<p>During the merger we would expect gravitational waves to be emitted. If the black holes are large enough we can even detect them - as the team at LIGO did earlier this year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also wanted to share some of the numbers associated with the event detected by LIGO, just to give a sense of the staggering amount of energy produced by this sort of collision.</p>
<p>On September 14th, 2015, the two LIGO detectors in Washington and Louisiana observed the same signal (offset by about 10 ms) that represented a physical perturbation on the order of 1/1000th the diameter of a proton (i.e. 10^-18 m). This tiny disturbance represented a five-sigma event that was determined to correspond to the merger of two black holes located about 1.3 billion light years away, each of which was about 30 solar masses. As the black holes spiraled inward and collided, they accelerated until they were moving at roughly 60% the speed of light. </p>
<p>The gravitational wave released by the collision of these two black holes was equivalent to 3 solar masses (that is, in the old E = mc^2 equation, m = 3 <em> the mass of our sun).  This equates to about 5.4</em>10^47 J, all released in the span of roughly 0.2 seconds. At the peak output of this event, the power output from this black hole merger was greater than that associated with all visible light in the known universe.</p>
<p>But, let's put that amount of energy into a perspective that will allow us to relate to it in human terms. In 2013, it's estimated that our annual global energy consumption was 3.89 <em> 10^20 J (that's 389 billion billion Joules). Since the black hole merger we detected released 5.40 </em> 10^47 Joules, that's enough energy to theoretically meet mankind's current energy needs for 1.39 <em> 10^27 years, or for roughly 1 </em> 10^17 (100 million billion) times longer than the lifetime of the universe thus far (13.82 billion years).</p>
<p>Obviously, that's still an insanely, incomprehensibly huge amount of time, and doesn't bring us that much closer to recognizing how much energy this event released.</p>
<p>So, let's imagine for a second that all 7.4 billion people on Earth are made into demigods, and are given an exact replica of Earth to oversee, each with its own equivalent energy needs and its own population of 7.4 billion. </p>
<p>So now we have 7.4 billion Earths, one for each human alive, and this ridiculous number of planets has a combined annual energy consumption of 2.88 <em> 10^30 J (2.88 billion billion trillion Joules). In this case, the energy released by the black hole merger we detected would meet these energy needs for 1.88 </em> 10^17 years (that's 188 million billion), or about 13.6 million times longer than the lifetime of the universe.</p>
<p>Okay, so let's go one level further. Let's say that in this weird universe where each inhabitant of Earth has an exact replica of Earth to oversee, each inhabitant of those demigods' earths now also has a replica of earth to call their own. So now each of those 7.4 billion earths is linked to 7.4 billion additional earths, and the total annual energy usage is 2.13 * 10^40 J (21.3 billion billion billion trillion Joules). </p>
<p>In this case, the amount of energy released by the black hole merger would provide for each of these 54.76 billion billion earths for 25.4 million years of operation at modern consumption levels. </p>
<p>And, all of this energy was released within about 0.2 seconds. </p>
<p>That's the sort of insane, incomprehensible energy output associated with the collision of two black holes.</p>
<p>Note: Some of these details come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_\(energy\)" target="_blank">Energetic Orders of Magnitude wikipedia site</a>, which is fascinating in its own right. The initial paper describing this discovery can be found <a href="https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To put that into perspective, the detectors are 4km long in each direction. If you scaled that up so that each arm was the distance from here to proxima centauri, the mirrors would have moved less than the width of a strand of hair. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way of putting it into context: it's enough energy to allow for continued exponential growth of human population and energy consumption at a rate of 1% per year (roughly, current population growth rate), until IPv6 addresses run out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Even swinging your arms around makes g-waves ... they're just so incredibly weak as to be undetectable.  At our current tech level, it takes something as massive as two black holes colliding for us to detect the slightest thing, but scientists are working on it.</p></div>		</li>
