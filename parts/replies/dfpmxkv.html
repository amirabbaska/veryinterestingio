			<div class="markdown"><p>But we see cloaks in fashion long after cars became popular. The designs changed and evolved of course, but cloaks were at least somewhat popular and at most highly fashionable until the 60s. You can even find cloaks today in women's fashion (even high fashion), though they aren't super popular.</p></div>		</li>
