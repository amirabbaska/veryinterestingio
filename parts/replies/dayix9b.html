<p>I'll do my bit to rebut that nonsense here. Basically they point to isolated occurrences of freak weather or local cooling and attribute that to being a global activity based upon personal experience. TLDR some people are more bat-shit crazy than you've described, their brains operate on the scale of ants and they probably think excessive heat is due to overfeeding the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually is a reasonable statement. But there is one important note to make: the word &quot;change.&quot; When asking what was different on Earth between 200 years ago and now in the context of the climate, there's only one real answer.</p>
<p>However, people have done those calculations, called &quot;forcings.&quot; They look at a bunch of different factors, figure out what impact it would have on the temperature, and compare them. <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=257" target="_blank">Here's one good page with some</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about climate change, skepticalscience.com is an excellent resource. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, thank you.</p>
<p>Honest question regarding climate change though, and please don't think it is a loaded question...I honestly don't know the answer to this...and med school has me so busy I can't do all of the research like I used to.</p>
<p>I've heard from the right-leaning news/politicians that data was forged or &quot;inflated&quot; by scientists. Have these claims been disproven? Or if they were true, why would scientists jeopardize the trust in the data and do something like that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The claims against climate science are weak as fuck.  They're based on intentional misrepresentations of data or disproven theories.  There is no scientific debate on whether climate change is real or if it's caused by humans or if it's dangerous.</p>
<p>Anyone &quot;expert&quot; telling you otherwise is likely making some big bucks.  Like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/us/ties-to-corporate-cash-for-climate-change-researcher-Wei-Hock-Soon.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">this</a> guy, who made over a million supporting the unsupported idea that climate change was caused by the sun. Remember, industry also had &quot;experts&quot; who said that cigarettes were safe.  And leaded gasoline.</p>
<p>Basically, we're at the stage where the science is clear, but industry is funding people to deny that fact.  And they're fucking us all over in the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, 100% false in every conceivable way.</p>
<p>Most claims of &quot;forging&quot; are related to data adjustment. Imagine doing a study on heart disease without accounting for the fact that your sample group happened to be 60:40 men, and men get heart disease more often than women. Climate scientists need to do the same kind of adjustments, which look like &quot;manipulation&quot; to an outsider.</p>
<p>Others involve corrections. NASA, NOAA, and other organizations have thousands of stations they collect data from. If 999 are reporting the same thing, but the last is suddenly off by a fraction of a degree, that gets adjusted. Often it's caused by a change in the local environment, like a new building.</p>
<p>Finally, some people look at local changes and insist it must be global. The US had a cold winter, but NASA says Earth is warmer? Definitely adjusting the data.</p>
