			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming OP was referring to visible light, the visible spectrum of light (the wavelength at which a photon can be observed by the human eye) is about 400-700nm, so objects of about that size or larger can block a photon (either by absorption or reflection) and effectively cast a shadow. Obviously this would be impossible to see with the naked eye, as it's on the order of a single photon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Single atoms can absorb visible light too, even though they're much smaller than its wavelength.. the reason we don't see a shadow from such an absorption is due to diffraction, plus it can only absorb one photon in a while (it has to de-excite first), and the absorption itself is probabilistic. </p>
<p>Near field probing is able to see shadows of objects smaller than the wavelength by about an order of magnitude.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, smaller objects can interact with photons, sometimes much smaller objects. I was under the impression, however, (and I may have been incorrect here, apologies) that only something on the order of the wavelength would block photons consistently enough to constitute a &quot;shadow&quot;.</p>
<p>For instance, even a hydrogen atom (~50pm, or 0.01% the wavelength scale) could absorb a photon, but the next might pass straight through, whereas something on the wavelength scale would absorb all photons incident upon it. The photon absorption/reflection effect can be detected on something smaller than the wavelength, but it wouldn't block all photons incident upon it.</p>
<p>I'm going to cede to the experts here, though. If I'm mistaken, I'll be happy to edit my comment to reflect my error. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shadows are not just related to light, theyâ€™re related to scattering in general. You can scatter atomic nuclei off of each other and produce a shadow behind the target nucleus, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the particle is smaller than a photon it will technically cast a shadow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the explanation I was thinking of as well. Also anything can technically make a shadow given what wavelength of light you're referring to.</p></div>		</li>
