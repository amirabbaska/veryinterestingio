			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: In German you have two words similar to bloodpenis and meatpenis meaning basically grower and shower. </p>
<p>EDIT: Wow! All this time no upvoted comment and as soon as we're talking about penises, penii or penes (yes I just googled the correct plural form of penis), baam!!</p>
<p>EDIT 2: And as many have asked and many have answered already before me the words are &quot;Blutpenis&quot; and &quot;Fleischpenis&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grower here. It gets hard as fuck. You know how dudes with big dongs in porn are usually floppy? Like it'll fold in half while they're trying to do those dumb porn positions. That will never even come close to being a problem. I could bludgeon a small child to death with this thing.</p>
<p>My sample size of one is clearly enough to speak definitively on the matter.</p></div>		</li>
