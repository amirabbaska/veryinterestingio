			<div class="markdown"><p>Dry air <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth" target="_blank">contains 20.95% oxygen</a> and you can simply <a href="https://inspectapedia.com/hazmat/Gas_Concentration_Conversions.php" target="_blank">multiply the percentage</a> by 10,000 to get the ppm. So the concentration of oxygen in dry air is 209,500 ppm. Based on that, ±15 ppm doesn't seem like a big deal.</p>
<p>Edit: There's a really handy graph right below the section of the article you copied. The ±15 ppm is based on seasons, and it's barely any change. To better answer /u/MAD_OR_NAW's question, seasons basically don't change the oxygen enough to really matter. What does matter is elevation. The ground has more oxygen than the higher levels of the atmosphere (and these levels are more evenly mixed), and if you go even higher, then space radiation just breaks it from O2 into just O.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, absolutely. The seasonal variation by latitude is negligible when compared to the baseline concentration. That ±15 ppm may be measurable but statistical significance shouldn't be conflated with importance. Though I do think it's a testament to the sheer scale of life in these regions that photosynthesis and respiration can create a measurable gradient of O₂ concentration in the troposphere despite how thoroughly it gets mixed. Though if we're getting into the ability of life to change the composition of Earth's atmosphere, I can think of nothing that illustrates this more dramatically than the Great Oxygenation Event.</p>
<p>Your reply does touch on something I wondered about: do the much more dramatic variations in water vapor create a more dramatic variation in O₂ concentration? More of one molecule should dilute the others, after all. Not that this potential variation is any more important than the aforementioned ±15 ppm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct; water <em>does</em> dilute oxygen out of the air. When the dew point is 0 degrees C, water vapor <a href="http://www.asge-online.com/pdf/ASGEpg185.pdf" target="_blank">takes up 6020 ppm</a> by volume. This effectively takes up 0.602% of the atmosphere, diluting the concentration of oxygen from 20.95% to 20.82%. Unnoticeable for things that like to breathe, but considerably more than the ±15 ppm we're talking about.</p>
<p>However, we would also have to consider that we're not displacing air so much as adding water vapor (since mountaintops also have 20.95% oxygen but there's just less air overall). I'm pretty sure that has something to do with molarity or something else, but I'd have to go down a long rabbit hole to remind myself of everything I forgot since high school chemistry. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're talking about atmospheric differentiation due to separation by gas density, that only happens above ~100 km. Below that, turbulent mixing is enough to keep the molecular weight of the atmosphere constant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably besides the point of what OP ment, but total oxygen density is almost compleatly dependant on air pressure. 1% denser air = 1% more oxygen.</p></div>		</li>
