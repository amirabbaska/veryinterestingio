			<div class="markdown"><p>i think the slow wave sleep would be more like defragmenting. that is when the junk is cleared out and our memory is consolidated. </p>
<p>REM can be seen as practicing and rehearsing, replaying the sequences of neuronal activation you experienced while awake. when you run rats through mazes there are certain neurons called place cells (also grid cells, and head direction cells) that activate when they reach specific places in the maze. when the rats are dreaming, with little electrodes stuck in their brains to monitor these place cells, we see them trigger in the same order they would in the maze. so we think the rats are dreaming about running through the maze again. but, and this is sort of cool, they run through the maze much faster! (i couldn't find a study that saw that, but i'm pretty sure i'm remembering correctly.)</p>
<p>that's a small, but concrete, bit of what we've seen in dreams. more speculative, because i'm not widely read here, REM could be used to rehearse emotional responses, learn faces of people we just met or have been thinking about. practice the neuronal pathways needed for kicking soccer balls or hitting pool balls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I was curious because it seemed like overexertion for simple defragmentation.<br />
I always assumed the ability to adapt/react to situations is what lead to humanity's dominance, but reading more on the human brain, it's more about using past and present information to be ready for the future events and prepared responses.  Fascinating that's what the brain does when it's not taking in new information.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would evolution lead to this? To get worse the longer you sleep? Something isn't adding up.</p>
<p>I find the best thing for me (my brain, specifically to get rid of accumulated brain fog) is when I wake up in the morning and I'm able to roll over and go back asleep, repeat until I can't sleep any more. It may sound strange but that's what I've carefully observed. Any comments on how that works? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution isn't smart, it's random. Bad traits usually would get bred out of our species if they impacted survival, but I suspect based on my own experiences with sleep, we would sleep much lighter in a more dangerous, survival-based life and likely wouldn't over-sleep. And if we do develop these traits now, technology and no longer living in survival situations allows them to carry on.</p>
<p>That said, the average person's body stops their accumulated sleep at around 8 hours, more or less depending on the person. As you say, this is the point where they simply cannot sleep more.</p>
<p>Some of us have the &quot;unfortunate&quot; ability to keep sleeping beyond this healthy limit to the point where we sleep too much, getting brain fog and other side effects (one major side effect I found is an extreme decrease on cardio endurance for 1-2 days after over-sleep).</p>
<p>The extreme cases are those with sleep disorders like Hypersomnia or Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. </p>
<p>While some causes for Hypersomnia are simply poor sleep quality ( caused by Sleep Apnea, restless leg syndrome, narcolepsy, etc... you never get enough restful sleep and can keep going back to sleep), there has been a recent discovery that some people, when they create a normal sedative in their body, either create too much and cannot metabolize it quickly enough, or they create a normal amount and cannot metabolize it. This leads to feeling similarly to if you were sleep deprived for 24-48 hours despite having adequate sleep.</p>
<p>I have suffered from Idiopathic Hypersomnia for 15+ years and have found that if I sleep aroubd 8.5 hours, I feel my best. On top of that, if I sleep very lightly, even with disturbed sleep, I am less groggy than normal (although I get nauseous). Oddly enough, taking melatonin helps me wake up easier in the morning; less groggy, less sleep drunkenness. I've noticed I sleep much lighter at night when I take melatonin as well, waking up to noises easier when without it I can and have slept through tornado sirens and someone shaking me violently.</p>
<p>Sleep is a strange thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found I wake up best when I use an app like sleep cycle which measures my sleep pattern through movement and wakes me up when I'm in light sleep. Been using it for a couple years now and on top of the mountain of data, I've had the best wake ups of my life. Highly recommend replacing alarm clocks with a smart app to wake you up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for why evolution would lead to something, you have to ask two questions:</p>
<p>Is there a benefit to it?</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>Is there a penalty for it?</p>
<p>I can't speak to the sleep issue confidently, so I won't. But take cancer as an example. When asking why evolution would lead to the cancers we see, you have to ask the second question. Clearly there is no benefit. So what is the penalty?</p>
<p>In most cases, cancer pops up after we have reproduced. There was no penalty.</p>
<p>Evolution has no agenda. It's not out to produce an eventual perfect being. It's simply the result of things reproducing themselves. If a bad thing is able to reproduce uninhibited, then it stays.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly, until I got my Garmin Fenix 5x and started tracking my sleep patterns, I would get 5-6 hours of sleep per night, and almost zero NREM. For decades. </p>
<p>Now, watching my patterns and changing my habits accordingly, I am getting 1+ hours of NREM each night and it's the deepest period of my entire nightly sleep cycle. My REM cycle is the lightest. I am having the most lucid dreams and I can wake up rested and remember most of them.</p>
<p>The watch and the deep analytics it provides have changed my sleep patterns in incredible ways. </p>
<p>If I don't reach that deep, NREM state, I wake exhausted and I don't remember any of my dreams.</p></div>		</li>
