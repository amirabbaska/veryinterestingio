<p>2.) A solid sheet will reflect all signals.  If you've ever seen one of them super-secret government-type buildings, they are encased in copper and have a copper pipe coming out of the side leading leading to ground to prevent electronic eavesdropping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cage needs to be a good conductor at the wavelength of the RF it's supposed to block. Roughly, if the wire spacing / size of the gaps is about the wavelength of the RF, it will work.</p>
<p>Note that a &quot;solid sheet&quot; of metal still has structure: it's made up of atoms. Often these will stop being an effective conductor at a small enough wavelength, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yah, so like, it also depends on the size of your cage. Is it a small one in between? Some RF will reach. Is it extremely large, less RF will reach person B.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...kind of. It's more like light, the cage casts a &quot;shadow&quot; where the radio waves can't go behind it, which fades as they bounce off surfaces and get behind it indirectly instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to consider that radio communication is not point to point. The signals propagate in every direction. If they find something to bounce off of they will most likely make it to the other person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If however the different paths the signal take scatter to much then the signal will begin to self interfere and that can somewhat disturb the signal. If two signals arrive at a wifi receiver at the same time at a comparable strength then neither will be received even if one is just a time delayed version of the other.  </p>
<p>For example a 5gHz signal that takes two paths one of which is just 3 cm longer (1/frequency*speed of light/2) will assuming that the signal is of equal strength self interfere and be unreadable. So bouncing is nice for low frequency signals but can get messy quickly when applied to high frequency such as wifi. </p>
<p>Or at least that is my understanding of it, I'm just a computer science guy who overheard some electro guys discussing this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had a hypothetical cage with infinite width and height, and the cage was designed to block waves of the length of the signal you're using, then yes, they'd block it completely.</p>
<p>In practice, if you just had a big cage between you and the other person the signal could still bounce around the walls or trees or whatever the environment surrounding the both of you, and get to its destination. This is called multipath effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this how hotels provide wifi only in “common areas” like the lobby? Are the rooms shielded in some way as to prevent the signal from entering?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks everyone for the replies. I didn’t think about other signals still being able to enter the room. I still had cell service so it must have been what others have commented. Just irked me because the advertised wifi in the room and it wasn’t available. Thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that is what I would have thought. But I ask this question because I checked into a hotel yesterday that advertised wifi as an amenity. I went into the room. Saw the login/password and logged in. I got a full strength wifi signal then instantly it disappeared. I walked outside the room and had full strength. Walked back in and had no signal. It was literally the threshold of the door. I complained a few times and got the run around and eventually they moved me to another room on another floor with the same results. Then I left because I’m overseas with only wifi as my option to contact people for a few days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds inefficient, it would be easier to generate a signal only strong enough for the lobby than it would be to isolate rooms with Faraday cages. A good Access Point will have the ability to control signal strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. When your AP transmit power is too powerful, it catches clients from far away, who have to blast full power to be heard back. These exchange go very far and saturate the RF spectrum of the other rooms, reducing the total number of clients that can use WiFi at same time.</p></div>		</li>
