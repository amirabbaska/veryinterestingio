<p>In a normal crystal in it's normal state (when atoms are constantly in motion and influencing each other), you can look at it's structure and you will see a symmetrical, repeating pattern from any angle. When this same crystal is brought to its &quot;ground-state&quot;, or state in which there is no movement or energy, the structure will naturally become asymmetrical. It was only able to maintain a symmetrical structure because it had energy from the movement of its atoms. </p>
<p>The difference between an ordinary crystal and a time-crystal is that when an ordinary crystal is brought to it's ground state, its atomic structure becomes asymmetrical, but when a time-crystal is brought to its ground-state, its atomic structure stays symmetrical (from the atoms moving) even though there is absolutely no energy present. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cooling something to its ground state does not remove all energy. There will always be &quot;zero point energy&quot; remaining, which is the energy of the ground state. In this crystal, the ground state appears to include a vibrational mode, which is unusual. </p></div>		</li>
