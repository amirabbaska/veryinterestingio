			<div class="markdown"><p>Elements are characterized by the number of protons in the nucleus (which has to be a whole number -- can't have &quot;half a proton&quot;). This is what lets us give the elements &quot;atomic numbers&quot; (hydrogen is element 1, helium is element 2, etc.)</p>
<p>We have found all of the elements from 1 (hydrogen) to 92 (uranium) naturally on earth, with the exception of 43 and 61, which are not stable and had to be created synthetically (as did the elements beyond 92). We <em>know</em> we are not missing any within this interval.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always thought other galaxies far away from our own galaxy also contain elements we are not familiar with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They could.  They may have created elements with higher atomic numbers than we have due to better technology, but that is it.  H is H, He is He, doesn't matter which galaxy we are in.</p>
<p>What they will likely have are alloys that we haven't considered yet or strange ways to dope alloys with non metal elements to create special materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is there any limit to the number of protons? so we've synthetically created some elements beyond 92? what if there's one with 3921 protons that we have no idea about? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus, it's impossible that we missed any element below 100.
It's unlikely we missed some isotope of those elements, where the number of neutrons differs from the stable isotope. For instance, deuterium and tritium are hydrogen isotopes with 1-2 neutrons.</p>
<p>Now, anything above 100 decays within a few days. It's unlikely they'll be found in space. We had to synthesize them ourselves. Some believe elements around 112 or 164 might be stable enough to last longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as the observable universe is concerned, we can be certain the elements on the periodic table are all the elements in existence. There won’t be another element with, say, atomic number 8 (8 protons). They’d be isotopes of oxygen, not a new element. If another element with 8 protons WAS found, it would fundamentally change our understanding of physics and the nature of the universe because, from what we know, it’s a physical impossibility. That said, there are plenty of elements missing from the periodic table, specifically in the 100s, that we haven’t been able to create or observe yet. That doesn’t mean they don’t exist, it just means we aren’t aware of their existence yet.</p></div>		</li>
