			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always imagined the Saiyans as having more drive but less potential than humans. So when they breed they create a limitless god, like Gohan, if he would get off his god damn ass and do something. For fucks sake he's nearly equal to Goku in blue form in base form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's just that sayian/human half breed children have more potential than a full sayian or human. It doesn't have anything to do with the tail.  Gohan was nearly able to catch up to his dad's blue power level by starting to train again for a matter of weeks/months after years of giving it up and future trunks was able to damn near match both Goku and Vegeta in SSB form when he got pissed off enough. Of course it seems all sayians have the ability to have a massive temporary or, in the case of Goku going SS the first time, permanent jump in power level. Trunks did it during the Zamasu/Goku black arc and Vegeta did it after Beerus smacked Bulma in the ssg arc of DBS. I'm sure I'm probably missing a time or two in there as well.</p></div>		</li>

The stress levels of the mother also may have long term changes on the DNA of the children. Lots of things that we didn't think would change anything are correlating with changes.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Epigenetics has demonstrated nothing of the kind. Certain animal models demonstrated heritability of traits that were not originally encoded in the genome, but there has been no study that conclusively demonstrates this in humans, nor can we even make any kind of assertions about what <em>types</em> of traits are potentially heritable in this manner. </p>
<p>There is no where near any kind of conclusive science in this regard, and suggesting e.g. that a parent's physical fitness would somehow translate into a genetic trait completely inaccurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By this logic, we can never assume anything about humans without directly modifying the DNA of human embryos, which is completely stupid nonsense.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to rely on a wealth of data sources to make reasonable assumptions about humans.  Don't be an asinine asshole and pretend that we can learn nothing from epigenetic studies of other animals.  It's completely disingenuous.</p></div>		</li>
