			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the radius for a particular mass such that, if the mass were concentrated inside a sphere of that radius, it would form a black hole: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius</a></p>
<p>It's a linear function with a factor of  1.485 <em> 10^-27 m / kg (2 </em> gravitational constant / cÂ²). For example, for Earth it's about 8.87 millimeters, while for the Sun it's 2.95 kilometers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah so if you need 1.5 that radius, that means basically it needs to be at least &quot;almost a black hole&quot; to sling the light </p>
<p>Thanks! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would that even look like? If we compress the sun to 4.5km in radius. Light would orbit excatly around the &quot;surface&quot; of the sun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would practically be a neutron star (or something even denser by then), and by the way the light would need to come in perfectly parallel to the star's position and enter orbit directly. The light coming from the star itself won't enter orbit.</p>
<p>You wouldn't actually see the light orbiting it from a distance, because you wouldn't be interacting with it. </p></div>		</li>
