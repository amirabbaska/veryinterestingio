			<div class="markdown"><p>We can also see this in dogs. Dogs have no disadvantage for mating out of season and can have puppies year round while wolves still time their breeding for when prey is plentiful. Once the selection pressure for having a kid earlier or later than mating season is gone there will be mating season drift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have created disadvantage with the school system. The children born in September (the oldest in the year) are at a significant advantage when it comes to academic and sporting achievement than the children born in August (the youngest in the year). It will be interesting to see if this creates breeding seasons once this becomes more common knowledge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really doesn't work that way.  Parents can delay their child's entry to school and the academic gap closes during elementary school.  Plus the academic structure we have in place now has only existed for a few generations and isn't likely to persist much longer, so it is very unlikely to have any noticeable effect on the human genome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the parents who are smart know what's up. Ever notice all those fancy private schools have pre-first? All of a sudden you take the young august kids, wait a year, and now they're on top. It's a huge win for the kids, the only stigma is in a public system they'd be made fun of for being held back from the 1st grade, but why do you think they do it? So little Aiden is a little bigger and smarter in 6th than Timmy who skipped 2nd grade. Guess who's the bully and the victim? They got it all figured out. </p></div>		</li>
