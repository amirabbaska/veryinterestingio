<p>That being said with what I understand from basic physics is that liquid helium would have no viscosity, which would mean drag would be negligible. </p>
<p>So we need to look at buoyancy. </p>
<p>Buoyancy force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. So the larger the bubble, the faster it should go until the gas's inertia equals out with the acceleration from buoyancy.</p>
<p>As far as shape goes, They seem to behave <a href="https://youtu.be/9FudzqfpLLs?t=84" target="_blank">much like regular bubbles</a> thought with no drag they should be more spherical than normal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The weird thing with superfluidic helium is that there <em>is</em> a critical velocity, so you can't accelerate forever. It's analagous to the maximum current that can flow through an area of superconductor, and it's due to some minimum quanta of momentum or something (I don't remember from class)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting to know that. I'm curious what that velocity is in comparison to water...
as in an incremental increase or closer to orders of magnitude faster?
Guess I have some reading to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oops, good point, I thought I was in /r/AskScience </p>
<p>Ok, I was thinking the bubbles would be more spherical as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for answering and linking the video! I had actually watched this particular episode with Ben Miller a long time ago but had forgotten about it. So I guess that means it's about time to start yet another Horizon binge...</p></div>		</li>

<p>You still have to move fluid (do work) so there will be plenty of resistance to anything passing through that accelerates any helium.</p></div>		</li>
