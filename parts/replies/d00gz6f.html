<p>this.</p>
<p>Im a guy in my 30's and have to sometimes buy from these college kids i know.</p>
<p>And they are all trying to outdo each other with how many blunts they smoke per day.</p>
<p>They laugh at me with my one hitter but when i see them rolling blunt after blunt and not having nearly as gooda time as i am, i have to give them shit.</p>
<p>How is it cool to have a high weed tolerance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I smoked like that when I was in college but it was mostly because my friends kept packing bowls and &quot;why turn it down?&quot;. Im (28M) good with a one hitter these days, the trick is to let the high kick in. You usually peak after about 10-15 minutes, if you think you need another hit, see if you still want it then. If you are too stoned to load it, your good. (I have to conserve because I don't have a steady source)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to smoke all the time in the 80s. Back when pot was 5% thc. When you'd get some buds where you could see the crystals, you'd be all 'whoa this is the shit right here'. Today, it all looks like it's been rolled in sugar. </p>
<p>Back then, me an my old college roommate would split a joint every day after class, before dinner, between 4-5. We'd smoke, watch the afterschool reruns, and just bullshit. It was basically like chillin with a couple beers.</p>
<p>Today, with all the Krispy Kreme sugar on it, one hit and i'm like &quot;F U K&quot; for an hour. My sons will smoke entire blunts to themselves and appear functional.</p>
<p>Too much for this old man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally!  Also, when I was in college (way back in the <em>nineteen nineties</em>, all we could get was &quot;ditch weed&quot;, where two people could sit around and pull tubes all day and get pretty high.</p>
<p>Every once in awhile, someone would roll into town with &quot;KB&quot;, or &quot;kind bud&quot;, which was super potent, and you'd smoke one hitter and think, &quot;what the fuck just happened to my brain.&quot;</p>
<p>Now you don't hear the term KB anymore because that's literally all anyone has: really good shit.</p>
<p>I can smoke one hit of most of the stuff going around right now and be perfectly happy for like an hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a look at the source and I'm having trouble understanding their math relating to the peak concentrations.</p>
<p>Peak concentrations are stated to be 100-200ng/ml of blood. Let's say a man has 5 liters of blood. His peak threshold would be 100-200ng * 5,000ml or 500,000ng (0.5mg) to 1,000,000ng (1.0mg) in his 5 liters of blood. They also state hash oil can be 20% THC, never mind the fact that extracts can be more than 80% pure (Lab results here)[<a href="http://imgur.com/tOf6uFT" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/tOf6uFT</a>].</p>
<p>A single dab of 80% extract, maybe 1/20th a gram, can contain 0.04 grams oh THC; that's 40mg and 4000% the stated maximum  blood concentration. And you will definitely feel the difference from a single dab versus taking two. That wouldn't be possible with their numbers. Even Marinol, a prescription cannabis extract, starts at a dose of 2.5mg. Any thoughts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>absorption rate is fairly low. I have no idea on numbers but in the low 10s% id guess. plus the higher your concentration in your blood, the less you will absorb from additional material. so doubling the dose won't double amount in your system. Plus you're constantly metabolising. But honestly you'd need to speak to an expert about it. I'm definitely not.</p></div>		</li>
