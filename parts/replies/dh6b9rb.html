			<div class="markdown"><p>Ice reflects light water absorbs. The more of the Earth that is covered with ice the colder it will get. Carbon dioxide traps light, limestone traps carbon dioxide. Plankton consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, we consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide. Volcanoes are another major source of carbon dioxide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I'm a botanist, not a geologist, but just Google pleistocene ice age and there is a wealth of information about it. One important thing to note is that the last ice age occurred due to gradual climatic shifts over tens of thousands of years, and the current climate warming is occurring over mere decades. This means that plants and animals have very little time to adapt and migrate to new regions.</p></div>		</li>
