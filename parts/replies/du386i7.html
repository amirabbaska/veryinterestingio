			<div class="markdown"><p>The length and shape of an object creating multiple shock waves is exactly what happened to the Falcon Heavy's side boosters as they came in for their respective landings. Each rocket created 3 sonic booms very close to each other, for a total of 6. 3 rapid cracks from one booster followed by 3 rapid cracks from the other booster.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_rule" target="_blank">Whitcomb area rule</a> comes into play. It affects the drag. Or how much air is interacting with the craft.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At high-subsonic flight speeds, the local speed of the airflow can reach the speed of sound where the flow accelerates around the aircraft body and wings. The speed at which this development occurs varies from aircraft to aircraft and is known as the critical Mach number. The resulting shock waves formed at these points of sonic flow can greatly reduce power, which is experienced by the aircraft as a sudden and very powerful drag, called wave drag. To reduce the number and power of these shock waves, an aerodynamic shape should change in cross sectional area as smoothly as possible.</p>

<p>Larger objects will give you a larger shock wave in terms of size (i.e. Mach angle)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't the Mach angle only a function of the speed of sound and the velocity of the supersonic object? Is the common geometric <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/machang.html" target="_blank">derivation</a> of the mach angle too simple for bigger objects?</p></div>		</li>
