			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a just-so story, but I still think it's worth some consideration. One theory for the evolutionary utility of dreams is that they help practice patterns of behavior to confront challenges (so that when you encounter any similar kind of challenge in real life, the relevant planning/response circuitry in your brain has been a little more primed). Could also be that the experience of dreaming is merely a byproduct of automatic routines that run in your sleep for this purpose.</p>
<p>If that's true, there's no utility in mentally/experientially rehearsing <em>success</em>. The challenge itself is the only important part. In fact, keeping success out of reach would be the optimal training ground to practice dealing with obstacles, frustration, and defeat, which are all circumstances that are important to be able to deal with to max out your chances for evolutionary success. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this theory. Matches a broader theory of mind that states that your brain is a pattern finding machine, and dreams are your brain running simulations on how it would react to emotions and patterns of emotions it might encounter. What you see in the dream may not make any physical sense. But it's only you in the dream, so the brain takes the emotional cues you're testing out and gives them a form. What does challenge and frustration feel like? That mountain you never get to the top of. Fear, unknown, alienness? Monsters. Powerlessness? Buried alive. The narrative in the dream rarely makes sense when you look at the what. When you look at how it feels, I find it usually does. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I almost never comment, but I have an almost identical dream experience as you. I never manage to achieve my goal in dreams. Also my teeth being damaged in a dream is a somewhat common occurance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Teeth falling out/being damaged is one of the most common dreams experienced among humans, across all ages and cultures.</p>
<p>Like almost anything related to dreaming, the meaning of this type of dream is debatable.  However, the most commonly agreed upon interpretation is that it signifies a lack of control or power in your life.  Without your teeth, you are helpless.  You are like a baby...and you've lost the ability to easily fulfill one of your most fundamental needs: eating food.</p>
<p>This interpretation has always made sense to me (as a very frequent dreamer of this dream); more so than ever, people are feeling like their lives are out of their control.  They are burdened by debt and/or poverty, they are stuck in miserable jobs they despise so they can attempt to sustain themselves.  Your car breaks down.  Your dad dies of cancer.  The list is infinite.  Life is unrelenting, and it's incredibly easy to feel like you've little control over your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never lost my teeth in a dream, I still experience the &quot;I can't reach that item, I can't ride a bike, I can't sit on a chair without falling off, I can't steer my car clear of that tree, I can't jump over a gap (even the very smallest of gaps) its like my mind wants me to dream the opposite of my intentions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a few teeth that are incredibly crooked in comparison to the others, which has been a source of embarrassment and frustration a lot of my life. I often have dreams about pulling those teeth out, straightening them with pliers, etc. And I think the lack of control is a compelling argument towards mine as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually heard a different version of why we have the teeth-falling-out dreams. </p>
<p>Ever had a dream where you need to run away from something, but find yourself incredibly sluggish? Running has a huge amount of biological feedback (from breathing to muscle aches to the impact of your foot against the ground). Absent all that feedback (because of things like REM paralysis), it's easy to assume you're not moving very quickly. </p>
<p>This same idea can be used for car accident dreams and tooth damage dreams. Lack of biological feedback (tooth on tooth, or foot against pedal) makes it easy to believe something isn't working the way it should (the brakes are out, or the teeth are rotten).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't find a source for this at the moment. Google decided to jump on the &quot;dreams have real life meanings&quot; bandwagon, and the whole idea is probably either hearsay or speculation that I picked up forever ago.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is probably my most common recurring frustrating dream. A close second is when I need to punch some evil person to defend myself, but the strength of my punch is roughly equivalent to a whisper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Que the entrance of the false dream prophet.</p>
<p>as an expert in all things I would say your dreams suggest you are under some pressure to achieve and find the task to be overwhelming.  I would suggest taking an honest look at what you &quot; could&quot; be stressed over in real life and how you're addressing them. Even if you have these problems well in hand having a firm battle plan could offer you the sub-conscious reassurance needed to achieve in your dreams. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really funny that you mention this.</p>
<p>I experience this in more than just &quot;Achieving&quot; something in my dreams.
I have problems completing the simplest tasks I put forward for myself. Ex : running away - I just run in place or move really slow. Opening something - I just fumble and cant seem to figure out what I need to do.
It's really creepy.</p>
<p>However one very specific and repeating dream I've had for years is about flying. And always flying a very specific way.
I leap in the air and almost hold my breath in a sort. Upon doing so I almost levitate and the feeling is explained almost like... holding myself up.. with an invisible bubble im balancing on. Than to move forward I almost lean into it, much like silver surfer and eventually get good enough to lean full forward and increase my speed and fly like someone in Dragon ball Z. </p>
<p>And rambling over.... lol </p>
<p>Another note on dreams and I can't be the only one who feels this way...
When you wake up mid dream, I feel like that entire dream came flooding to me in that last 30 seconds before waking up, even though it feels like I've been in that dream for a very long time.</p>
<p>Anyone else get that?</p></div>		</li>
