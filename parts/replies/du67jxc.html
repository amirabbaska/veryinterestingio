			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this: they used a red suit, because in the open there is far more green and blue colors than there is a red hue to things. This is also why we use blue- and greenscreens. Because its all about the contrasts (luminance and color) when it comes to keying. And since us humans have more red colors <del>to us</del> on our bodies, blue and green work the best if you want to key out the background against an actor. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They did all that, then added <em>another</em> layer on top, which had a fish-eye lens - this gives the &quot;distorted&quot; or 3D look.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>Film jungle with red man</p>
<p>Film jungle without red man</p>
<p>Film jungle without red man and a distorted lens</p>
<p>Combine and remove the red.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they also went through the footage and applied concentric circles over the actor to indicate the distortion. a computer program ran and printed the master negative using the footage that was filmed as an input. it is not a purely optical effect. it is a computer effect.</p></div>		</li>
