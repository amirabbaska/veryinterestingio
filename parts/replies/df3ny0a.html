<p>Repeated exposures help build stronger and stronger connections and make the &quot;memory&quot; more concrete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds a lot like what <em>learning</em> is like. Often we use the term &quot;memory&quot; to mean almost anything where information or experiences form the past are recalled in any fashion. For example if I learn how to hit a golf ball often that will be called &quot;procedural memory&quot; or even &quot;muscle memory&quot;. </p>
<p>But when someone says talks about having a memory, or remembering something, almost always they're talking about recalling a conscious experience - what someplace looked like or food tasted like or how something smelled. And it seems like these things are fundamentally different than learning or anything else we might try to lump in with the term &quot;memory&quot;. We can form them nearly instantaneously. They don't get stronger with repetition, in fact, memories can become inaccurate if we're exposed to similar experiences or even just from recalling them many times. Also, we need to be consciously aware of, and paying attention to, whatever it is that will be remember.</p>
<p>Learning is nothing like that, it gets better with repeat exposure, can improve significantly over long periods of time, and we can even learn things without actually realizing it (how to get somewhere, a new language, etc.). I think you've given a very accurate description of how we understand learning to work. And the fact that we've been able to replicate some of these things in machines (with machine learning) based on exactly these kinds of neural net structures seems like good evidence that we're on the right track.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that these two kinds of recall are caused by the same process. I think it makes a lot more sense to <a href="http://consciousthoughts.net/essay2.php" target="_blank">call some things learning and some thing memory</a> and stop assuming that they must share the same causes or processes. It's likely that memories are something that can help us learn things. One process can help the other process work well. For example, remembering what it looks like when we hit a golf ball really well can make it easier to learn how to hit a golf ball through practice (it might even be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/comments/60413l/is_intelligence_just_error_correction/" target="_blank">just as simple as a form of &quot;error correction&quot;</a>). But that doesn't mean they're the same thing, and it'll probably help us figure out how they work if we (not just you and me, but nearly everyone that talks about them) don't confuse them unnecessarily.</p></div>		</li>
