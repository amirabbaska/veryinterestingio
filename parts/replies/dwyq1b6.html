<p>&quot;Dissolution of gas in liquids increases with temperature&quot; (essentially said)</p>
<p>Wrong wrong wrong.</p>
<p>Laboratory/Analytical Technician student here.</p>
<p>ELI14 (High school chem terms):</p>
<p>While liquids/solids MAY have their solubility increase with temperature depending on numerous physical chemical factors, it is not the rule. </p>
<p>To understand why, one must realize that all dissolution processes of liquids/solids are dynamic equilibrium reactions, meaning they constantly dissolve/precipitate out of the solution. This is true for all materials, even those that to the naked eye are immune to dissolution.</p>
<p>All equilibrium reactions follow the Le Chatelier-Braun principle, which states that stable equilibrium, if acted upon by an external force, will shift in the direction which minimizes the external force.</p>
<p>The equilibrium reaction can be split into two steps. First step is breaking up the bonds of the solid/liquid/gas (these can be primary bonds in case of ionic solids or van der waals forces in case of non-ionic solids), second step is the engulfing of the free particles in solution (called hydration for water). The first step always REQUIRES energy, while the second step always FREES energy. </p>
<p>If dissolving something REQUIRES more energy than it lets off, it is ENDOTHERMIC. Essentially, dissolving such an object will make the container feel COOL. By introducing more energy (heat) to the system, we fuel the reaction and we can observe the solute's concentration increasing proportional to temperature.</p>
<p>If dissolving something actually RELEASEs a net amount of energy, it is EXOTHERMIC. Essentially, dissolving such an object will make the container feel HOT. Based on the Le Chatelier-Braun principle described previously, we know that introducing more heat to this system will cause the dynamic equilibrium to shift in the direction that decreases the &quot;quantity&quot; of this external force. In this case, we want the amount of heat to remain as it were before the introduction of it, thus less solute will dissolve to limit the heat the reaction produces.</p>
<p>For gases, it's much more simple.</p>
<p>ELI5 (elementary school chem terms):</p>
<p>A liquid can be imagined as a collection of tiny round objects (this isn't exactly true, but it's close enough to the truth that we can ignore the errors this assumption makes) that are constantly trying to move around, but are prevented from doing so by their neighbors trying to keep them close (this is roughly the Van Der Waals forces previously mentioned). The more neighbors there are, the harder it is for a particle to move around. The harder the particle tries to move around, the less of an effect its neighbors have. </p>
<p>Gases, being strangers to our particles will still enjoy the same treatment once they enter the solution, but will be much less inhibited. By increasing the temperature, every particle will want to move around much more, and will thus bump each other towards the surface or other areas in a &quot;random&quot; manner (brownian motion). If something is bumped onto the surface, it will suddenly only have half as many particles trying to keep them close than when inside the solution. </p>
<p>By increasing the temperature, we increase the probability of a particle getting bumped onto the top of the solution and thus the probability of them having very high wish to move around freely without neighbors to tie them down. As a consequence, they will break free. </p>
<p>This process is why gas particles' dissolution in liquids is ALWAYS conversely proportional to the temperature of the system. Higher temperature -&gt; less gas dissolved. </p>
<p>This process, funnily enough, is also why hot liquids produce steam even before boiling. Liquids always produce steam (particles breaking free), but the higher the temperature, the more will be produced.  Boiling is simply when particles have so much energy, that they can break free even when completely surrounded (when steam production occurs in the interior of the solution.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What an obnoxiously written essay. How did you spend like 10 paragraphs to so poorly explain a simple concept? Maybe hold off trying to educate people until you at least graduate, hopefully by that point you will have learned to write in a less pedantic way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only way I’ve made clear ice is to insulate a mold so only the bottom is exposed, or have a mold upside down over an insulated container of water, so that gas and impurities are pushed out the mold opening into the standing water as the water in the mold freezes. </p></div>		</li>
