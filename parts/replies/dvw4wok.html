			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You could drink water. </p>
<p>The problem is absorbing too much water, too quickly. We call this &quot;water intoxication&quot; or &quot;water poisoning&quot;. Essentially, your body isn't able to process the water fast enough, so the cells try to fix the imbalance by absorbing the excess (which is what causes the problem). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer and it can happen even when you're not necessarily dehydrated so much. One of the best and off inside and cases is the radio station contest for a Nintendo Wii. I think a mother of three or something that was a contestant drank 5 gallons and died in the studio. Lots of people can die from over-hydration</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The autonomic response to being that dehydrated is just &quot;Drink.&quot; I also heard that in those two blasts that there were rain clouds that were &quot;seeded&quot; with radiation so it started raining heavily irradiated water, so if someone who wasn't killed by the initial blast drank the rainwater, <em>even if they didn't drink enough for toxicity,</em> the radiation in the water they drank would kill them pretty quickly.</p></div>		</li>
