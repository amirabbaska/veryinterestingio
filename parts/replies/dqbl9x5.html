<p>If you don't eat regularly your body will slow gut motility and this has the effect of increasing how much you absorb from your food. Anything that decreases gut motility will increase the metabolizable energy of food.</p>

<p>Is this where the idea of eating many small meals comes from?  I've always just considered overall calories in vs calories out rather than size or frequency of my meals.  But some will suggest that you should eat often in small amounts.  The quoted statement seems to imply that there is perfect balance (which is probably impossible to determine with accuracy) of calorie intake and timing that will keep gut motility at the right level to absorb the right amount of food - &quot;right&quot; being defined by whatever an individuals goals are.  Like if I fast all day and eat one giant meal my gut motility will be decreased and I'll metabolize more energy from that meal.  But if I eat too many small meals, I might get a lower % of metabolizable energey from each meal but I'll get more total calories.  Am I understanding that correctly?  Or no?</p>

<p>So drinking zero calorie sodas (like Coke Zero Sugar or Diet Dr. Pepper, which I love) causes one to metabolize more energy than they otherwise would from an accompanying snack?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The article is a review of several different peer-reviewed and other-type sources (all listed at the botton).</p>
<p>While there is no specific  answer here for comparing a diet coke to a snack, the overall result of the studies listed shows that yes, there is some kind of stimulation of energy storage (weight gain) that appears to be correlated with consumption of sugar substitutes, even if the only change in eating habits is switching to diet drinks. sugar substitutes here include saccharin (Sweet n Low, etc), sucralose (Splenda, etc), and aspartame (Coke Zero, the new Coke Zero Sugar, etc).</p>
<p>There is no conclusive explanation of the link, and per individual the reason may be unique to others. Sweeteners may or may not affect the body by: affecting gut flora, affecting insulin resistance, affecting eating habits (of course, disregard this reason in cases where the only change is switch to diet drinks), affecting a response from other as-of-yet unidentified metabolism genes.</p>

<p>One Giant Meal Vs Several Small Meals?</p>

<p>Sorry, but I would have trouble accepting a generalization on this one. I found a pretty much equal number of conflicting views. I’d say more importantly than searching for a number of meals to eat: follow a diet and lifestyle in general that keeps you regular. </p>
<p>Healthy gut motility is maintained/improved by getting enough fiber in diet, proper hydration (and electrolyte (Na, K, Ca etc) balance), occasional vigorous exercise, regular light-moderate exercise, reducing or eliminating chronic stress (getting enough sleep etc), and other factors I didn’t find surely.</p>
<p>This is just a list to start with. Some items affect some bodies more than others.</p>
<p>Edit: Correction: Multiple small meals is generally understood to be better for maintaining healthy gut motility.</p>
<p>Still, there is not necessarily any strong relationship between  weight-gain/weight-loss and number of meals each day. Good gut motility does not mean weight loss  if all the food moving through is high-fat high-sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/squeakbb already posted a great response regarding the relation of large versus small meals, gut motility and weight loss. Just to add on a bit more on the diet soda point. </p>
<p>Research has been trying to explain the correlation between non-nutritive sweetener consumption and weight gain for some time.  Some research is focused on its effect on gut flora but personally I don't find that explanation compelling alone due to the fact that aspartame (the predominate NNS in diet Coke) is not bioavailable in significant quantities in the colon, as it is rapidly absorbed in the SI. Also, there are certain non-nutritive sweeteners that cannot be broken down at all by the gut flora and pass through unimpeded. NNS's are a pretty diverse group outside of their ability to stimulate sweet-taste receptors so it's good for people when reading and interpreting research to not lump them all together outside of that characteristic.</p>
<p>There are 2 transporters responsible for glucose uptake in the SI, GLUT2 and SGLT1. SGLT1 is always present and is good at uptaking glucose at low concentrations and its expression is regulated by a sweet-taste receptor. Essentially the more you stimulate this sweet-taste receptor, the more SGLT1 transporters will be present in the membranes of your SI cells. SGLT1 is good at absorbing glucose at lower concentration levels but it gets saturated at higher concentrations. The gut responds to higher concentrations but sticking GLUT2 receptors in the apical (the side facing the lumen aka gut tube) membrane and GLUT2 receptors bolster glucose uptake. SGLT1 regulates GLUT2 apical insertion. Studies have shown NNS's DO increase SGLT1 expression, which would result in GLUT2 expression as well. </p>
<p>In your GI tract there are cells called neuroendocrine cells that secrete certain hormones that act on the liver to prime it for what's coming. These hormones, incretins, affect glucagon and insulin secretion by the liver. It's theorized that maybe NNS's increase incretin secretion as well, leading to increased insulin and glucagon secretion but the evidence is conflicting. Some animal studies have shown that yes, NNS will result in insulin secretion via incretins. However, studies that were done in fasting animals and humans showed no effect, indicating that NNS alone doesn't have a direct effect on incretin/insulin/glucagon and that maybe if it does have an effect, it is one that relies on glucose being there. </p>
<p>Sooo in short--it's looking promising that diet soda does increase glucose absorption via sweet taste receptors the same way a regular soda would. Is this mechanism enough to explain weight gain when glucose absorption is already pretty effective in the SI? I'm not sure. I'm also not sure what effect this has on the gut flora or how this mechanism affects fructose transit as desite the fact that SGLT1 doesn't transport fructorse, fructose increases SGLT1 expression. </p>
<p>I can tell you however, that SGLT1 is a big target for emerging anti-diabetic and anti-obesity therapies.  The most successful 'treatment' for obesity has been the Roux-en-Y surgical procedure--an invasive surgery that essentially bypasses the duodenum. The theory behind the success of the RYGB is now being linked to reduced SGLT1 action. </p>
<p>This was wayyy longer than I meant it to be! I'm a big fan of Diet Coke and I maintain without evidence that it brainwashes you until you can't drink anything else. But I personally try to limit to drinking it by itself and not in conjunction with meals. But honestly, the verdict is still out and this is just my personal preference really.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much! It's a topic I like to talk about haha. </p>
<p>I did my undergrad in molecular biology but physiology always interested me so I took a lot of coursework for it. I had a professor who wanted us to keep journals of research articles we read throughout the semester and this topic interested me so I ended up with about 100+ research articles and reviews that I later presented for a colloquium. So essentially, I just read a lot about it on my own but knowing the underlying physiology and having a good grasp on cell and molecular bio was helpful as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me that very small differences in digestive efficiency could have massive effects over a lifetime. If I use or store 92% of the calories I eat and some else uses or stores 94%, that’s 50 calories a day with a 2500 daily caloric intake. That’s a pound every 70 days or so or 5 pounds a year. Has anyone ever studied the calories content of human feces?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've definitely seen fecal and gas content analysis when it comes to studies trying to demonstrate how much artificial sweeteners and certain fiber is metabolized by the gut flora. Not specifically calorie content, but in order to see what is 'bioavailable' aka what actually makes it into our stomach into our system and what gets expelled. I do think this has been done in studies evaluating the accuracy of the Atwater system. </p>
<p>According to the paper below that did this, Atwater factors overestimate calories in low-fat high-fiber diets by up to 11% so there are significant calories at play. </p>
