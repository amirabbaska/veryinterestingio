			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to give an idea, the maximum transmission power for a WiFi device is generally 1W (I believe this is the FCC maximum). A microwave oven often operates at 1000 W.</p>
<p>So it's sort of like if 1 person is trying to shout over a room of 1000 people.</p>
<p>If your phone/router support the 5Ghz band, this may avoid interference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can I put 1000 wifi routers in a single location and microwave food with it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like microwave the room you put them in.</p>
<p>A microwave oven is designed to concentrate and contain the microwave radiation it uses to cook food, where as a router Is an omnidirectional microwave signal transmitter/reciever (think radio, but different frequency range, still light) the 1000 routers blast the signal everywhere so the whole room would be irradiated, and cooked.</p>
<p>In fact this is how microwave oven were invented. Microwaves were (still are) used for wireless communications. Techs who would find themselves in front of said industrial scale microwave transmitters noticed heating over their body, the effect was refined to cook food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most wifi routers don't do more than 100mw and then only intermittently. A thousand routers would dump very few microwaves in the room. The power supplies on the other hand would put out  thousands of watts  of heat. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That may be the absolute max for the regulations (not sure, didn't check), but normal consumer WiFi hardware doesn't even come close to that. Most come in around 20mW, and certain devices can be pumped up to maybe 100mW (generally only when using 3rd party firmware)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely- 1W would be absolutely absurd for a wifi signal.</p>
<p>The other thing people forget is that setting your router to 200mw doesn't help if your laptop can only do 50mw. Your laptop would be able to hear the router- but the router wouldn't be able to hear your laptop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Most enterprise APs max out at 100mW and there are restrictions on which antennas you can use because a high gain antenna at 100mW would transmit much further than any client could respond from. Only special purpose APs for outdoor deployments or radio backhaul transmit at higher powers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 20mW thing is due to the definition in the regulations. Antennas are directed. The 100mw definition only applies to a perfectly omnidirectional antenna, but that doesn't exist in real live. A normal stub antenna will have a gain 3 to 5dbi. That roughly increases the strength of the signal by a factor of 2 to 3.</p>
<p>You can actually buy adapters capable of sending much stronger signals. But in general you're not allowed to use them outside Bolivia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hi, </p>
<p>I can give a little bit of insight on this too. </p>
<p>You're right, and are using a good analogy. In the ISM band (2.4GHz) the rules for wireless radios are that you 'deal with interference'. <a href="http://file.scirp.org/Html/8-9801080/7aa0f806-9c62-4bf5-ae30-1c09e7756ab9.jpg" target="_blank">Microwaves happen to generate a <em>lot</em> of noise</a> which can interfere significantly with wireless lan radio signals. So depending on the modulation being used, transmit power, receive sensitivity, etc it can make connectivity quite difficult. Lots of other wireless technologies that operate in the ISM band can have a similar effect. </p>
<p>Modern WiFi Access Points can operate simultaneously in 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Some very new consumer APs can have 3 active WLANs, on in 2.4, one in lower 5 and one in upper 5. These are sometimes called &quot;tri band&quot; but it's a crappy name and a bit misleading. '</p>
<p>Anything non 2.4GHz should work perfectly fine around a microwave. However you'll generally get less range with any wireless radio the higher in frequency used, due to limitations in antenna design (antenna aperture). </p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair, There <em>are</em> real tri-band WLAN devices, namely those with support for 802.11ad (60GHz):

<p>The downside being that you need line-of-sight and few meters distance maximum for 60GHz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I put my Wi-Fi access point in the microwave oven, would a significant amount of the signal be blocked by the door mesh?</p>
<p>Edit - just did a little experiment, and yes, the microwave oven's door mesh does significantly shield against 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi signals.</p>
<p>Turned on the Wi-Fi hotspot on my cell phone and connected to my tablet. 10 feet away the signal strenth is about -30Db on the tablet, or full bars, when outside the microwave oven. When placed inside the microwave oven, the signal strength drops to about -75Db, or one bar, at the same distance. Marked and noticeable difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The door mesh can usually block up to 60dB of the signal, or 99.9999%, so a 2.4GHz router would get quite effectively isolated. If you were to use 5GHz WiFi... I'm not sure how much would the door mesh block in that case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much the same. The wavelength at 5Ghz is about 6cm, the holes in your microwave oven window are a couple mm at most, so it might as well be solid as far as the RF is concerned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on to this; your microwave with a closed door is meant to create a Faraday cage so that no electromagnetic radiation can escape or enter. </p>
<p>A quick and easy way to find out if your microwave's Faraday cage is working properly is to put your mobile inside the microwave (please don't turn the microwave on with your phone inside, obviously) and try to call it with another phone.
If there are no leaks then you shouldn't be able to get a signal on your phone. </p></div>		</li>
