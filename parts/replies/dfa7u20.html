			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't remove your antivirus. Shit can slip on very easily if you don't have it. There are some free ones that don't degrade performance because they <em>aren't constantly scanning or doing other things to eat up resources except during scheduled times or when you start a scan yourself.</em> I haven't noticed any slowdown from Comodo, which is free and doesn't nag you to buy their paid version. In fact, for a while I thought it didn't even <em>have</em> a paid version! But it sits quietly and doesn't use up much of anything unless you have it scan something or it notices that something's up.</p>
<p>Hell, I don't even notice when Comodo <em>scans</em>. It's very light on resources.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not if you do as I said: use a firewall, install updates, don't click on shitty links.</p>
<p>If you can find an antivirus suite which does <em>nothing</em> other than explicit scans, which does not install any drivers or browser plugins, does not MITM your TLS traffic, and so on, then yes, running its scans every once in a while is <em>probably</em> more or less harmless.</p>
<p>But if it does <em>any</em> of those things, then you are increasing your attack surface. And yes, Comodo <em>does</em> install a filter driver to process any and all I/O passing through. Which means that, if there is a vulnerability in that driver, simply downloading the right file, without even opening it, may compromise your computer. Exactly like happened <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/17/tavis_ormandy_zeroes_in_on_antivirus_remotecrash_bug/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Whether it slows down your computer is really a secondary concern. The bigger issue is that it makes you more vulnerable to attackers.</p>
<p>Both Chrome and Firefox devs have gone on record to say that AV software is the single biggest impediment that stops them from shipping a secure browser.</p>

<p>Don't firewalls end up being extremly paranoid and just block everything? Knowing most Windows programs, I'm pretty sure their firewall isn't gonna do much. And it'll probably fuck with Steam in ways that Google couldn't help me with. I seem to be cursed to have strange software problems under normal conditions that Google can't help with, and if I did something that would actually cause an issue? Whooooo boy.</p>
<p>That's just Symnatec being stupid. I don't use Norton or McAfee because they're shit.</p>
<p>I prefer to have a couple of layers of security. An adblock to stop malvertising, Malwarebytes and Comodo to check anything I download, and I run scans with those should I notice anything unusual. I haven't been hit by anything yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Performance is not the <em>primary</em> goal of antivirus software, but one of the main competition points <em>is</em> performance - so they do care.</p>
<p>Calling all antivirus software &quot;crap&quot; is a crap statement. The reality is that writing antivirus software is (much, much) harder than writing a virus. </p>
<p>Minimizing &quot;risky behaviors&quot; such as clicking risky links helps, but there have been bugs in image libraries that have been exploited before. Keep some sort of antivirus active, and for your mother's sake, do backups.</p>
<p>Most good security suites also include backup, which is an essential part of security anyway. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I didn't. I said that MSE is generally competent, and you should feel free to use that.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yep. And AV software often hasn't caught it. There have also been bugs in AV software that has been exploited before. <em>Many</em> times.</p>
<p>I already responded to another commenter with some sources to back up what I'm saying, but I'll at least drop <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/antivirus-is-bad/" target="_blank">this</a> excellent article, which quotes some actual security experts.</p>
<p>One of the key ways to achieve security is to minimize your attack surface. The less software is installed, and the less software has privileged access to your computer, the better. And AV software is horrible because it runs with full privileges, and often even installs kernel-mode components. And they tend to install browser addons and filter drivers to process any and all I/O, and often even install custom certificates to man-in-the-middle your presumed encrypted internet traffic. And vulnerabilities have been found in <em>all</em> of those components at one time or another, leaving the users <em>more</em> vulnerable than if they hadn't run AV at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, before cellphones, when I used a computer for most of my internet surfing, it got to where the AV programs would mess up my computer so much that it got to where I would fairly frequently restore my laptop to factory condition and start over. It was quicker that way. I think their &quot;holistic&quot; virus hunts deleted more necessary code than actual malware.</p></div>		</li>
