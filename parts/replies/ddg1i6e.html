			<div class="markdown"><p>What about an odd number having an east or west designation. Such as I35E or I35W near Dallas? Are those just separated branches of the highway that still run North and South but are on the East and West side of the city?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, my brother lived in Dallas, and from what i can remember I35E goes through Dallas and I35W goes through Fort Worth and they merge back together again as you get further north of those two cities. Think of it as, you're heading north on I-35 and you come to a fork in the road, the left side is the west side to forth worth and the right side is the east side to Dallas. Once you pass through either city the two interstates will merge back together again and become, simply I-35 again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a 35E and 35W in Minnesota as well, and it sounds like the exact same idea. They separate in the southern suburbs, 35W goes to Minneapolis and 35E goes to St. Paul. They merge back together north of the cities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of the opposite of what happens in Atlanta, 75 and 85 merge for a short time in the heart of the city, then split again and go each on their merry way after. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I-35 is the Only interstate that does this, and it does it twice. Once in Minneapolis, and St. Paul, MN, and then again in Fort Worth, and Dallas, TX.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes. 35E takes an eastwardly direction but it still northbound. Same goes for 35W. There are other interstate highways that are marked for one direction (using the even and odd numbering system) but are actually the opposite.
