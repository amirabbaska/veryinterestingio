			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems like a slight waste of fuel, why wouldn't they just account for the rotational velocity and drag and stop gimballing a little bit before reaching the desired angle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably easier to burn a little more fuel to kill the turn promptly than calculate your cut -off to coast there, plus as those velocities a wobble can pick up quite quickly.</p>
<p>I'd think you'd want to switch into a guidance mode that'd kill deviations asap if for no other reason than the aerodynamic one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity alone can't change the angle of the rocket. It doesn't exert any torque, it just works straight through the CG. If the thrust is also straight through the CG you cannot turn. </p>
<p>e: I didn't think this through carefully enough when wording it, and what I said was misleading.  Certainly gravity affects the trajectory of the rocket; however, the rocket won't be rotated by gravity such that it looks the way we expect (i.e. the long axis is aligned with the velocity axis).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Gravity and CG thrust don't provide a torque, but atmospheric drag does.  Since rockets are (usually) aerodynamically stable, in the lower and middle atmosphere they tend to point in the direction of motion.</p>
<p>That direction of motion, however, is not constant (in the reference frame rotating with Earth).  In particular, the net (thrust+gravity) force is not aligned with the rocket's prograde, so the flight path tends to flatten over time.  The atmospheric drag then provides the torque required, even absent active control elements.</p></div>		</li>

With a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gravity_turn_-_phase_2.svg" target="_blank">diagram</a> where you represent the rocket velocity and acceleration with vectors you can easily see that when you add the forces the resulting velocity vector has slightly lower inclination than the original velocity vector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is literally vectored thrust. However, its done using different components than you would with a jet engine, because, well, it's a different type of engine. The rocket nozzle itself is rotated a bit. In jet aircraft with thrust vectoring, the gas leaves the engine straight but is then deflected by a surface placed in the way of the stream.</p></div>		</li>
