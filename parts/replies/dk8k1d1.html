			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Any physical change will classify it as a physical addiction, and it will also have physical withdraw symptoms. You can think of a mental dependence as an intense desire for the altered mental state caused by the drug.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Watching a movie causes physical changes in the brain that are now detectable. Where do we draw the line?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can think it like this: your body always tries to mantain an equilibrium. In this case we are talking about stress, so let's say your body normally strives to mantain an arbitrary &quot;stress level&quot; of 50.</p>
<p>If you get stressed for a long amount of time, your brain sees it as wrong and tries to make up for that trough stress reducing chemicals or will to engage in stress reducing activities, but it is also the other way around. </p>
<p>Weed reduces your stress level, so if you use weed once, it's fine. But if you use it all the times, it starts to release stress inducing chemicals because it wants to keep the &quot;stress level&quot; at the normal value, 50 (in nature being too relaxed would cause you to get killed). If you suddenly stop to take weed, the body still continues to release these stress inducing chemicals and you get stressed, so you want to engage in stress reducing activities, the one your brain is more used to is smoking weed. However if you manage to endure the stress for while, your body will register the &quot;no weed&quot; status as normality and will tone down the production of stress inducers.</p></div>		</li>
