			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. I think it's interesting to understand the intrinsic cost of providing the service vs the cost of operating the business and pricing. Obviously this model was chosen to maximize profitability but I think there's a certain level of fairness expected by consumers today. I think it's important for scientists and engineers to keep people informed about how Data is delivered and what kinds of actual costs are involved in delivery. I believe true costs are very obscured by ISPs pricing and make it challenging for the consumer to tell what they are actually buying. </p></div>		</li>
