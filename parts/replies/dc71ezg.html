			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a really fascinating subject, and gets even more interesting when you understand the basis of WHY heat flows. I recommend you check out some of the educational youtube channels talking about thermodynamics and if you are really interested look for some elementary explanations of how &quot;Statistical mechanics&quot; works without getting lost in the math.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The problem seems to be that engineers still need to be plugged in to the relationships between all those empirically discovered quantities, which are vital for optimising steam engines (or whatever) but make little intuitive sense. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hotdog will still radiate heat. It puts out electro magnetic energy (largely infrared) and loses heat energy. That em is absorbed by whatever your box is made of, which would then radiate it outwards again, as well as conduct it into the air outside the box.</p>
<p>Being in vacuum it will stay hot a lot longer than if it was in contact with a medium, but it will cool eventually.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>as /u/ZiIIah notes, if the box were perfectly insulating—and no such box exists, or can exist—you don't need the vacuum. If you did have such a box then what would happen is that the hotdog, air in the box, and inner surface of the box would come to equilibrium through exchange of electromagnetic radiation—mostly infra-red light. The hotdog would get a bit cooler until equilibrium was reached, and then the whole thing would remain at constant temperature. But, you can't have a perfectly insulated box.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a perfectly insulated box doesn't exist</p>
<p>you can simulate one by putting back into the box all the energy it loses via radiation and convection (at which point you have your basic combi oven, keeping your hotdog hot)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't heat a phenomenon/cause of the actual flow of energy due to a difference in temperature, and as such it's not actual energy and doesn't &quot;exist&quot; in the object?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes-  internal energy is not the same as heat.  Internal energy is a state function (a property of the state of a system)  while heat is a transfer of energy.  I wouldn't agree that radiative energy transfer is not heat, except when the energy transfer is from a system far from equilibrium (like a laser).</p></div>		</li>
