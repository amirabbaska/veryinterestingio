			<div class="markdown"><p>Tomahawks carry an explosive load of around 500 kg. That is a pretty decent explosive and will destroy anything near it and light structures in a decent area around, but it is also not <em>that</em> much destructive power.</p>
<p>Bombs thrown from bombers in WWII were around 250 or 500 kg, so they will solidly destroy a house they hit, but that basically was it. If you shoot at military bases you shoot at hardened targets that are (also) intentionally placed with decent space from each other, so the radius of destruction is limited further.</p>
<p>Therefore, you use more bombs and target them exactly at all buildings you want to hit, so you still get to destroy all fuel tanks, all buildings, all garages, munition depots and all garden houses or parked planes and vehicles. But it does not look as destroyed as if you had carpet bombed it with a wing or five of actual bombers. </p>
<p>The interesting thing about Tomahawks is that they can be fired from 100s of miles away, fly below the radar and still destroy a specific, picked target (parked planes, fuel depots, command structures) so that it is militarily &quot;disabled&quot;. </p>
<p>If you want a Tomahawk to do real damage, you can use one that carries a nuke. But that is an entirely different matter. If you want to do really massive &quot;bomber damage&quot; you need to send in the B2s and B52s or (and?) have other planes do runs with cluster bombs. That operatation needs much more preparation then sending some orders to two destroyers which then empty their missile bays... </p>
<p>edit: Do not worry about downvotes, I just got one as well. There probably is some bot or human tool just downvoting for the sake of it...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which still is &quot;100s of miles&quot;, that's good enough for ELI5. </p>
<p>I read somewhere that it has 1000 miles in range, but that probably depends on the specific model, fuel loadout and probably warhead. If you scale the explosives down to 250 kg, you can probably put more fuel into it and as such extend the range. Yes, wikipedia states they can put a booster on it to extend the range.</p>
<p>But for this scope here I doubt it matters much if it is 800, 1000 or  1500 miles. The point is you have a basically a self-propelled, all-the-way-steerable, low flying bomb, precise delivery mechanism that costs around 800000 per piece for dropping a few hundred kg of explosives (or a nuke) whereever you want them and that can be fired from pretty mobile ships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also heard something about this when using missiles versus actually having US planes carpet bomb the area. While those missiles were solely used to demilitarize the airbase, having actual US planes in the area creates more of an incentive for the US to be negatively involved in the situation. Something about actual US presence being over Syrian soil can create a lot of hype which can lead to much worse scenarios.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably yes. You can create <em>massive</em> airbursts and extreme heat with those. </p>
<p>They are very effective against humans, anything that can burn (they create a really intense heat and heat-radiation) and the blastwave travels around corners and through caves, cellars and tunnels (non-ELI5: basically ripping people's lungs, even though they are in cover and behind three turns). The more conventional bombs are smaller in radius, but completely do destroy what is near them. I do not know how well thermobarics work against hardened targets, that conventional bombs would take down.</p>
<p>Afaik Tomahawks do not come with thermobarics, there's an option for cluster bomb warheads. They might have used some of those on parked aircraft/fuel depots/...? I do not know, if it makes sense from a tactical perspective, they possibly did.</p>
<p>It all comes down to what you want to achieve, and in this case they wanted to &quot;disable the military function of the base&quot;, which the bombs that got used did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do more damage than people are implying, certainly.  </p>
<p>For reference, <a href="http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55316342ecad046c1a8b4567-1200-1091/ap511720987539.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> is the OK City bombing.</p>
<p>We dropped ~30,000kg on Syria.  That is more than about 13 OK City bombs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The large damage on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was that is collapsed was that the columns in the building was destroyed and it then collapsed when it could not hold up its own weight. </p>
<p>Most of the casualties there was because of the collapse not the blast wave.  </p>
<p>Structures on a military airbase is not build like that so the damage will be smaller. They struck hardened aircraft shelter ans ammunitions storage.</p>
<p>And the strike was also on the runway. The Oklahoma City bomb created a 30-foot-wide (9.1 m), 8-foot-deep (2.4 m) crater in the street. That is on a normal street and runways are thicker so multiple smaller explosions have a had time destroying them. Destroying a runway is hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did it pretty great during WWII.  With single bombs.  This was a show of force, not an attempt to actually destroy anything.  We have bombs that DO destroy those structures.</p>
<p>JMEWS just came out, and they were testing it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes when runways are built like an office, and Tomahawk missiles have pure explosive warheads, and when they all strike the same spot at the same time you could expect greater effect than the OK city bombing. </p></div>		</li>
