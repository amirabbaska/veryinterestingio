			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't upvote this enough. Though I have a few minor issues with this, not with what you wrote specifically, but with the way the different countries are approaching the problem. ISIS poses an existential threat to every regime in the Middle East. I firmly believe that 3-4 years into their appearance as a political and military force in the Syrian Civil War, and the region as a whole, the gulf monarchies still haven't quite realized this. Iran and Iraq seem to be the only countries that are completely invested in the complete destruction of the group, and I believe its because, as you pointed out in the Iraq section, the governments are largely (or completely in the case of Iran) Shia. If Isis were to consolidate control in Iraq and Syria, odds are Lebanon and/or Iran would be next. </p>
<p>That aside, I have to bring into question what is the fixation with Yemen. It's the poorest country in the region. Is it in Saudi Arabia's backyard? Yes. But it holds no true military or economic power, the country is heavily divided into tribes and the fact that AQAP has some sway in the country. It seems to me that its much more trouble than its worth. </p>
<p>Lastly, I think that stating that the regional powers will crush Isis in a day is a little simplistic. ISIS is much more than a military body you can physically crush. It's an ideology that some, but not all, of its members will carry with them after the &quot;central power&quot; is crushed, and odds are that they will continue to carry out attacks, similar to what happened in Iraq after Saddam was taken out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) ISIS as an existential threat to the Sunni regimes</p>
<p>Eventually, yes. This is one of the reasons why Saudi and the UAE work very hard to take down rival Sunni groups who do not buy into their ideology. See what happend to Morsi, for example. However, the support of ISIS is a dance with the devil. Saudi, for example, has a large and strong Shia population. If Iran were to win in Iraq and Syria, the next stage would be to support revolts in Saudi. Secondly, a paramilitary organization which is almost universally viewed unfavorably in their nation is much less of an existential threat to Saudi than a nation state which is expanding its sphere of influence rapidly and can weaponize Shi'ism for geopolitics. </p>
<p>2) Yemen is central to the Iran strategy. Saudi feels like now as Germany did prior to WWI. If Iran were to win in Syria and Iraq, there would be a giant Shia superstate to the north and Yemen to the south. Saudi would be fighting a two front war. </p>
<p>3) ISIS is not an Islamic ideology that has any real appeal to anyone. I've read transcripts of captured ISIS recruiters and had legal access to their propaganda machine. ISIS' main line in their recruitment, almost 100%, is their opposition to what they call Western Imperialism. ISIS supported attacks take place mostly in three places: Iraq, Syria, and the Western world. The others are usually copy cat attacks and are very few and far between. They will sputter out as ISIS is defeated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree ISIS has proven to some to be a workable alternative to westaphilian constructs so much so that I think it will dramatically alter the future of the region decades after they vanish. The reason why is simple, accounts from people who lived under their rule said they governed and provided services more efficiently than any other regional government despite their brutality. ISIS didn't just negotiate their way using power politics with selfish regional actors but also with the populations. The sunni tribes are a prime example, as ISIS protected them from shia oppression. But most importantly is now people got a taste of what an effient govern looks like and it is unfortunately was theocratic and pan Islamist in nature. The many instruction manuals, accounts and guide books ISIS developed during this time will spread to other groups and take a life of its own, not unlike how US later used Nazi scientific research. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I feel like this was the most important thing he overlooked. It is REALLY hard to fight an ideology rather than a nation state. There are no clearly defined combatants. In a weird way it would be easier to fight ISIS once they can solidified a physical area they claim as their own that isn't constantly changing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ISIS is not seen as an existential threat to these nations and ignored for another reason not to talked about, because US exists as a superpower. That's the killswitch they can rely on if their war games take a wrong turn. It's why Iraqis fled right away as ISIS approached. Having said that, we saw the same thing with mongols and there was no superpower to take care of things so I may be wrong.  But still same mentality of &quot;I will use these new guys against my ancient foe, before taking them on&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to make some additions why it is specifically difficult to fight ISIS in Syria and Iraq. </p>
<p>Syria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assads main objective is to defeat the opposition first, because that is how the Syrian Civil War will be won. The opposition not ISIS gets massive support from abroad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISIS occupies territory that is pretty much irrelevant for the war, the agglomerations of Syria are almost exclusively on a small stripe in the west (that is where the clashes with the opposition take place). The only thing that is of interest in ISIS territory is Oil, but conveniently for the Syrian government ISIS sells it to Assad for dumping prices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Assad Isis is not the main threat and once the opposition is
dismantled or at least forced to fight on with asymmetric means only, Assad will have an easy endgame against ISIS. </p>
</li>
<li>ISIS is in the Syrian Civil War pretty much irrelevant when it comes to numbers of combatants, factually spoken ISIS is the smallest faction that fights in the civil war, therefore its really not that of a threat for Assad and the opposition, especially because the Western- and Russian-backed Kurds do the best to contain it and put as much pressure on it as they can, even  try to push to Ar-Raqqa. (second biggest city Isis occupies)    </li>
</ul>
<p>Iraq: </p>
<ul>
<li>ISIS has massive support of the Sunni population which is politically sidelined since Saddams defeat </li>
<li>It has military skilled assets, because  Ba'ath-Party loyalist fighting with ISIS and are probably even more numerous than ISIS itself. </li>
<li>Airstrikes are only limited possible because a massiv bombing on Mosul (precivilwar: 600,000 citizens) will just let the support for ISIS grow and further escalate the conflict, potentially even to a scale comparable with the Syrian one. Therefore the (ongoing) capturing of Mosul is dirty and very slow urban warfare even though the Peshmerga and Iraqi forces are outnumber ISIS almost by a factor of 10. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing what happens when you assume balance of power/balance of threat politics is obsolete, right? The most amazing thing is that the Nat Sec establishment in DC still continues to peddle the institutionalist/neo-liberal fantasies of post-power politics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every ideology has its place in time, right now neo liberalism is exposed as a lie but in the future who knows. It has worked great in Europe and with Asia, it's just failed in middle east because the intentions were corrupted. It just no longer serves its purpose, we actually need to confront China, we don't need Europe or the middle east. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of our relationship with KSA. If you look at it culturally, we fit much, much better with Iran as our key ally. They are substantially better on human and women's rights. But we've been in bed with the Saudis for 60 years, and a lot of Iranians still resent us for overthrowing their first democratically elected leader. So here we are, our closest ally besides Israel doesn't allow women to drive and essentially allows indentured servitude for foreign workers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not 100% sure what you would like to know.</p>
<p>There is sort of a miniature cold war going on along shia-sunni lines. Iran and allies (mainly Assadist Syria, Shia Muslims in Yemen) on one side, Saudi Arabia and allies (like the gulf states) on the other. Also Turkey...somewhere, trying to pursue it's own interests and security concerns.</p>
<p>When the US invaded Iraq, they made the decision to remove people that were formerly members of the Baath party from public offices. The thing is, in near-totalitarian regimes, like Saddam's Iraq, party membership isn't really optional for most functions. As a result, the Americans essentially dismantled public works, social structure, and most importantly, the military- and security apparatus. </p>
<p>Iraq has a majorly Shia population, with a very significant Sunni minority. Under Saddam, the ruling Sunni minority oppressed the Shia Muslims. After the invasion, the Shia Muslims were put into power and now in their turn oppressed the shit out of their former overlords.</p>
<p>This Shia-Sunni split, combined with the power vacuum created by the disassembly of the security apparatus left an opening that was filled by al-Baghdadis group, at the time connected to Al-Quaida.</p>
<p>Also, Iraq became a key strategic partner of Shia Iran, despite these two not long previously having fought an extremely destructive war and being long-time rivals.</p></div>		</li>
