<p>a kilo, or a ton, or a megaton of gold</p>

<p>All of these are infinitesimally small amounts compared to the amount generated. It is likely a large number of orders of magnitude more than a megaton.</p>
<p>The earths crust has 0.004 ppm of gold in it and from google we can at least get an estimate that it weighs on the order of ~10^19 tonnes. This gives a figure of 40000 megatons of gold in just the earths crust.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, how many megatons of gold, platinum, silver, and copper does, say, a minimally sized supernova generate?</p>
<p>(And what do we need to do to harness such a star and bring it close to earth so we can get all those tasty metals? Or is there a flaw in my master plan? ;-) )</p></div>		</li>

<p>The first flaw would be the colossal amounts of energy required to change the velocity of a supernova-capable star and move it in a direction you wanted it to go. Preferably over a time period in which the human race and the solar system would still be around to enjoy it. Then you'd have to alter the momentum of the star a second time in order to &quot;park&quot; it into a nearby orbit. </p>
<p>Would you build enormous rockets? Would you build some kind of framework capable of applying force to a gigantic fusion reactor without melting? Would you use some kind of gravity sling? Build a gigantic rocket engine <em>around</em> the star capable of shaping its energy output into thrust? Any way you approach the problem of moving a star, you are likely to find the solution far more costly than the value of materials. </p>
<p>Another flaw is that, when all was said and done, you would wind up with a star going supernova in relatively close proximity to our solar system. That could be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyKQe_i9yyo" target="_blank">bad</a>. </p>
<p>A third flaw would be gravitation perturbations and how they might mess up the orbits of the planets, Oort Cloud objects, etc. But that problem seems small and niggling compared to #2 above.</p></div>		</li>
