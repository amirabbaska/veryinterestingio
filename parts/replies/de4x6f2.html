			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, the &quot;stall&quot; as they call it, is a function of bearing yo-yos, as in the yo-yo's baring allow the yo-yo to store the kinetic energy by spinning without stopping.</p>
<p>Again, that is a function that can happen perpendicular to the ground. It may fall to the ground during a stall over an arc, but in zero gravity, the stall would remain in place, until you jerk the string and get the yo-yo on the return phase.</p></div>		</li>
