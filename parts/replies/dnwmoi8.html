<p>As it happens, &quot;dose makes the poison&quot; is a rule of thumb.  There exist a number of substances with what are called non-monotonic toxicology curves.  You get a little of the substance, the body doesn't notice and takes damage.  You get more, the body notices and handles the damage.  You get more, the body runs out of resources to handle the damage but doesn't notice it ran out of resources and so it takes more damage.  You get more, an entirely different system notices and absorbs the substance through an entirely separate route.</p>
<p>You see this pattern everywhere once you start looking for it.</p></div>		</li>
