			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly the case for me. The problem solving challenge is the motivation. Once the problem is solved, which seldom requires actually <em>completing</em> the problem, the joy and motivation are gone. It’s definitely not laziness, because I’m then ready to move on to a new problem and so on and so on.</p>
<p>It just means more to me that I do it in my mind than that I do it in actuality. Now, when others are depending on me, then of course that outward obligation will carry me to the finish line. But you are correct in that it more often than not feels like busy work once the thought problems are solved. And for the sake of others (friends, family, coworkers), I’ve finished many tasks. When asked, “Now don’t you feel a sense of accomplishment for completing this?” Honestly, no, not really. I felt the accomplishment earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, it does seem like the challenge is often part of the motivation. You're more engaged when the problem requires you to push yourself to succeed. When you can see a clear path to the end it no longer requires you to be as engaged and can get tedious.</p></div>		</li>
