			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always heard this to be the right answer but would appreciate more information on why this doesn't result in places like southern China or Florida that are on roughly the same latitude as the Sahara being dry (and in fact those places are very wet).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Proximity to bodies of water, elevation, and terrain features all play a roll in that. Florida is a low elevation peninsula which is surrounded by water. Southeastern China is a low lands region which is bordered by the Yellow Sea. Look at India as well, it is along a known latitude for deserts but it has quite a substantial wet and dry season. Due to wind patterns and the location of the Himalayas. Not to say thats always the case though. Geography does a lot of interesting things</p></div>		</li>
