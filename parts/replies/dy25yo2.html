<p>An infant's laugh seems to just be an expression of joy.  But humor is different, it's joy derived from violations of logic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm curious about your source for this, but I learned it as a reaction to reality not being align with the expected reality (I think it's called incongruity theory).  Of course some of humor in adults occurs when we can predict the outcome, but that humor most comes from the unexpected, and that toddlers - who have experienced so little in the world and can't really expect anything - are amused by almost everything because it is all new to them.</p>
<p>Of course this is also just one possible explanation of this, but I was wondering if your idea has evidence that I can read.</p></div>		</li>
