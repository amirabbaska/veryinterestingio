<p>Fun fact: each of the five Saturn V engines' <em>fuel pumps</em> had 55000 horsepower, pumping 670 gallons of fuel and oxygen per second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget about the fourth big one of &quot;Balancing/Steering&quot;. Rockets are unstable since all their power comes from the back end. Think of it like steering a boat, if your front end drifts a little bit to the left or right and you don't adjust your boat will quickly start to go more and more off course. Now imagine trying to do that at high speeds and with much less ability to steer and you'll understand why so many early rockets went up and then flew in terrible directions (like doing a 180 into the ground).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Counter-intuitively, it doesnâ€™t matter that much if the thrust is behind or in front of the center of mass. In the early days, they experimented with rockets with the engines on top, but they were not any more stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Tx4cjP-GRAY" target="_blank">source</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The OP was asking about engines specifically, but at least as many failures occurred from system control issues. Not necessarily that the problem is super hard. It's just regular hard nowadays. But because they had to do it all with early 60's technology. I suspect the N1 would have flown if they had half the computing power of my phone.</p>
<p>Oddly, digital control has it's own pathologies. The first Ariane 5 was lost from an integer overflow. A few months ago the Russians lost a rocket by programming it to think it had come from a different facility than the one it was actually launched from. I think SpaceX uses digital control on their engines, allowing better restarts and throttling. But evidently they can't predict how much igniter fluid (hypergol) they need in different conditions (old engines just use the same amount each time). Hence the recent failure to recover the Falcon Heavy core.</p></div>		</li>
