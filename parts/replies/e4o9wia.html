			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a dream the other day where I was living in an old apartment that I used to live in 8 years ago. In that dream I recalled the exact floor I was on and a good friend of mine that lived all the way on the end of the hall. In the dream I remember looking at the exact door number. When I woke up, I called my friend to verify if that was the right door number and it WAS! As of now, I can't even remember the floor number or his room number.  I tried to search my mind and I can't even find anything remotely helpful in my memories to pull that information back out. How can that even be possible?? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait wait, so you called your friend in reality right? Did he forget it too?</p>
<p>In my experience, the THOUGHT that you had it right, and actually having it right are two completely different things. </p>
<p>One day, I failed at remembering a mathematical proof on an exam.</p>
<p>At night, I recalled it! I woke up right after that dream and was soo amazed by it that I wrote it down. In the morning I looked at what I had written down. Guess what: total gibberish! </p></div>		</li>
