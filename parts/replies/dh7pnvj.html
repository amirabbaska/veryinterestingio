			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, two blue eyed parents can only have blue eyed children.  The same is true for red hair, as it is also autosomal recessive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true, actually. Blue eyed parents can indeed have a brown eyed child, it's just not very common. Eye color is controlled by more than one gene, so many genetic interactions control it. Many peeps think that it's as simple as bb x bb but it ain't. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There is at least two genes that control eye color.  Evidently one of them is much more common than the other because you are usually right... simple Bb genetics usually explains eye color.  But if you read the link another gene can come in and create blue eyes even though you carry brown-eyed information on the other gene.</p></div>		</li>
