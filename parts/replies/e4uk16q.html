<p>I really hope they do this. Hubble was such a revolutionary instrument, it should be in the Smithsonian, not charred scrap at the bottom of the ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Hubble as downmass does not preclude another payload as upmass.  They could launch a new telescope and bring back the old telescope.  They could launch a dozen unrelated satellites and bring back the old telescope.  They could launch a new space station and bring back the old telescope.  The BFR being reusable is coming back regardless.  </p>
<p>Or it could simply be a demonstration on a BFR test flight of it's downmass capability basically using Hubble as the downmass simulator like the Falcon Heavy used a Tesla Roadster as an upmass simulator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is sort of what the Space Shuttle did. At some point building a new telescope becomes the better option, especially as ground-based telescopes can more more and more do what Hubble can at a fraction of the cost. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Technology_Large-Aperture_Space_Telescope" target="_blank">ATLAST</a> could fly before Hubble's time ends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is the possibility to do that. Mission 4 to the Hubble installed a soft capture system to the telescope.</p>
<p>This gives NASA options on what to do with it the Soft Capture System could be used to either boost or effect a controlled deorbit. It does not need a manned mission to do this with the SCM. Though NASA is struggling for funds so it is anyone's guess which way it goes. It depends on what day and what time you ask NASA about the Hubble </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing lasts forever.  </p>
<p>It's kind of like a car. It can work for a long time, and you can fix it, but eventually too many things start wearing out and the cost becomes prohibitive. We could boost it only to have the fine guidance sensors or camera break down. So we go up and spend more money fixing those only to have something else break. Pretty soon we've spent more than building a new one would have cost. </p>
<p>NASA was actually given a few 'Better than Hubble' telescopes by the Military a few years ago. A space telescoping pointing the other way is a spy satellite. So far there is no budget for the high cost to add the necessary hardware and launch them, but that could change and would arguably be cheaper than repairing and boosting hubble. Plus they are have better optics than Hubble. Though as time goes on technology advances and we could do even better starting from scratch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with your first paragraph, but your second is in error. NASA is currently developing a mission around one of the donated telescopes, called WFIRST. It is the flagship mission that will follow James Webb. It will have a field of view 100 times larger than Hubble, but at the same resultion (in the infrared). It's coronagraphic instrument will test the technologies to directly image earth like planets in future missions. It is being supported by Congress, but the last president's budget proposal tried to cancel it. Congress usually gets it's way when it comes to the budget, but it never hurts to tell your representative and senators how you feel about upcoming space missions.</p>
<p>Edit: I meant to say that this year roughly $100m dollars will be invested in WFIRST and next year it will get more if the president signs the budget legislation. The Senate's proposed funding amount for 2019 was optimal for the earliest possible launch date and cheapest possible build cost (spending more early makes things cheaper in the long run). Launch would be roughly 2025, but JWST delays are likely to affect that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately, I think the most likely answer is that Hubble will stay operational until it breaks - the costs of repair are so high, it will be difficult to argue for a repair mission, but until then, the returns of maintaining operation are still very good. </p>
<p>James Webb has some overlap with Hubble, but we will actually have an increase in science returns using both at the same time, as they observe different wavelengths.</p></div>		</li>

<p>JWST launching is not a given. It may never fly IMO. I read an article about new research in adaptive optics that sounded like if it could be scaled it would obsolete JWST, possibly before it even launches given the constant delays and budget over runs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can already observe at a higher spatial accuracy than the JWST, under the right conditions.  The game changer for JWST is that it sits above the Earth's atmosphere, allowing it to have a much greater sensitivity than ground-based telescopes (100x that of Keck and 1000x that of VLT) - and that is at wavelengths that we are able to observe from the surface. There are gaps in transmission that are basically impossible to observe from Earth's surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The delays and budget overruns are mostly due to trying to build a spacecraft with a pile of new, experimental technology. I don't know much about the practicality or commercial viability of either its current technology or this newer stuff, but I strongly doubt that replacing the current new and experimental technology with even newer and more experimental technology will get it off the ground sooner.</p></div>		</li>
