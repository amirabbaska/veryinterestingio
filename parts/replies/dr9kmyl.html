			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me add one of my images for that: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/JXMzU" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/JXMzU</a></p>
<p>This is not technically a lightbulb, it's the kathode of a scanning electron microscope. Material, shape and wear mechanism are close enough, though. If you won't mention it, it'll pass as a lightbulb. </p>
<p>Minor addition: As you can see in the image, the arcing <em>when</em> the filament fails can cause nearby secondary parts to melt as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not intentionally interpolated, at least. There are two problems: secondary electrons are exiting the filament preferredly at the sharp edges, leading to higher brightness. This is partially what gives the image depth, and we need this to show topography, however it reduces the focus on fine detail. Problem two is that it was originally stored as bitmap, then converted to png. Then I reopened that png in GIMP, cropped parts off and saved it again. And I'm sure that does not actually help image quality :)</p>
<p>The sharpness was adjusted on the melting striations on the top of the molten ball in the top quarter of the image. Anything outside of there is slightly out of focus anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, that one uses a carbon filament, which does have the advantage over tungsten in that the evaporated carbon tends to resettle back onto the filament.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The main cost of an incandescent bulb is not in the purchase price. It is in the electricity used for a given light level (lumens/watt). The 116 year old bulb is a failure in that respect. Any low wattage incandescent bulb will last decades if you run it at half voltage. </p></div>		</li>
