<p>I disagree with this terminology.  It is simply a mass balance, but there isn't a concentration of salt in freshwater bodies that needs to be &quot;drained&quot;.  It is simply a balance of salt in = salt out in freshwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit:  They have fresh water precisely because mass in doesn't always equal mass out.  </p>
<p>Mass in doesn't equal mass out instantaneously and there is nothing forcing those to be equal.  If the salt concentration in the lake were to be transformed into the same concentration as that of the ocean or any other high value (there are all sorts of nontypical events that could create such a scenario) we know that over time the concentration would be reduced as the salt water drains out to the ocean and relatively fresh water is supplied by rainfall once the nontypical event is turned off.  </p>
<p>Lakes have fresh water, not because they can't have salt water, but because when they do have salt water it becomes fresh over time because of what the inputs are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes more sense to me than the &quot;draining&quot; explanation. Crater Lake in Oregon has no rivers in or out; water regulation is mainly from evaporation and rain (and snow) fall. Evaporation would tend to increase salt concentration, right? But the rain and snow are sources of fresh water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the equilibrium is driven towards very low concentrations -- if you dump a bunch of salt in, it will return to fresh.  &quot;Drain&quot; does capture this.</p></div>		</li>
