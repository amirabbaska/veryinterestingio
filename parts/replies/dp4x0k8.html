			<div class="markdown"><p>It might help to remember that vitamins are just chemicals like all the rest of what the body needs. But the reason they're vitamins is that our bodies can't naturally produce its own. Like vitamin C, its just ascorbic acid and is a vitamin for humans, but other animals can produce it in their bodies naturally, so to them, its not a vitamin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That question would be how vitamins is synthesized/extracted. Not how you put the in a pill.</p>
<p>How you make the is different for each one and there are som description on the Wikipedia for each one. </p>
<p>There is a pdf for the production of Vitamin C
<a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120119194657/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/2001/fulltext/456a4.2.pdf" target="_blank">http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120119194657/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/2001/fulltext/456a4.2.pdf</a></p>
<p>It look like you use Glucose a sugar and convert it to Sorbitol with som high temperature reaction. Then there is two fermentation steps with a micro-organisms and the you convert the output to Vitamin C with som chemical reaction. the you purify it to pure vitamin C</p>
<p>Chemical manufacturing is often a multi step process that can be hard to understan how it works without knowledge of chemistry</p></div>		</li>
