			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to take a moment to point out that this is a great example of how even &quot;objective&quot; measurements like percentage growth are so easily manipulated by context and phrasing. </p>
<p>&quot;Only 1% point above target&quot;
&quot;33% over estimated growth&quot;
&quot;Up by 1/3 more than anticipated&quot;
&quot;Experts underestimated growth by 25%&quot;
&quot;Expected increase only 75% of actual increase&quot;</p>
<p>One statistic that is really pretty minor can be downplayed, upplayed, simplified, and be used to support several narratives. (Experts underestimating something, experts unreliable, etc.)</p>
<p>All are technically correct but you will only get 1 of them from any given source and perhaps not even the original data to make your own call.</p>
<p>Edit: added &quot;point&quot;
Edit2: i made it mom. ty for gold, I owe it to the scientific ethics class I sometimes didn't sleep through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even worse when mixing percentages with decimals. &quot;We grew by 150% last quarter...&quot; meaning you are now 2.5x the size you were?  Or 1.5x the size you were?  Because &quot;Grew by X%&quot; says to me that the current size is 1+X%, but I've seen it used both ways.  &quot;105% growth&quot; means you have more than doubled, but many of my colleagues will say &quot;105% growth&quot; to mean we are merely 5% bigger.</p>
<p>Numbers don't confuse me, but the way they are phrased and presented is often very confusing.  I even have a math degree and I often have to carefully think this stuff through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me when Windows 7 first came out. Something like 45% of businesses planned on upgrading within a year. I saw two different news articles.  One said 45% would be doing so - which is a huge uptake rate.  The other article said &quot;most&quot; won't be upgrading.  Both are technically correct but it's a matter of putting a positive or a negative spin to a story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is like the fancier version of people over-emphasizing part of the number of something to make it sound like a big deal. &quot;Last year, Americans spent over 3 <strong><em>MILLION</em></strong> dollars on [some seemingly trivial thing].&quot; Right, because that comes out to an average of 10 <del>dollars</del>  cents a person, and is actually less than the previous year, and other countries actually spend $0.12/person, or whatever. But joe radio listener hears that and is like &quot;holy balls 3 <strong><em>MILLION</em></strong> on [trivial thing]?? That's what's wrong with America! Fuckin' millenials&quot; or something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>E.g. the person who made the error may take the smaller number to deemphasize their mistake, while someone (let's say a salesperson) would prefer the larger since it makes him look better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nah, whatever supports their argument the best is what they use (by people who know how to manipulate people with numbers).</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're gonna be wrong it is better to be wrong on the high side (more comes in than you called) but the ideal is to say it's gonna be X and it turns out that X is exactly what happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I figured it out is this: the answer is 4. You guessed 3. You were 75% of the way there, and so 25% off.</p>
<p>EDIT: I now realize that this part is garbage but I'm leaving it for my shame:</p>
<p>Or another way, if the answer is 98, and you guessed 7, it doesn't make any sense to say you were off by 91 / 7. You have to leave the correct answer as the &quot;base&quot; because your guess could be randomly all over the place. So in this case you were off by 91 / 98, which is 93% off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue the opposite. Prediction was 3, result was 4. The prediction should be the figure of which to take the percentage. As 1 is 33.33% of 3, then the prediction was 33.33% off.</p>
<p>4 is 33.33% higher than 3.</p>
<p>3 is 25% lower than 4.</p>
<p>As was said above, it depends on which way you want the figures to sound.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it absolutely does.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what you're saying, I want to introduce the idea of &quot;percent difference&quot;.</p>
<p>Percent change is usually 100%*(final - initial)/initial. We're implying here that our initial value is our reference point. </p>
<p>So if growth in Q1 was 3% and growth in Q2 is 4%, we would say the growth rate increased by 33%. If growth rate in Q1 was 4% and growth rate in Q2 was 3%, we would say the growth rate decline by 25%. But we often don't have this inherit reference point so we have to phrase things like /u/Bokbreath did to convey meaning.</p>
<p>We all know this, this is nothing knew.</p>
<p>Economists like to use &quot;percent difference&quot; and I've even heard that economists invented it, although I highly doubt it. It doesn't have any real mathematical meaning, but is useful in comparisons. It's generally defined as</p>
<p>100% <em> |a-b| / |.5</em>(a+b)|</p>
<p>This is useful because your reference point doesn't matter like in percent change formula. So in this case, it would be...
100% <em> |3-4| / |.5</em>(3+4)| = 100% <em> |4-3| / |.5</em>(4+3)| = 1/35 ~ 28%</p>
<p>You might say this is stupid but let me give you an example of why it's useful.</p>
<p>Let's say <strong>Economist A estimated growth of 3.2%</strong> and <strong>Economist B</strong> estimated growth of 5% and the actual was 4%. Whose prediction was better?</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1:</strong> One might argue you should use absolute difference to compare.</p>
<p>Economist A's forecast: |3.2-4| = 0.8</p>
<p>Economist B's forecast: |5-4| = 1</p>
<p>In this case, Economist A's forecast is better. But I know absolute difference isn't very helpful because if next quarter growth was .1% and someone forecasted .7%, on an absolute scale, it's only .6% off, but the relative difference it's a pretty terrible forecast. Similarly, if an economist forecasted growth of 75% in one quarter and it grew by 76%, that's a pretty damn good forecast! So absolute difference isn't a great metric to use.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2:</strong> Economist B might argue you should use percentage change with the forecasts as the reference.</p>
<p>100%*(4-3.2)/(3.2) = 25%</p>
<p>100%*(4-5)/(5) = -20%</p>
<p>Well, actual growth was 25% more than Economist A's forecast and 20% less than Economist B's forecast.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3:</strong> Economist A might argue you should use percentage change with the actual growth rate as the reference.</p>
<p>100%*(3.2-4)/4 = -20%</p>
<p>100%*(5-4)/4 = 25%</p>
<p>Here, the results are saying that Economist A's forecast is 20% less than actual and Economist B's forecast is 25% more than actual. This is the exact <strong>OPPOSITE</strong> as scenario 2's conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 4:</strong> Finally, you can look at the <strong>&quot;percent difference&quot;</strong> of the two. Here, we basically ignore the idea of a reference point.</p>
<p>100%<em>|4-3.2|/|.5</em>(4+3.2)| = 22.22%</p>
<p>100%<em>|4-5|/|.5</em>(4+5)| = 22.22%</p>
<p>They're exactly equal! This is cool because we're no longer reliant on a reference point. Does it have any mathematical meaning? Not any I can think of. But now I don't have to listen to two economists bitch about whose forecast was better.</p></div>		</li>
