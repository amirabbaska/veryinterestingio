<p>Trees are great but they're not phytoplankton</p>
<p>It is estimated that marine plants produce between 70 and 80 percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere. Nearly all marine plants are single celled, photosynthetic algae. <a href="http://www.ecology.com/2011/09/12/important-organism/" target="_blank">http://www.ecology.com/2011/09/12/important-organism/</a></p>
<p>Or algae. </p>
<p>Most freshwater phytoplankton are made up of green algae and cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae 13. Marine phytoplankton are mainly comprised of microalgae known as dinoflagellates and diatoms, though other algae and cyanobacteria can be present. <a href="http://www.fondriest.com/environmental-measurements/parameters/water-quality/algae-phytoplankton-chlorophyll/" target="_blank">http://www.fondriest.com/environmental-measurements/parameters/water-quality/algae-phytoplankton-chlorophyll/</a></p>

But I am optimistic about the possibility of bio-engineering them to be more resilient, after all we've already engineered algae that can do some crazy stuff. That is a good /r/askscience thread if you ask me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I say this a lot, but trees are actually not good at sequestering carbon!  The problem being, trees store 90% of their carbon as above ground wood.  This means that when a tree dies, it releases all of the carbon back into the atmosphere.  Huge amounts of trees also attract huge fires, which also release all the carbon!  In North America at least, grasslands are FAR more effective st sequestering carbon.  Grass is the opposite of a forest in that it stores 90% of its biomass underground, where it cannot be easily released!  Not to mention North American grasslands are one of the most depleted ecosystems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only way to sequester Carbon long term is to keep it out of the atmosphere.  Quick growing, high biomass  plants work awesome, but you have to keep it out of the atmosphere.  The reason we have excess carbon now is that we have spent a hundred years taking carbon deposits out of the ground that have been there for millions of years, therefore methods that only sequester carbon for 20 or 30 years are nothing but a band aid.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once tried to start a project / kick starter to do this!! I got very little support/ interest. </p>
<p>I crunched the numbers on how many trees the average human would have to plant to entirely erase their carbon footprint, and it came out to ~4/year!</p>
<p>The idea stemmed from dissatisfaction with government action - obviously THEY'RE not going to fix this, so it's up to us. </p>
<p>Heck I can plant 8 trees a year, 4 for me and 4 for a climate change denier. </p>
<p>Let me see if I can find my original post... </p>
<p>Edit: Found it:

<blockquote>
<p>Check this out. R/theydidthemath helped me get here, but they made it way more complicated than it needed to be.
Check this out. The Average tree sequesters 1 ton of Co2 in 40 years.
The average human produces 4 tons of Co2 in a year.
Therefore, if you plant just 4 trees every year, that's 4 tons in 40 years. Your carbon impact is gone 40 years later.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just one problem, the average human doesn't really have space for 4 trees per year. You also have to factor in growth time, but some trees grow pretty quickly. People should still plant trees. </p></div>		</li>
