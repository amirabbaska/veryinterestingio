			<div class="markdown"><p>The first couple times you  go to the gym it sucks. Everything hurts during and after. However, after a while it becomes addicting. It’s that point where your running and a good part of a song comes on and feel superhuman for a few minutes. There’s this rush that comes over you. Sometimes it’s during a really hard part, taking a shower afterward, or just collapsing onto the couch. </p>
<p>If you are working out too hard when you first start out you might be stressing yourself out too much. Your body isn’t able to cope with the strain you’re putting on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Exactly spot on. If you make it a habit, you crave it.  If you're a couch potato or regress into one, exercising is taxing and depressing.  But it slowly becomes addictive, desired, and pleasurable.  Runner's high and all that.  And mood skyrockets too.  I've experienced this several several times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started going to the gym in January, the first day was a nightmare, it took me some time to finish the exercises and once it was over and while I was walking to my house I asked myself &quot;is this really worth it?&quot;</p>
<p>That whole week I was so tired, and the next one too once I began with leg day, back day and such. But I never stopped. </p>
<p>Sure, sometimes I don't wanna go and I wanna stay at my house, but since I started I can definitely say that my attitude and reception of some things changed, I feel more relaxed and like I accomplished something each day. </p>
<p>If you're starting with gym or running each morning, you need to take it easy at first, last year I had an instructor that made me do a lot in my first day and I ended up very hurt and couldn't do anything for a couple weeks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll need to go to the gym for like a solid two weeks (2-3x a week) before you reach the &quot;addiction&quot; phase.</p>
<p>For me, I get DOMS pretty bad. Repetition of the solid day or two afterwards of just stretching every opportunity I get to settle it turned into me relishing in the tightness of my muscles. It turned into addiction pretty quickly. It sounds weird to say, but I don't actually do it for the body figure anymore, I do it so I can get DOMS and stretch. I get antsy and agitated if it's been too long since my last good gym day.</p>
<p>... Is this a weird road I'm going down? Is this a doorway best left closed? Ah well. I'll enjoy it while it lasts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best part of every workout for me is using a foam roller at the end. Incredibly pleasurable when my entire upper back cracks laying over it. Or just putting all my weight onto a tense muscle in my thigh. I don't think its harmful and it's improved my posture and recovery a lot.</p>
<p>Workout addiction is a thing, but I wouldn't worry about it unless it starts to interfere with your life or have negative health consequences. You can always ask a physician in doubt.</p>
