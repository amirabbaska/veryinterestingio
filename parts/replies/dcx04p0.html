			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too, actually. I always thought it was normal. Is it also in different colors, shape and form for you? Is it also, opposed to what I would probably think of others with these descriptions if I didn't have it, not bugging you at all?    </p>
<p>I also see this while having my eyes opened, but weirdly only when thinking about it. It also doesn't affect my vision at all, passed every test I've done so far without a single mistake. (for drivers license,..)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I always see these colorfu symmetricl ink blot looking patches that sort of blink and constantly evolve and shrink inwards.  </p>
<p>I really thought everybody sees this, and now I'm wondering how in thirty year's it's never come up.  Also all I OK?  Sounds really weird when I write it all out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I get the colors, shapes flashes, snow etc.  When falling asleep often I will &quot;watch&quot; the light show, almost like the Northern Lights, or a laser show.  It is mesmerizing and often puts me right to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. Me, too. I always thought this was perfectly normal. Had it, since I was little. When I was a child (like 4 or 5 years old) I always thought some of the abnormalities I saw were fairies. I think this explains why people thought I was making stuff up. </p></div>		</li>
