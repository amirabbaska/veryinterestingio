			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't give you the exact reason but maybe a possibility. It's probably to do with the fact that while the gasses are toxic, your exposure to them is probably not significant enough to warrant an actual decontamination. Like the new car smell &quot;particles&quot; might be in very low ppm quantities and the gasses emitted fade over time (i.e. the lack of new car smell), that the overall health effects are negligible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that's possible, I very much doubt that it would be cheap or fast, and the costs would end up being paid by the consumer. If it isn't proven that the smell is actually hurting the customer, then there's no good business reason to degas a new car. </p></div>		</li>
