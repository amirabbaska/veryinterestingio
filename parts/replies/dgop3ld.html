			<div class="markdown"><p>The mouse movement thing has got to be the biggest myth about these CAPTCHAs. It's been repeated here so many times people just accept it as true. It does not look at mouse movements. That would be bad news for the visually impaired, who don't use mice, and would completely fail devices that don't have a mouse like a phone or tablet.

			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually already have the invisible one. It doesn't do anything unless it thinks you're a bot. It does show a little banner in the corner that it's powered by invisible recaptcha, but there's no technical reason for that to be there.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm idiotic and misread your first sentence. I'll have to work on my coffee intake.</p></div>		</li>
