			<div class="markdown"><p>This really makes it an issue of semantics and I don't think it really gets to the heart of what OP was asking. The &quot;one-sentence proof&quot; is only valid because it relies on a lot of high-level machinery and theorems --
but these in turn all have their own unstated proofs which are necessary for the result to go through.</p>
<p>You could take any proof of a theorem, declare the penultimate statement(s) in it as a new theorem in its own right, and then give a &quot;one-sentence proof&quot; of the thing you were trying to prove.</p>
<p>The objective way to answer this question would be to consider the entire proof starting from the relevant axioms. The question is then whether there was a long proof from the axioms which was superseded by a much shorter proof from the (same) axioms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your point is valid for many of these examples, but Zagier's one-sentence proof for primes of the shape 4k+1 specifically does not &quot;rely on a lot of high-level machinery and theorems&quot;. </p>
<p>While there are some computations that have to be added to complete the proof, it is absolutely elementary. After showing that the complicated involution indeed is one and has exactly that fixed point, anyone can understand that an involution creates a pairing of elements, except for the fixed points. And thus the set S has an odd number of elements, and zero isn't odd, so the set S is nonempty.</p>
<p>If you (or someone else) is interested in the computational details, I can gladly add them, but I'm going to bed now - so you'd have to wait until this post is roughly 10 hours old ;-)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's at the heart of the question. When you manage complex abstractions (habitually stated as theorems) you can do easily complex tasks.</p>
<p>Is like say to someone that multiply by the usual rule is wrong bros by definition he must add x times the same number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I have a decent math background but haven't taken anything since college, so I may not know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>But in a way, it seems like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>relies on a lot of high-level machinery and theorems</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is kinda almost the whole point of math lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Mod is just the remainder after division, with the number coming after mod being the divisor. So p = 1 (mod 4) means p is 5, 9, 13, etc. -- numbers that have remainder 1 when divided by 4.</p>
<p>You often see it used like an operator (especially when talking to programmers). Which would be p mod 4 = 1. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>okay, that makes the entire thing make a lot of sense! I'm surprised I didn't notice that pattern when going through the values that worked for the theorem :p </p>
<p>thanks! </p></div>		</li>
