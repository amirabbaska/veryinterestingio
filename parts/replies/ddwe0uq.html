			<div class="markdown"><p>Burning any organic matter also releases something called <strong>H</strong>eterocyclic <strong>A</strong>romatic <strong>A</strong>mines (HAAs), some of which majorly inhibit human monoamine oxidases and thus have a large effect on all parameters of human cognition.</p>
<p>They are what we smell in smoke as well as coffee, tobacco and pretty much all of the culinary arts, not PAHs.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, can I ask you a question? Not that I'm doubting you - you clearly know way more than I do about the subject - but I was actually wondering about the carcinogenic wood smoke thing the other day, believe it or not. </p>
<p>People have been burning wood fires for a <em>loooong</em> time and I read that cancer is a relatively &quot;modern, man made&quot; disease.. how come people haven't been getting cancer from burning wood since the beginning of, well, man?</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for all the great answers, guys. I knew questions wouldn't let me down. Appreciate all the food for thought. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>People didn't typically live long enough to get cancer &quot;back in the the day.&quot; Cancer is not a &quot;man-made&quot; disease, it's just our modern lifespans and elimination of other forms of early death are causing a lot more people to reach an age where they die of cancer, instead of malnourishment, other diseases, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there also the diagnostic factor, as in we've probably been getting cancer much longer than we've actually been able to diagnose it? Some cancers are easily visible without diagnostic imaging (or cutting you open), but a lot of cancer isn't visible without it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In addition, for the vast majority of human history almost nobody had access to a doctor (even a clueless or crappy one) and even if they did, there was often no way to diagnose what made someone sick or die. </p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>In the fossil-rich region of South Africa known as the Cradle of Humankind, scientists have discovered the earliest known case of one of the worldâ€™s most deadly diseases.</strong></p>
<p><em>Using 3-D imaging, the researchers have diagnosed an aggressive type of cancer called osteosarcoma in a foot bone belonging to a human relative who died in Swartkrans Cave between 1.6 and 1.8 million years ago.</em></p>
