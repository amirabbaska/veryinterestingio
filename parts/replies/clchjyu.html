			<div class="markdown"><p>They wouldn't be paying for it, they'd be saying that they produced it and selling it for ISIS and taking a cut.  The Middle East has very prolific wells and as brownribbon said three million dollars isn't an absurd amount of money in the oil business.  With bad regulations/monitoring they could say they drilled new wells or increased production on old wells to account for it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could even look at it as a protection kind of racket.</p>
<p>ISIS controls the well.  Whatever entity is running the well for them, extracting the oil and taking it to market.</p>
<p>They collect the proceeds, and after an &quot;agreed upon&quot; fee, ISIS, as the controller of the well, gets the remainder.</p>
<p>The same kind of arrangement happens in that region.  There are American and other companies who often own shares or rights to the production process, or the well itself (sometimes they even drill it and setup all the infrastructure).  After agreed upon fees or percentage of the cut, the nation gets its share.</p>
<p>In this case since ISIS controls it, the nation isn't getting the share.  ISIS is.  Or, maybe the nation that controls it is giving them a cut in exchange for them to not blow it sky high.  Either way.</p>
<p>Such arrangements are quite common though.  Many oil wells are actually operated by another company that holds a stake in it in exchange for doing all the dirty work-drilling, setting up pipelines and storage, and getting it to market.  They profit as well as the person who owns it or the nation that controls it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oil as a global commodity is worth several billions of dollars per day. $3m isn't all that much.</p>

If you price oil low enough, you will find someone who is willing to buy it without asking where it came from.  Its not as if these people are choosing to support ISIS, they are simply buying without asking questions.  Everything has a value, everyone has a price. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, once it gets to a ship, it's pretty easy. The original tanker turns off its AIS transponder (a simple flip of a breaker), another ship does the same. Although in violation of international maritime regulations, there's really no other active way to track a ship offshore if that equipment is off. The two ships then meet in international waters (or an ally who will look the other way) and the cargo is transferred (&quot;lightered&quot;). Ship B pops up at its destination with &quot;legal&quot; cargo and forged paperwork. <a href="http://rt.com/news/iran-oil-tanker-tracking-system-018/" target="_blank">This is how Iran exports its sanctioned oil</a>. They know that their ships are tracked, but it is childishly easy to evade. So a ship departs full, transponder goes off, &quot;disappears&quot; for a while, shows up a few weeks later empty. </p></div>		</li>

<p>well, radar.  But that's only effective if you have coverage.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referring to shoreside authorities tracking a ship offshore. Radar is line of sight from land-based installations and there is no active satellite tracking that the ship can't turn off. LRIT can easily be deactivated as well. Again, not legal, but you either just turn the equipment off entirely, or reconfigure the settings.</p>
<p>This past summer a tanker carrying disputed Kurdish oil <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2737505/Oil-tanker-carrying-100-million-cargo-mysteriously-disappears-coast-Texas-dispute-Kurdish-oil.html" target="_blank">&quot;disappeared&quot; off Texas</a> while &quot;attempting to offload its cargo&quot;. (The article says it disappeared off radar, but really it was just outside the coverage area and they switched off their AIS).  This was a mere 60 miles offshore, inside the U.S. EEZ, in an offshore anchorage...</p>

<p>You could also track by acoustic signatures, but again, you'd have to have a lot of resources.  Only a handful of countries can do it and no one wants to tip their hand as to how well they can do it.

Oil from the Gulf of Mexico has distinct chemical differences from Middle Eastern oil, for instance.

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a common misconception that there is some authority out there tracking commercial ships offshore all the time similar to air traffic controllers. There's not. (The Iranian ships are watched for political interests, and when they go off the grid it's fairly easy to infer the reason.) Ships are required to have AIS, a short range ID transponder and another system called LRIT (&quot; Long Range Identification and Tracking&quot;) that sends their position only to their flag administration and other choice subscribers, but that's about it. Both are easily disabled and the consequences are pretty much zero. If there's not a distress though, I don't think some country is going to invest its expensive assets trying to find a random ship (it wasn't even tracking in the first place) on a whim; the ocean is huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are half right, but half completely wrong.  </p>
<p>The Turkish government is worried about ISIS because it is essentially a rival, aggressive, powerful nation right on it's doorstep. This goes against the national interests of any country.  So they certainly do not agree with them.  And to add to that, because Turkey is Sunni majority country, while ISIS is a Sunni calpihate, there is the likely possibility that many Turks will feel sympathy towards their cause. This could in the future lead to a lot of internal problems within Turkey (terrorism, protests, political drama, etc).   </p>
<p>Regarding the Kurds:  Yes,  Turkey does not want to empower militant Kurds, as it may embolden them to form their own nation - something the Kurds have wanted for 70 years. Because then Turkey would have another strong, powerful nation right on it's doorstep.     Turkey is against both ISIS and Kurdistan for the exact same reason. </p>
<p>This is why they are acting so bizarre with with Kobani.  They want to neither engage ISIS, or empower the Kurds.  Not to mention that 20% of Turkey are made up of Kurds - they would end up losing 1/5th of their land if a Kurdistan was formed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may have backfired here.  Not only is the US and today's coalition of the willing effectively a co-belligerent with the Assad regime against ISIS, but ISIS has also played a major role in marginalizing the moderate and secular Syrian resistance forces.  This suits Assad's strategic and propaganda purposes perfectly, as it allows him to portray his regime as the protector of minorities, secularism, and general stability against barbaric terrorism and radical islam.  The more war-weary the syrian people get, the more who will be willing to take the fascist they know over the upstart theocrats who want to export the jihad into neighboring countries too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you sure about that? I feel like I read somewhere that ISIS &amp; Assad have never actually fought directly. I might have also heard that Assad helped support ISIS during it's formation as a way to show the west that the conflict was a choice between a dictator or a brutal extremist group. (In the hope that Western governments would see his regime as the lesser of 2 evils and therefore preferable) </p></div>		</li>
