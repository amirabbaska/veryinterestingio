<p>But presumably the multiverse would have its own underlying physical laws that determine how its individual universes behave. These multiverse laws would then involve some constants that (by definition) are the same for every universe. So, it's turtles/constants all the way down. :)</p>
<p>I agree this is probably a better discussion for /r/askphilosophy .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he sees &quot;the multiverse&quot; as a thing. I don't know much about multiverse theories but I think of them as a collection of separate universes (that may or may not interact). I might be misinterpreting but I think what /u/munchler means is that &quot;the multiverse&quot; is like a bigger version of our universe, which contains sub-universes. Sort of like a set containing subsets, one of them being our universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't really have a good answer to that question. You can point to some constants and say that their value is derived from some more fundamental constant, but if you follow that chain all the way down, eventually you get to a point where we don't know the underlying reason for things any more. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This question might be more at home in r/askphilosophy lol.</p>

<p>I'm not sure it's possible to have &quot;science&quot; without at least a little philosophy as the basis. We're not talking about morality, or subjective values, or our &quot;place&quot; in the universe. It's a tough question to answer adequately, since the question itself is vague, but I think the discussion is sufficiently based in accepted scientific principle. <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2010/multiple-universes" target="_blank">Here's an article from MIT talking about something very similar.</a></p>
<p>As you said, the physical constants could vary. It's fairly easy to conceive of a universe where the speed of light is different, or 'G' is different. The article I linked talks about thought experiments where the mass of various fundamental particles varies, or if one of the fundamental forces were different/absent. </p>
<p>So it's already an avenue of thought that's being explored. I think the question that arises then is, if some of the things we consider &quot;laws&quot; could be different in other universes, must not there be some superset which dictates those differences? I'd say there certainly must be. At some point, one would think that there are basic structures, laws, whatever we want to call them, that outline what is, and what isn't. </p></div>		</li>
