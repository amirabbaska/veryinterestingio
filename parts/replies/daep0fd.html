			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how it was explained to me by a teacher which really helped me understand:</p>
<p>Whenever you raise the power by one, you multiply by the base.</p>
<p>Whenever you lower the power by one, you divide by the base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be better to explain that negative exponents are defined that way to satisfy the multiplicative property: a^b <em> a^c = a^b+c.
So 3^-k </em> 3^k = 3^(k-k)= 1. Thus 3^-k = 1/3^k.
This is the more general explanation that also covers fractional exponents, and is a parallel for a lot of how mathematics is created: Definitions are extended to satisfy existing useful properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This definitely doesn't help when you start learning more advanced math such as calculus.</p>
<p>A better way of explaining it would be:</p>
<p>3^-2 = 1/3^2</p>
<p>Just add a one on top (numerator) of the number and change the sign from a negative to a positive on the exponent.</p>
<p>Because when they start learning about derivatives you don't want to simplify the exponent, you want to keep everything as clean as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well written, I like the description in plain words. One minor suggestion though, perhaps consider:</p>
<p>3^0 = one, neither multiplied nor divided by any threes</p>
<p>Just for the sake of symmetry across the positive and negative exponent explanations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO it is already symmetrical.</p>
<p>3^-0 = one not divided by any threes = 1</p>
<p>3^0  = one not multiplied by any threes = 1</p>
<p>edited to make it more clear it's not really like dividing or multiplying by zero</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably something to avoid getting into in this particular topic</p></div>		</li>
