			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting farady cage story... My house has aluminum siding and metal window screen, I can't get wifi outside.  I had to replace the window screens in the back of the house with a plastic screen material effectively breaking the cage and now I get signal back there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have time to prepare for the EMP, unplug your microwave and put your electronics in there. Its designed to be a Faraday cage... And while it may be imperfect, it's better than no shielding at all. </p>
<p>You can test this by connecting your phone to a Bluetooth speaker and placing it in the microwave. The connection stops nearly instantly when you close the door. Just don't turn on the microwave, obviously.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>In reality, yeah. Current is induced on the outside of the metal. The window won't make a difference</p></div>		</li>
