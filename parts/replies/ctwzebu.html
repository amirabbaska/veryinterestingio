<p>For example, among the Shona people, parents have the power to switch from affectionate kinship terms/nicknames to first name use, to show anger to reprove their children</p>

<p>Isn't that present in most cultures with minor variations, though?  I.e. in an Anglophone or Russian culture, a mom would go &quot;John Middlename Smith, you come here now!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're right that this is generally pretty common--that was the point of the answer :)  </p>
<p>But human behavior is also marked by variation.  A good counter-example is Chinese family language--generally speaking, parents and children use kinship terms, and do not use personal names (parents may use <em>milk-names</em> or <em>Xi«éo</em> to create a nickname).  Switching to personal names as a way to express disapproval or assert authority isn't part of Chinese culture, both for Mandarin and Cantonese speakers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes exactly.  While OP poses his/her question looking for a more specific answer, the apparent commonness and universality of elder (particular paternal elder) respect across diverse cultures shows that the recognition of parental power is a psychobiological characteristic of human beings generally.  As a result, we cannot say exactly what the reason is down to a mathematical formulae, but we have a pretty good idea.  In anthropology we are quite often bamboozled with the extraordinary diversity of cultures -- but at the same time some human phenomena are actually more simple than they seem.  In my opinion there is definitely a recognition and a strong significance placed by humans on the ability to give life to another -- and this seems to be common in every culture.  Parents don't just give you life in a biological sense, they continue to nurture you for years to come, essentially giving you life (or a life force) throughout your entire childhood.  The ability to give life to another seems to be recognized as a major form of power across cultures we study, and because of this, we have a pretty strong reason to believe that there is a psychobiological reason behind this universality.  The child recognizes its biological helplessness and views the parents and/or elders has having power over their life.<br />
Anthropologists do have to be careful with topics like this because they can be overanalyzed, when here it seems like a spade is a spade.  Since respect towards elders is also common among animal species (though without language), studies like this can go beyond just the human and look at paternal relations among species more broadly.</p>
<p>I did also mention 'life force' earlier.  I did so because the ability to give 'life force' is a quintessential motif in Melenesian spirituality. </p></div>		</li>
