			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to this, even if this study does completely change the idea that neurogenesis occurs in the dentate gyrus, it doesn't mean that neurogenesis is completely absent in the adult brain. For instance, there is increasing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5380718/" target="_blank">evidence</a> suggesting that new neurons are made by stem-like cells called tanocytes in the adult human hypothalamus</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see thanks </p>
<p>Its just that you can do tons of research on adult n-genesis and there are so many studies done on this substance that increases adult n-genesis and that substance that decreases it, etc </p>
<p>are they saying that all of the studies for several decades now used bad science and incorrect means of measuring this phenomenon? seems shocking to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From reading the supplemental discussion (I'm a microbiologist, so I don't have much knowledge of this besides what I'm reading here), it seems like besides techniques, the big issue is animal models.</p>
<p>The only way to reliably look for n-genesis is to examine brain tissue under a microscope. You can't just take people's hippocampuses, so human studies of n-genesis (including the current study) rely on tissues obtained after death or when hippocampal brain tissue is removed as a treatment for severe intractable epilepsy. (You can see how studies forced to use samples of opportunity like this might not be as solid as you'd hope.)</p>
<p>Because of this, most studies of adult n-genesis probably use rodent models, where you can do whatever experiment you want and then take the brain and look at it right after. You describe studies of substances increasing or decreasing adult n-genesis-- I can't imagine a way to do those studies in humans, so they must use an animal, probably a rodent.</p>
<p>There isn't any doubt that rodents have adult n-genesis. What the authors here are disputing is whether humans are comparable to rodents in this way. They are saying that they aren't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me they are doing post-mortems on humans and checking for young neurons.</p>
<p>&quot;We also find that the number of proliferating progenitors and young neurons in the dentate gyrus declines sharply during the first year of life and only a few isolated young neurons are observed by 7 and 13 years of age. In adult patients with epilepsy and healthy adults (18–77 years; n = 17 post-mortem samples from controls; n = 12 surgical resection samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not detected in the dentate gyrus.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for describing this - it’s a key point that’s often missed in scientific discussions. An older mentor of mine once said it’s amazing how much we understand about mice and rats and how little we still understand about humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a common misunderstanding of modern scientific research.</p>
<p>No individual study can prove something, and it is very rare for a study to be so large that it can definitively disprove something. At the cutting edge of research, ideas are tested over and over, in many different ways, dozens if not thousands of times. There is an expectation that there will be conflicting results. <em>This does not mean any of the studies are bad science or even incorrect.</em></p>
<p>Scientific realizations are not accomplished by individual studies but by a continual conversation across thousands of studies. As we perform more and more research we get a better idea of what's going on, a better idea of <em>how</em> to perform these studies, and a better idea of what all the individual results mean. </p>
<p>This result may be contested in the future, or prove to be erroneous, or prove to be true under a narrow set of conditions. Normally by the time something is accepted as truth the first studies which showed that result are long relegated to history. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just my 2 cents as a scientist: when conflicting results come out, it doesn't necessarily mean that either set of results come from &quot;bad science&quot;. It is entirely possible that old or new results are complicated by unforeseen systematic effects, or trends that aren't accounted for/haven't been noticed yet.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that the science is bad, it means that our understanding might be incomplete and warrants further study.</p></div>		</li>
