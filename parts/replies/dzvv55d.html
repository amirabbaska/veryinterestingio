			<div class="markdown"><p>Middle school math teacher here.
When i begin to explain this in class i pick up a random kid talking and say something like &quot;that's enough... I'm giving you detention.&quot; And after three second of silence in the room i add &quot;nevermind I take it back. Feel good ? Losing something negative is positive, and it's the same for numbers&quot; and then i add the debt example. </p>
<p>Can seems mean but they usually like it and they'll remember it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually french so i'm gonna try to give you a few tips but I won't have time to check for perfect grammar.</p>
<p>As a teacher : </p>
<p>1)Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Design-Science-Pedagogical-Technology/dp/041580387X" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Design-Science-Pedagogical-Technology/dp/041580387X</a>
I think this sums up and unifies a lots of &quot;education theory&quot; into one clear diagram called the conversational framework.</p>
<p>2)Learn how the learning process work at the brain level, memory, attention, how emotions play a role, the system 1 and system 2 ( <a href="http://bigthink.com/errors-we-live-by/kahnemans-mind-clarifying-biases" target="_blank">http://bigthink.com/errors-we-live-by/kahnemans-mind-clarifying-biases</a> ), what is chunking, the role of repetition, the theory of flow.
Learn about the different types of intelligences, growth mindset, motivation and be able to explain all of these concepts to kids to teach them how to learn.</p>
<p>3)Encourage reading. Show that you read. Ask about their reading. This is so important.</p>
<p>4)You owe them to be strict. It's not bad, it's not jerky. They have to enter your class knowing that they won't have the choice but to work. Remind them that it's because it's your duty to give them the knowledge that will allow them to be free.
The school institution has to defend humanism values. </p>
<p>5)Teach them to act and talk differently in differents situations, as you do. Wich implies attitude and language. Wanting to have fun is normal, you can have conversation with them about a lots of things but teaching time is teaching time.</p>
<p>6)Be consistent and fair. If you say something do it. You don't punish them, they punish themselves by breaking the rules and jeez, you wish they hadn't and it disappoint you because you know they can act in a good way.
Separate the period when they can or can't talk, when they can or can't cooperate. Have a variety.</p>
<p>7)Don't allow being disrespected or making fun of in a mean way. Even if subtil or it could be misunderstood. Never be mean and always show that you care about them and they will respect you.</p>
<p>8)You don't know what's going on at home. Kids can have a really rough life. Talk with colleague and health staff if you see some kids having trouble.</p>
<p>9)Don't give too much homework, honestly a good attention in class and little work should be enough for most kids.</p>
<p>10)Learn to find good ressources. Every concept has been reasearched and there is good way to teach it our there. Your job is not to create everything from scratch, but to create the learning experience.</p>
<p>11)Be explicit with what they need to know. When you give a test, give details about what will be demanded from them. Don't grade to harsh or you're gonna discourage them, you have to some balance.</p>
<p>As a math teacher : </p>
<p>1)Always begin a lesson with a small exercise on the board that can be anything. Things they saw months ago, something that will help them understand the current lesson, mental calculation,  etc.</p>
<p>2)Proportionnality is central to middle school. First year of middle school I don't do it as a separate chapter but use it all through the year. (organized in 6 parts : prices, length, angles, time, areas and volumes. it can cover all of the number/geometry concepts many times (we call it spiral progression in France).
Deep understanding of it take a long time but fonctionnal understanding is necessary and give them confidence.</p>
<p>3)Don't do a &quot;addition&quot; then a &quot;substraction&quot; then a &quot;multiplication&quot; or &quot;division&quot; chapter. How can they learn wich operation is to be used when they only practice  one at a time.
Btw, use langage as a way to help them understand wich operation is at stake. (how many time this number can fit in this one?</p>
<p>4)At middle school level, teach them how to use at least three programs :
Geogebra for geometry
Scratch for programming and game
Excel or something</p>
<p>5)I began my carreer with printed lessons with words to fill. Now the &quot;lesson part&quot; is almost completely constructed with markers on the board by asking them what we're gonna write or do as much as possible. This teach them how to speak with rigour. This allow to talk about concepts more deeply. Yay btw you're a langage teacher too.
Teach them to be autonomous and remind them that you don't care what their lesson look like as long as all the infos are there, that it's clear, and that they'll be able to understand it.
We don't get to write that much these days as adults but I really think the paper and pen allow liberty of thought and should always be taught.
Keep the lessons short and straightforward.</p>
<p>You can give links to video or other ressources with the school program.</p>
<p>6)USB CAMERA.
You lose so much time by sending kids to the board to write down what they already did at their table for the class to see.
Take their notebook and show their work on the whiteboard.
Welcome error and don't judge it. Error is what allow you to learn. Make kids comment and explain the error and how to avoid it.
Don't have to use the shitty geometry board tool all the time. Use the same kind they use and show with the camera.</p>
<p>I didn't give you any advice about how to explain specific things but honestly there is many good ressources out there. Being a good teacher is more about teaching them how to learn and motivate them to do so. </p>
<p>Sometimes you can think they don't understand math but honestly
most of them would by giving some fucks. A kid that wants to succeed would with an average teacher, a kid that doesn't want to wouldn't learn with the best explanation cause he would'nt really pay active attention. So of course always focus on why math is useful. Try to make the learning experience as pleasant as necessary (can't always be the case.)</p>
<p>In some family the motivation come from the enviromnent, pressure and expectation from the parents, some kids don't have that chance. If you want them to succeed you should have high expectations for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great application of the concept. Reminds me of how my math teacher helped us remember the rules:</p>
<p>- If a good (+) thing happens (x) to a good (+) person, that's (=) good (+)</p>
<p>- If a bad (-) thing happens (x) to a bad (-) person, that's (=) good (+)</p>
<p>- If a good (+) thing happens (x) to a bad (-) person, that's (=) bad (-)</p>
<p>- If bad (-) thing happens (x) to a good (+) person, that's (=) bad (-)</p></div>		</li>
