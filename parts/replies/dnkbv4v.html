			<div class="markdown"><p>awesome video, i just have one (probably stupid) question about it:</p>
<p>why can't it be that passing through the filter just changes the polarity of the photon? that would with my understanding of physics be the easiest explanation.</p>
<p>with that, passing through filter B at 22.5° also changes the polarization to B and it now has the same chance (85%) to pass through filter C at another 22.5° as if the arrangement was just B-C</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's hidden variables, how do they actually know photons are &quot;entangled&quot;? It seems like it would be pretty trivial (based solely on the information provided in this video) to create a set of hidden variables that would lead to the given result, unless you're operating on a large number of unstated but inviolable hidden assumptions that would somehow rule those specific hidden variables out.</p>
<p>Edit: Okay I'm looking forward into it and... it doesn't make any sense. People are saying stuff like how you use the polarization stuff discussed in the video to <em>determine</em> if photons are entangled. So you can't derive any information about the nature of the polarization behaviour on the basis of entanglement if you're <em>using</em> the polarization behaviour to determine whether or not something is entangled. That doesn't make any sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i don't really see how that proofs that the measurement doesn't change the polarization. </p>
<p>as far as i understood entanglement, in this case it just means that both photons always must have the same polarization.</p>
<p>so at start both photon have a a undetermined polarization orientation.</p>
<p>after one passes through filter A, it either get absorbed or they both have a 100% certain A-direction Polarization.</p>
<p>now the second photon passes through the second filter (either B or C) then it is just the same as if itself passed filter A before, because of the entanglement it must be polarized in the A direction.</p>
<p>so what if the second photon passes through filter C or B before the first passes through filter A? well then its the same just in reverse. the first photon has a well defined polarization (either B or C) and according to the related probabilities it either passes through A or doesn't</p>
<hr />
<p>bottom line: how does entanglement proof there is no interference of the filter with the polarization of the photon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more in line with the interpretation I gleaned from the companion video. When you pass a single photon through a filter skewed at an angle with respect to the photon's polarization, conservation of quantized energy forces it either to be parallel or perpendicular to the filter polarization with nothing in between. I'm often amazed how simple videos like this can teach me so much about coursework I'd completed in undergrad.</p></div>		</li>
