			<div class="markdown"><p>I  will follow your comment up with the mechanical side. The blade are pitched by the flight control system via a device called a Swashplate. Same basic concept of a slip ring.  As the swashplate is tilted and the blade rotates around the pitch control arm will cause the blade to twist providing more lift to certain quadrants.  That’s how rotary wing aircraft pitch, roll, and yaw.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s up under the dome (rain shield)on top if I remember right.  (Mainly worked on the CH-53E.  Same manufacturer).  If they are similar then it is actually a ring and it’s actually not tightened down.  It is held in place by other bolts that connect the ring to the head.  Maybe Army Vet can confirm for me.  As a side note that looks like a Navy version with auto folding blades. Or 160th for the Army.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it's the same on UH-60, but on the Apache it's called the IDDU: Integrated De-ice De-rotation Unit. </p>
<p>That and Radio Frequency Interferometer were the biggest mouthfuls of the job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah there is some ridiculously long name for it but we just call it the de-ice system and we almost never use it.  I actually went to school for Apaches cause we were &quot;supposed to get them&quot;.  They never came, switched to hawks in 2004.</p></div>		</li>
