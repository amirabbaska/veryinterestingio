			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to expand on capacitors and why you have to wait.</p>
<p>Capacitors are electrical components that store electrical charge, much like batteries. Unlike batteries, capacitors <em>usually</em> discharge their power when the power source is removed. This <em>usually</em> happens fairly quickly (old CRT capacitors can store a lot of charge for a very long time, so never take one apart).</p>
<p>You can see this discharge effect in some electronics by watching the standby LED slowly fade out. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That was long ago...today a very innocuous-looking little cap can start your day off wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One minor point: While it does matter how long it's turned off, it's not such that longer is always better.  Usually after about 10 seconds you're fine (with most devices).  Leaving your router off for an hour won't do anything more than leaving it off for 10 seconds.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Router was just a random (and maybe poor) example and yes sometimes leaving it off can help **other** equipment adjust.  In general a restart is a restart and longer times don't increase efficacy of fixing **that device**.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For a router it may be different. Not different for the unplugged router which will reset itself quickly, but different for the equipment on the other side.</p>
<p>On the Central Office side of routers and internet gateway equipment it is common to have relatively long timeouts before resetting communications circuits. Waiting 10 seconds for the device to reset means your equipment will reboot and reconnect fairly quickly, but the router will perhaps reconnect and recover within a minute or two. Slow and infrequent communications circuits may not notice. Software that uses large data buffers and silent background reconnects may continue uninterrupted. For network infrastructure is somewhat common to have a 10 minute or 30 minute interval which allows devices to restart their connections without disturbing the broader infrastructure.</p>
<p>Think of it this way:  If the IT department needs to reboot some routing equipment, if they're fast about it most people won't notice. A few people will get communications interruptions, but most software has long timeouts and multiple retry attempts. A slow timeout means IT can reboot the box but all the people out in the office or in the home only see a minor network hiccup or a short pause to their streaming video.</p>
<p>Some software and equipment have keepalive times measured in hours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Valid point, I hadn't really factored in upstream equipment.  Also a router was probably a poor example to use.  That being said, some of these scenarios seem rather rare and unlikely.  They also are about resetting upstream devices, not making the router function better.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on what is wrong, it can. If something was overheating due to another error, letting the device cool can restore function. Also, specific to network connected equipment, letting the DHCP lease expire means the device (may) get a new IP address, which (may) solve a network issue.</p></div>		</li>
