			<div class="markdown"><p>As per the comments above, there are many different forms of ice (another strange property due to its polar nature). At high pressure, ice can take forms that are more dense than water, like Ice-VI and Ice-VII. The kind of ice we see (Ice-Ih) is one of the few that is less dense than water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just as the other reply states you wouldn't find other forms of ice naturally. but if you really wanted denser ice you could make 2H2O (heavy water) and freeze that into an ice cube which would sink in an ordinary glass of water</p></div>		</li>
