			<div class="markdown"><p>I have songs stuck in my head all of the time too.  It used to drive me nuts but I recently decided I wasn't going to let it bother me anymore.  I also used to think I had to be really careful about the music I listened to because I didn't want some weird song playing in my head all of the time.  It doesn't matter what I listen to so I don't care anymore about what song is playing on constant repeat.  BUT! I have come to a possible conclusion as to WHY I have a song stuck in my head all of the time.  I have had constant ringing in my ears (tinnitus) for most of my life.  I guess I was prone to ear infections when I was a baby.  Anyway, I believe the reason I always have a song stuck in my head is a coping mechanism for my brain to deal with the constant ringing.  My brain is trying to give me something better to listen to other than the ringing.  I'd like to tell my brain I don't need any help and the ringing doesn't bother that much anymore and I don't need to listen to a song ALL THE TIME.  Last thoughts, I would absolutely love to hear the sound of silence.  I want to hear total peace and quiet once in my life.  I remember watching Cave of Forgotten Dreams by Werner Herzog and remember him standing in the cave and saying, &quot;shhh, just stand here and be surrounded by the silence&quot;.  I'm paraphrasing horribly but he and the people with him could stand there and hear absolutely nothing.  Even if I could stop the song I'd still hear the ringing.  I can't stop either.  But I'm ok.  I've just decided nothing is going to change so I tell myself not to let bother me...and it works.  </p></div>		</li>

The tinnitus is more recent for me, but I'm pretty sure the music I hear became even more present when it became a coping mechanism for the tinnitus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can stop mine for a few seconds if I try hard.</p>
<p>If yours from outside though? Or in your head? If I had a tinitus, which comes from outside, my music could not drown it out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, I suppose the ringing comes from outside my head but it all sounds like it's coming from the same place.  The songs are in my head though.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting, I had no idea it was so rare.  I remember realizing as a preteen that I always have music going through my head,  and figured it was because I spent so much time playing piano. I took lessons from the age of 5 to 18, and had to practice at least 30 minutes a day. Even on vacation or out of town, my patents usually found a piano we could practice on. I'm pretty selective about the music I listen to on the way to work, because one of those songs is going to be with me all day. Not necessarily the last one I heard or my favorite, I have no idea how my brain picks it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have it all the time the difference for me is I hear new unique music not a song someone has written. What's more interesting is I don't have much control over any of the specifics. Like whether or not it's just a melody or a full composition. My brain got stuck on reggae for a while, as I'm not the biggest reggae fan it was mildly frustrating.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funnily, I literally cannot come up with a new melody. I always blamed the music for this.</p>
<p>(Then again, I don't have the urge to create a melody so I'm fine) </p></div>		</li>
