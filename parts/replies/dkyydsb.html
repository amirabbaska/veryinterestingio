			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Thanks for taking the time to write this. I wish Id read it when I was 23 and struggling with my confidence after going bald!  (20 years later and I'm fine with it) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any known link between the thickness of facial hair and the thinning of head hair? My observations are that the sooner a teen gets facial hair (ie: full beard at age 15) the sooner that person will go bald. Conversely, guys with great head hair often have sparse facial hair.</p>
<p>I fall into the latter category and it continues to bother me that at age 36 I can't even grow a mustache. It doesn't bother me as much that my head hair is thick and luscious with no signs of ever balding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for mentioning this.  So many people shave, it's easy to forget.  I forgot.</p>
<p>Facial hair and male-pattern baldness appear to be related secondary sexual characteristics.  Baldness and facial hair would have projected a distinct appearance in ancient man that modern men frequently alter.  There is a spectrum of phenotypes as unique as each person, and different ethnic populations have different male hair pattern tendencies and frequencies.</p>
<p>Shows like Vikings and The Last Kingdom have lots of characters with unkempt, natural hair. Long beards and frequently male-pattern baldness.   It's not a coincidence that they look tough and aggressive.  In Star Trek they exaggerate these features in Klingons to evoke the impression of an aggressive, dominant male.  </p>
<p>Might as well throw-in the authoritative low voice, exaggerated upper body strength, chest hair and maybe even the &quot;dad bod'&quot; <del>beer belly</del> as additional male secondary sexual characteristics.</p>
<p>This is a complex and fascinating human feature with both physiological and psychological components.  The genes controlling hair growth are one thing, but we also appear to be hard-wired to respond to these visual cues.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could just be neutral selection on the baldness phenotype meaning that the natural tendency for loss of function mutations resulted in the gene spreading in the population.... doesn't have to be very complex.</p></div>		</li>
