			<div class="markdown"><p>Since N+1 has to have a prime factor greater than p_n, you could just check each number between p_n and N+1 since at least one of them is a prime. But in fact there is always a prime between p_n and 2p_n. On average the distance from any number n to the next prime is about log n, so if you want to find primes, just checking consecutive numbers until you find one is relatively quick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>N+1 can have only prime factors smaller than p_n, if your list does not include all primes up to pn. 3*5+1, for example, is 16. The only prime factor of 16 is 2, which is included 4 times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. I was using the notation of the previous post, where N is the product of the first n primes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3*5+1 is missing one prime, 2.</p>
<p>2*3*5+1 is 31 which has no prime factors equal or smaller to 5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, so its saying that the number produced following the sequence will either be prime like (2*3+1 = 7) or it will be divisible by a prime that is not in the original list. </p></div>		</li>
