			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, they are subsidizing rides and gas for drivers in foreign markets to make rides affordable for passengers in other countries. For example, a 30 minute ride can cost around $45 in the US. However, in India, the same ride can be under $10 so they can compete with domestic ride-sharing apps that are already in the price range of the consumer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, making profits is still questionable. They do not have significant advantages over a regular cab company in terms of providing large scale operations (their back-end of developers is more expensive than a dispatch, their &quot;fleet&quot; costs more to maintain than a cab company does, and they aren't going to get any sort of pricing advantage on cars or gas); their primary advantage in the long-term is mostly that they hope to not be regulated like a cab company, so they can drop unprofitable routes while still being an effective monopoly. Plus, they keep trying to use information asymmetry to claw money from drivers, <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/04/10/uber-showing-drivers-and-riders-different-fare-estimates-says-lawsuit/" target="_blank">e.g. showing riders higher fare estimates than drivers and pocketing the difference,</a> or not informing drivers of the actual long-term costs of operating a vehicle constantly so they feel their take-home is higher.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's ridiculous.  Developers make their system work world-wide, but dispatchers are normally in every locality.  I'd love to see some evidence of that.  How long have you been driving a cab, by the way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't own their &quot;fleet&quot; so there is no cost to Uber w/ regard to vehicles. </p>
<p>They have variable pricing that better matches realtime supply and demand -- if you've ever used taxis in big cities during a torrential thunderstorm or below zero temps, you could spend hours trying to get a taxi because drivers have no incentive to drive in bad conditions for same money as they do in good conditions, whereas Uber drivers making surge price payments do have incentive to hit the roads.</p>
<p>Also, Uber isn't tied to a medallion system that limited the overall number of taxis on the roads... even as big cities populations and rides increased, places like Chicago and New York did little to increase supply of taxis.</p>
<p>And Uber's rating system helps ensure drivers act in certain ways to ensure high ratings or they get kicked off service, While there isn't a good way to rate taxi drivers.</p>
<p>Of course, many of these differences are things that COULD be built upon the existing taxi model, and may be at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uber has to pay for their fleet; the drivers need to actually be incentivized to work, which includes costs for maintenance. Uber does not attempt to educate drivers on these costs, so they gain some advantage from drivers accepting lower real takehome pay, but that isn't going to be a huge advantage. Basically, Uber needs to pay drivers more to justify driving for Uber over driving a car that doesn't require you to pay for your own maintenance.</p>
<p>Variable pricing for supply and demand is an an advantage, but as I said the biggest advantage of this is being able to let drivers self select out of unpopular routes taxi drivers are required to work for by regulation. That is a competitive advantage, but not really a socially desirable one.</p>
<p>Supply is a potential advantage, true, but none of the complaints typically levied against taxi services were that they were undersupplied, but that thet were merely undemocratic in who could drive.</p>
<p>Rating system does not affect profitability unless Uber is willing to pitch themselves as a premium service and charge accordingly. There is a minor benefit in that it incentivizes drivers to personally eat cost for accomodations but I doubt this is significant.</p></div>		</li>
