			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit more of an ELI20 answer follows:</p>
<p>Most of it is due to taxes and local, state, and federal regulations.</p>
<p>MSW is municipal as described. Typically taxed by the ton.
There are many other more specific kinds of waste though, typically ladden with massive regulations.</p>
<p>RMW = Regulated Medical Waste. (think needles, used bedsheets, anything potentially contaminated with blood or body fluids, or potentially contagious)</p>
<p>HHW = Household Hazardous Waste (typically exempt from certain hazardous waste rules until collected at a collection location (e.g. the household doesn't have to be registered, licenced, pack it a certain way, etc.).</p>
<p>HW = Hazardous Waste (regulated by the EPA and by authorized states in many cases with more strict requirements)</p>
<p>Typically these other types of waste require much more expensive treatment prior to disposal (treatment being a very speciifcally defined term including incineration, wastewater treatment, etc, and disposal meaning final deposit in a landfill if not reused, recycled, or otherwise used for something other than the originally intended purpose of the waste).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good Answer.  MSW must be disposed in a certain way, with more requirements than C&amp;D, but way less than Hazardous Waste.</p></div>		</li>
