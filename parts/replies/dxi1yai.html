			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out that this isn't true of all LED bulbs (as opposed to individual LEDs).</p>
<p>LED bulbs typically have a 'driver' that rectifies the alternating current, steps the voltage down, etc. Cheaper drivers only do the basics. More expensive drivers will include capacitive smoothing that provides the LED itself with continuous power so it doesn't flicker.</p>
<p>I really notice the flicker and it drives me crazy. Even when nothing is moving I get the feeling that the light is 'grainy' in some way. When switching from incandescent to LED bulbs I always tried a few different makes to see which didn't flicker. It's not always the more expensive ones either!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called a pulse width modulator (PWM). Incandescent lights are dimmed by reducing the voltage going into the light. LEDs have a fairly narrow requirement for voltage to be able to run. The solution is to have the LED flicker on and off and adjust how long it's on compared to how long it's off.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my whole house is LED. I really like Feit Electric (Costco sells them) brand LED bulbs. They are affordable, and the 20+ year ones are great quality. You're going to want a 2700K color for warm in maybe a 60 Watt equivalent omni-directional bulb. Really depends on the room and desired brightness. Nearly all my rooms are 2700K and 100 Watt equivalent, but my bathroom vanity is 6 bulbs at 3000K and 100 Watt equivalent (wife loves it for makeup and face picking).</p>
<p>I do seem to have a tough time finding a flood light bulb with about a 1600 lumen output and greater than a sharp 30 degree spread (preferably in 3000K or 5000K)</p></div>		</li>
