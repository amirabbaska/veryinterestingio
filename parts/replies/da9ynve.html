			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to give a modern real-world example of exactly that:</p>
<p>In 1996 I got hired at a midsized software firm that had just had huge sales growth and was set to launch into the big-time.  They increased staff by something like 20% to handle all these new clients and to ramp up on the next generation of software and so on.</p>
<p>Well, I get through their training program, and, umm . . . nothing.  I'm not talking to any clients, I'm not getting to do anything.  Then the CEO gets up in front of the company one day and loudly announces that &quot;These rumors are all lies!  There will be no layoffs!&quot;</p>
<p>Well, he wasn't lying, because they simply terminated everyone who was still within the 90-day probationary period, and then began making up shit like crazy to fire-for-cause everyone else they could slash.</p>
<p>Turned out that he had incentivized the company's sales team by making their previous year's bonuses dependent on new installations.  So, the sales team had gone out to companies and persuaded them to take &quot;free trial installations&quot;.  Almost none of the &quot;new clients&quot; were actually paying customers, they were all on these eternal free trials with no obligations.</p>
<p>I was lucky, I started looking for a new job about ten second after the CEO's big announcement, and got another job offer literally about twenty minutes before the meeting in which they were going to &quot;fired-for-cause&quot; me.  The meeting started with my manager telling me that I hadn't done somethingorother satisfactorily, and when I slid the fresh-off-the-fax offer letter over to him to let him see, the meeting ended with him asking me if they needed any more people, and if so to put his name in.</p>
<p>I ran into someone from the company about a year later and he told me the CEO had been fired that summer.</p></div>		</li>
