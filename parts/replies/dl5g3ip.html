			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  It was a pretty rough answer, but if you want to dig a little deeper I would recommend checking out this vid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqwvcrA7oe8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqwvcrA7oe8</a> and then going deeper from there if you wish.  </p>
<p>Another cool effect of fasting is autophagy, where the body will consume damaged proteins and even cancer cells for energy during a fasted state if mTOR isn't activated.  </p>
<p>Also should mention that it is not necessary to fast to enter ketosis, one could consume fats and proteins and forego the carbs and still enter ketosis using this method, since it is the carbohydrates mostly that affect glucose production.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I didn't realize you could enter ketosis without fasting.  So connecting the dots in my head, is that basically the foundation of the ketogenic diet? I know this varies person to person, but is there a way to gauge how little glucose you actually can get away with before your body is no longer in ketosis, or do you need to eliminate consumption entirely?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dude who fasted for a year did an AMA once; or twice; to be clear he is a rarity because most people who attempt what he did will get so sick they have to stop, or will die; the doctors were surprised some of his organs didn't fail or his heart didn't go into fatal arrhythmia from electrolyte imbalances as it would for a lot of people. As it stands now, he says his organs are weaker and aged, though losing the weight may have still been a net gain for his life expectancy if he keeps it off. He'll almost certainly die if he ever gets fat again though.</p>
<p>BUT, assuming you hydrate well, take in enough electrolytes and water-soluble vitamins (the ones NOT contained in fat, basically B's and C) a very large person would last much longer. Nasa was doing research on it in the early 2000's as a possible part of the solution to long space travel and hibernation technologies but I have no idea what they found.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not familiar with carb-flu and whether it's the same thing, but I went through an educational program (keto with an emphasis on anti-inflammation) to cut carbs and sugar from my diet and it was explained that the initial &quot;ill&quot; feelings were the system shock of fat-soluble contaminants (pesticides, preservatives, food additives, heavy metals, pollutants, BPA, fire retardant chemicals, etc) being liberated as you began to burn fat. There was a strong emphasis on liver support through diet and vitamin supplements for the first two weeks, but the effects for my wife and I passed before the first week was through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question.  I will say a couple things here.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I would recommend being in ketosis before attempting a fast.  When the body is in ketosis, it behaves as if it were much more satiated than if on the glycogen pathway.  By this I mean the cravings are much less intense, and you feel much less hungry most of the time.  </p>
</li>
<li>My longest fast is 7 days (I am not overweight), and I noticed the first 3 days, I thought about food a lot, but did not have intense cravings due to the fact that I have fasted before and was already in ketosis at the time of the fast.   However, after the 3rd or 4th day, my mind and body accepted that I wasn't going to feed it, and I stopped thinking about food so much.  By the 7th day, I felt great, and almost regretted eating again, since I enjoyed the psychological break from thinking about food constantly.  </li>
</ol>
<p>So I would venture to say that it will vary from person to person, but it gets easier over time, and it helps greatly if you're in ketosis to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>After a few days? Yeah. After a few weeks though? Probably not. I lost 70 pounds in ~3-4 months when I was younger by &quot;fasting&quot; - after the first week or 2 you'd actually get <em>sick</em>, just thinking about food. </p>
<p>Your stomach gets so small that even if you were hungry it'd be a pain to eat much. I remember in the end when I was finished I'd have to practically force myself to eat by taking tiny nibbles and washing it down with water hah. </p>
<p>But yeah, you really aren't hungry when you go the anorexia route. FYI I didn't 100% fast as I'd eat whole grains or fruits/veggies when I had the chance. </p>
<p>Best decision of my life though! And i used to always call it anorexia but now I'ma be classy and call it fasting ;P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple things: You can and do burn fat before the switchover to ketosis, but not as much of it. It should also be pointed out that glucose is still essential for some processes even after the switch to ketosis, and humans <em>cannot</em> convert fats into glucose. It instead uses protein for this purpose, so even an obese person will waste away lean mass in a starvation scenario. Ketosis slows down that protein catabolism since glucose consumption decreases significantly when the brain switches to ketone bodies as a fuel source. </p></div>		</li>
