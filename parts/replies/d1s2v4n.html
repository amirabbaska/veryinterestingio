			<p>If not recycled asphalt is considered hazardous waste so they have a very strong incentive to reuse it.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's a petroleum product. Petroleum products are generally harmful to nature if not disposed of properly.<br><br>(Hopefully someone can give more detailed information.)</p>		</li>

			<p>Also, what would be reasons asphalt cannot be reused and how would it be disposed of?</p>		</li>

			<p>Asphalt is a form of petroleum, of course it's extremely recyclable like many other petroleum products.</p>		</li>

			<p>I found the rate of recycling to be more interesting than the fact that it was recyclable. There are few things that can achieve that rate of reuse, even when they have huge advantages in being recycled, like aluminum (which gets regularly tossed out here in the US.) </p>		</li>

			<p>Aluminum has a 95% or so recycling rate in thr US. because refining it from ore is ridiculously energy intensive.</p>		</li>

			<p>Source for that?<br><br>The average rate I find is about 67% but is for years 2012 or 2014. Often this information is for cans alone, which could well be a smaller part of the market than say metal salvaged from cars or aircraft etc. </p>		</li>

			<p>This is probably for cans, and is due to the people not recycling them. For the entirety of aluminium, the recycle rate is close to 95%<br><a href="http://www.world-aluminium.org/media/filer_public/2013/01/15/fl0000181.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.world-aluminium.org/media/filer_public/2013/01/15/fl0000181.pdf</a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_recycling" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_recycling</a><br><br>In industry, recycling aluminium has pretty strong economic incentive. Some people will scavenge aluminium from dump and other source of garbage and make a living selling it to scrapyards and recycling centers.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm assuming the requirements on asphalt repeatability and purity are much lower (compared to aluminum alloys for example), which would make recycling it a lot easier and therefore more profitable.<br><br>The process itself also looks a lot cheaper (lower temperatures and environment requirements).</p>		</li>

			<p>I would call it on par with concrete when it comes to QC. Plastics aggregate temperature bonding and a few other factors are tested to ensure quality. </p>		</li>

			<p>If you think about it, how much asphalt is torn up to begin with?  and of that, its generally going to be done by a construction company, who will be sensitive to their cost efficiency and want to maximize their revenue.  Im sure the 1% are the jerks that tear up their sidewalk and toss the debris into their can.<br><br>Unlike say, a private individual with a coke can that haphazardly tosses it into the trash, and it fails to get extracted by the trash service.  Thats going to be alot of us.</p>		</li>
