			<div class="markdown"><p>I found the rate of recycling to be more interesting than the fact that it was recyclable. There are few things that can achieve that rate of reuse, even when they have huge advantages in being recycled, like aluminum (which gets regularly tossed out here in the US.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming the requirements on asphalt repeatability and purity are much lower (compared to aluminum alloys for example), which would make recycling it a lot easier and therefore more profitable.</p>
<p>The process itself also looks a lot cheaper (lower temperatures and environment requirements).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think about it, how much asphalt is torn up to begin with?  and of that, its generally going to be done by a construction company, who will be sensitive to their cost efficiency and want to maximize their revenue.  Im sure the 1% are the jerks that tear up their sidewalk and toss the debris into their can.</p>
<p>Unlike say, a private individual with a coke can that haphazardly tosses it into the trash, and it fails to get extracted by the trash service.  Thats going to be alot of us.</p></div>		</li>
