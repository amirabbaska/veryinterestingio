			<div class="markdown"><p>In that movie the prisoners are rehabilitated by implanting information (like knitting skills)  into their minds so they must have found a way to freeze a person while keeping the brain active. It’s a sci-fi movie after all. The most unrealistic part of that movie is that C4 doesn’t come in 50 gallon barrels. </p></div>		</li>
