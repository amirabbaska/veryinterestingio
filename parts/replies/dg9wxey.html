			<div class="markdown"><p>One thought is that <a href="https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.newscientist.com/article/dn620-comfort-feeding/amp/" target="_blank">it helps babies suckle without getting smothered</a>. Monkeys have protruding jaws, but our jaws receded to make more room for brains. If women had flat chests, they would have to mash a baby's nose against it for the mouth to latch onto the nipple. A protruding chest allows a baby to both suckle and easily breathe through their nose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most apes have longer nipples than humans, to make nursing easier. While the smothering idea sounds interesting, modern day breast size could also be sexually selected? Throwing ideas out there, I dont have the time to research at the moment. Will come back to it later. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely disagreeing, because there are things such as vestiges that used to serve a purpose but no longer do. But I have to point out that most things DO confer some fitness advantage. That's how evolution works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A trait as significant and ubiquitous as large fatty breasts almost certainly has a role, even if it's just to signal to potential mates. Are you familiar with how natural selection works?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This hypothesis seems fairly well rounded: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcrxNBlqrbM" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcrxNBlqrbM</a></p>
<p>It addresses a lot of humans' unusual reproductive behaviors and justifies large breast preference evolutionarily as a natural consequence of other reproductive strategies. Worth a watch, IMO.</p></div>		</li>
