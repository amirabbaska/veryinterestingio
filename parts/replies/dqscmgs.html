			<div class="markdown"><p>The cons are you are scrubbing away enamel which doesn’t grown back on your teeth. It might work but in the long run your eventually going to run out of the hard putter layer of your teeth and have only dentin which is naturally yellow and weaker than enamel. I’m a hygienist and I would never everrrr scrub that on my teeth, it’s like pumice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a sodium ion developed in the US by startup Oravive. It was a miracle tooth sensitivity and really helped a ton of people. Used to be in lots of toothpaste. GSK bought the patent rights and tried to put it in Sensodyne. It claimed to regrow or strengthen enamel too. </p>
<p>Guess what happened?</p>
<p>American dentists were terrified so the American Dental Association (the ADA you see on toothpastes and brushes) got the FDA to make it available via prescription only in the US for like $50 a tube. Most dentists don't even really know about it.</p>
<p>Everywhere else in the world if you buy Sensodyne Repair and Protect the active ingredient is Novamin. It's amazing. Life changing. </p>
<p>You can go on Amazon.co.uk or go to Canada or Thailand or Taiwan and get it. eBay too. If you can find friends to send it to you.</p>
<p>One note, brush with it, but don't rinse. Just spit. No flouride means it's not horrible to swallow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A dentist is a mouth/teeth doctor, and goes to medical school. A hygienist can help with hygiene like deep teeth cleaning, and goes to 18 months of schooling to get a certification with no degree above Associate. A hygienist is also NOT a nurse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/phenom_anon is close. Dentists go to dental school, which is like medical school. They become doctors (physicians, really) of the clavicles and up (where your shoulders are). Hygiensts go to school for 18 months. Dentists can specialize into certain specialties like Endodontistry, Prosthedontistry, Orthodontics, Maxillofacial Surgery... Schooling is 4 years to earn the DMD or DDS degree (equivalent) and then longer for specialization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine recommends the crest gentle white strips. It has to be the gentle one. I think the box says you can do a 14-day course every six months, they go for like $45 online</p>
<p>She also says everybody should brush with a soft toothbrush. I'm special so I have to brush with an EXTRA soft toothbrush. Your teeth feel nice and clean after brushing with a stiff toothbrush, but you're wearing away enamel and damaging your gums.</p>
<p>She also tells me not to brush until at least 30 min have passed since I last ate or drank anything other than water, because food leaves enamel in a temporarily softened state and you want it to harden back up before you brush.</p>
<p>She's pretty obsessed with enamel</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Comment by u/DaBrown in this post:
&quot;Just a suggestion from a dental professional, don’t use charcoal toothpaste or any paste on your teeth. It’s like scrubbing your teeth leaving them microscopically jagged by basically exfoliating your enamel away. Yes, in the short run it will whiten, but with continuous use I give it two years and your teeth will look yellow from scraping all that enamel away up to the dentin, your second layer of your teeth which is naturally a bit yellow. Your enamel also doesn’t grown back like your skin does.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
