			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats have kidneys that are effective enough to get all the water they need from meat, so as long as a cat maintains a diet of fresh meat it doesn't have to drink. This is an adaptation for life in the desert. It can be a problem for owners of housecats, since cats today are typically fed dry feed or things like that, which doesn't contain enough water, so the cat needs to drink. And since cats aren't &quot;used to&quot; the need to drink (evolutionarily speaking) their thirst reflex is fairly weak, so they don't always notice that they need water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm stretching my qualifications here, but I think just about every temperate rodent or mustelid can probably go a long time with no water. Dietary water is a bigger part of your water balance if you're eating grass vs. seeds, and dew/fog is more accessible in non-arid environments. But rodent metabolisms are FAST, and good fur really keeps water in. </p>
<p>If the environment is right, I bet you could do it too! How often do you have to pee when you're bundled up outside in the cold all day, despite never drinking water? But, like I said, I mostly study not-animals, so those are claims that could use some other support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Erh, I highly doubt humans could pull it off. Our kidneys are just not effective enough and I can't think of any animal approximately our size which can live without water at all. Other than that, what you suggest sounds reasonable, metabolic water + food + dew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former bio major here, chiming in. OP is correct about the animals getting the water they need from their diet. The process of digestion actually produces some miniscule amount of water. For smaller animals, that tiny amount is enough to sustain their systems. Humans and other large animals are dreadfully inefficient unfortunately and have to gather more water from external sources in order to maintain themselves.</p>
<p>Side note: Did you know there is actually a summer equivalent to hibernation? It's called aestivation. Creatures in extremely hostile/arid summer environments can actually enter a torpor to conserve energy and water!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have somewhere that Squirrels make mushroom jerky. so that jerky can produce a little water for them.
Perhaps one of the most intriguing things you’ll find in Thorington’s books are the lengths to which some squirrels will go to take advantage of a food source.</p>
<p>For instance, did you know that some squirrels eat mushrooms? Not only that, but red squirrels will hang fungi out to dry between tree branches so that it keeps better over the winter.</p>
<p>Mushroom jerky is also less likely to infect their larder with insect larvae and nematodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I took biochemistry, but I did major in it. I'm almost positive that catabolism(which includes aerobic metabolism) tends to consume H2O because those C-C bonds in fat/carbs get broken and turned into C-H and C-OH bonds. Some animals, like meerkats, have super efficient kidneys which would be why they don't need to drink water.</p>
<p>Edit: That rule of thumb may not have been completely accurate in this case.  Metabolic water is (in part) produced when glucose is completely oxidized into water and carbon dioxide. Here's the unbalanced equation:
C6H12O6 + O2 --&gt; H2O + CO2 + NRG</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the citric acid cycle and beta oxidation consume water to produce reducing power (carried by coenzymes, I think NADH and FADH, iirc).  </p>
<p>Cellular respiration more than makes up for it.</p>
<p>Overall reaction is approximately <code>CH2O + O2 -&gt; CO2 + H2O</code> for carbs and <code>CH2 + 1.5 O2 -&gt; CO2 + H2O</code> for fats.</p></div>		</li>
