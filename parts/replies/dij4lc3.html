			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi mate. Australian anaesthetist here. Do they still do actual general anaesthesia in the dentists chair over there? As opposed to just conscious sedation? And would any dentist, on their own, actually perform the anaesthesia and do the dentistry at the same time? Very curious about this. The current generation down here have no experience with this practice but a few of our old timers do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that all depends on if you base your classification of GA on the ASA sedation scale.  General dentistry here will use versed/demerol and classify it as moderate/deep sedation. However there are several lawsuits you can look up where the patient loses their airway from over sedation (technically a GA) and an adverse event occurs.  This is unfortunately a result of a dentist trying to monitor the anesthesia and perform the surgery at the same time.  These events brought about a  standard for dentist offices to continuously monitor vitals/spo2. But if dentist doesn't monitor it then whats the use, a dental assistant is not trained to do this. </p>
<p>OMFS surgeons usually have an OR setup in their office but hire a CRNA or anesthesiologist to deliver the GA.  This is a common set up in US outpatient dental surgery.  </p>
<p>Pediatric dentistry with GA is performed in a variety of settings (hospitals, ASC, some dentist offices) but  always, to my knowledge, has an anesthesia provider present.  </p>
<p>A lot of dental anesthesia is administered by independent CRNAs in my area because its just not lucrative enough for an anesthesiologist to do it, so we don't bother.  However in some states a dental anesthesiologist can be licensed to practice. They are dentists who do post doctoral training in anesthesia.  We are not impressed with them and I don't support their practice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I just thought it was interesting that as an anesthesiologist, you seem to be supportive of CRNA and not AA. I generally avoid the political aspect of anesthesia practice, but I am curious about why you feel that way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked with AAs in the past and I know others who do. We all hate it. The vast majority is incompetent. It is more work for us because we constantly are called to the room plus we have to meet all the qualifiers for 1:4 supervision. Almost all Surgeons  are unhappy with them who then complain to administration which threatens our contract.  My current practice is symbiotic with crnas.  We all work together. They are unsupervised but we are around if anyone needs assistance (rare). </p>
<p>Only reason to ever work with an AA: greed. More money for us. I'd rather make a little less and work waaay less.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, appreciate the response. I work with anesthesiologists, about 1:4 ratio like you said. We have a good group; very collegial. Obviously, CRNAs and AAs in general are antagonistic toward each other since they vie for a similar role, but I've never worked with one, and they are rare in my state so I'm a bit insulated from it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many physicians have a different viewpoint. CRNAs are less likely to call for assistance since they are taught in school they are equivalent to physicians. Physicians I have spoke to prefer AAs because they are less cavalier and will call for help much sooner if there is a complication or difficult intubation.</p></div>		</li>
