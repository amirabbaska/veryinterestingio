			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like you're hovering close to an incorrect explanation, but it's a very common one and you still have the fairly right idea. Check out sections 2.2 (especially 2.2.2) and 10.1 of this article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force</a>). I honestly don't really understand it either, but what it sounds like you are saying fits into the incorrect view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;air pressure gives lift' is false actually. There's no reason the air above the wing would increase in velocity to keep up. Additionally, even were the principle sound, any wing would have to be so massive on top to produce enough lift it would be ridiculous.</p>
<p>The real reason a wing produces lift is actually far simpler, imagine a wing like a stone on a lake, it's flat and angled so as to 'skip' across the surface. The only reason a stone falls is because it's velocity drops off because it has no thrust. A plane and bird both generate their own thrust, which forces air into the angled wing, pushing it up higher.</p>
<p>Edit from google: &quot;A plane's engines are designed to move it forward at high speed. That makes air flow rapidly over the wings, which throw the air down toward the ground, generating an upward force called lift that overcomes the plane's weight and holds it in the sky. ... The wings force the air downward and that pushes the plane upward.&quot;</p>
<p>So not only is it 'skipping' across the air, the wing's shape actually throws the air downward, this is the reason the wing is enlarged on top, which is something I just learned now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, no.  &quot;Air pressure gives lift&quot; gives you the same answer as &quot;Air flow gets turned downwards by the wing&quot; (The first one is the Bernoulli approach, the second one is conservation of momentum).</p>
<p>The usual bit that gets stated wrong in the air pressure explanation is <em>why</em> the air has to move faster over the top of the wing than the back of the wing. Saying that the air &quot;meets up&quot; and has to travel farther is wrong; but it is true that air over a wing 1) moves faster over the top and 2) as a result has lower pressure and 3) adding up the pressures on the wing does give you the lift and drag.</p>
<p>A further note: what you're describing sounds really close to the Newtonian theory of lift, with air particles hitting the bottom surface of the wing.  This is in almost all cases not a good model for lift (it works for extreme angles of attack and some hypersonic cases).</p>
<p>ELI5 summary: Skipping a stone actually isn't the best analogy, since one side of the stone has water and the other has air.  You can think of lift happening because the special shape of a wing has the effect of pushing air downward; if the air is denser, the wing has  more to push against, and so you get more lift.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What people get wrong is they think the wing has to be curved (special shape) to generate lift.  But in fact, a flat wing can generate lift.  I.e. a paper airplane.</p></div>		</li>
