			<div class="markdown"><p>Silly putty is a terrible example because like all polymers it behaves differently under different strain rates.
Toughness (how much work can be absorbed) is related to the area under the stress strain curve. Brittle materials fail shortly after the elastic region while ductile materials are dislocated until failure.
Colder material acts more brittle because of thermodynamics. It is more favorable to fail completely than dislocation </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the word phrase you're looking for is 'non-newtonian'. Also, silly putty is a great example because of how sensitive it is to temperature changes. </p>
<p>Also, saying &quot;because thermodynamics&quot; is escentially repeating what I said in that a 5 y/o would need more advanced chemistry knowledge.  </p>
<p>Not sure how your comment is productive for explaining something to a 5 y/o.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The word is actually Viscoelastic. And they have a lot more going on than steel in terms of complexity.
Thatâ€™s fair about thermodynamics but I believe op wanted it in a basic chemistry background. A regular polymer is better suited with its glass transition instead of materials stuck between non Newtonian behavior and elastic behavior. </p></div>		</li>
