			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only on the particle size, but also on their number (for interference reasons). You can prove this easily by diluting a little amount of milk (which is a dispersion of fat particles) in water and then turning a light on the side. You will see the Rayleigh scattering in the form of a blue hue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer is way more correct than the top post, not sure why yours is so far down. The main reason is because of the particle geometry in this case - the Rayleigh regime applies to small water particles in the sky, but not in the same way in the ocean</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait... My understanding was that the mechanism of Rayleigh scattering WAS absorption of blue light by Molecular bonds and then re-emission in a random direction. </p>
<p>Have I got something wrong?</p></div>		</li>
