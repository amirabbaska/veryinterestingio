			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there is probably no need to intermix the definition of a continent and the definition of a tectonic plate.<br />
Their very difference and similitude give us the opportunity of handling various aspects of geography from political, economical to geophysical aspects.</p></div>		</li>

<p>there is no universally accepted metric to measure a peninsula.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly the case, and is true of almost all geographic terms, from bay to river to mountain to valley, etc etc. Places are called what they are called because someone sometime called it that and the name stuck. Not because someone took a comprehensive view and applied some terminology algorithm in order to get the right term.</p>
<p>There's no reason why someone couldn't call Alaska a peninsula and I'm sure people have from time to time. In the particular case of Alaska there is the problem of there already being a commonly accepted &quot;Alaska Peninsula&quot; which is a part of the state: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Peninsula" target="_blank">Alaska Peninsula</a>. So anyone talking about the whole of Alaska being a peninsula risks confusion and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>PS, to add a bit more. The historian Fernand Braudel wrote about Europe as being a peninsula. Most of his books aren't viewable on Google Books, but this review of one mentions the <a href="http://www.pro-europa.eu/europe/646/braudel-fernand-geography-and-freedom/" target="_blank">European Peninsula</a>. In Braudel's book <em>The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II</em> he writes about peninsulas a lot. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=yAMe0bu3Jt4C&amp;pg=PA162" target="_blank">This page</a> has a section titled &quot;The Peninsulas&quot;. The major peninsulas of the Mediterranean he mentions right away include the Iberian peninsula, Italy, the Balkan peninsula, Asia Minor, and even North Africa. North Africa because, despite being attached to the African continent was cut off by the Sahara and historically functioned <em>like</em> the other peninsulas of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Braudel also plays fast and loose with the term &quot;continent&quot;. Calling the Mediterranean peninsulas &quot;miniature continents&quot;. And even describing the major islands, like Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, etc, &quot;miniature continents&quot;. </p>
<p>He also uses the term &quot;isthmus&quot; in unusual ways, see the section starting <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=yAMe0bu3Jt4C&amp;pg=PA188" target="_blank">here</a>, where he describes what he calls the Russian isthmus, the Polish isthmus, German isthmus, and French isthmus.</p>
<p>What all this demonstrates to me is that terms like peninsula, continent, and isthmus don't have strict definitions and one can use them however one wants. But if one uses them in ways that diverge significantly from normal usage, as Braudel does, care should be taken to be clear. Braudel isn't saying &quot;the continent of Sicily&quot; or &quot;the peninsula of North Africa&quot;. Rather he is using these terms to evoke a particular way of looking at the geography and history of the Mediterranean. He presents an interesting way to think of the geography of Europe, using these terms in ways that encourage one to see Europe in, perhaps, a new way.</p></div>		</li>
