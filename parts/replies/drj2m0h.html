			<div class="markdown"><p>...automatics don't have clutches.  they have torq converters.   </p>
<p>DCT's hill-hold uses the brakes.   if you creep slow with a DCT, you'll wear out the clutch just like a manual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because an automatic transmission car doesn’t use a friction clutch like a manual car does- it uses what’s called a torque converter. At low rpm it works as a liquid coupling, basically the engine sloshes some liquid round and round and the gearbox uses the force of the sloshing to turn the wheels or hold you on a hill start. It’s clever stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fantastic. Thank you for the explanation!  ::EDIT::<br />
Is there any damage to the torque converter over time due to friction and heat from the liquid?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Automatic Transmission Torque Converters are like a fan blowing into another fan, except that fan is in transmission fluid. Most modern torque converters also include a lockup clutch that locks the two fans together. Doing so eliminates the rpm loss from the fan thing. It helps with fuel efficiancy and engine braking. There are also lots of little clutches (and bands) inside the transmission that are utilized to engage and disengage the different gears.</p>
<p>Edit: Basically the engine side fan is blowing hard enough to keep the transmission side fan from spinning backwards but not enough to spin it fowards.</p></div>		</li>
