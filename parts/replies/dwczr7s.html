			<div class="markdown"><p>The phosphate industry generally is actually a good precursor for understanding oil: lots of little nowhere countries were the world's richest for a while, until the resources ran out.  Most invested poorly or got fleeced by offshore interests, and are now <em>very</em> poor.  (Nauru is the example that comes to mind.)  </p>
<p>Nauru was in the second or third wave: not guano, but easily accessible phosphate rock.  It's all gone now, and 80% of the area of the country was mined...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if we didn't come along to mine it, the bats would eventually not have enough of a cave left to live in?</p>
<p>If they filled up every accessible cave, would they go extinct, or find somewhere else to roost (like trees)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This particular section of the cave was called the cathedral cave part of Capricorn caves in Australia. This cave hosts operas and weddings in there as the acoustics are really good, it is really tall I think 20m to the ceiling? And the floor is just compacted bat poo. So I doubt that it would be filled in the next thousand years. Also they did mine some of the poo in other caves many years ago(1910ish?) they stopped the contract as the miners started blowing holes in the caves despite strictly agreeing not to destroy anything.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing this cave system is located on the Tropic of Capricorn and because of this 4 weeks of every year there is a spot in one of the caves that has a hole which perfectly aligns with the suns azimuth which creates an instense beam of light that can light a piece paper on fire like a magnifying glass.</p>
<p>To answer your speculation about them roosting elsewhere sounds feasible but I'm just some guy who has done a lot of travel and a bit of caving in Australia.</p></div>		</li>
