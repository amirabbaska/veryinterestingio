			<div class="markdown"><p>The advantage you have over the house varies based on the cards played.  With 6 decks the player has a 49.45% chance of winning at the beginning.  Once the count reaches +6 (the net of all high, low, and neutral cards) the odds increase .5% in the players favor.  For every multiple of 6 this goes up (or down) by .5%. When I play online I usually wait until I have a 51% chance of winning to bet.    </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also varies based on the rules used by the casino. Odds are affected by the # of decks used, whether the house hits on soft 17s, splitting aces, other restrictions on doubles and splits, payout for blackjack, and other small variations. On the Vegas strip, there's subtle variation in rules between casinos, but the differences actually have a big impact on card counting viability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, doubling after splitting is a big one, and you won't even know unless you ask the dealer what the rule is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused.....    </p>
<p>The biggest factor in the player edge is his/her bet spread between high and low counts.</p>
<p>And what do you mean you play online? Online casinos shuffle the deck after every hand......</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody really explained how it gives players an advantage.  So your chances of getting 10s go up?  Yeah but so do the dealer's?  And I know they have to hit on 16 and chances are they have a ten coming if it's in your favor.  But you have a 16 shouldn't you hit as well because chances r the dealer has a 20?  Idk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have the option to double your bet when you get certain starting hands (mostly 10,11, some ace hands, some 9s) and generally you want 10s in that situation. Also the dealer has to hit in bad spots like when they have 16.<br />
Basically you have the power to alter your strategy. Also you get more blackjacks which generally pays more than you bet, whereas when the dealer gets it, you just lose the bet, nothing more</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered this myself.  I think a lot of it has to do with the ability to double down and split to win more money. I can't say I completely understand the math behind coming up with the house advantage, I just take their word for it and use the percentages they come up with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question on the &quot;tap on the shoulder&quot;. Is it really a thing like the movies have made it out to be? Like do serious winners get taken to the underground level of the casino and beat up or something? Does that (or a similar enough version of it) really happen? Or is it just like someone is beating the odds by 5% and they get a genuinely polite tap on the shoulder and get asked to leave?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody gets beaten up.  Maybe there was a day when that used to happen, like back in the 70s when the mob ran casinos, but not anymore.  Now you'll just be politely asked to find another game to play except for blackjack; they may even comp you a room and a meal to ice the sting.  If you keep &quot;advantage playing&quot; at blackjack you will be politely but firmly told to leave.  If you refuse to leave the police will be called.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nowadays, stuff is very strictly regulated.  So if you're ever in a legitimate state licensed casino and they make you go to an underground level to work you over, they better kill you because there are 1000 lawyers itching for you to call them so they can cash in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that card counting can be extremely difficult to do effectively without giving yourself away. I'm not saying you have to be a genius, the math is actually quite simple, but to do it quickly enough to get a running count without it being obvious what you're doing requires a very specific kind of brainpower that most don't have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do it if you put your mind to it.  I think the hardest thing to do is focus doing that when gambling because well gambling is exciting.  When your card counting it feels like an actually job.</p></div>		</li>
