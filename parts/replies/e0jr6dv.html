			<div class="markdown"><p>A whole duplicate conveyor belt just for the occasional piece of black plastic? Nahhhhhh.</p>
<p>How about just adding some more optical detectors?  If the vertical detector (pointing down at the black conveyor belt) says nothing's there, but a horizontal optical beam gets interrupted, then there musta been some black plastic.  Maybe that would help the problem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently went to a presentation about waste at the local &quot;trash company&quot; and they showed us a video where actual people sorted the plastic on the belts so I guess this wouldn't be a problem there haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black plastic is definitely recyclable. Our plastic recycling company turns over AU$15M and black is the majority of our product.</p>
<p>That being said, pretty much any colour can go in a black mix for extruding. Black Masterbatch (colouring agent) is cheap and strong.</p>
<p>White on the other hand, is pretty much only ever white once. Any colour contamination is very apparent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you read the article both claims were made. Both a process issue and a demand/price issue. Black is certainly less valuable </p>
<p>We used to collect and sort our own materials but now but in from others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s tints vs shades</p>
<p>People aren’t quite as fussed if the plastic is darker (slightly greyish) but not so keen if it has say a pink hue because of red contamination. </p></div>		</li>
