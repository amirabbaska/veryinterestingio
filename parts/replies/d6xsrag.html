			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say people should avoid them, they should just acknowledge that the airline is really inexpensive for a reason.  You're obviously not going to get the same frills and amenities on Spirit as you would on Delta, but your ticket's a third of the price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but their bag fees are ridiculous.  $55 for a carry-on usually makes it the same as Delta or United for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the actual answer, that even the guy who claims to be an aerospace engineering student didn't mention. The people who design the airframe including window spacing are not the same people who design the seating layouts, and in fact the seating can vary a huge amount from airline to airline within the same plane design.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 6'7&quot; and I have no problems with Spirit. Most of the time I end up with more room than on Delta/American/United just because the person in front of me can't recline on me</p></div>		</li>
