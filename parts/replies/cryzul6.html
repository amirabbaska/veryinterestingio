Furthermore say for the sake of argument that all the time zones were equal, and you want it to stay 10:37 pm you could travel at a steady speed so that each time you entered a news time one it would be 10:37 pm but the min, and sec, would keep increasing while you traveled through each time zone. Because there are no smaller delineation a than hours in time zones. So no you can not. </p></div>		</li>
