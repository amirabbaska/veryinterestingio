<p>Course nowadays we run a business and the accountant also takes care of our personal taxes but hey. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For 99% of Brits it is. Anyone who is an employee of one company with no additional side income (which covers most people) doesn't have to deal with taxes; it's taken out of your payslip and it all just works without any involvement.</p>
<p>Things get a little more complicated for people with more complicated affairs. My self Assessment is mostly me telling my accountant that it looks right. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In every successful American comedy show, theres always an episode or a trope about &quot;doing the taxes&quot; that has been completely foreign to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can only speculate why the US doesn't do this. You seem to have an industry dedicated to figuring out people's taxes. That's totally unproductive, just simplify the tax laws and the need for this industry vanishes. Complicated deductions might also be holding you back. Incentivizing certain behavior using the tax system can be great, but do it in a way that can be automated. Walking your old neighbors dog for free is nice, but shouldn't give you a tax deduction since no sane government could know that about you. Giving tax deductions for driving an electric car is fine though, as long as the IRS can access a registry over who owns what car and the registry shows which cars are electric. That way the deduction could be completely automated. Taxes do not need to be complicated.</p>

<p>You have hit the nail square on the head. There's absolutely no good reason why every year I have to spend time and alot of money to have my taxes done by a professional, using the information the IRS already has just to be told how much more I still owe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only reason we spend a day doing taxes every year is so a few large corporations can make gobs of money. </p></div>		</li>
