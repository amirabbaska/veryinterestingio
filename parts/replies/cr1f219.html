<p>But he would have to be naked or at least have an opening for his butt, right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a few orders of magnitude off: you need to consider conservation of momentum as well as KE. Even if there's enough chemical energy, there's not nearly enough reaction mass. An efficient methane engine might have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_rocket_propellant#Bipropellants" target="_blank">effective exhaust velocity</a> of ~3.6 km/s, at an oxidizer : fuel mass ratio of 2.6. So with 7 mg (10 mL) of CH4, this would give you a ΔV of just (3.6 km/s <em> (2.6 + 1) </em> 7 mg / 65 kg) = [0.0014 m/s](<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=(3.6+km%2Fs+*+(2.6+%2B+1%29+*+7+milligrams+%2F+65+kg%29" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/search?q=(3.6+km%2Fs+*+(2.6+%2B+1%29+*+7+milligrams+%2F+65+kg%29</a>).</p>
<p>(There's an unrelated error in your <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282*%280.01+Liters%29+*+%2822.4+moles%2FLiter%29++++%28890+kJ%2Fmole%29+%2F%2865+kg%29%29%5E%281%2F2%29" target="_blank">Wolfram link</a>: &quot;22.4 moles/liter&quot; should be &quot;1 mole / 22.4 liters&quot;).</p>
<p>In one interpretation, this maneuver is extremely inefficient at converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. The propellant stream is very fast (v ~ 3 km/s), and the rocket is slow (the total ΔV is very small), so, most of the KE (~ v^2 ) goes into the propellant instead. For energy efficiency, you'd need the velocities to be of similar magnitude, so you'd need a propellant mass comparable to the rocket mass. (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket#Energy_efficiency" target="_blank">&quot;propulsive efficiency&quot;</a>)</p>
<p>Since in this concept there's much more &quot;inert&quot; mass (nitrogen) than fuel, I think it'd be more effective to separate the combustion from the propulsion. For example, burn CH4/O2 in a fuel cell, and use the electricity to power a small <a href="http://www.lr.tudelft.nl/?id=26232&amp;L=1" target="_blank">resistojet thruster</a>, using the inert gas as working fluid. Then you could get a lower exhaust velocity (maybe 700 m/s) over a larger mass, for a ΔV of around 0.005 m/s. At least in theory.</p>

<p>Can you run through this with me a little more explicitly? I'm not an aerospace engineer so my training has left me equipped only to deal with pure kinematics - I don't fully understand the 1+2.6 and your meaning of 'fuel to mass' ratio.</p>

<p>Good catch, that's why I link to those things. These are all great caveats and I'll edit my post to include a link to yours. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oxidizer/fuel ratio: just means 2.6x more oxygen than methane, on a mass basis. If you have 7 mg methane to burn (per your assumptions), you'd balance it with 2.6*7 = 18 mg of oxygen, for a total exhaust mass of 25 mg. ^what ^is ^this ^a ^rocket ^for ^ants</p>
<p>The (effective) speed of the exhaust is 3.6 km/s, so its momentum is (3.6 km/s * 25 mg), and the velocity change (ΔV) of the human is that divided by 65 kg.</p>
<p>Nothing but kinematics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How interesting. How does this consideration apply to hypothetical photon thrusters (well, the hypothetical high-powered ones at least, a flashlight is one already, strictly speaking)?</p></div>		</li>
