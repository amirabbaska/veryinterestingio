			<div class="markdown"><p>The British government set targets for the NHS to reduce waiting times for patients left on trolleys. Apparently some managers removed the wheels from the trolleys and reclassified them as beds - waiting times went down. Still trying to find a good source for this, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Another example would be police reclassifying crimes to hit targets. <a href="https://m.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/414/right-to-remain-silent" target="_blank">Relevant This American Life episode</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example, the government sets a goal to reduce the unemployment rating. </p>
<p>They could do this in all sorts of way that don't actually help unemployed people. Commonly, unemployment rating only counts people actively looking for a job, so if they stop long time unemployed people from looking unemployment goes down. </p>
<p>Or they could lower the minimum wage to the point that no one can life of it to create more jobs, and now the unemployment is lower, but the previously unemployed still can't buy a proper meal. </p>
<p>There's all kinds of weird stuff that can be done if you focus on a number to hard. </p></div>		</li>
