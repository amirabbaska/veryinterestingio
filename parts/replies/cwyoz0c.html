<p>Recommend that your leadership contract some real experts to do a full audit of this book's physics. Electricians deserve to not be lied to by their textbooks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only briefly browsed the book, and found reference to magnetic field lines being called flux lines, with an improper definition of flux. Then it uses a <strong>left</strong>-hand rule for magnetic fields around a wire, when it is actually a <strong>right</strong>-hand rule. Here it is the straight opposite of true. I feel very sorry for the poor individuals that have to unlearn everything they trust from this text.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electricians and engineers define current as the way a positive particle would flow, and that is the most used convention for the definition of current. In a metal wire it is the negative electrons which are moving and a chemist would think of current backwards. There is an entirely reverse set of hand rules. I'm not saying your textbook isn't wrong, I didn't read it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's honestly hard to overstate how wrong this (it's contradicting causality for goodness' sake), and some of the other errors listed elsewhere in this thread are also ridiculous.</p>
<p>To be honest, I hope some other institutions which make use of Delmar/Cengage books catch wind of this and change textbooks, regardless of discipline. Something this wrong brings into serious question what sort of quality control is done at the company.</p></div>		</li>

<p>At least in math their books are better. Cengage publishes Galian's &quot;Contemporary Abstract Algebra&quot; which is very good. I'm using it this semester to teach abstract algebra and I like it a lot. I'm using one of their other math books this semester for a low level class I'm teaching also, and it has a few issues but they are all comparatively minor and seem overall to be better than many textbooks, although that one is on the 12th edition so one feels like they really better have ironed out most of the bugs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs more visibility. </p>
<p>Chances are the editor had no backing in physics, so the syntax is right but they trusted the semantics to the writer.</p>
<p>Best thing that can be done is to fix it,  and make sure the textbooks we spend metric fuckton on are at least technically correct. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's likely not part of a college course. This wouldn't fly at any reasonable college. This is probably part of some IT training/military training/vocation training program and it's a book primarily for electricians rather than electrical engineers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more than likely the issue in this example. I just can't believe it's never been 'reported', or no feedback has been received, since it's release in 1995. </p></div>		</li>
