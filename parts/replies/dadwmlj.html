			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two different measures: sodium and salt (sodium chloride).</p>
<p>2300mg (2.3g) of sodium is about 5.75 g of salt. That's the US FDA recommendation. </p>
<p>The average sodium consumed in the US or UK is 3.2-3.7mg, or about 8.5g of salt.</p>
<p>The danger appears to start at about 5-7g of sodium or about 12-16g of salt, with most of the data pointing to the higher end of that range.</p>
<p>The really fun part is that some research even shows <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/126/4/479" target="_blank">worse cardiac outcomes</a> for people who consume less than 2g of sodium per day.</p></div>		</li>
