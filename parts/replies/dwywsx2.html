			<div class="markdown"><p>When Newton developed Calculus, it was primarily for the motion of planets. Nothing useful/every day. 300 years later phones, rockets, cars, etc. wouldn't exist without it. It may not have amazing, flashy uses now but it doesn't mean it can't in the future. </p>
<p>Edit: also the hunt for large prime numbers may reveal insights into new branches of math/tech. For instance, the computer was invented as a tool to help get people to the moon, and now it's an every day thing. Maybe if we find a more efficient way to figure out if a number is prime, the relevant formula/program will have uses in other fields.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Wrong about the computer, the point I was trying to make is that it's original purpose was much different than what we use it for now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Encryption was used, and computers were used to make more complex, harder to crack codes. It was found that using two prime numbers multiplied together makes a much better key than any old number, because it has only four factors.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/twin-prime-conjecture" target="_blank">Twin Prime conjecture</a> is also relevant here.</p>
<p>In short, twin primes are two primes that differ by 2. For example, 3 and 5 are primes, but there are many more such as 107/109, as well as 18408749/18408751. Here's <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/100ktwins.txt" target="_blank">a list of the first 10k twin primes</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the conjecture claims that there are an infinite number of these twin primes, which is interesting considering the above results show that the probability of seeing prime numbers decreases as we go higher up.</p>
<p>It hasn't been proven yet (hence being a conjecture), but there has been various proofs getting close to proving it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was proven too.</p>
<p>Anyway, it there a triplet prime conjecture too? , like 7,11,13 or 11,13,17. Are there infinite number of these too?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a general &quot;prime k-tuples&quot; conjecture that says that unless there are any obvious obstructions, there will be infinitely many prime k-tuples of a given form.</p>
<p>For example, one could ask if there are infinitely many prime triplets of the form p, p+2, p+4. The answer in this case is no, because there is an obstruction: if you take any three numbers n, n+2, n+4, then one of these must be divisible by 3.</p>
<p>There is no such obvious obstruction for prime triplets of the form p, p+2, p+6 (like your example of 11, 13, 17), so we conjecture that there should be infinitely many such triples.</p></div>		</li>
