			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your comment. Sure, the closer we look, the more strain on our eye muscles to mantain the curvature of the lens. But, if you are aware of the 20-20-20 rule, accourding to it you are advised to stare at something at least 20 feet away for 20 secs, every 20 minute you work on a computer screen. Since it's usually a hassle to gaze out of the window in an office, why not simply close your eyes for 20 secs.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is looking at a star in the night sky not the same as focusing at infinity? I can relax my eyes so that everything goes blurry, even stars. If I want to look at a star, I have to consciously focus on it, and I don't wear glasses either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again it comes back to the idea of the 'ideal eye' in reality few eyes are perfect so biologists talk in terms of accommodation.</p>
<p><a href="http://practicalphysics.org/range-accommodation-eye.html" target="_blank">http://practicalphysics.org/range-accommodation-eye.html</a></p>
<p>Explains it pretty well.</p>
<p>Google has this to say on accommodation:</p>
<p>For a normal eye, the near point is located 25cm from the eye. Far point.
The far point of the eye is the location of the farthest object on which the fully relaxed eye can focus. For a normal eye, the far point is located at infinity.</p>
<p>Now bear in mind my 'biology' comes from film school in 1985 :) but back then shooting 16mm film or video infinity for focus considerations was 30-100 feet away depending on lens and aperture. </p>
<p>As a footnote - infinity basically means the object is so far away that light rays from the object arrive in parallel. So if the eye at rest is ideal it will focus parallel beams on a primary focal plane that coincides with the rods and cones on the back of the eye. That's how it's designed to work. If the eye is too long or too short internally then that won't happen and you are long or short sighted - neither condition changes what the ideal situation is it just illustrates that many eyes are less than perfect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would it be less stressful to the eyes to work behind a video projector rather than a monitor? Why is nobody doing that? Space restrictions or privacy concerns shouldn't be an issue for most home offices.</p></div>		</li>
