<p>or, in the UK, <em>Doppelganger</em></p>
<p>if I remember correctly, the intro/credits scene it pretty badass </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bought this dvd many years ago, was happy to realize that the version I bought has the cover that now goes for almost $200 :)</p>
<p>While iffy on some points of physical science, the mental/emotional responses do seem reasonably plausible.  The ending was also something unexpected, but understandable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; 1969, (Known as Doppelganger, now), starring /Roy Thinnes(&quot;The Invaders&quot;TV show, &quot;Airport 1975&quot;, and &quot;The Hindenburg&quot;. The show basically the obvious: guy takes off for a circuit of the Sun, lands on Earth2, where handwriting is backward, etc. Not a bad movie for 1969... </p></div>		</li>

<p>Reminds me of the pilot for Sliders. Quinn's first slide sends him to an alternate dimension where green means stop and red means go.</p></div>		</li>
