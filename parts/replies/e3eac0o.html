			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry but your answer makes it sound a bit like your saying that if you pick the peach early in the season it's cling stone and later in the season it'll be freestone even if it's from the same tree. This is not the case. Whether or not pit is cling or free comes down to what variety of peach it is. </p>
<p>Yes cling peaches <em>tend</em> to be early season types and free <em>tend</em> to be later but with over 2,000 varieties of peaches grown around the world it comes more down what variety and where the tree is grown that determines if it's a &quot;early&quot; or &quot;late&quot; ripening peach. </p>
<p>Then throw in the Hybrid Semi-Freestone (a cross between a cling and freestone variety) Peaches and all the &quot;common wisdom&quot; goes right out the window. </p>
<p>Edit: a word. </p>

<p>Freestone peaches are most often eaten fresh, simply because the pit is easily removed. This variety of peach is ripe around late May through October. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly researched this earlier this year because I found myself eating a lot of peaches and wanted to know what was going on. I several websites that appeared to be reputable that all said this. Now as I’m sitting on here John and trying to wake up, I can’t find that info anywhere. Let me see what sources I can find when I get some more time later today and see if we can find a consensus answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting! How come peaches are never &quot;marketed&quot; via their varietal? I can walk into a grocery store and see 18 different apple cultivars, but peaches are always just called &quot;California peaches&quot; or &quot;tree-ripe peaches,&quot; but never anything more specific than that—even though they often taste way different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The marketing is not as detailed as it is for apples.  I will occasionally see apricots marketed by their varietal, usually Earlycot or Tomcot. Pluots are occasionally marketed by their varietal as well. Sometimes you can see the varietal listed in the sticker attached to the case or by which boxes are marked on the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know where you’re from, but in my area there are only ever red delicious, gala, fuji, or Granny Smiths available as far as apples go. There are Texas, California, Saturn, white, and nectarines of a few different types, so, at least as many peaches</p></div>		</li>
