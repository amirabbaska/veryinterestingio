			<div class="markdown"><p>Id like to add that my new-born daughter has yet to learn to laugh. But she does show enjoyment. When I massage her scalp she relaxes and opens her mouth. But she doesnt smile, not yet. </p>
<p>That comes first after 4 to 6 months, after her eyesight improves, she can see other peoples faces,  and she learns that her emotional reaction actually matters to other people. </p>
<p>There is another anecdote that I also find interesting. </p>
<p>In playing multiplayer games, I tend to use teamspeak, a voice communication system for groups of people. One of the greatest things to do online is to crack everybody up, just say something so funny that the whole channel stops talking and everybody laughs. </p>
<p>But here is the thing, Teamspeak uses push to talk. Which means you need to hold a button down actively with a finger while talking.  </p>
<p>It CAN function on voice activation, but no one ever uses that as a channel with 20+ people will be an unmitigated mess if every sound everyone makes is constantly broadcast. </p>
<p>But here is thing.<br />
When someone laughs on Teamspeak they hold down the button.</p>
<p>Every. Time.</p>
<p>Think about that. They have nothing to say, they don't want to enter the conversation, many of them were busy in the game with other things and barely even paying attention. But they had to stop what they were doing, just to broadcast a loud chimp-like intermitten howling across the internet, almost by compulsion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting about the Teamspeak context. It makes sense, though. After all, why did we evolve an out-loud signal connected with humour if not for other people to hear it? If experiencing humour was just for ourselves, we might just feel nice inside and nothing else. Laughter, though, alerts everyone in earshot that something potentially funny is happening.</p>
<p>You may wonder why, then, do people sometimes laugh when they're alone? My proposed answer is that our society has moved faster than our evolution. For the vast majority of time we were evolving, no human was <em>ever</em> alone. Before we had civilization, it was critical for survival to stick close by your band of extended family. Being alone in a room and watching television or whatever is a thoroughly modern circumstance. Simply put, our primate brains haven't caught up with the reality that sometimes there might not be anyone around to hear us.</p>
<p>As for your daughter, she is likely to start laughing around six months. I talk in my book about my friend's child who started laughing at around five months. No one has any idea at what first made her laugh, and after that, she laughed at all sorts of arbitrary things. For a new human, the world is full of new things that are mundane to us, but, in just the right conditions, hilarious to a toddler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly I find that I'm less inclined to laugh when alone, even if something is really funny. I'm much more inclined to laugh at a comedy show, for example, when I'm watching in a group, even if it's not as funny as something I'd fail to laugh at alone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago, I picked up on my spouse (then boyfriend) using a particular laugh when he wanted to share something funny with me. He didn't even realize he was doing it till I pointed it out. Anytime I hear that laugh, I don't even wait for him to call my name - I wander into whatever room he's in and ask about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did I say weeks? i meant months, 4 to six months is what most of the literature says. </p>
<p>The interesting thing about laughing is that its a compulsion, its like we all have tourettes in this one way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think about this every time I'm on TS with my raid group. Should I be broadcasting my laughter? Does that even make sense? </p>
<p>On one hand, it feels wrong to open up your mic to broadcast laughter. I mean what if you're the only person who found that thing funny? Now you're just randomly laughing into a silent channel.</p>
<p>On the other hand it <em>also</em> feels wrong to cut my mic when I start laughing. Laughter is the reward for a good joke or witty repartee and it feels wrong to deny the person who told that joke the reward. Sort of like going to a comedy show and not laughing even though you found the jokes the comedian is telling to be funny. </p>
<p>You bring up a very interesting point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude I don't know I used to do that and had my voice activation on. If you set a good threshold and use headphones it will never activate unless you're actively speaking or laughing. If you need to talk to someone else in the room there is a push to mute yourself button I believe. How often do you hear them yelling &quot;FUCK upu tucking hacker over of shit&quot; when they die? Don't think they really feel compelled to press the key and broadcast that either. That would suggest voice activation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost everyone I've ever played with, on several different voice systems, has used PTT.  It's almost like people are different.</p>
<p>To Exodus111's point, I actually noticed last night that I was hitting my PTT button when laughing at someone's story.</p>
<p>Personally I also can't not use it, since I play with my GF and we have open mics with each other and talk about random shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read something  some years back that posited that it is a response to the unexpected. IIRC when some other animals &quot;laugh&quot; it's an aggressive behaviour, and the theorey was that we used it when we were surprised as a kind of alarm, it would alert the community to danger while making a sound that might startle/scare whatever the threat was. This kind of explains why we laugh when we are assaulted at some of our most vital areas. It also forces us to bare our open teeth, a very aggresive behaviour in many mammals.</p>
<p>As we developed to be more rational, seeking new experiences became a large boon, and behaviours were selected for that encouraged us to seek the unexpected. This included making laughing enjoyable, while still keeping an aggresive sound that could startle other animals. The part I liked the most is it provides a very deep root for schadenfreude. If laughter is a response to learning, especially learning what is safe and what is dangerous, it makes sense it would go off when someone hurts themselves because it just taught us that something is dangerous, eg: that branch that looked sturdy was rotted.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's what I heard a while ago, don't have any sources unfortunately. Was curious to see how someone who has spent a great deal of study on the matter had to say about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two reasons I don't buy into the idea that laughter is a way of learning information.</p>
<p>One is that it's unnecessary. If you grab a rotten branch and fall down, then pain will tell you not to do that again. If you grab a rotten branch and fall to your death, then you've eliminated yourself from the gene pool and the others who were more wary of grabbing rotten branches succeed in having offspring. Laughter and humour, as far as I can see, doesn't add anything new or useful to that situation that isn't already taken care of by other, more immediate mechanisms.</p>
<p>The other, lesser, issue I see is that laughter is often about fictional or false information. Sometimes humour can be outright surreal. As a way of learning, it's wildly unreliable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought it was a reaction we have for instances that don't meet expactations. </p>
<p>Jokes always have some 'hidden' info that is dropped at the end. The President falling down at a speech is unexpected. Cowering in fear from an angry lion, only to have it be your friend in a costume. It seems that we laugh when our mental images don't align with <em>actual</em> images. </p>
<p>Hell, we even laugh at our past selves, at the fact that we were ignorant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem I have with the idea that laughter is the result of unexpected results or circumstances is that there are many things that are unexpected but not funny. Horror and suspense movies have many unexpected moments that cause fear, not laughter. Or, on the other end, you might surprise someone by giving them an engagement ring, and they may be delighted, and laughter might be one part of their possible responses, but it's certainly not the expected or desired response. I think there are just too many exceptions to the idea that laughter and expectations are correlated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes there are many different types of unexpected moments and we have different reactions for different situations.  ex. unexpected embarrassment you blush.  I feel like laughter came to a type of nonverbal communication so we dont have the need to actually say oh thats funny im laughing. instead we just laugh. </p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WellSpentTime" target="_blank">WellSpentTime</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely convinced about this, as I think there is only a specific type of unexpected results or circumstances that are funny. What if we limit it to the type of unexpected results that are illogical or unexpected in a way  that &quot;tricked&quot; you into believing something else was going to happen?</p>
<p>To use the previous example, if you give someone you are in a relationship with an engagement ring, it might be unexpected, but certainly not illogical. If, however, you as a guy give your non-gay best friend an engagement ring, I'm pretty sure he's going to have a good laugh. </p>
<p>As another example, I found a random joke on the internet:
Boy: <em>calls 911</em> Hello? I need your help!
911: Alright, What is it?
Boy: Two girls are fighting over me!
911: So what's your emergency?
Boy: The ugly one is winning.</p>
<p>This (bad)joke starts out leading the reader to believe that there's actually something serious going on. Then it takes a sudden and unexpected turn, which really makes no sense. It is in other words, illogical. Why would he call 911 if his concern is that the wrong girl is winning the fight? And if fighting is meant figuratively, why is he in such a rush to get help?</p>
<p>So if we remove the illogical part:
Boy: <em>calls his friend</em> Hello? I need your advise.
Friend: Alright, What is it?
Boy: Two girls are fighting over me.
Friend: So what's the problem?
Boy: The ugly one is winning.</p>
<p>This is still unexpected. Why would be ugly girl be winning? If he cares about the looks, couldn't he just choose the pretty one? On the other hand, it's not very illogical. Maybe the ugly one has the best personality? Needless to say, this version is not very funny. </p>
<p>And what about removing the unexpected part?
Boy: <em>calls 911</em> Hello? I need your help with a girl problem.
911: Alright, What is it?
Boy: Two girls are fighting over me, and I don't know which one to choose. I think the ugly one is winning.
911: But what's your emergency?
Boy: I don't have an emergency.</p>
<p>This is as illogical as the first version, but doesn't have any unexpected &quot;plot twists.&quot; Which makes it not very funny.</p></div>		</li>
