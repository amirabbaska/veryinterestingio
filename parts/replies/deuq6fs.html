			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say heroic acts, do you have any examples? That seems almost like a more interesting story than an act of horror driven by mental illness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even something like sociopathy in leaders can be used to commit heroic acts. Sometimes people with little to no sympathy are in leadership positions where they're called to kill others (military) or possibly hurt others to prevent worse (doctors who in history may have had to saw a leg off to save a life, EMT, police, etc) from happening. They may not be in it ideally to save people or do &quot;good&quot; but just to make a living. If you count leaders (heroes by some) driven by OCD, sociopathy, ADHD, autistic tendencies, depression (people unsatisfied with current state of things), schizophrenics who may exhibit artistic talents and many other forms of mental illness, you'd have a list of countless people. Of course to be a mental illness it's supposed to be considered harmful to its host or others but I think there's some method to the madness, or a good reason &quot;negative&quot; traits have evolved and thrived in society at times, and that we'd be remiss if we didn't count all the mentally ill people throughout fiction and non-fiction who committed heroic acts. That's a contentious theory and not intended to glorify or justify any mental illness, some can be hell for others and its host, but no doubt that what we may call mental illness can sometimes have a positive side. </p>
<p>Examples: <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/5228906/top-10-greatest-mentally-ill-superheroes" target="_blank">Comics are full of them</a>. Non-fictional: So many but I watched <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/index.html" target="_blank">A Brilliant Madness</a> lately and loved it. It's oddly curious in the mathematical world how some of these guys may have been mentally ill previously or driven to it by stressing the mind so much over a problem. Google &quot;mentally ill mathematician&quot; and history has some really interesting examples of heroes there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, this is a really interesting and thorough response! Thanks for sharing such a unique and unexplored perspective. It's really cool to see mental illness painted in a less negative light. </p></div>		</li>
