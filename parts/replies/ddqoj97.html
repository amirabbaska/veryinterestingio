It had an &quot;Urchin&quot; at its center, which was a device consisting of beryllium and polonium. As the core was assembled by the explosives, it collapsed on itself and produced a burst of neutrons, kick starting the nuclear reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the nuclear weapon equivalent of a flint or detonator that kickstarts the nuclear side of the explosion. (for anyone who isn't familiar)</p>
<p>When you see diagrams of nuclear weapons, this part is often omitted. I suppose that does make the world slightly safer if someone were to find a few kilos of plutonium in their coat closet.</p>
<p>The fact that you need a nuclear &quot;detonator&quot; when working with significantly subcritical quantities of fissile material is partially a safety mechanism. It means that an asymmetrical triggering of the conventional explosives used to start the reaction (for instance, because you dropped the bomb accidentally) would be unlikely to trigger a full nuclear explosion.</p>
<p>Note that this may not apply to the old 1st gen &quot;gun style&quot; bomb designs like the ones purportedly designed by North Korea. You really want to keep those away from accidental static discharge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doubtful that NK is using a gun style design. From what I understand, they're primarily focused on Plutonium devices using reactor bred Pu. As they found out during the Manhattan Project, reactor Pu is not suitable for a gun-type design, as it doesn't assemble quickly enough to achieve anything other than a fizzle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that the early initiators didn't produce that many neutrons — on the order of 100 or so. That's all it takes to make sure the reaction starts. It's not so much it kicking it off as just guaranteeing there are some neutrons floating around at the right time — even without an initiator, plutonium and (to a much less extent) uranium has a lot of random neutrons swimming around in them because of tiny amounts of spontaneous fissioning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's my understanding that the triggering devices, actually the entire triggering mechanism, which is <em>really</em> the tricky part in building one of these things. not that uranium enrichment is easy, or that plutonium breeding and enrichment is a walk in the park, but just that it's <em>really hard</em> to get a triggering device to work so precisely, so quickly, and to make fuses for the conventional explosives that are so ridiculously consistent and fast.</p></div>		</li>
