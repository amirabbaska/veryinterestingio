			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked at a cabaret club that once had a hypnotist. He had one guy become stiff as a board. With audience help, the guy was put on the backs of 2 chairs, ankles on one chair and neck on the other. </p>
<p>Then a (skinny) woman sat on the guys stomach. Not a single flinch from the guy and he looked really relaxed.</p>
<p>At close, when the staff were having a drink, one waiter said it was BS and the chair thing could be done by any guy. So we got 2 chairs, lifted him into the same position and the skinniest waitress sat on his stomach. He managed it but but no way was he relaxed. Obvious his body was working hard to stop him falling.</p></div>		</li>
