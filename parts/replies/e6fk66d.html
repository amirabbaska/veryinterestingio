			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to eat like a goat when I was younger. I clearly remember eating things that were absolutely beyond what should have still been eaten. Then I got on a health kick in my mid 20s for a bit and stopped eating stupid shit. Now I just can't eat anything even close to as questionable as I used to. Not an expert, but I think whatever good bacteria was inside me going apeshit eating anything in sight ended up getting starved out by more normal bacteria. So long, pizza I'm pretty sure we only got 3 days ago :(</p></div>		</li>
