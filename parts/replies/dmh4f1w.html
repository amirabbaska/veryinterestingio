			<div class="markdown"><p>It will begin to slow down considerably. We are running out of methods for producing the next-heaviest element already. A &quot;superheavy element factory&quot; is being constructed in Russia now, which will likely contribute a lot to superheavy element research. But to reach into atomic numbers around 120 is already a huge challenge that we don't yet know how to overcome.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can we project an elements properties before their creation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are fundamental particles, meaning that they exist as a basic building block of everything, they are not made up of anything smaller. They have a negative charge of 1.6e-19, which is a very small amount of charge, but there is almost never just one electron. While a lot of elements have their electrons tightly bound to their nucleus in clouds around it, metals (and some other elements) freely share their electrons between each other, meaning they can flow, hence why metals are conductors. This is the basic principle of how technology works, we generate a potential difference (voltage) via some means (chemical, electromagnetic, etc.), and electrons flow from the lower potential to the higher as current. We think of current as a flow of positive particles from high potential to low, but that is just for convenience, there are no positive particles flowing. As the electrons lose potential energy, they do work, which is what we use to power things. For example, a light bulb uses a high resistance filament to cause the electrons to do a lot of work, releasing energy as heat, and therefore light. This work causes the potential energy to drop, hence while you'll see a voltage drop over a light bulb. Please note this is a simplified explanation. </p></div>		</li>
