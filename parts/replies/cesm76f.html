<p>The water department in your town is probably maintaining (by law) a certain level of chlorine or other chemical to kill nasties in the water. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope. It's not required to put chlorine in the water. Approximately <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sueddeutsche.de%2Fgesundheit%2Fchlor-im-trinkwasser-mit-chemie-gegen-den-dreck-1.1121889" target="_blank">half of the water suppliers don't use chlorine</a> in Germany. Ground water is pretty safe to drink without adding chemicals, the few germs are sometimes treated with ozone or UV rays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two points in act in our (Germany) favour here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>good infrastructure: short distances between treatment plant and consumer (e.g.: <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodensee-Wasserversorgung" target="_blank">water is imported from the Lake Constance</a> but the treatment is always near the consumer)</p>
</li>
<li>Germany is somewhat cold. Cold enough to lay pipes a deep into the ground and not having to worry about them getting too warm even in summer. That's a big part of the secret of Germany not having to use chlorine for the supply pipes against for example Legionella.</li>
</ul>
<p>Concerning the dirt the OP mentioned: if you constantly use the pipes under a high enough pressure, where should the dirt come from? Most often some dirt comes from local measures to clean up the pipes, loosening lime and iron from the inside.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Though it is Advised, even in germany, to let the water flow for a couple of seconds to drain &quot;standing water&quot; and user &quot;fresher&quot; water, as Legionalla grows in standing water.</p>
<p>The secret to clean water often comes from using enough water, to keep it moving. In some countries (includign germany) water saving in threatening water quality, because the water and the waste-water is staning to long in the pipes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same in the Netherlands. 90% of Dutch water companies do not use any chlorine whatsoever. The 10% that do(edit: actually I think it's only Rotterdam that still does) only use it as initial cleaning method but do not maintain the amount of chlorine, they actually try to get the water to be as good as chlorine free once it arrives at  your house. </p>
<p>All the people here saying water is dirty and only maintaining the levels of chlorine is what is saving us are wrong. Maybe that's how it works in the US but it's not the only way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope they use other forms of purifying the water? Under Norwegan regulation you need several barriers, both physical and chemical. On top of that the water treatment facility where I've interned (don't work with it now) had chlorine as a back-up in case of, for example, the UV-system malfunctioning. </p>
<p>What sort of physical barriers do you know of in Germany? &quot;We&quot; used crushed marble. I know other variations and filter are also relevant, but I sadly don't remember.</p></div>		</li>

Marble filters are mostly used to 'neutralize' water low on calcium.</p></div>		</li>

<p>as opposed to the final section of pipe to your home and to your sink, which if you don't use the water for days or weeks and let it sit, can become full of rust and junk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I live in a big apartment building in a medium sized city and if I don't run the tap for at least a few seconds before drinking then the water tastes a bit off, but it looks fine.  It tastes like when you leave a glass of water out overnight and it tastes funny the next day.  Is this normal?  At my parents house in the suburbs outside a different medium sized city, for example, the water tastes fine immediately out of the tap.  Their house is older than my apartment building.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know a lot of places use chloramine these days and from what I understand that won't degrade easily.</p></div>		</li>
