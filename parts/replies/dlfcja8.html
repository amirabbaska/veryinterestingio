Its continues from mouth, middle ear, nose and down your throat because they have the same origins during development, hence infections usually spread, a sore throat can affect your hearing due to tube mentioned in the original comment closing creating a lower pressure in the middle ear. </p>
<p>Other than that, these doctors usually perform most surgeries affecting these areas of the body. The anatomy is so complex and interconnected it requires its own surgeons that also do clinical work.</p>
<p>Edit: Source, im a medical student!  </p>
<p>Edit 2: Spelling, writing on my phone with Swedish autocorrect apparently takes the air out of my knowledge on what an ENT does. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is also why Speech Language Pathologists (SLP's) are in charge of chewing/swallowing issues as well as their more obvious areas. Learning that anatomy is such a pain that it specialists end up covering anything to do with it.</p></div>		</li>

Here is a video of a recently approved procedure

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im from Sweden and we rarely do it here, but i heard they do in germany.  The most common issue with the eustachian tube (aka auditory tube, goes from the back of the nasal cavity to the middle ear) is that it closes with ultimately creates a lower pressure relative to the outside. In germany you can go through the nose and put in stent (like the ones used during a heart attack to open a coronary artery) to even out the pressure. </p>
<p>Its really hard tho, and you can get the same result with a tunnel through  the eardrum, which is an easier procedure, cheaper and less invasive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact in my discipline we treat brain aneurysms by passing wires in to the groin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how divers equalize their ears as well. There are exercises that open your eustachian tubes and allow you to equalize the pressure. The best known one is pinching your nose, closing your mouth and blowing hard. </p></div>		</li>
