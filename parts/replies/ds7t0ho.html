			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always said this, there is no benefit to looking at the clock if you wake up in the middle of the night. If it's time to get up your alarm will go off. If I wake up in the night I try not to even move or open my eyes, most of the time I end up going right back to sleep. </p>
<p>Some people I know will wake up, roll over, sigh, look at the clock, check their phone then wonder why they can't get back to sleep.</p></div>		</li>
