<p>Unfortunately, users were forcing micro USB cables upside down, as they physically could now, destroying the pins on the devices. Manufacturers thus put micro-B sockets even on OTG devices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's really interesting though is that DJI  uses micro USB A ports on their controllers and the included cables are also micro USB A.</p>
<p>Micro USB B does fit inside of the port as well too, the only real difference is that the port is rectangular instead of trapezoid like micro B. </p></div>		</li>

<p>With USB-C the bendy fatiguing spring is in the socket of the device allowing for a cleaner appearing plug</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is why all my fucking USB-C ports on my laptop no longer securely hold on to their attached cables.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why they didn’t go with something like Lightning which has no moving parts on cable <em>or</em> plug. USB-C might be a step forward for people using Micro USB, but it’s still a giant step backward from my perspective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so disappointing! What kind of laptop? How long have you had it? How often do you plug things in?</p>
<p>I agree with you, that sounds like a step backwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Macbook Pro with Touch Bar, and only for four or so months. One of the ports is permanently occupied by a YubiKey, and the rest of the ports are roughly evenly used for plugging in power. I'd estimate a rate of plug-ins at 1/day/port. This has been the case for at least a month, so I'd estimate that the springs in the USB-C ports have failed after 90 or so plug-unplug cycles.</p>
<p>I had the same issue with a previous laptop as well.</p>
<p>I otherwise love the machine, but compared to Lightning, USB-C is a steaming pile of shit and I wish they'd just opened up the Lightning spec instead of dooming the industry to a decade of USB-C garbage.</p></div>		</li>

Doesn't type C have springs on the wire. It's just in the inside rather than the outside </p></div>		</li>
