<p>Yeah, People in Canadian paraliment claimed the DEA threatned 'more searching' but that's not a trade issue, and everyone knows it's just blowing smoke and would ahve no real impact more more then a month.</p>
<p>It seems more likely the the DEA is an alarmist scapegoat used by people in parliament so that didn't have to look bad for shutting down a popular change.</p>
<p>I can't think of any practical way anything the DEA change would have a long term impact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because without worry of growing the marijuana being illegal in Mexico, the only obstacle the cartel face is shipping it to other countries.

<p>A common conspiracy theory revolves around the fact the &quot;The War on Drugs&quot; is essentially a huge Swiss bank account for the US government to fund covert black-ops. The kind of black-ops that got the US nested in the Middle East for instance. If they don't want something showing up as a line item in a federal budget, move it around until it becomes copacetic. Dealing with a corrupt nation like Mexico makes it that much easier to clean the paper trail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 'This is Your Country on Drugs' Ryan Grim makes a good case that there aren't enough drugs or drug users in the US to justify a war against, once you remove marijuana from the equation.  There's no question the social impacts from highly addictive hard drugs are much more severe than weed, but relative to the population almost nobody uses them and of those who do even fewer wind up addicted.  So you end up needing weed scheduled to have the resources necessary to deal with actual problems.  It's a really weird conundrum we've found ourselves in; personally I'm all for abandoning prohibition, but getting there is going to take a complete restructuring of the economics that support American law enforcement and a whole lot of social reprogramming.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this may be true, it is a poor excuse for social policy; if you need to fund something, and can't fund it legitimately, then it probably shouldn't be funded or else you need to do a better job of making your case.</p>
<p>In any event, I think that marijuana is probably going to be legalized by the US within 20 years, at which point it will be legalized in a lot more places. The reality is that most Americans just don't care about marijuana abuse anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have had periods where other drugs have been a valid problem in certain areas. You have the crack epidemic of the late 80's and the 90's. In Detroit it really was as bad as the publicity about it stated. There were multiple crack dens in neighborhoods, and it generated plenty of addicts causing problems for other people, and definitely created a harmful culture, especially for those impoverished. We're left with a  generation of African Americans growing up that it was commonplace for you or your friends to have parents very much lost to the pipe.</p>
<p>That's not to say the crack epidemic was far reaching, and it certainly doesn't bother the white people in the suburbs, but it was a significant issue.</p>
<p>The problem is that the war on drugs isn't a solution. Cop raids didn't kill the crack epidemic, people growing up seeing the destruction it left turned a lot of people away from crack, even as it was seen as a guaranteed entrepreneurial venture for people in impoverished neighborhoods. Sure we still have crack in bad places, but the numbers are not as high. And while it's a tragedy and an issue we should educate about, it's not a socially harmful activity that should be pursued aggressively by law and persecution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In general, the cartels are well diversified. Take away marijuana, and there are several other drugs they can resort to. Take away drugs, and there is weapons smuggling. There's smuggling of immigrants over the border. There's human trafficking. Last resort, there's kidnapping for ransom. Cartels have a lot of ways to make money and self-perpetuate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sort of logic follows the lines of, &quot;well, if we legalize chocolate, the criminals will just get into heroin, better keep chocolate illegal!&quot;  It is an utterly insane and nonsense argument.  You don't keep something illegal so that you give criminals something to do.</p>
<p>Legalizing marijuana all over the US would be a severe body blow to the cartels.  Why?  Most people don't fucking want inject heroin into their fucking vaines.  Shocking, I know.  Literally a majority of Americans though are pretty happy to smoke weed.  Why?  It is safer than a bottle of vodka by a few orders of magnitude.  A handle of vodka is a lethal dose for me, and I can get a half of a block away for $10.  A majority of Americans on the other hand have not tried heroin.  In fact, nearly all Americans stay away from the stuff for boringly obvious reasons.  Heroin is a problem for those who do it, but they are an extreme minority.</p>
<p>Illegal marijuana is like illegal chocolate.  It is giving criminals free cash, protects citizens from nothing, and funds criminal empires.  Citizens rightly don't give a shit about the law and so marijuana is a huge cash crop for the cartels.  Over half of cartel money comes marijuana because it is so damned popular and easy to sell.</p>
<p>&quot;But they will push heroin and other nasty things!&quot; you cry.  They can try.  How much do I have to market and chop the price of heroin before I can get you to slam the needle home?  Would you do heroin even if I was paying you?  For most folks, there is nothing you can do to &quot;market&quot; heroin better.  Heroin isn't popular because no one does it who isn't already kind of fucked up.  On the other hand, my Dad, a boring nearly retired engineer who doesn't swear and votes Republican will happily smoke some weed.</p>
<p>This isn't even academic.  We have tried this before.  He had alcohol prohibition and saw the rise of massive criminal empires funded by a thriving black market.  We ended alcohol prohibition and saw those empires crumble.  Sure, those criminal empires diversified.  They got more into illegal gambling and hookers, but how much illegal gambling and hookers do you consume in a year?  Those empires diversified, withered, and crumbled.  </p>
<p>The same will happen to the cartels when prohibition ends.  Their profits will be cut in half overnight and their market will radically shrink.  The smuggling they continue to do will be even more dangerous (for them).  Instead of shoveling money at them by letting them sell something that a broad cross section of America wants and smokes, we will start to bleed them as they are reduced to folks who are generally fucked up and a tiny minority.  </p>
<p>If we really wanted to fuck them up, we would adopt a sane drug policy for all drugs and base prohibition on actual harm and addictiveness.  Crazy, I know.</p></div>		</li>

Saying they would just switch industries is pretty misleading because even if they did am excellent job of switching, they would be reduced from a constant threat to national security to an occasional threat to peace and order. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if you take the position, but I've heard people reason &quot;They'll always exist in one form or another, so taking away their marijuana profits won't do any good.&quot;</p>
<p>Weakening them would be an unequivocally good thing. If anyone has evidence to suggest that they're indifferent to their marijuana market being taken away, then now'd be the time to present it. I suspect that they are vehemently opposed to such a change because it would lead to less profit and less power. This should lead to less violence, something that will never be eradicated in human society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, they'd probably just find a different way to make their money. I mean the Knights Templar cartel has been making a lot of their money off of the lime market through extortion and theft from producers of a legal product. Marijuana is easy money right now for them, but I don't really think targeting any one of their enterprises will &quot;cripple&quot; them as is put in OPs question. Organized crime is historically very resilient when it comes to disruption. The American mob wasn't crippled when prohibition ended. Sure a lot of the way they make their money is through illegal markets (drugs, prostitution, illegal gambling), but quite a few infiltrate legal markets (the stereotypical waste management, teamsters, insurance scams). Hell, European mafia figured out a way <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/renewableenergy/7981737/Mafia-cash-in-on-lucrative-EU-wind-farm-handouts-especially-in-Sicily.html" target="_blank">to exploit government subsidies for wind farms</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed but product is product, take away the weed profits and they will fill the void, legally or non. Whatever money that's used in illegal trade from.drugs, guns,human trafficing, dog fights, prostitution, bootleggimg,selling hacked info, whatever gets funneled into legit businesses. The start restaurant chains, cell phone stores, liquor stores, Mexican restaurants whatever. Any profits from anything illegal is used for legit purposes and then to bribe people for protection from everything I mentioned. Policital and corporate curruption in the US and World is the real main problem not the cartels or anything mentioned. Without the protectors they can't do anything. We need transparency to the fullest degree.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mexico gets a lot of US aid for &quot;fighting&quot; drug smuggling, and doesn't want that to dry up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the root of it right here.  But all of your points could have been said back in the 90's pretty much verbatim.  What needs to be emphasised that today we are living in a different time, we are living with a REAL war in Mexico.  It's kind of like the war against ISIS now except way bigger.  The scary stuff they say ISIS might do?  you know cut off the head of an American, which i guess they have managed to do a couple of times?  That has happened to hundreds, maybe thousands of Americans and even far more Mexicans since 2006 when the REAL war started.  And is it happening in Syria or Iraq or Turkey half a world away like ISIS?  Oh no, it happening right here in a world half of America thinks is just as foreign and and far away as Syria is, even further maybe since they don't obsess about it and talk about it CONSTANTLY on the news.</p>
<p>Usually I could spend a day talking about this to anyone that would be willing to listen but no one wants to hear it.</p>
<p>And it is late at night and I'm tired and this is ELI5 and my son is five and I can't imagine being able to come close to explaining WAR to him.  I can't imagine what I would have to say to make him understand this WAR.</p>
<p>Anyway if you want to follow up on your points I would start with what has changed since the 90's.  A big one is NAFTA, after NAFTA it became inherently easier to move things from Mexico to the United States and back again.</p>
<p>Think about every <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container" target="_blank">Intermodal container</a> you have ever seen in your life.  Hundreds? Thousands? Tens of Thousands? Hundreds of Thousands?  If you can't drive a mile without seeing one?  And you've driven a hundred thousand miles?  Thats a lot of containers.
There are some Interstate Highways where every other vehicle is carrying them.  If you grew up in a place like that and think that is normal for the rest of the USA, well, it's not, but nowhere in the USA are they uncommon.</p>
<p>Now think about the fact that you didn't know what was in a single one of them.</p>
<p>So what do I tell my son?  Nothing.  The only thing I can do at this point is actively teach him Spanish as much as I can.  I will hopefully teach him that he is growing up in a world where the walls between Mexico and America are being torn down, not put up.  That we live in a different world than I grew up in.  That we are all norteamericanos and that we are all in this together.  And that truly he is a citizen of the World.</p></div>		</li>
