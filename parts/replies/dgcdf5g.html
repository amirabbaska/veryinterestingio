<p>The Belgians figured out that if you have a flat bottom bottle the residual sugar can continue to build up CO2. If it builds up enough over time, it'll explode. The Belgians put a divot in the bottle to break up the amount of concentrated sugar in one area and thus the bottles wouldn't explode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect.  Yeast will happily consume all available sugars until they either run out of sugar, or the alcohol levels exceed their tolerance, and they die off.  Sugars will remain in solution and diffuse throughout a bottle.  The sediment you sometimes see in certain beers is dead yeast, not sugar.  The divot (punt) in the bottom of glass bottles is a structural improvement that functions like an arch, allowing a bottle to be a better pressure vessel.  It also has the secondary effect of being easier for the glassblower to make a stable, flat bottom, so that the bottle stands well on a table.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I am correct in the punt being functional yes? If it were a flat bottom the CO2 would continue to build. This is what I've always known and if I'm wrong I'd like to know where I'm wrong. I don't know many glass blowers so I usually don't get to have this conversation </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The important takeaway is that the punt is functional, in that in makes the glass vessel stronger.  </p>
<p>But it has nothing to do with controlling the levels of CO2.  The CO2 levels (and thus, the pressure, and carbonation) of the liquid are controlled <em>only</em> by how much sugar is available for the yeast to metabolize, and the amount of alcohol in the solution.  In other words, flat-bottom beer bottles burst because it's an inherently weak shape, not because of sugar concentrating along the bottom.  Sugar levels are the same throughout the fermenting beer, with no gradient.  In addition, the act of fermentation itself stirs the liquid due to gas formation and thermal effects, further mixing things.  </p>
<p>[edit] Here's a <a href="http://howtobrew.com/book/section-1/priming-and-bottling/priming-solutions" target="_blank">priming sugar chart</a> that shows how much sugar you want to add per type of beer for an appropriate bottle ferment.  Note that the Belgian style has the highest recommended level of sugar.  This leads to the most CO2 being produced per bottle, and greater gas pressure along with it.  It isn't a surprise that the Belgians needed stronger glassware than others!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An additional reply, so you'll be tagged.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f_xdEDlERE" target="_blank">Here</a> is a brief video showing how a modern glassblower makes a bottle.  </p>
<p>At the 1 minute mark, you'll see him making the arch of the punt, then attaching the work to a solid pipe (called the punty) so he can work the opening side.  Notice that the indentation makes it easier for the glassblower to properly center the bottle before transfer, and also notice that at the end, when they knock off the bottle from the punty, they have to flame-polish the rough area where the bottle had been attached so that there aren't any sharp/weak spots that might cause the glass to crack during annealing.  If the bottom area wasn't concave, that rough area would make for a poor-standing form.</p>
<p>(Despite the conveniences of modern lighting, gas, etc, this basic process would have been recognisable to a glassblower from hundreds of years ago, and many of the tools used are ancient.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I've worked the last 10 years on customer service side of the industry. I'm just happy I can contribute. My dream would be to get paid to study beer and history. But I didn't get the Smithsonian gig. Who do you work for? PM me</p></div>		</li>
