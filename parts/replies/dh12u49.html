			<div class="markdown"><p>Airport runway numbers also reflect the magnetic heading, so because magnetic north is always moving (and moving more and more rapidly in the last decade or more) magnetic headings change so runway numbers therefore have to be changed (repainted) to accommodate the proper magnetic heading.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the replies you've been getting, the magnetic north actually moves at a noticeable speed. On the occasion that I'm doing field work I sometimes rely on an orienteering compass to make sure I don't get lost. You have to adjust these compasses to account for the difference between true north and magnetic north if you want to use them in conjunction with maps. This adjustment is called the declination, and is a published measurement you can get for whatever part of the world you live in. Over the last 10 years I've had to re-adjust my compass to new declination measurements a few times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On average they do line up, but the Earth's magnetic field is messy and likes to wander, so at any particular time it's generally offset and not actually all that close to a perfect dipole. The process generating the magnetic field (dynamo action in the outer core) tends to roughly line them up, but doesn't need to actually line them up perfectly. Loosely related: Saturn's magnetic field is extremely well aligned with its spin axis, and at first this was actually really hard for people to explain because dynamo theory required some non axial component to work at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>correction: the magnetic pole near the geographic north pole is the <em>south</em> magnetic pole. that's why the north magnetic pole on your compass is attracted to it, otherwise they would repel each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting!</p>
<p>what does GPS / mapping use ? </p>
<p>im going to guess it uses geographic north pole, and that true magnetic north is about 11 degrees off what a common person would consider north?</p>
<p>i say this because what i would consider north is the geographic north pole of the Dipole map <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/607968main_geomagnetic-field-orig_full.jpg" target="_blank">referenced</a> above. But if someone were to make a simple magnetic compass, it'd be ~11degrees off what they(or, i guess, I) would think north is. So I'm a little lost there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they point to magnetic north, which is either 14 or 16 degrees off of true north.</p>
<p>True north is how the Earth physical spins about its axis. Magnetic north is how the metals and lava and magma and crap under the surface interact to create a giant magnet with its poles somewhat near the spin axis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're trying to visualize it, realize that the fabric analogy is sort of a 2-Dimensional representation of a &quot;thin slice&quot; of space (well, actually space-time, but let's not go into the weeds here). You sort of have to imagine that fabric existing all around a planet, at all angles, facing all directions, etc.... but with all of them 'dipping' down towards the planet. </p>
<p>Or imagine a 3D grid with nice even spaces everywhere; then where mass is located - the grid lines tighten up/bend towards it a little. </p>
<p>It's not easily visualized; hopefully that makes some sense or helps a little.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>The earth's gravitational field is not uniform around the planet. Different density rocks and water change what the local field looks like by small amounts. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Geoids_sm.jpg/300px-Geoids_sm.jpg" target="_blank">NASA's GRACE mission mapped out the field.</a></p></div>		</li>
