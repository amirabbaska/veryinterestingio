			<div class="markdown"><p>My family and I recently moved from a rural area (county population 80k) to a big metro area (easily 10x more residents and 50x more people passing through).</p>
<p>My kids caught pinkeye and some other virus at school.  Needless to say, my wife and eye got pinkeye (first time in my life and I'm almost 32).</p>
<p>While administering eye drops to my youngest, I was asking her to open her eyes.  As soon as I opened my own mouth and started to say &quot;Open&quot;, she coughed right down my throat </p>
<p>4 days later, I had a cough that lasted 5 weeks and 7 days later I had pink eye.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always really healthy, never got colds, had the occasional sinus infection and every few years tonsillitis or some other crap. Fast forward to my kid turning 1, putting him in childcare and me going back to work. My god. We've both been healthy for a full month and it's so unusual! Last year we had gastro twice, pink eye twice, influenza, he had RSV and pneumonia, and this illness and that sickness. Chicken pox is the latest thing going through childcare.</p>
<p>Fun times! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pediatric urgent care doc and this has been my experience too. The first few years you are sick more frequently and then you build immunity to the most common bugs in your community. Otherwise I can’t explain literally being sprayed in the face with snot by a febrile toddler multiple times per shift and not getting sick. My entire (fully vacccinated) family except me went down with Flu A this year. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I am glad I had my flu shot.  I was only down for 3 miserable days.</p>
<p>Fun fact, being sick on the road sucks as a long haul driver.</p>
<p>My emergency bucket has never been more needed!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All that.</p>
<p>Though we can get got.  My peds rotation in med school was just me being unable to breathe through my nose for six weeks.</p>
<p>Now that I’m an attending and mom is retired, I get whatever’s circling the senior center.  Colleague has a fairly new baby.  When preschool hits, I’m just going to wear a surgical mask to work.</p>
<p>But we’re insane about hand washing.  It makes a world of difference.</p></div>		</li>
