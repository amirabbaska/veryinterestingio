			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer you're looking for is not just that it places stress on other organs but also invades them and destroys them. Tumors may spread to your brain and grow and grow. Not only does this interrupt nerve pathways but keep in mind your brain is confined to your skull. It has nowhere else to go. It gets squished to death. Tumors spread to the liver and destroy the architecture of the organ making it no longer able to do its job. They spread to the lungs and destroy them. Now these don't work anymore either. If they spread to the bone marrow they can interrupt your the bones process of making red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. This can strain your heart (lack of RBCs), cause you to die of infection (WBCs), etc.</p>
<p>Then there is the fact that treatments we use, particularly chemo, also suppress WBCs making you more likely to die of infection.</p>
<p>Why you die may be different from case to case but kept unchecked, it will kill you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So really, Cancer is like being crushed to death, but only your organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once cancer spreads to a new place in the body it becomes almost impossible to target and kill it in multiple locations. This is because it's probably in the spinal cord fluid. It metastasizeses because it grows faster than everything around it.</p></div>		</li>
