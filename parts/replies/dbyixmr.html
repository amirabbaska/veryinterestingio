			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not totally sure what to picture, but I think the operations manager's view is right. </p>
<p>As I understand it, the houses are going to draw the heat they need from the loop <em>and no more</em> whether you set the boiler to 100 or 160. But at 160, much hotter water is sitting in the loop and losing heat to the ground (yes, even though insulated) at a much faster rate, since rate of loss is dependent on the difference in temperature. </p>
<p>To make it more intuitive, consider going further with your thinking: make the boiler 500F (if it could handle it). Wow, now that should be even better, the houses will only have to briefly tap into this ultra-hot water. But of course, maintaining the loop at that temperature will cost much more fuel. The same is true, just to a lesser degree, with the 160F vs. 100F difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting conundrum, to say the least. The flip side to your argument, though, is that the earth surrounding the buried pipes is also a (poor) insulator, as it has relatively poor thermal conductivity. As you warm up the dirt around the pipes, that changes how much is wicked away from the pipes. One of the experiments I've wanted to do is run the boiler hot in the fall (when we have plenty of hydro power available) to warm up the ground around the district loop, and see if that actually improves winter performance.</p>
<p>In our situation, we're fortunate as we have our own hydro-electric power plant, so electrical power is basically free. The problem is that in the depths of winter, when the temperature drops below freezing, the water supply to the power plant starts to freeze up, dramatically reducing the available power.</p>
<p>One of our other thoughts has been to sink a number of wells and during summer months when there is plenty of power, to dump all the extra into the ground. In the winter, we'd then heat-pump off that, basically using a large cube of earth as a thermal bank.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your ideas about heating the ground when you have excess energy available are excellent.  However, the choice of water supply temperature is not a conundrum.  u/tripperjack is correct.  Regardless of the thermal conductivity and thermal mass of the soil, you will lose less heat to the soil if you use a lower temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if one of the houses is calling for heat, it will expend more energy in the pursuit of that heat than it would normally.  That being said, I know very little about the given system and I don't believe the electricity saved is worth the heat loss.  I feel like this is certainly something worth looking into; energy saved vs energy used in both situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conceptually, it's a pretty simple system. There is a single large boiler, heated by cordwood and/or electric elements (up to 70kW worth). The circulation pumps push the hot water through an insulated underground pipe system, which runs past a row of 7 houses. Each house in turn has its own circulation pumps and thermostats.</p>
<p>Anyhow, as an Engineer, this is one of those optimization problems that I find really fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Choosing a water supply temperature is about more than standing losses , if this is a non-condensing boiler system (very likely) it should never be allowed to fall below 145 F, to do so will rapidly increase corrosion damage to the firebox and heat exchanger surfaces from acidic condensate.</p></div>		</li>
