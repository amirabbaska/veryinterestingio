			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering what would happen if you get molten glass and &quot;hold&quot; it in the &quot;middle&quot; and allow two drops to form, being connected to the same tail.
Or if that is even possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Toughened glass insulators are made this way. Their strength is remarkable, though they are not able to survive a gun shot. Toughened glass is a preferred method to produce insulators for the highest voltage transmission lines in the world. Common brands are Sediver (Seves), SGD (La Granja, now Verescence), Global Group, Global Insulator Group and Nanjing. Many of these brands have videos outlining the toughening process, which is similar to the process for forming Rupert's drops, but uses air to cool the outer glass. Check them out! I work in Transmission line design and this is certainly my favourite piece of transmission line hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is essentially how tempered glass is made. Any piece of glass which cools rapidly has internal tension similar to a prince Rupert drop. If you drop a blob of molten glass into a bucket of water in a way that doesn't form a tail, you will have a blob of tempered glass able to withstand high external stress, like the head of a prince Rupert drop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However a tiny flaw through the surface layer will release the energy stored in the glass, causing the entire panel to explode as is typical when tempered glass fails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi destin, I have a few questions. </p>
<ul>
<li>is it possible for you to re do this video at a later date by trialling different calibres and round types? To try and yield different results? </li>
</ul>
<p>maybe a collaborative video with Richard Ryan from fullmag channel would be ideal since he has a massive arsenal and high speed cameras. </p>
<ul>
<li>if there were a way to suppress the shock wave that travels to the back of the drop, would it still break? </li>
</ul></div>		</li>

<p>P.S. I love your channel by the way, your genuine enthusiasm and sense of curiosity really makes it enjoyable to watch.  Also you're now the only channel in my list of subs that has notifications turned on!  Thanks for the tip.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to see the test recreated with higher calibers. Based on how it handled .22lr, I don't think it inconceivable that it could withstand 9mm out of a pistol length barrel. 5.56 would be the ultimate test.</p></div>		</li>
