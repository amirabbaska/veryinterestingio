			<div class="markdown"><p>You can. Many people listen in. If you buy an aviation chart or an IF supplement you will find the frequencies listed in there. Also if you look at skyvector.com you can get the information from the charts for free. Which airport do you live near? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. You can get a receiver (Probably a transceiver. It will both transmit and receiver). Just google “aviation handheld radio”. But, at 30 miles you definitely won’t hear the tower and you’ll only hear some of the other airplanes. You probably have a smaller airport closer to you, though.</p>
<p>You can also listen to airports right now via <a href="https://www.liveatc.net/" target="_blank">https://www.liveatc.net/</a> .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I️ can say what it sounds like is fizzing hissing fart-like noises, nothing desirable. I’m an audio engineer for an AV company, we use the wireless microphone spectrum and what sucks the most is the FCC is constantly juggling around allowances of frequencies to other devices. They just sold off some of our spectrum to cellular service so we’re in the process of selling off our now obsolete wireless microphone kits to other countries where the frequencies are still legal to use. And we have to buy brand new units. No rebate, no compensation, kind of bogus. If you’re caught using frequencies you’re not allowed to be in anymore I️ believe it results in a fine from the FCC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wifi uses 20 MHz to 80 MHz or even 160 MHz wide channels, as opposed to FM radio which uses 0.2 MHz wide channels. It's really difficult to get a channel that wide on such a low frequency, so probably not. You would need at least a couple hundred MHz for a reasonable carrier frequency for anything carrying high speed data. I believe LTE also uses 20MHz wide channels, so similar situation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AM signals can go crazy far under the right conditions, as the signal can &quot;bounce&quot; off the Earth's magnetic field at certain times of day. If I recall, there was one station in Cleveland that was seriously overpowered early on in radio and in the evenings could be heard halfway across the world.</p>
<p>EDIT: Per the below comments, it was WLW 700AM in Cincinnati and for a short time in the 30's they ran a 500kW transmitter, an insane half-megawatt.  Current FCC rules have 50kW as the maximum.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WLW#History" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ionosphere, not magnetic field.  It's the point in the atmosphere where solar radiation strips electrons off the gas molecules to create a layer of charged gas.  During the day, the band thickens towards the ground, so radio signals that bounce off it don't go as far.  At night, it recedes upwards, so radio signals can travel farther before they're bounced back down.  A powerful signal can bounce back and forth from ground to ionosphere 3 or 4 times before it becomes unintelligible.  You can also bounce radio signals off the moon with a strong enough signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What’s also cool is that, due to the way radio waves interact with the ionosphere, higher frequencies travel faster through it and if a thunderclap happens on the other side of the world (producing a sudden electromagnetic pulse containing all frequencies), the high frequencies will reach you first and you’ll hear a descending “whistler”. </p>

<p>My grandfather said that they could sometimes pick WLW up in the Philippines during WWII.  When I was flying, I used to set the ADF to 700 to serve as a homing beacon, and I could listen to the radio through my headset.</p></div>		</li>
