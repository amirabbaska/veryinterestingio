<p>Unfortunately, there's really no one to hold these people directly accountable (like a mom), since it seems like some of the most powerful, influential people in the world are the ones implicated in this. </p>
<p>It will be <em>really</em> interesting to watch as the list of people implicated from Western countries grow, and the big question is &quot;what will happen?&quot; Certainly, it is interesting to see influential people from the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and East Asia implicated in this, but accusing the Saudi Royal Family or Chinese elite of corruption is like shooting fish in a barrel, and I'm sure no one will be shocked to learn that Putin isn't squeaky clean. </p>
<p>The real test will be how the media (at large, rather than the journalists releasing this data) and public react as more people from Western nations are implicated in this. Hopefully, we will be able to hold these people accountable, but I'm not exactly holding my breath, since we can't know how deep this rabbit hole goes. If 2 or 3 U.S. senators are implicated, they will probably be run out of office. But if 15 or 20 (or even more, though I shudder at the thought...) are implicated, at some point, you have to ask whether the government will respond to the will of the public and hold their peers accountable... </p>
<p>And what if the Koch brothers or other high-profile, very political donors are implicated (and my bet is that they will be)? That would be a real litmus test for the role of money our government: they're not going to bite the hand that feeds, so the question will be, would they rather alienate their voters/constituents or their donors? Only time will tell, but I'm worried that we already (unfortunately) know the answer.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR The scary part is that there's not really anyone to hold these people directly accountable, since some of the wealthiest, most powerful people in the world will likely be implicated in this.</strong></p></div>		</li>

<p>Then some Kardashian drama will come up, we'll forget all about this silly nonsense and all will be right with the world again. /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm looking at US media outlets right now, and <em>none</em> of them are running this story. Seems like kardashian drama already trumps this story. Why is that? </p>
<p>Edit: yes it's all over the place now. My question stemmed from the fact that most american sites took almost a day to report on this when europe had it all over, and published late at night on a sunday. Maybe the us publishers were fact checking, maybe they were skeptical, or maybe they were waiting for the go ahead from higher ups. Either way it seems a bit strange, especially since, so far, those who are implicated here are not exactly on good terms with the US establishment (putin, jiping, and so on).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What exactly do you expect to happen? You shit on American pop culture as if that's to blame. These are the most powerful people in the world. This is like ordering Superman to testify before congress. These people are untouchable. </p>
<p>This is the way the world has worked since the beginning of civilization. Stop pretending like there's anything at all anyone can do to hold them accountable. That's not going to happen. It's not an outrage. It's not a shock. Powerful people will stay powerful. Stop being naive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is ELI5 to the letter, however I would like to know what a &quot;good reason&quot; could be for dodging income taxes illegally? AFAIK, it would have to outweigh the economic burden it directly results in, right?</p>
<p>Maybe in some fucked up place, with a fucked up government, and your company is looking to defraud the government while stashing earnings for rebels? But that seems a bit of a stretch when, to use your analogy- Johnny, while keeping your piggy bank hidden, is also known to be jolly good friends with Joey, who beats and rapes his sister :I</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you do e.g. business in Russia, you may want to hide your money from the government to avoid the situation where one of Putin's buddies simply says &quot;this business looks good. I think I'll take it&quot;. Still not &quot;legal&quot; but let's say it might be morally justifiable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any crime could be potentially perceived as moraly justifiable. What is going to need to happen here is more investigation.  </p>
<p>In this case, there are a lot of people, with a lot of money, in a crazy place for no apparent reason. Now we wait for those who care enough to ask 'why?' to offer up their findings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe Timmy's mommy is a crack head and will steal even from her own children to get a fix.    There are lots of bad countries where mommy (government) actually outright steals due to corruption (not &quot;steals&quot; in the GOP/Libertarian nomenclature where &quot;Steal&quot; means &quot;tax to pay for basic services&quot;).  </p>
<p>If mommy wants to familiacize (nationalize) his piggy bank and decides that David's piggy bank is now family property instead of David's property he will be happy that not all of his piggy bank was public.  David might want to protect his hard earned lawn mowing money from a bad mommy like Hugo Chavez. </p>
<p>Another &quot;good reason&quot; might be just for convenience.   Samantha might keep a piggy bank at school in her locker so that she doesn't have to wait to go home to get the money out to pay her friend Jill. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or, if you don't want the government to take your money to buy presents for others. </p>
<p>I'm thinking more along the lines an Eastern European government illegally seizing a businessman's assets and giving the proceeds to cronies than more run-of-the-mill tax evasion, but that too obviously.</p>
<p>EDIT: Or, as a person of sizable wealth from a country without strong rule of law, you could use the Panamanian financial system to obscure/protect your assets from hackers, non-state supported criminals, other corruption ... If &quot;they&quot; don't know how much or what you have, it's harder for them to target you, and it's not inherently illegal to do this.</p></div>		</li>
