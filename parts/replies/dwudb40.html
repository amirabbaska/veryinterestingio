			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome answer!</p>
<p>I'm an excellent artist and I know I am a very creative person but I've ALWAYS had a huge problem when it comes to actually &quot;putting it on paper&quot;.</p>
<p>I can draw anything I can see. I can embellish the art as I'm making it and find cool ways to make it my own but forming an idea in my head and then making it real is very hard.</p>
<p>I can &quot;know&quot; what I want to do. I can see it in the Mind's Eye, but when I must engage my hands and create the thing I want...its like the idea becomes unfocused and I cannot concentrate on any one part of it long enough to make my hands do it.</p>
<p>Personally,  I love pencil and paper but I can only draw it if I'm looking at it. My daydream doodles suuuuuuuuuck, although they are drawn well lol.</p>
<p>I always attributed it to ADHD and a difficult time with focusing but maybe that's not the only reason....I guess I'll just keep practicing.</p>
<p>*edit; the original question was about writing. I think I know the feeling as well. I love to write but it ain't going to happen if I sit down and say &quot;OK were doing this thing! We're finally knocking this novel out!&quot; That'll end up a big NOPE! if I just start writing when the idea hits...I'll go on for pages!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADHD could be a big part of the issue, it has a tendency to interfere a lot with executive functioning (y'know the &quot;get stuff done&quot; part of your brain process).</p>
<p>I've got ADHD and autism so executive dysfunction is a thing I'm more familiar with than I'd like.</p>
<p>One thing I use to help get past that when I'm drawing or writing is to sketch out the different parts of the idea in my head without worrying about making it something I can finish. So say I want to draw a deer lounging by a pond. There are parts of that I can focus on that aren't the whole drawing; so I'll look up reference photos of deer lying down, different kinds of trees, lakes in a forest, etc. and I'll end up with two or three pages of completely random lakeshores, trees, and deer. Then once I'm confident enough that I can draw all the elements I want and have the picture in my head of what the completed piece would look like, I pretend the finished piece is already on the page and I'm just tracing it.</p>
<p>If it's writing, well I have the whole story in my head but it never wants to come out in the right order, so whatever scene pops into my head at the time, I write that down and worry about stitching everything together later (that's what editing is for! lol).</p></div>		</li>
