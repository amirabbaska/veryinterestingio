			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that it's the same velocity but not the same angular velocity. The difference is that if an object A is at a larger radius than object B at a smaller radius, over the same period of time object B would have moved in a larger arc than object A. If they had the same angular velocity (w=v/r) they would stay in the same local space. Another way to think of it is to imagine an ant moving around a plate of circumference B which is smaller than another plate, A, of larger circumference. The time it would take to move around plate B once wouldn't be the same for the same ant to move around plate A. They move at the same speed but have a larger distance to move to complete a full circle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that the stars in the galaxy aren't like the planets in our system, but I was under the impression that the stars generally had the same linear velocity, not the same angular velocity. So our position relative to stars at different distances from the core will change over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that stuff closer to the Galactic center will orbit around the galactic center faster than us and therefore we will see new stuff there eventually, also stuff further away from us is going slower than us so we will see some new stuff there also, but if you look directly in front or behind us in our galactic orbit we're just going to see the same stuff going around the galaxy at the same speed as us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then I doubt it.  The distances to other galaxies is so great that parallax from one side of the Milky Way to the other is pretty insignificant to the vast majority of the cosmos.  </p>
<p>The Milky way is &quot;only&quot; 100,000 light years across.  Andromeda, the nearest major galaxy, is 2.537 million light years away.  </p>
<p>Take a look at a golfball 25 feet away.  Take a step to your left.</p>
<p>Looks pretty much the same, no?</p>
<p>Do that with a ball a mile away.  That's the change in view for the galaxies the furthest away.</p>
<p>There will always be a bit of sky behind galactic cores that we can't see.  And that amount of space may hold a shitton of stuff (re: Hubble Ultra Deep Field).  But it will always be a tiny fraction of the Universe.  Time will change more of the extra-galaxy than our distance traveled around the hub.</p></div>		</li>
