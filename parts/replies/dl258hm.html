<p>Institutional investors and other investment banks had access to a lot of data in the 80s, far more than you or I would have had easy access to. </p>
<p>These days, everyone (theoretically) has access to the same data, depending on whether or not you want to shell out the money to pay for it. That makes it far less likely that a company small enough to fall victim to a hostile takeover is doing something so fundamentally different than what a current big investor would want to see happening.</p>
<p>That, and the fact that poison pill clauses have held up in court.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An provision in the corporate charter (the document that creates a corporation and sets its rules) that allows management to issue a huge number of shares to certain holders under certain conditions.  </p>
<p>As an example when, Gordon Gecko buys 20% of a company, and threatens a vote to sell the whole thing to him, the company gives the 80% owners new shares, reducing his ownership of the company to 11% and greatly increasing the cost to takeover the firm.  </p></div>		</li>
