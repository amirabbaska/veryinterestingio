			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation makes the most sense to me.  Heat changes the shapes of the molecules in the rice allowing water to infiltrate the new space between the changed structures.  Also, these physical and geometrical changes lead to changes in the biological properties of the rice that make it more palatable to our senses.</p></div>		</li>
