			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a lot of fun. 14 shots seem like a lot, but I'll admit, I've never been treated for a rabies bite (without already having a prophylactic rabies shot on board already). Hope your wife's all healed up and not too afraid of cats now. </p></div>		</li>

<p>As horrible as my country is, we have cheap medicine and I am proud of that...no one deserves to shell out 1000s of $ for something as conventional as Rabies shots.. it's not some high tech vaccine, it's been with us for quite some time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can’t comment on the mechanism, but some rabid animals end up dumb, wandering around in daylight and basically just stumble around until they die.  Last year, a skunk just stuck its head under a garbage can downtown near where I am and sat there not moving for a day until it died.  That’s why if you see raccoons, skunks, foxes etc. moving around in daylight, you should stay well clear and call animal control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the behavioral component to this disease is caused by infection of central nervous system neurons. While the replication and transmission of the virus is left to infection of the salivary glands, infection of the neurons leads to an over-excitation of those cells. That's actually what causes death in rabies... basically it's your central processor giving you the blue screen of death. The reason it does that is because it's trying to activate the fear and anger centers of the brain. Anger and fear lead to biting, so on and so forth... fear of water, as previously mentioned, helps with transmission so as to not dilute and wash away those precious viral particles. </p>
<p>So it's got some code - some basic directions that lead it from the initial site of exposure all the way up to the brain where it's supposed to execute some basic commands. The problem is, biology is messy and lots of errors can come up. So there are times when viruses, bacteria or parasites of any kind can get lost, activate, infect or destroy things they didn't mean to, etc. That may be what happens with rabies when it accidentally infects the wrong part of the brain. While the hippocampus is the processor responsible for putting together a lot of emotive triggers, the cerebellum is responsible for movement and coordination amongst other things. Over-exciting the cerebellum therefore results in blowing the fuse on your ability to efficiently move around. </p>
<p>Now the real question is whether this is a bug or a feature. After all, let's remember that rabies infects ALL mammals, the majority of which are not predators nor are adaptively built for carnivorous type activities. In the flight or fight response, most critters are built for flight. The dumb stage of the disease may be a feature for spreading rabies from prey to predator. Now, one would have to ingest the infective portions of the prey to be infected (brain and salivary glands predominantly would have the bulk of the viral load), but if you're talking about a small rodent, the head is where the juicy bits are. </p>
<p>This is an unconventional mode of transmission and I am not aware of the degree to which it's been studied. Furthermore, there have been studies in rodents and lagomorphs that have shown that a large percentage die from rabies without ever exhibiting clinical signs of the disease. Whether this is from trauma sustained from the initial infection or just a species specific blisteringly fast incubation time, I do not know. </p></div>		</li>
