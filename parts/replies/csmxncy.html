			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah!!! Finally here it is. Prepositions in English really don't make much sense and aren't logical. <em>On time</em> vs <em>in time</em>.
It's pretty much a phrasal verb with a time clause. Whatever that means, fuck knows. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'On time' and 'in time' have subtle but distinct differences though. If you are on time, you've arrived at or before an arranged moment. If you're in time, you've made it before a strict deadline or cutoff. </p>
<p>You're on time for a meeting.
You made it in time for the bus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially since &quot;in&quot; and &quot;on&quot; are the same word in Romance languages. Not so in Germanic languages( in German on = auf &amp; in = in.) Also, Germanic prepositions are a bit more flexible than those in Romance languages. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is useful, but these historical differences don't take into account things which came up after the language was pretty much fully formed, as it were. For example, in German, despite English being &quot;Germanic&quot;, they use an entirely different preposition for something being &quot;on&quot; TV - they use &quot;an&quot;, which is otherwise usually used I describe something being up against something else, such as a picture &quot;an&quot; the wall; but not a bowl sitting &quot;auf&quot; a table.</p>
<p>Also note that names for modern inventions (rather than the prepositions that accompany their use) are typically much more similar across languages. &quot;Telephone&quot; is probably a good demonstration of this effect - you'll find almost that exact work used in most languages to refer to a telephone. It was obviously concocted as an English word from Greek roots, but took hold most everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i dont think any language's prepositions are more or less flexible than any other's, unless you can back up the claim.  i believe the sememes just map to different preps in each lang.  </p>
<p>for example 'on' in italian.</p>
<p>'on time' uses 'in'</p>
<p>'on the table' uses 'su'</p>
<p>'on monday' uses no preposition just the noun</p>
<p>'runs on gas' uses 'con'</p>
<p>'on fire' uses 'a'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of those examples utilize an idiom. For example, one cannot be physically on top of (or inside) time itself.</p>
<p>I had just typed a lot out, but it's 12:30 and I realized how incomprehensible I was. So I'll just leave this here instead...</p>
