			<p>Yeah!!! Finally here it is. Prepositions in English really don't make much sense and aren't logical. <em>On time</em> vs <em>in time</em>. <br>It's pretty much a phrasal verb with a time clause. Whatever that means, fuck knows. </p>		</li>

			<p>'On time' and 'in time' have subtle but distinct differences though. If you are on time, you've arrived at or before an arranged moment. If you're in time, you've made it before a strict deadline or cutoff. <br><br>You're on time for a meeting.<br>You made it in time for the bus. </p>		</li>
