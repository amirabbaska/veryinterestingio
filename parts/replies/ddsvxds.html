<p>Also keep in mind the amount of time and effort that was put into some of these megastructures. They took many decades to build and were huge efforts that often took the resources of powerful kingdoms/states/empires. I'd say it's better to compare the building of the pyramids to something like the Space Race and moon landing rather than to buildings today.</p>

<p>I'd also wager most of these megastructures have a pretty impressive body count behind them over the years as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be surprised. Most evidence points to the pyramid builders being paid skilled labourers (not really slaves as we think of it). I mean surely some died, but it likely wasn't a big slave operation with a tremendous death rate.</p>
<p>Then again thousands of people have died building even some modern dams. The Panama Canal had 30000+ deaths during its construction.</p></div>		</li>
