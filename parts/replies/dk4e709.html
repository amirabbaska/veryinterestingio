			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't really teaching it math so much as faking it using logical operations.  Transistors are combined to form logic gates. These are simple circuits that take usually one or two binary input wires and have an output wire.</p>
<p>For example, the XOR gate (exclusive or) causes the output wire to be 1 whenever either input wire is 1.  But if both inputs are 0 or both are 1, the output is zero.  There are other kinds of gates that correspond to other logical operations.</p>
<p>Now think of how binary math works for one bit.  0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, and 1+1=0 (with a carry of 1).  XOR is equivalent to single-bit addition!</p>
<p>Now if you put 8 next to each other, you have 8-bit addition (almost... you need to add some more to handle the carry from right-to-left).</p>
<p>Other operations vary in complexity and size.  Some work with integers and others with floating point numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like making a silicone lollipop and cutting out a slice. You need to make wafers from a single crystal. To make a single crystal, you cool molten silicone very carefully to allow the silicone to solidify into a nearly perfect single crystal.</p>
<p>Your typical piece of metal has lots of crystals mooshed together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electricity only has two stages: it is either ON (there is a voltage difference between two points) or it is OFF (no difference / no connection). So it would be pretty hard to encode other numbers: electricity can't be partly on or partly off.  </p>
<p>Not ELI5: In reality this is a little more complicated - as every passing electron has a magnetic field which can induce electricity in the surrounding wires they don't actually use ON - OFF but using HIGH and LOW values with a big PROHIBITED area between these two - so even if interference happen (which happen) the circuit will know if the signal is legit or not. This called digital signal, most often using 5V. And they don't use the OFF as a real off (breaking the circuit) because it is very hard to detect. Low voltage is easier to create and very easy to actually detect it. It could be possible to create other stages as well (other accepted voltage levels) but it would just complicate everything without any gains.  </p>
<p>Going even lower level: a circuit is actually made from transistors: which is basically an electrically operated switch. They use two different type of silicone sandwiched together like this: N - P - N. The P in the middle is blocking electricity. Each transistor has three legs: one input, one output and one which controls if the gate (the middle part of the sandwich) is opened or not. If the P part gets enough electricity it allows electrons to flow from the input to the output - the circuit is closed, the signal can travel. If the P part doesn't get enough, the gate remains closed, the signal can't move on. Imagine it as a light switch - you are the control. If you turn the switch on, the lamp get the signal. If not, then it remains dark. The transistors are the same, just MUCH-MUCH-MUCH smaller. And they, as I said, can be controlled by electricity - with the mechanical switch it would be impossible to do this fast or this small (and producing such a mechanical transistor would be much harder).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could use more than 2 voltage levels to create trinary or higher systems, but that uses more power for the higher voltages, and we want to reduce that. Detecting the various voltages also adds complexity. In short, you could, and we do use analog signals in various components (mostly around sensors and power) but they get converted to digital signals, as logic is simpler for digital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever tried balancing a light switch between on and off? Doable, but very difficult. A transistor works the same. It either let's electricity through or it doesn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This 'balancing' is used often. For example the VGA input on your monitor. </p>
<p>Each pin of the VGA holds a voltage level. The voltage level determines the color. The range of voltage is split for each pin (8 of them), and determines the amount of R,G,B for the pixel being transmitted. </p>
<p>It's not difficult, nor hard. In fact, this is known as analog signals and have been used far longer than digital ones. </p>
<p>You can even make an analog computer, there are analog multipliers, dividers, etc. Some say analog computing is the future.  </p></div>		</li>
