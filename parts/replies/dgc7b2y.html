<p>The &quot;once an addict, always an addict&quot; thing is COMPLETE. BULLSHIT.</p>
<p>It is not based on solid science.  It is based on the old pseudoscientific, mostly religious AA model of the &quot;sinner saved by grace&quot; whose inherent proclivities towards vice are held in check only by some sort of external Power (or in the modern secular framework, therapy).</p>
<p>Yes, there are people who face lifelong struggles with drugs and alcohol.  There is even scientific support for the fact that these individuals have a lasting neurological inclination to use.  But there are also people who walk away from addiction and never touch another drop, hit, or puff, or even feel particularly tempted to do so.</p>
<p>The vernacular &quot;once an addict always an addict&quot; thing is a vestige of an era in which addiction treatment was expressed in the idiom of Christianity, which teaches the inherent and irredeemable corruption of the soul apart from a saving Higher Power.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm really not trying to have a religious dogmatic debate, here. It's ELI5, not r/politics.  In my limited personal experience, and from what a preponderance of professionals (with whom I've communicated) have indicated to me, an addictive personality tends to stay an addictive personality.  I'm not saying I know what causes the problem, but if there was a reliable cure available, I think it would have made big enough news that I'd have seen it. </p>
<p>I'm sorry if that pisses on your cornflakes, and you're of course free to disagree, and I hope it works out for you. </p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An alcoholic who hasn't had a drink for five years is still an addict.</p>

<p>I wouldn't post blanket-statements like this. What you said is often true, but not always. I know lots of people who used to be physically dependet on alcohol years ago, but can now drink responsibly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an awful lot of anecdotal evidence. I could say the exact opposite of you and claim it's true because of first hand experience. Source: I am a recovering addict. Nothing about addiction is one size fits all. Some people might be able to drink responsibly years later, I would wonder if they weren't just people that drank often though.</p></div>		</li>
