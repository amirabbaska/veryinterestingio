			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you say that the benefits of holding your breath during the lift out weigh the long run consequences that you are speaking of? Would  lowering the weight, breathing properly, and using correct technique be more beneficial than not breathing and using proper technique? For some context I am a collegiate football player and looking to be as explosive as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holding your breath in will reduce oxygen flow to the brain which is why some lifters faint after completing the lift or &quot;see stars&quot;, doing this a lot could have a detrimental affect over time to the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't you have a strength and conditioning coach? Also, for squatting and deadlifting, if you don't tighten your core--which requires you to push your stomach out-- by holding your breath or slowly exhaling you are putting yourself at risk of serious injury.</p>
<p>Look up Joe Defranco and Louie Simmons. Louie Simmons broke his back from powerlifting then starting lifting the right way became the world record holder for squat max as a 50+ year old. He owns one of the world's premiere powerlifting gyms, has trained NFL athletes and his whole career has been developing the best training methods for explosiveness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also something called recruitment of muscle fibers. When you lift, a certain amount of your fibers, let's say 50% are actively contracting to lift. If you're struggling to achieve that motion, your body will 'recruit' the other fibers and the % of fibers activating increases until you can lift, or you near injury. </p>
<p>Like some else said, holding your breath stabilizes you, which assists in support and recruitment. It's not unhealthy as long as you're getting sufficient oxygen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to dissagree with you man but are you sure?  I was always told while doing excercices one of the most important things is breathing.  Weight comes down,  you breath in.  You push up the weight and you breaht out.  Isn't that better?  Or is holding your breath better? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the heavy back squat. The bar is on your traps or back. What js producing the force during the lift? The glutes, hamstrings, quads, adductors. That force has to be transferred through your body from those muscles up to the bar. Your torso needs to remain locked and rigid so you don't absorb any of the force generated by your legs. Breathing definitely hurts your ability to generate a rigid torso. That's why we take a deep breath, contract everything, perform the rep, then take another breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thx for your reply man, i'll keep this in mind. What about the other exercises like benching, weightlifting,... Is it better to hold your breath or does that only count with deadlifts and squats?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The guy I used to power lift with always told me to take a deep breath on the negative and exhale forcefully through the rep. Never worked for me. I've always held my breath. Tried breathing and I'd lose 20-50 pounds depending on what lift I was performing.</p></div>		</li>
