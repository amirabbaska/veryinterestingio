			<div class="markdown"><p>In light of this wealth of evidence about how menstrual cycles affect women's behaviour, this passage struck me as odd:&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A final limitation is that our study did not identify the
precise proximal mechanisms that influence tip earnings.
These might include the previously documented shifts in
body scent, facial attractiveness, soft-tissue body symmetry,
waist-to-hip ratio, and verbal creativity and fluencyâ€”or
they might include shifts in other phenotypic cues that have
not yet been studied.&quot; </p>
<p>The so-called mysterious mechanisms might be a lot more simple and might boil down to the dancers' behaviour while they're on their periods. Imagine feeling generally crappy, bloated and a bit bitchier than usual, you're also maybe springing a few new pimples, and worrying about leaking blood while you spread your legs wide to straddle a dude for a lap dance while wearing nothing but a skimpy pair of bikini bottoms (because you won't get away with a g-string, that will show the tampon). This is going to constrain a dancer's gregariousness and undercut her confidence which in turn gets communicated to male patrons. </p>
<p>Moreover, these other studies cited also suggest that women are less motivated to sexual displays when they're menstruating, and typically, not being at all into it tends to be fairly unattractive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you notice this line: &quot;By contrast, participants using contraceptive
pills showed no estrous earnings peak. &quot;</p>
<p>Women on the pill still have periods and would, under your explanation above, still have peaks and troughs, which is not apparently the case; which means there must be an explanation beyond them simply being less into it while on their period.</p>
<p>EDIT:
Also this: &quot;We divided nonestrous parts of the cycle into
menstrual and luteal phases because we expected that
menstrual side effects (e.g., fatigue, bloating, muscle pains,
irritability) might reduce women's subjective well-being and
tip earnings and we wanted to be able to distinguish an
estrous increase in tips from a menstrual decrease, relative to
the luteal phase.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The study's concept is interesting and there are certainly other studies that look at similar points, but this particular one is a bit flawed.</p>
<p>An exotic dancer who is actively menstruating is likely to be a little more constrained in her movements (don't want tampon strings popping out, etc.), and may be experiencing cramps and other discomforts.  </p>
<p>In addition, some dancers may have heavier flows that  mean they would have to wear pads instead of just tampons, and thus could not do the full routine.  Many such women may simply not show up during that time of the month.  This reduces the pool of dancers to consider.  Women who dance well enough to work only 3 out of 4 weeks a month (because the 4th one they are on the rag) are probably on average better dancers than those that have to dance even when menstruating.  So, you're factoring out some of the arguably better dancers.</p>
<p>So, I wouldn't rely too heavily on this particular study, or other studies of similar premise.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what he's saying. Right after being fertile, they go on their period, which would cause behaviors that would limit ability to dance well, thus limiting their tips. Or they wouldn't be able to dance at all during the period. </p>
<p>Of course they get better tips while their fertile, because the evidence is skewed in that favor. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>First, what you're saying really isn't that the study design is <em>flawed</em> but that there are competing explanations. Thus, we ought to attenuate our conclusions.</p>
<p>Second, very good alternative hypotheses! Much agreed.</p></div>		</li>
