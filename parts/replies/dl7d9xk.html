			<div class="markdown"><p>Other major spec that matters in fans: pressure gain across the fan. Pushing air through a hole in a wall requires almost no pressure. Pushing air through a heat exchanger then a hundred meters of duct with lots of angles requires a lot of pressure. These require quite different designs of fan to be effective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In your example a propeller fan would be perfect for a hole in a wall. Whereas a centrifugal fan is best for highly restrictive applications like ducts and heat exchangers. A prop fan can't do shit within a duct whereas a centrifugal fan is highly inefficient without ductwork or at least a housing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pressure, air flow, size, and fan speed in general can all be combined into one parameter called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_speed" target="_blank">specific speed</a>.</p>
<p>There's still lots of parameters to optimize, like sound and aesthetics and manufacturing cost, but it's wrong to thing of pressure and flow rate as completely separate optimization dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As with vehicles, fans have to be optimized to their specific purpose. Torque and horsepower are both required to make a vehicle that the average consumer finds pleasing to drive, but as soon as you start towing, that torque is nowhere to be found and you're sitting at the rev limiter trying to get up to speed. </p>
<p>So for example, you have a radiator that you need a fan to push air through. Given there's a lot of resistance you probably want a fan that can handle the high static pressure from essentially pushing against a wall. Imagine a gigantic U bend parabola on a graph where the left side is airflow and the right side is static pressure. The more static pressure you require from a fan the less airflow it naturally has. You can create a design that is strong in both and are usually used for computer radiators, car radiators and hvac systems. </p>
<p>If you want something to push air in an open environment though, like a box fan or in a vent hood you'll want something with much higher airflow and virtually no static pressure capability.</p>
<p>These changes allow the fans to run at maximum efficiency in a system under load. The typical use the fan is designed for defines the energy it uses at an average load, so an airflow designed fan will be using wayyyyy more energy than the static pressure fan to move a similar amount of air in a static pressure environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Torque is irrelevant, what you feel when you drive a car with a lot of torque is just more horsepower at lower RPM. Just from the nature of the relationship between power and torque, an engine designed to produce power at low RPM will (by definition) have higher peak torque than one that produces the same power at high RPM.</p>
<p>I think what you're getting at is that engines can be tuned to produce a lot of peak power, but this will be produced at high RPM and within a narrow band. This normally means they sacrifice power at low RPM and often area under the power curve as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are separate types of measurement.  You can't just say that torque is a the feeling of horsepower at low rpm. </p>
<p>Torque is a measure of rotating force. It is measured instantaneously.   Horsepower is a measure of work over time. It is (and requires) measured over time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if there were an optimal shape perhaps the &quot;optimal&quot; blade shape requires more space than you have available (like a modern thin laptop), and so you design a thinner blade shape that gets close but fits in much smaller spaces.</p></div>		</li>
