			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some towels inherited from my nan. They were made in the 1960s. Rough, but they dry really well. Modern towels are soft, but don't dry well or hard and still don't dry well. I love those old towels. They don't last as long though. My nan never used a dryer. But I don't use fabric softener with towels and need a dryer. </p></div>		</li>
