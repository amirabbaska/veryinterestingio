			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if another charged particle is brought into the field, how does that get communicated to the first particle? Is there like a chain reaction with the virtual photons, or do the virtual photons associated with the new particle directly interact with it?</p>
<p>I realize this would probably be easier to explain in field theory, but particles are easier to grasp</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes so it is easier to explain in field theory because really the field is the entity doing the communication. The particle picture seems easier to grasp on the face but shouldn't be taken as a picture of &quot;what is really going on&quot;. Virtual particles are a way to visualize (in feynman diagrams) the terms of a perturbative expansion and the sum of these terms allow physicists to calculate the quantum corrections to the classical fields. The fields should be thought of as the &quot;real&quot; things and the virtual particles should be thought of as mathematical tools to calculate the small corrections due to the quantum nature of those fields. This is not to say there is no &quot;reality&quot; to the virtual particles, they are real in a sense because of their utility in calculation, but individual pictures involving them (feynman diagrams) should not be considered a complete visualization of what is occuring.</p></div>		</li>
