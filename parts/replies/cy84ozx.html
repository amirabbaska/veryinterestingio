			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like Belgium. All unions are organized according to political orientation. So per industry you'd have 3 options: a socialist union, a Christian democratic union, and a liberal union. They have a big say in what happens in the country, and are almost on the same level as political parties.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: for clarification, our &quot;Socialists&quot; would be called &quot;Social-Democrats&quot; in Central Europe. Also, our unions aren't as strong as Belgium's, they have a stronger union tradition.</p></div>		</li>
