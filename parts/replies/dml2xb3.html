			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent explanation, just wanted to add that many (if not most or all) Muslim countries have both Islamic banks and regular banks, and not all banks in the Muslim world are considered &quot;Islamic banks&quot;, for example, in my country, there are more regular banks than Islamic banks, and the most successful (and possibly most popular/relevant) bank in the country is a non Islamic one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a term called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murabaha" target="_blank">Murabaha</a>. I work in a bank in brazil and they made a contract with a muslim fund or something like that and instead of straight charging interest they made an agreement to buy gold or other metal from them and them sell it back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the general practice in Islamic banks in Malaysia as well. From what I heard from my Muslim friends you can actually go to the warehouse and see the commodity that you just &quot;bought&quot; : gold, metal, flour, rice... And basically you sign another thing that allows the bank to help you sell them out. </p>
<p>But I'm not Muslim myself so I can't verify this lol. I actually only used regular banks my whole life. Islamic banks and regular banks coexist in Malaysia, you can pick and choose whichever that you prefer. Some large commercial banks offer Islamic versions of their products too to cater to the Muslim population if they prefer to do so. they can of course always opt for the regular banking version as well as some think that the regular banking products are less complicated, even though they're less &quot;moral&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation should be higher. </p>
<p>A side note: Some people argue that riba means inflation and the verse is about inflation, not charging interest. </p></div>		</li>
