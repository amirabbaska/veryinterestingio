			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small correction, there are not just two estrogen receptors. There is GPER1, a membrane bound estrogen receptor, ER-X which is largely uncharacterized, and then there are lots of translational modifications that can happen to ERalpha and beta that can embed them in the membrane or have them dimerize to other transcription factors in the nucleus, allowing them to act in completely different ways. GPER1 is my baby so I always have to speak up for it. I'm not as familiar with phytoestrogens and their affinity for other ERs as I study plain ol' estradiol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Estradiol (E2) has higher binding affinity for ERa than ERb (<a href="http://molpharm.aspetjournals.org/content/54/1/105" target="_blank">1</a>). While looking this paper up, I got curious about binding affinities of xenoestrogens to GPER1, and in this review (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3380306/#!po=8.48214" target="_blank">2</a>) they actually discuss some papers comparing binding affinities of several known endocrine disruptors to ERa, ERb, and GPER1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting!</p>
<p>ERb is apparently a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076013000526" target="_blank">dominant negative regulator</a> of some ERa action, so since a lot of the phytoestrogens have a higher affinity for ERb, that might explain why they have a different sort of response, overwhelming the ERa activation signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good find! Yes if ERa is breast carcinogenic and ERb overwhelms its response that would make sense to decrease cancer occurrence!</p></div>		</li>
