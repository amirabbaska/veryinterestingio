			<div class="markdown"><p>I once got the opportunity to sit in an empty chair next to my state rep in the State House.  The rep on the other side of her got up to leave and said &quot;I've got to go to my kids [whatever], can you vote Yes for me on 1233 and 1234, then No on 1235?&quot;.   </p>
<p>She reached over at voting time and hit the buttons in the adjoining seat.  Obviously, they were both the same party and the votes were, like other posts mentioned, trivial.  </p>
<p>But that's how the sausage is made.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I definitely thought it odd.  Alas, this was Illinois, and sadly, given the massive corruption in Illinois politics, this practice is probably the least odd thing that goes on there.   </p>
<p>Looking back I'm surprised I didn't see lobbyists openly handing stacks of cash to the reps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait do they need to hit quorum for those votes? If there are 20 representatives, even for something trivial, I don't imagine that being nearly enough for quorum right...</p>
<p>I don't fully understand how votes work in the House and Senate though, so I apologize if this is a dumb question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quorums are assumed unless somebody requests a quorum call.  Depending on the nature of things, a quorum call can be considered an objection... e.g., &quot;I care more about this bill than others, and the votes aren't currently going my way, so I can ask for a quorum call in the face of low attendance to delay the vote,&quot; which makes it almost like a filibuster in that way.  </p>
<p>On the mock filibuster of PATRIOT Act renewal, Rand Paul used the quorum call rather creatively.  In the face of dwindling attendance of a late-night session, he called for a quorum call to slow things down.  People then left the chamber while that happened, cause quorum calls are boring. Then he cancelled the quorum call (which he can do, since he requested it), and took the floor, which he'd been unable to do prior.  Then he talked for a bunch of hours to further delay the vote, which ultimately resulted in the PATRIOT Act's expiration.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah the old Cato methode of simply talking until a deadline has passed.</p>
<p>Edit: For anyone who isnt a Roman history enthusiast like me. Cato the Younger on multiple occasions would talk in the Roman senate for hours in order to fail votes that had deadlines. He did this twice to Julius Caesar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, they do need to hit the quorum. However, the rules assume that the quorum is met, unless a quorum call demonstrates that it is not. So as long as nobody calls out that there are not enough voters present, the vote is valid.</p>
<p>Since nobody wants to be the person that halted some trivial matter for no reason, the quorum call is only used when the vote is over something important and your side is going to lose. So not for renaming some post office or thanking the Red Cross for existing, that would be an enormous waste of money and would cause your popularity to plummet. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I upvoted you because of this line. You sound very eager to contribute and I like that. Must be exciting to have a topic that you know first hand to come up.</p>
<p>When will I get such a chance? Someone asks about oil palm plantations in Malaysia please. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha thank you! I wouldn't want to comment on things that I don't know anything about, so I don't comment much. So I was really excited to get to talk about this and maybe help people understand how their government actually works!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Malaysian, a former UK colony, Ive always been very impressed with the American system of governance, especially the 3 independent bodies of judiciary, executive, and legislative.</p>
<p>Here in Malaysia there is a crisis where the Prime Minister who is being accused of cheating Malaysians of US$3 billion that is being deposited into his own accounts as well as his friends' have removed the Attorney General (i think its equivalent to the head of the Department of Justice) from his job, thus halting the A-G's prosecution of himself.</p>
<p>The PM have also promoted 4 of the 15 members of the Public Actions Committee (PAC), who are also Member of the Parliament (MP, equial to members of Congress, in the House of Representatives) that is also probing the case, thus the probe is also halted, and they will be replaced by the PM's own people because the PAC are made of 11 MPs from the PM's party and 4 MP's from the opposition.</p>
<p>The PM also controls the Police, Anti-corruption Agency, the Treasury, and the aforementioned A-G all reports to the PM.</p>
<p>So how the fuck will these agencies investigate his own boss? One who can remove the head at any time as he has shown and proven? </p></div>		</li>
