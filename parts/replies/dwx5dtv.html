			<div class="markdown"><p>I was making a joke. Jaden Smith went through a phase in which he tweeted little bits of wisdom such as what I quoted above. The reason it's funny is because it makes no sense whatsoever. He tries to come off as being all deep, philosophical, and &quot;woke&quot;, as the kids say these days. But in reality, he just wound up seeming like an idiot. </p></div>		</li>
