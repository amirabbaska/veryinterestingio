			<div class="markdown"><p>As a doctor: you're not really correct. When you're talking about a break in the skin, the line between scarring or not is the disruption of the basement membrane. Beyond that, the size of the scar mostly depends on the shape, how much tissue between the edges has been lost, and how close together those edges are (e.g by sutures). It has nothing to do with how quickly blood can &quot;start to work&quot; on the wound. </p>
<p>E.g even a perfectly straight, simple cut with a scalpel that's just deep enough to break the basement membrane will <strong>always</strong> scar even if you immediately sew it back together. But you can rub the entire outer layer of skin off your chest with sand paper and it won't scar. </p>
<p>It's easier if you think of the body as not having any kind of blueprint. As your grow your body is basically following instructions, but if say your finger gets cut off, your body has no blueprint for that missing finger. It's gone. Your skin is constantly growing outward from the basement membrane, so damage above this level will just be replaced with new cells, generally. But if that membrane is broken, the body doesn't know it's supposed to be stitched back together, so it just chucks a bunch of scar tissue in there to glue things up. Similarly your body is smart enough to grow bone between two broken bits of bone because the inflammation that occurs between them can effectively smell either end. But it doesn't have any idea what a tibia is supposed to look like, so if you lose half your leg, it doesn't know how to grow back.</p>
<p>When a lizards' tail falls off, it does so at a preprogrammed point and so a set of instructions (do x then y then z) can grow back that tail from that known starting point. I'm guessing (any biologist feel free to correct me), but if you cut the tip off that tail without taking the whole thing, it wouldn't grow back until the whole thing fell off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a surgeon or a dermatologist, but depending on the location the depth needed to scar is pretty shallow because the skin isn't very thick and that base layer is close to the surface. E.g it's probably fairly hard to scar the bottom of your foot, versus very easy on a lot of your arm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>A large or deep cut, however, often repairs with scar tissue since blood can't quickly start to work on the fully damaged space. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expanding on your points, this is why getting stitches is so important, and why good stitch work can make a world of difference in appearance after healing, especially around the face. Stitches close the wound and save the body from being forced to close it with scar tissue. Not only will you heal faster, scarring can be extremely minimized compared to leaving wounds open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a surgery where it was tightly closed, and even when the stitches were removed it was only a thin line.  Then in the following months it expanded and left a 3mm wide scar.    </p>
<p>Any way to keep this from happening?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yeah. That's because the nail bed has a set of cells specifically designed to inhibit fibrosis, so your nail doesn't get all gnarly (but has the side effect of being able to regenerate the tip of your finger). That's a unique trait of the nail bed, just like the liver has the unique ability to regenerate itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait hold on a minute. I lost the tip of my finger but retained the nail bed. The surgeon however elected to remove the nail bed to make it look more natural and reduce the chances of something called hook nail happening. You telling me that if he left the nail bed I could have potentially regrew a portion of my fingertip? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually had this happen to me at work! </p>
<p>I sliced the tips of my pinky and ring finger off and my doctor said he could do a graft, but then I would lose sensation in the area so it might be better to just let it heal on it's on. My fingertips grew back, but the side effect is now they are overly sensitive that if I poke my fingers on something it'll actually cause pain! </p>
<p>I think I still have a picture of my fingers when they were cut somewhere if anyone is interested, haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting. I cut off my left ring finger in a door when I was a kid. It sliced off right before the cuticle. The nail grew back and kind of wrapped over the top of my finger. I don't believe I experienced any actual regrowth of the finger, because it is still a few centimeters shorter than my right ring finger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Common treatment for fingertip injuries will inhibit the regeneration - i.e. bandaging the wound or suturing it.  Once its healed its done, regeneration won't work anymore.</p>
<p>The less you mess with it the better the regeneration would be.</p>
<p>I recall a link once that said, on the opposite end of the spectrum, you can actually help encourage fingertip regeneration by applying extracellular matrix to the wound.</p></div>		</li>

It was pretty deep and I thought I would have a scar on my fingerprint but after it healed, I can't find any noticeable traces.
