<p>The lobbying side of nutrition particularly irks me. There are few things in this world as personal as what you eat (which is then tied to body image, self esteem, etc.) -- indeed, how many times a day do we put something in our mouth, chew, and swallow it? If what we ingest is largely driven by a special interest group buying a study that then has the power to dictate what we should be ingesting, it's rather frightening. I can only hope that dissemination of information and scientific progress (and publishing of certain indisputable facts) can nullify their effect.</p>
<p>Might I ask, how does one become a food scholar? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Study something you think is cool about food! There are institutes and departments in various universities all over the place, but food studies is often a sub-discipline: anthropologists, sociologists, literary scholars, political scientists, or historians (to name just a few) may focus on food as a way to learn about the larger issues in their fields. </p>
<p>I'm a literary scholar by training. I got into the field by studying cookbooks and I'm interested in how they represent--and sometimes misrepresent--culture. From there, I took up interests in how food makes us feel, how museums treat food and culture, and then I got into cannibalism and food waste and trash...</p>
<p>Rabbit holes, man...</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.food-culture.org/" target="_blank">Association for the Study of Food and Society</a> has academic resources for folks who want to study this stuff. The field is quite varied in the range of disciplines and political perspectives that contribute to it. However, it isn't limited to academia: lots of thoughtful people learn about this stuff and then go to work for nonprofits, think tanks, and various food-related industries, or they lend their perspectives to issues of the day that are covered by the press. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's incredibly interesting! Here I thought I was a decent enough food scholar because I watch Top Chef. They did discuss very thoroughly Edna Lewis and her cookbook last night at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your delve into cooking literature and culture from your base as a literary scholar sounds incredibly fascinating, it's always interesting to see the way human curiosity leads to peculiar yet really cool things, places, and ideas.
Rabbit holes indeed lol
Sorry for rambling, it was just an interesting thing I had to comment on</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd never thought about the lobbyist side until I ended up on the British government's version of the nutrition guidelines and realized that (theoretically) we're basing our diets on suggestions that are coming from our governments - and that they're not necessarily the same in every country.</p>
<p>It kind of was a mind-blowing moment for me because I realized how easy it is to become indoctrinated and take things at face value just because that's what we were always taught. (I recognized that with respect to politics &amp; stuff, just never thought about all the things that I'd considered more science (&quot;fact&quot;) based. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point. If you are interested in this sort of thing, I suggest you check out the maximum dose of certain chemicals (for example, heavy metals like lead and mercury, or pesticides) that various governments (USA, Canada, European Union and Japan make a good contrast) tolerate in water and food.</p>
<p>It's an eye-opening experiment. Makes you realise how arbitrary/biased some of those decisions must be even though they're all based on the same body of knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen Ancel Keys mentioned yet, but no one is a better example of the harmful effects of lobbying on nutritional science - this guy almost single-handedly scared us away from fats (much of which we now are starting to realize are healthy, 50 years later) and towards sugar ('nuff said). Google for much outrage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was moderation really popular in the 19th century?  I always thought that people like John Harvey Kellogg were considered kooks by the majority for their stance on moderation and abstinence.  I thought it was more of a fringe movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He wasn't really that moderate about his stance, though--he was pretty extreme. In that way, he was at the fringe and anti-onanism was his weird, noisy hobby. You can see moderation preached in the conduct literature of the time and also in children's literature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what do you consider a good recommendation on what to eat and avoid. Is there a general diet you would recommend like Mediterranean or Paleo? What is your rationale behind the advice? </p>
<p>You should do an AMA! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, that person used a whole lot of words to not really say much.</p>
<p>But IMO the best advice is to avoid those specific types of diets altogether. Eat what you want in moderation, avoid processed foods where possible, eat plenty of vegetables.</p>
<p>I actually lost about 26 pounds last year based on this type of mentality. It started with finding Michael Pollan's book &quot;Food Rules&quot;.</p>
<p>It's great because it's not a whole strict program, it's just a bunch of individual things that are basically &quot;if given the choice between x and y, x is healthier.&quot; And it all follows a common theme of avoiding processed foods (for direct and indirect reasons i.e only eating &quot;unhealthy&quot; foods when you make them from scratch will cut way down on your consumption of them,) eating more fresh veggies, and everything in moderation.</p></div>		</li>
