			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably not true.   Check out the current models for the curvature of the universe.   Not only is it incredibly, incredibly flat but it is approaching asymptotic zero curvature.    Thats exactly what we expect to see in a universe which was <a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/infpoint.html" target="_blank">already infinite at the moment of the big bang</a>.    We will be able to tell alot about our universe without directly observing an edge in the same way we don't need to literally see a quark to know if they're there or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it would be possible to measure where the center would be simply by grabbing a few points of data.</p>
<p>This is just a theory, of course.</p>
<p>You would use four different points of measurement. The first two would be a group of stars moving from point A to point B say over 1,000 years. The second would be another set of stars moving from point A to B over 1,000 years.
Then by measuring their velocity and direction, you may be able to predict the source of where they were coming from, assuming the Big Bang Theory is the basis of how the universe was created.</p></div>		</li>
