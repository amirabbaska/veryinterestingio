			<div class="markdown"><p>What I find extremely interesting is that in this case a person in a discipline you may think of last is potentially best served to answer this. I'm a student in a geo field and the similarity to columnar jointing came to mind immediately even though it has no obvious connection to geology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably related to the fact that when initially starting a research project this is what you have to do. Want money to study something? Better write up a detailed proposal discussing what we do and don't know even though you've never studied this before. This has been perhaps the most mind-boggling part of being a scientist for me so far (I'm a grad student): you go from no knowledge to teaching it in next to no time and it's really easy to feel like a fraud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just checked out South Shore Cliffs images and slightly off topic but there is a beach in Dragon Age Inquisition that has these exact formations and I always thought it was some supernatural/magic game explanation on why the cliffs were shaped that way. Who knew it was real and likely modeled after the south shore cliffs?!</p></div>		</li>
