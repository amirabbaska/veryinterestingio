			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, it also leaves the homeowner the option to finish that basement or attic space, putting the light switches where they make sense based on what's done with the space. Pre-installing switches in unfinished spaces makes it more work later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but they are high up on the wall too. My basement has a sump pump plugged into its own circuit with no part of the circuit below four feet from the floor, just so it is the last to go if the basement floods. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other electrical codes to cover flooding. The string is really just there to have either another switch or so you don't have to put one in. Let's say you wanna add a light near a junction box down there. It way quicker to just add the fixture than the fixture and a wall switch. You save on both materials and labor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Basements are often at or below local water level. Some are also tanked on the inside not the outside of the wall, especially in older buildings. Not having wiring below floor level of the house is good.</p></div>		</li>
