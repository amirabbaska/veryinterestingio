<p>but an important basis for this is the definition of temperature, which is the average kinetic energy in the random movement if particles. </p>

<p>That is not the definition of temperature (it is defined via entropy), although the two are closely related.</p></div>		</li>

Considering the fact that Entropy is almost impossible to define both clearly and accurately at the same time, I think we can avoid its use in this subreddit unless someone is specifically asking about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Entropy is a well-defined quantity. It is not very ELI5-friendly, but &quot;temperature is defined via the kinetic energy&quot; (in one way or another) is wrong and it leads to various misconceptions about temperature. See the questions about negative temperature for example which pop up somewhat frequently.</p></div>		</li>
