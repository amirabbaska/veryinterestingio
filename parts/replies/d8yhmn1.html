The author tackles exactly this problem - 100% sure that the bomb will go off when it should, 100% safety that it won't go off unwanted. Which, of course, is impossible. And since you need to demonstrate to your enemy that your bombs <em>will</em> go off under the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction... well you can imagine which &quot;100%&quot; the military favored. </p>
<p>The incidents described in this book are harrowing. After reading this book I sometimes thing that it's really just dumb luck that we're all still alive here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're not wrong. Arguably worse was the armed forces' insistence that the lack of an accidental detonation meant that the bombs were safe. Thankfully, that was never proved wrong.</p>
<p>The film about the silo explosion looks great though, I can't wait for general release.</p></div>		</li>
