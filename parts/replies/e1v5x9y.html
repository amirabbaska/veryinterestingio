			<div class="markdown"><p>I once read in this subject. One case of vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms involved a man inhaling a ludicrous amount of NO2 for many days in a row. More than I can imagine anyone bothering to pay for considering the gimmicky high it's worth. In the conclusion, the problem was solved with a vitamin supplement and instructions to stop using the drug.. </p>
<p>So I was under the impression that not only does N2O not easily cause serious damage but even if it does the damage can be repaired. Is this impression correct? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine did 200-ish canisters a day for a few months(literally filled an inflatable pool with empty cartridges): legs started giving out, unable to walk normally for a year. Now he's been through a ton of B12 injections and has leg braces. Should still get surgery and then a long revalidation process.</p>
<p>Permanent damage: very little, although hes currently completely messed up.</p>
<p>Sidenote: Alcohol abuse can cause Korsakov Syndrome (which is not really curable) through B12 deficiency. Could nitrous do the same? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the damage is not easily repaired but as you said it is easily prevented. As long as you get a b12 supplement it should be safe to keep doing ludicrous amounta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about NO2 deactivates b12 though? Would all antagonists of glutamate do this as well?</p></div>		</li>
