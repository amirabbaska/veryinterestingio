			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally someone who actually golfs answers.  For spotting my ball in the air on the fairways in the rough I do prefer colored balls but for putting the white is actually much easier to focus on.  For any shot really when youâ€™re trying to focus on specific dimples of the ball it is much easier with white </p></div>		</li>
