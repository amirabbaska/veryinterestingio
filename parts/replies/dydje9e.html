			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I think OP is missing just how huge and old and active the Universe is compared to the life cycle of supernovas.  In rounded-for-a-quick-estimate numbers, a supernova burns out on average in 10 million years.  That's 100 lifetimes per billion, times 13 is 1300 supernova-lifetimes.  If those were human lifetimes it'd be 91000 years, and we don't have recorded history for even a tenth of that.</p>
<p>There has been plenty of time for mixing the elements into the galactic dust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes..! They've only recently been observed with the aid of the LIGO gravitational wave observatory. This was <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20171016" target="_blank">pretty damn big</a> news in astronomy <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/neutron-star-collision-top-science-stories-2017-yir" target="_blank">late last year!</a> ;) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutron star mergers appear likely to solve a long standing puzzle relating to the heavy elements: they are too abundant, too neutron-rich and appear too early in the universe's history to have been formed in supernovae (specifically, core-collapse supernovae).  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/PT.3.3815" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1063/PT.3.3815</a> is a very readable article on the topic and conveys the excitement of a highly active research topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to observe such an event from close up, it would probably be more awesome than you could ever describe in words. </p>
<p>Then youâ€™d get crushed by the gravity waves, but what a way to go, eh?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can find a tiny trace of Iridium in the Earth's crust but it's much more abundant in meteorites.</p>

<p>So I have space spark plugs (seriously)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for bringing to my attention that iridium can be used to make spark plugs. I honestly had no idea. </p></div>		</li>
