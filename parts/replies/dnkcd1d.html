<p>Turbines exhibit mechanical efficiency over only a very narrow range of RPM. Outside of this range, efficiency drops dramatically as does power output. Turbine engines are also ungodly inefficient at very low RPM, and are thus terrible at idling.</p>

<p>Right, but in a locomotive, the engine RPMs are pretty much only related to the power output, not the speed, as it's all coupled through the electrical stage. The engine in your typical locomotive is typically operating at the most efficient operating point for a required power output.</p></div>		</li>
