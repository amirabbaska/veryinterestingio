			<div class="markdown"><p>Can someone explain the varying intellectual capacity of different species of birds? </p>
<p>I have chickens and turkeys, and have kept ducks and geese. Uh, to be blunt, they're fucking stupid. STUPID. Waterfowl are inescapably dumb, no way around it, but you can see glimmers in the chickens and turkeys. Still, the mind boggles at the idea they're closely related to the sort of bird that can &quot;talk&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waterfowl and gallinaceous (chicken-like) birds are very primitive as far as birds ago. They evolved early in avian history and haven't changed much. They're not known for intelligence. Other groups of birds like corvids (crows and ravens) and parrots are incredibly smart. These birds outperform chimps on many intelligence tests and parrots are probably the smartest animals on the planet after us. </p>
<p>There are over 10,000 species of birds and they have been around for a long time and have diverged into myriad forms. It's kind of like asking &quot;why are humans so much smarter than hamsters, we're all mammals!&quot;. There is really nothing special about being a mammal per se - it's just the group we belong to so it's easy and comfortable for us to expect our closest relatives to be smart, because we're smart but that's not really how evolution works. Birds as a group are extremely diverse. Some evolved great intelligence just like some mammals have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to take away from the rest of what you say, but the &quot;talk box&quot; Peter Frampton is famous for works the other way around from what you are assuming. Essentially it gives him guitar sounds to speak with.</p>
