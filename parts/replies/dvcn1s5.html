<p>This is the result of running a model. What if the model is wrong? What if one of our baseline assumptions, like the fundamental constants being always and everywhere the same, turn out to be incorrect? How can we be so sure that our model is comprehensive and correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is concerning to me that everything I've read on cosmology is thoroughly confused on what is the map and what is the territory. We have a model that, when projected backwards, tells a story about the events following the Big Bang. But then those events get treated as facts, and it seems other model-building (e.g. dark matter) takes the previous model as if it was data (&quot;proven to be right&quot;).</p>
<p>I hope that this is just a failure of popular writing on the topic and that actual researchers are keeping this distinction clear. I don't have the background in this area to know. Perhaps someone who does will see this and respond.</p></div>		</li>
