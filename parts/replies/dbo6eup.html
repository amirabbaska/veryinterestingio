Look how surprised we were when we found organisms living in hostile places and thriving. Deep sea creatures could gain energy from tidal motion, pressure differentiation, hot vents, or a multitude of ways we haven't found yet. Life forms could even be thriving in those depths based on a different biological system. Look at Earth's history and remember the theories of organisms predating the oxygen saturation, whereas life was sustained on a methane atmosphere, etc. Look at the theories of how life could exist under the ice sheets of the gas giant moons such as Europa, for example.</p></div>		</li>
