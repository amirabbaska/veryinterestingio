			<div class="markdown"><p>Beautiful answer... but one more thing: When the economy is growing everyone can be winning.  If the economy was stagnating then me making more money means someone else is making less.  That is a dangerous mental landscape to occupy as it makes everyone adversaries as opposed to us all working together to produce valuable goods and services for everyone's gain.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The way you worded it is technically the opposite.</p>
<p>If the value of money inflates(increases), each dollar is worth more (ie, everything costs less). If the supply increases, that's equivalent to value decreasing (every dollar purchases less stuff).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The applicable difference is mostly felt when prices rise (because the dollar is worth comparatively less) but wages stay flat, or at least don't rise at the same rate. There are plenty of people and families who get the same or larger paycheck today than they did 5 years ago, but are having more trouble making ends meet than they used to.</p></div>		</li>
