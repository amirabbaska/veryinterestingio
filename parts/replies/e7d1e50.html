			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Only advantage that I encounter daily, is that overweight (but absolutely not morbidly obese) people's CT abdomen scans are much easier to read, as the intraabdominal fat acts as a dark spacer between organs and other structures.  In the morbidly obese the radiation penetration and thus quality falls drastically.</p></div>		</li>
