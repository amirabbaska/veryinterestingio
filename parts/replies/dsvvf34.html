			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're in Wales, it'd be pronounced differently (see my top-level reply). If you're in an Anglicized area (including the US), it's probably just going to be the default L sound.</p>
<p>Fun fact, the name &quot;Floyd&quot; was a variation on &quot;Lloyd&quot; where the spelling was altered by English speakers trying to approximate the native Welsh sound using sounds that actually occurred in their language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most of my childhood, I thought that when people said Llewelyn, they were saying &quot;Lou-Ellen&quot; and that it was a girl's name. And I wondered why people would name their son that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Spanish, the 'Ll' character has the same sound as the 'Y' character. So 'llama' (flame) sounds like 'ya-ma'. 'Lluvia' (rain) is pronounced as 'yoo-via'. Phonetically, Lloyd would be pronounced 'Yo-id' in Spanish (which phonetically sounds like 'Yo-eed' in English). </p></div>		</li>
