			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation for us who don't know how TV works.</p>
<p>But couldn't we assume that the broadcasters have some significant losses by removing that show from their lineup?  The broadcaster chose that show over its rivals for that time slot, presumably because they felt it would provide the greatest return on their investment.  With that show cancelled, they now must replace it with their second choice, which would likely be less profitable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ad based broadcasters like ABC have to sell slots for the show. No brand would want to be associated with the show after this. </p>
<p>Without the ad revenue, paying license for the content doesn't make financial sense. </p>
<p>They will replace the slot with another content that might not bring as many viewers, but it would bring enough ad revenue to cover the licensing costs. </p>
<p>Remember, broadcasts buy content to sell ads. A content with high viewership has high ad value but also high licensing cost. Profitability shouldn't be a problem. </p>
<p>ABC wil be fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Networks like ABC also usually have many shows in development at a time, so they should be able to easily fill the time slot. The new show may not (read: probably will not) have the same ratings, but will definitely be less likely to be black-balled by advertisers.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, as a former media buyer, I can tell you that advertising slots are usually bought by the quarter. Since Roseanne S11 wouldn't have premiered until September or October, that ad time won't be sold until Q3 &quot;up-fronts&quot; at the earliest, so around the second week of June. Interesting timing for this whole snafu.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They do since they had already started shopping ad buys for the new season. However it's not as if someone took away something of value that they already had. <em>They</em> are choosing not to buy any more episodes of Rosanne. So what they are loosing is money they likely <em>would have made</em> if they bought more episodes (and if Rosanne hadn't posted that tweet).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to remember that ABC didn’t own the distribution rights to Roseanne, so cancelling it was a much easier decision to make as they wouldn’t have profited from any syndication or streaming sales. </p>
<p>Compare that to Brooklyn 99 which is distributed by Universal which also owns NBC and you can see why NBC brought it back for another season. </p></div>		</li>

<p>TL:DR: The production companies are the ones that take the risk. Broadcaster could be up for penalties for breach of contract but most likely a moral clause let them cancel the contract without them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there are major losses, I'd imagine they have production insurance but also like you said, a morality clause.</p>
<p>I wonder if a morality clause could be used to sue a major actor that the show hinges on, for damages if they say/do something stupid to cause a backlash or cancellation. </p></div>		</li>
