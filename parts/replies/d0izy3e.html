<p>it only has to tidally lock from 0 rev/year to 1 rev/year.  It would seem much less than a planet going from 365 days/year to 1 day per year.  </p>
<p>(granted, the moon has a much larger effect on earth's rotation,  slowing it down from 420 days per year about 600 mill years ago).</p></div>		</li>
