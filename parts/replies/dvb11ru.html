			<div class="markdown"><p>There are tons of vaccines for bacterial infections.  TB, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Whooping Cough, etc.  </p>
<p>No the strain of chlamydia is different, but similar enough to take a lot of the work out of developing a vaccine for humans.  There is a type of chlamydia that can be passed between humans and birds, and gonorrhea and syphilis may have originally come from cattle or sheep so STDs do jump species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vaccines work by giving your body small parts of the bacteria or by giving you a broken form of the bacteria. Your immune system recognizes these bacterial parts as foreign and makes antibodies specific to them. After vaccination, if your body encounters the same pathogen, it already has the cells and molecular machinery required to scale up and eliminate the pathogen from your system. </p></div>		</li>
