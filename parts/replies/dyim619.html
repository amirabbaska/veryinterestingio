			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes. You might run into some problems keeping them on underwater unless they covered the entire eyeball. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160229-the-sea-nomad-children-who-see-like-dolphins" target="_blank">You can train yourself to see underwater though, like the Moken people of Thailand</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>part of the article specifically stated that as you aged your lens lost the ability to accommodate the refraction required and that is why adults of the Moken tribe mostly spearfish from the surface, so unless you're a kid, you can't really train your eyes to see underwater like the Moken children</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the shout out connoisseurOfDanger. Here is a little, interesting, soon to be published info on dolphin eyes: in humans corneas are the most innervated part of our bodies. This makes sense:something gets into your eye and you want to close it immediately.  As far as we can tell, dolphin corneas are COMPLETELY devoid of innervation. This is probably due to their constant immersion in water. I'd like to test fish corneas, to see if this is the same for them too, but the protein we stain for is too far removed for this direct test. I would work on finding a fish analog, but 'fish' is way too broad and I'd have to test it in thousands of different species before I'd be confident saying anything about the class as a whole. We also only find heat sensing nerves in very sensitive epidermal tissue, like around the blow hole, which is opening possibilities about how dolphins detect temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's an antibody-based detection system, and it doesn't recognize the fish epitopes?</p>
<p>If you just wanted to see if there were neurons or not, couldn't a label-free method like third-harmonic imaging work? (might be talking out of my ass here, but I know people who used it on brain tissue or the retina, is there anything about the cornea that would prevent it from working, in principle?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I really want to use my corneal confocal microscope to test this directly.  But we have some physical limitations the main one being my boss doesn't want to put a very expensive microscope around all that saltwater.  Then we'd have to figure out how to get the animals to hold still and keep their eyes open.  That would probably require putting the dolphins under, and the US Navy won't put their dolphins under just for some fun tests.  </p>
<p>We were able to test corneal tissue, obtained post mortem, and since we don't see any innervation in the cornea (and we do see it in the sclera) my boss and the people in charge of the dolphins are even less interested in trying to make the scope work. </p>
<p>EDIT- But I just realized you asked about putting fish in some sort of scope.  As long as the fish was alive, I could probably do that but I'm not sure how to go about getting IACUC approval for that sort of test, especially since our lab has never handled any aquatic life before.  I'm sure I could get the appropriate approvals, but again my boss would not be interested and I don't have the funding.  Also, &quot;fish&quot; is soooo broad.  I'd probably find a lot of differences depending on the type of fish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the transition between materials that distorts the image. Because goggles are flat, if you look straight through them, they don't distort the image. (If you look through goggles at an angle, they will change the angle you see things at.)</p>
<p>When you have a curved transition between materials, that acts like a lens. The focal length depends on the shape of the lens and the materials involved.</p></div>		</li>
