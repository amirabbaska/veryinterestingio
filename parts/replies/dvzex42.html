			<div class="markdown"><p>5000 words recognition vocabulary seems a little small when 5-year-olds can already recognise upwards of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5400288/" target="_blank">10000 words</a>, whereby we have to take into account that this paper does not differentiate between words and word groups or lemmas. It is stated in the other paper that both terms are used interchangeably at times, making the usage of &quot;word&quot; in the context somewhat confusing.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/lifijsal.2016.2.issue-2/lifijsal-2016-0008/lifijsal-2016-0008.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> paper by Swansea University puts the mean at 14000 to 18000 lemmas (or word groups), which, I grant, ist still substantially less than Shakespeare, but substantially more than 5000. However, there will have been scores higher (and lower, unfortunately). The estimated vocabulary necessary for completely fluent communication (being able to understand 98% of all communication) is 8000-9000 words.</p>
<p>Interestingly, education doesn't make all that big of a difference to vocabulary size.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scale of the difference between graduate and non-graduate speakers is nothing like what Kirkpatrick suggested, even allowing for the different unit of count he uses. The difference is more like 10 or 15% rather than the two-fold or ten-fold difference he describes. [...]</p>
<p>The  two  groups  tend  to  appear  more like each other than they appear different and the difference in the means is driven by a longer tail of low scores, below 10,000 words, which is present in the non-graduate population.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather vocabulary size seems to increase with age, regardless of educational attainment.</p>
<p>So, no, average vocabulary size does not seem to be at 5000 lemmas, but rather closer to 14000. Maybe the 5000 were the average size for the active vocabulary?</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I already have a recognition vocabulary size of around 5000 words in Spanish (after 1.5 years of learning the language), which is already enough to study at the university and pass exams, and in excess of 30000 in both German and English, though my active vocabulary is far smaller. And, honestly, I feel that it's not all that difficult to increase either, which is why 5000 just felt a little too small to me.</p></div>		</li>
