			<div class="markdown"><p>It would come down to which cells received the CRISPR modifications. </p>
<p>Most therapeutic iterations for CRISPR that people are talking about right now involve modifying blood (easy to take out of the body and work with), eye (less interference from the immune system) and liver (a sink for most targeting methods). Since cells from the blood, eye and liver don't transmit genetic information across generations, CRISPR-based modifications of these cells shouldn't be heritable.</p>
<p>People have talked about modifying embryos with CRISPR (we aren't quite there technologically, but people love talking about it). In theory, a CRISPR-modified embryo could heritably pass on the CRISPR-based genetic modification, depending on which cells in the embryo were modified.</p>
<p>You can also imagine using CRISPR to directly modify a sperm or an egg (in most cases you wouldn't do this, since there are other technologies that achieve the same result more safely), in these cases the modification would also be heritable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with SirT6. My lab is focused on modifying human immune cells outside of the body. These modifications should only affect the targeted cells and not alter genetic information inside of sperm or eggs. This is called &quot;somatic cell&quot; editing. This means that specialized cells in the body are edited, but not the &quot;germline.&quot; &quot;Germline editing&quot; would be if eggs or sperm (or the cells that will eventually develop into sperm or eggs) are modified. Future generations should only be affected if these germline cell are modified.</p>
<p>Germline modifications raise important ethical concerns. Somatic cell editing, including immune cell editing has fewer of these ethical complications. Engineered immune cells are more like a living drug. They are engineered to accomplish a specific disease treatment if they re-enter circulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>This</em> is a great question, I would love to know the answer as well! Would it be similar to using a performance enhancing drug (PED) and passing along the genetic modification that comes with those?</p></div>		</li>
