			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually because your eyes aren't a perfect camera, but do all sorts of post-processing.</p>
<p>Imagine it's a bright day, and you see something that kinda dark, just a bit, and has stripes. Your brain tells you &quot;well since everything else is brightly lit, the thing has to be dark in color, or else I'd see it bright as well. Black and blue!</p>
<p>Now it's night, pretty gloomy light. Everything is more or less dark. Your brain now sees a dress, it's dark, but brighter than the rest of the dark stuff around you. So brain says, huh that's a pretty light color, might even be white or gold, but it's difficult to make out in this illumination. White and Gold it is!</p></div>		</li>
