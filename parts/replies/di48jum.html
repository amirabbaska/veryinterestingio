			<div class="markdown"><p>So the Maillard reaction happens above 150Â°, if you could pressurise water so that you could get the temperatures up that high, would you get browning of the food? That's always something i associate with dry or oil based cooking like roasting, toasting, frying, grilling etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know of any studies of the Maillard reaction at 6 atmospheres, so it seems like the answer is &quot;we don't know.&quot;  It's a solid hypothesis that you would see browning.</p></div>		</li>

You make dulce de leche by boiling a can of sweetened condensed milk for an hour or so.  That's a maillard reaction, and it never gets over 100c.</p>
<p>maillard reactions happen at below boiling temperatures. Egg whites left to simmer for 12 hours will brown, for instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get maillard reactions at lower temperatures as well.</p>
<p>The reason we don't see it with water is there's no dehydration along with the heating.</p></div>		</li>
