			<div class="markdown"><p>You would actually die immediately from the fall alone. If you jump from the height portrayed in that video with the garbage being flung into the caldera, you would be hitting a fluid that is greater than twice the density of water and orders of magnitude more viscous from many stories up. You’d have to jump from pretty far away for the air around you when you started to be tolerable. </p>
<p>You’d smack into it and likely be unconscious immediately from the head trauma. Your blood would boil away right after that. </p>
<p>I suppose you might have some pain from the superheated air as you fell though, but I’m a medical doctor not any flavor of physicist so I dunno about heat transfers like that.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a video of a guy that committed suicide by jumping in a big pot of some kind of molten metal. It almost instantly created a large explosion due to the water in his body. </p>
<p>I cant seem to find the video though.</p></div>		</li>
