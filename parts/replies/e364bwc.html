			<div class="markdown"><p>As an example, our bowels can only feel the sensation of stretching. So you can feel gas or feces or whatever moving through them sometimes, but nothing else. So if you go in for a colonoscope the surgeon will be able to use a small set of metal jaws or a wire loop they run an electrical current through to rip/burn off pieces of your colon and you won't require any analgesia. You won't feel a thing while this happens (other than bad cramping from the air they inflate the colon with) because pieces being torn/burned off are simply non-sensations as far as your bowels are concerned. </p></div>		</li>
