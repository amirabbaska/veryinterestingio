<p><em>Around</em>, yes. It's equal to the secant of the bank angle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The apparent gravity for a passenger is the combination of the acceleration caused by the earth and and the centripetal acceleration toward the center of the turn.  Ideally, the direction of that combined gravity vector is out to bottom of the plane and it’s magnitude is somewhere around 1G.  If done properly, the passengers shouldn’t feel too much of a difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We're also really spacially aware, so both of us can tell you what cardinal direction the movement is in too. </p></div>		</li>

But I didn't spin myself, I spun the can with my arm in a vertical circle. The inertia this creates makes it hard to turn, so I could only do it while walking, not on my bike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sitting in a plane doing a holding pattern above Heathrow made me nauseous. Just a constant bank, describing one big circle above the airport. I was in a 787, in the middle bank of seats, and it was a dark and cloudy day, so I couldn't see outside. It was just me and a constant subtle Coriolis effect that was making my inner ear freak out.</p>
<p>Made me realise how unpleasant spin gravity would be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the chip manufacturer. The requirement is to disable the chip when speed exceeds 1000 kn <em>and</em> altitude exceeds 18 km, but some manufacturers are lazy and only rely on one test. It's less common to do that now, but if you need high speed or high altitude operation it's still important to confirm.</p></div>		</li>
