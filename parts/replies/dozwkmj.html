			<div class="markdown"><p>What he said isn't actually the other way around though. His explanation said that line dried are probably less dry but therefore MORE absorbant than machine dried. Your observations state that the air dried ones are more absorbant (and in your comment you deduce that therefore you think they are more dry, which you probably can't observe directly). </p></div>		</li>
