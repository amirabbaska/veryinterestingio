<p>The case of simple water mixing is a state function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This could be quite an ignorant statement, but isn't Newton's law of cooling a non linear equation, meaning that the water will cool at different rates depending upon what temperature it is at, so it does matter which temperatures you mix first?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, but the catch is 'closed' versus 'open' systems.</p>
<p>The 'system' is basically the scope of your calculations. You can never fully take into account the entire universe, you you always have to draw some sort of bounding box and consider only what is inside of the box. In this case, it makes sense to define the system as the volume of your three buckets.</p>
<p>The system can be considered 'closed' if there is negligible energy transfer from inside the box to outside the box. In our example, this is true if energy initially inside the buckets stays inside the buckets and does not get radiated away to the outside world. This is the case if the buckets are well insulated and/or you only consider a short time period during which very little energy could be lost. This is known as an 'adiabatic' process. Since the energy always stays inside the system, it would not matter how you mixed things, you always end up with the same result because there is no place for the energy to go.</p>
<p>The system can be considered 'open' if there is a mechanism where energy initially inside the box can leave the box. This is the case if the buckets are not well insulated or you take a very long time to mix things or it is very cold in the room etc. Since heat transfer is non-linear, you can easily demonstrate that the order of mixing things matters. The limiting case would be to not mix things at all and just let the hot buckets cool off. </p>
<p>In the real world, every meaningful system is open to some extent. But in many cases you can simplify things greatly by making the approximation of a closed system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newton's law of cooling states that the greater the temperature difference, positive or negative, between an object and it's environment, the faster heat will be exchanged. I.e. a hot coal cools faster than a lukewarm coal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More precisely it mustn't matter for a state function, i.e. there is by definition a lack of information about the system, otherwise the notion of entropy is ill-defined. Furthermore, mixing of water under constant pressure/constant volume will lead to different amounts of work and heat transfer, leading to different temperatures of the baths (buckets). Then again using energy might go against the spirit of OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment thread needs less negativity. I like the analogy at the end. That's a good way to put it. One I just came up with in my head would be paint color. Two buckets of red and one of blue will always make the same shade of purple assuming every single drop is transferred.</p>
<p>Of course, this assumes a perfect universe, and we all know that the universe is too chaotic for these assumptions to be met. When comparing all sequences, the differences in practice will be small but the differences in math will be zero.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Perhaps it's not the positivity or negativity, but how we combine them? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this remain true when you factor in the temperature of the buckets themselves would it not be colder if you poured all the water into the bucket that is already cold vs the hot buckets?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My original response pretends the bucket temp isn't part of the system (or that the combining bucket is not one of the original), but yes that should matter as there is some energy in the bucket itself.  Using one of the hot buckets as the final vs the cold bucket would mean more total energy in the system and a slightly higher temperature.</p></div>		</li>
