			<div class="markdown"><p>A capacitor can be used, but they are frequency dependent devices. You would end up making a bass/treble control. Transistors can also function as variable gain amplifiers, but potentiometers have the advantage of being available in log taper types. So changing rotation by 10 degrees has the same apparent effect whether it is at the low end or high end. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all. You could implement a digital filter where changing the volume just changes a number in the computer.</p>
<p>Allpass filters are really simple. Adding capacitors or using more complex circuits wouldn't make it an allpass filter any more. You'd have a filter that's useful, just not for the application we need. I'd be willing to explain if you're fine with it getting a bit more technical and advanced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if your explanation is correct...at least in the sense of analog circuits.  You are describing a <em>filter</em>, which affects <em>frequency,</em> and not <em>amplitude</em>.      I'm thinking the more correct term is an attenuator... which controls amplitude (i.e. volume) and leaves the original signal intact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's perfectly applicable. There is such a thing as an allpass filter, which lets all frequencies through. And filters have variable gain. An allpass filter is just another name for an amplifier which amplifies/attenuates all frequencies equally.</p>
<p>I'm an electrical engineering student in graduate school. I know what I'm talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok.  I'm not an EE student, but I've built a few triode-based amps in my day.  I know what an all-pass filter is... it's a filter, not an amplifier.  Filters are about frequency, amps are about, well, amplitude.  I see the all-pass filter as passing all frequencies (unity gain), but it also (in general use) alters phase.  I've built them into speaker crossovers to correct for time delay. (didn't seem to help/improve much)  Guitar pedals have them also...the are called phasers in that use case.   </p>
<p>I suppose I'm having trouble seeing the use of a filter (all-pass or otherwise) used as a volume control.   What am I missing?</p></div>		</li>
