			<div class="markdown"><p>We did our studies in different  human cancer cell lines and a wide variety of human cancer tissues. VAR2CSA was able to bind specifically to the majority of cell lines and cancer tissues.
in vitro, we tested cancer cell lines from: prostate, lung, breast, lymphoma, osteosarcoma......
in vivo, we tested breast cancer, lymphoma  and prostate cancer and we are curently testing other types.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very much my question. I'm a renal cell carcinoma, 1B Fuhrman 2, clear type survivor. I have lesions on my lungs we are watching and I'm curious if RCC would respond to it, since RCC responds to very little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, I read somewhere that it was expected to hit 85-95% of all types. I have no idea, where that number came from and I can't seem to find the article. I can't reliably say, if the number is from the team.</p></div>		</li>
