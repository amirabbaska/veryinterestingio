<p>I remember that once they tried releasing microbeads in front of the hull and that decreased drag. But I can't imagine polluting the ocean so badly just to get a higher speed. Just think of the stuff that's left in the waters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Y ah the problem is kayakers and canoeists donâ€™t have a fundamental understanding of surface energies, durability, and flow dynamics so they are trying all the wrong stuff. It has been proven that there can be huge improvement in drag reduction if the right coating and conditions are used. It is definitely not commercial scale yet but there is a lot of promising research.</p></div>		</li>
