			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't look too deeply for numbers, but in 2015 we had about a 5.8% failure rate on rockets. That's really not to bad. But now imagine hearing your government is going to shoot a rocket filled with nuclear waste over your city. And hope it doesn't explode and rain nuclear waste over everything. That's the primary reason why we don't shoot nuclear waste into space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't shoot it into space because very very bad things would happen if the rocket. It would be very expensive, but it's also just a bad plan</p>
<p>Best plan is to feed it into a breeder reactor to make more useful fuel</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Breeder reactors for the win!</p>
<p>I would like to see the government start a program where utilities can &quot;lease&quot; breeder reactors from them, but as a part of the lease, they have to employ Navy nuclear technicians to operate the plant, change the fuel, and dispose of the fuel.  That way, proliferation is off the table from the get-go, and the U.S. has a quick source for weapons-grade plutonium (not that we need more, but I guess it could be a selling point?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cost is not the only thing stopping us from sending the waste into space! There is also an inherent danger involved.</p>
<p>Think about what happened with the tragic challenger mission. Although it is very unlikely a catastrophic failure like that one will happen again, think about what would happen if instead of a crew of humans, that shuttle or rocket had contained a full shipment of highly radioactive nuclear waste. </p>
<p>The fallout from this type of explosion would be devastating. The radioactivity would be spread around the atmosphere depending on the hight of the explosion.</p>
<p>Although the chances of this happening are slim, it would take many trips to get all of our high-level nuclear waste to space, and each trip increases the odds of a failure happening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. What element is it? Some isotopes are more dangerous for chemical properties than radiological. </p>
<p>Fortunately dilution is the solution to pollution.</p></div>		</li>
