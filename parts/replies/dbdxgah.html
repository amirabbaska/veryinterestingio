<blockquote>
<p>I feel like a great director can take a shitty script and cast and still make a halfway decent movie with them. On the other hand, I feel like a terrible director could have taken a film we think of as a blockbuster... lord of the rings, star wars, whatever -- and totally ruined them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to explore the area between these two. A not so great director with a not so great cast does something wonderful. Whom should the credit go to?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way I think to look at it is like a car. A script/screenplay is like the guts, the engine, chassy, drivetrain. A screenwriter decides whether it gets a 4 cylinder or 6, AWD or rear wheel. It's where it all begins. It's what separates an american muscle car, and a honda civic.  The director is the body designer. The curves, the colors, overall look and design. All the features, the way the doors open, the interior. It's what initially catches your eye when you see that hot rod drive by, even though underneath it might not be all that different than what's under your hood. And finally the actors, they're the drivers, they're the ones moving the whole thing along. Where should the credit go? Well all of them really. A great driver can only do so much with a rust bucket, and you can toss a spoiler on a civic and it's still going to be a civic. In general, terrific acting is done with the enabling of a good director, and good directing is done with a well written foundation to build upon.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at Natalie Portman in Star Wars vs Black Swan. She was TERRIBLE in Star Wars, then three years later won best actress for Black Swan.</p>
<p>To me, that speaks to the strength of the director. Portman's obviously a talented actress, but she needs a good director to pull it out of her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention good writing to give them something good to work with.  The writing for the prequels was abysmal on top of the lackluster directing.  See something like Thor where she comes off as a standard actress given competent material and directing, but where it doesn't provide her with much to show off her chops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. The few names most people recognize are usually writer/director combinations, like Tarrantino and the guys (girls?) that wrote and directed the matrix.</p>
<p>I feel like the only time I see writers headlined is when it's a known author like stephen king or whoever</p></div>		</li>
