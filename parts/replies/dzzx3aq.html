			<div class="markdown"><p>U-238 is not a radioactive waste and what is produced is called depleted uranium.</p>
<p>The activity is quite low  and it is only a alpha emitter the radiation can pass trough you dead skin layer. It would be a problem if you ingested it.</p>
<p>So you can handle U-238 and it is used to quote wikipedoia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Civilian uses include counterweights in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical radiation therapy and industrial radiography equipment, and containers for transporting radioactive materials. Military uses include armor plating and armor-piercing projectiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is primary a problem as a hevy metal so don't bread in dust or eat it but the same is true for lead. Depleted uranium is less toxic the  arsenic and mercury.</p>
<p>You could not remove all traces of  it but so you cant cover up the operation but the storage problem of the depleted uranium is not a relevant part of the problem.</p>
<p>The amount you produce is not that large. Uranium or is 0.72% U235 depelted uranium as 0.3% so the extracted U235 is 0.5% of the original mass. So for 1 kg of U235 you have 200 kg of depleted uranium.</p>
<p>Little boy had 64 Kg of u235  so 12800 kg of depleted uranium was generated is 12.8 ton. Uranium have a density of 17.3 g/cm^3 so it is only 0.7 cubmic meter in size.  So we talk in the order of cubic meter of waste per nuclear weapon. That is not a relevant storage problem. If you have a enrichment facility add a little extra space for storage is not a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow, I knew it was dense, but didn't realize it was that dense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what makes it an excellent projectile. It's also pyrophoric and self-sharpening: The outermost layer of a kinetic energy penetrator disintegrates into uranium oxides (read: burning metal dust) in high-velocity impacts rather than deforming/flattening like other metal projectiles tend to do.</p>
<p>While that's bad for distributing all the energy into a body, it's very very good for getting through vehicular armor, and that superheated radioactive cloud is not something you want inside your wounds or lungs: those alpha particles can be stopped by dead skin but will have a field-day if inside your soft organ tissues (but the &quot;burning metal cloud&quot; part is of more immediate concern to crews).</p>
<p>Unfortunately that also spreads that same dust across a rather wide area in exactly the most unhealthy and contaminating form depleted uranium can take.</p></div>		</li>
