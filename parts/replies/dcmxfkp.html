			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I signed in just to ask you this because this was on my mind yesterday unfortunately.</p>
<p>If you eat something particularly fattening/ bad for you that immediately triggers diarrhea, does your body absorb that fat and other unhealthy stuff like it would if it sat in your stomach/ intestines for however many hours/ days?</p>
<p>In other words, is it better for me if I shit my brains out shortly after eating a double cheese burger or does it not make a difference? </p></div>		</li>
