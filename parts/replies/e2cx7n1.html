<p>For example, 3! is 3•2•1 = 6.</p>
<p>Let's consider three objects, A B and C.
We have six orderings:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really useful for probability. Say you were pulling from a deck of cards to get one specific card. theres a 1/52 chance of pulling it from a stack of 52 cards. Then you pull the next one and theres a 1/51 chance this time. Next time is 1/50 and so on. So if you wanted the odds that the specific order of cards you pulled came up it would be 1/52 <em> 1/51 </em> 1/50... and you could then write the odds of a deck of cards being in a specific order as 1/52!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since cards are mentioned this means that you can shuffle a deck and statistically it is 52! possible ways it can be shuffled.</p>
<p>This means it is very likely once shuffled it is unique and no one else has shuffled it that way.</p>
<p>This is because this number is so large, it is larger than even possibly the grains in all sands of earth, larger than all stars there are in observable universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely correct example. Just a small point about terminology. A factorial would be when you multiply a <strong>natural</strong> by all <strong>naturals</strong> below it.</p>
<p>Naturals = <strong>N</strong> = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...}</p>
<p>Integers = <strong>Z</strong> = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}</p>
<p>Also, just by convention, 0! is defined to be 1. Mathematicians have done this for a variety of reasons, but maybe the easiest argument for this is the following:</p>
<p>5! / 5 = (5 <em> 4 </em> 3 <em> 2 </em> 1) / 5 = 4 <em> 3 </em> 2 * 1 = 4!</p>
<p>4! / 4 = (4 <em> 3 </em> 2 <em> 1) / 4 = 3 </em> 2 * 1 = 3!</p>
<p>3! / 3 = (3 <em> 2 </em> 1) / 3 = 2 * 1 = 2!</p>
<p>2! / 2 = (2 * 1) / 2 = 1 = 1!</p>
<p>If we want to continue this pattern, then 1! / 1 = 0!, so 0! must be defined as 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More technical detail (feel free to ignore):</p>
<p>If you tried to define it on all integers, for the product of all integers below another, you would get n! = 0 for all non-negative n, and an undefined result for all negative n.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>3! = 3 <em> 2 </em> 1 <em> 0 </em> (-1) <em> (-2) </em> ... = 0 (there is a 0 in the product and anything times 0 is 0).</p>
<p>0! = 0 <em> (-1) </em> (-2) <em> (-3) </em> ... = 0 (again, there is a 0 in the product)</p>
<p>(-3)! = (-3) <em> (-4) </em> (-5) <em> (-6) </em> ..., which is not well-defined as (in maths speak) the series does not converge</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to be really pedantic, -3! Isn't defined so you can't definitively express it like that. Common expressions of non natural factorials use the n-1 gamma function but this is not how they're defined simply an extrapolation of an existing operation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A variation of this argument for the 0! definition comes from one way to formalize the definition for the factorial, a recursive one.</p>
<p>We can say 1!=1, and then define for n&gt;=1, (n+1)!=n!*(n+1)</p>
<p>For example, 3!= 2!<em>3 = 1!</em>2<em>3 = 1</em>2*3</p>
<p>We can easily extend this to include 0 by requiring that 1!=0!*1, and since we want 1!=1, that means 1!/1=0!=1</p>
<p>This shows why we might want this pattern to be preserved, it's not just a random pattern, it can be used to define the factorial!</p></div>		</li>
