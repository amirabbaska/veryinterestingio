			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't really easily block it. It's not just one massive organization filing thousands of lawsuits under the name &quot;Church of Scientology.&quot; Its thousands of individual members all being told to file a lawsuit against the DOJ and the Treasury to bog it in nightmarish beuracracy. You have no idea which ones of the thousands of lawsuits may be actual Scientologists, no way to prove it, but you do have one thing:</p>
<p>The Church of Scientology promises that, as long as you grant them tax exempt status, you'll be free. It'll all go away.</p>
<p>And so, with no way to prove some conspiracy and no way to figure out which of thousands of lawsuits all filed by different people may be real and which may be fake, and even if you did still having to fight it, you decide to give in, because it's the easiest option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No police resources are being used. Police do not run the courts. </p>
<p>And while it is illegal to file frivolous lawsuit, the lawsuit has to be determined to be frivolous. It was also not the Church as a single entity filing suit, it was the members individually filing suit based on their personal 1st Amendment rights claiming that Scientology was their religion. That is actually a legitimate use of the system as it is a protection for First Amendment rights and how the government knows they are being violated somewhere. </p></div>		</li>
