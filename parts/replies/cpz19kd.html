			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they can digest short polymers (oligomers)!  At least pentamers (chains of 5) can be digested, and very likely even longer chains (<a href="http://aem.asm.org/content/59/11/3978.short" target="_blank">source</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They certainly could become less durable, but think about wood. Very useful, despite the fact that it is technically biodegradable. This is because it's generally kept dry, and the bonds in wood are hard to break down even though there are microbes capable of doing so. Plastic would probably similar only even more difficult, since plastics tend to be hydrophobic and won't stay wet easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a time when wood was the new kid on the block and nothing knew how to digest it.</p>
<p>Earth recieved tons of air, but the world was covered with dead trunks that just sat there and did nothing.  The tough cell walls was beyond the capabilities of any digestive system; micro or macro.</p>
<p>A fungus found a way to break into those cells and fed on the huge supply of dead trunks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the carboniferous period plants evolved lignin, the building blocks of wood.  It took fungi a LONG time to figure out how to unlock and digest lignin.  So much carbon was taken out of the atmosphere by plants that it changed the atmosphere to be much more oxygen rich.  Massive dragonflies :)</p></div>		</li>
