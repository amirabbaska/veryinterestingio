			<div class="markdown"><p>Jep, pretty much the same in Germany. Example for something you have to pay with your own money is the dentist. Most things are covered, but not everything will be paid by the insurance company. Everybody in Germany is technically  insured by the tax system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.cogilog.com/Logiciel/exemple-bulletin-paie/employe-2.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is an exemple of a pay stub I found by googling.</p>
<p>The total in green (1 820,04€) is what the employee earned before taxes (the gross salary).</p>
<p>The &quot;Montant Sal.&quot; column is all the taxes payed by the employee. The &quot;Montant Pat.&quot; is all the taxes payed by the employer.</p>
<p>The employer pays 236,61€ for the healthcare and 20,00€ for the complementary (&quot;mutuelle&quot;), the employee pays only 20,00€ for the mutuelle.</p>
<p>The other lines are for other taxes (pension, unemployment, accidents, ...).</p>
<p>The &quot;Net à payer&quot; is the net salary:  1 377,24€.</p>
<p>So, an employee earning 1400€ will actually cost you almost 2400€.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't that bad.  My base is about $9,000US/month. I pay about $3,200/month Federal, State, Fica/Medicare and Health care. The health care is 400 and doesn't include my wife but does cover my kids. </p>
<p>My employer is paying $600/month for my health care plus all the other taxes mandated fees (unemployment insurance, social security plus other). I don't know how much those taxes are but it is at least a thousand dollars a month. </p>
<p>So if just the health care was converted to taxes to pay Single Payer type then the government would get $1000/month. And another $700/month from my wife.</p>
<p>That is another 1700/month + the Medicare money.</p>
<p>And that is what everybody in my company pays regardless of how much they make.</p>
<p>Of course it is much more complicated than this little blurb but it just seems the money is there and it would be so much more efficient to have single payer so that these costs would be known up front and more stable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Soc Sec/Medicare are 7.65% for the employer.  So on your $9k your company pays $688.50.  Unemployment varies by state but it's tiny- federally it's 0.6% on only the first $7k paid to each employee, so $42/year for each employee.  State unemployment obviously varies by state but is also generally tiny, in my state for example it's about $70/year for each employee.  So your employer pays a bit less than $700/month in taxes for employing you.  </p>
<p>And healthcare is pre-tax so deduct whatever is withheld for health insurance on your paycheck before calculating the 7.65% they pay in employment taxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Our taxes are worse when healthcare is considered. </p>
<p>I get about 25% taken out from my check, with no healthcare (state tax is 5.3%) on a reasonably middle class wage. With the employer contribution that's about $750 take home on $1076.50 or just about 70%, or a 30% tax rate. If you asked me whether I wanted pretty decent (and simple! Isn't that an underestimated benefit?) health care at a cost of another 10%, I'd go stand in line to sign up, immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's about a 35% income tax rate on a $108,000 salary.  The French example is a 25% income tax on a $21,840 salary.  That's a pretty absurdly high tax rate for such a low income bracket.</p>
<p>Further, France has a 20% sales tax on everything except a few exempted categories.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not that simple actually, more like you have lots of reductions that apply to unemployed people, and yes some things are free in that case; but not everything. When you are unemployed, you apply to Pole Emploi, which is an institution whose purpose is to help you find work. In the meantime you are &quot;subscribed&quot; there, you get unemployment benefits, but it is limited in time. At some point, if you did not find a job, you cannot continue to get benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Example, here in Belgium I was born rather wealthy so a job wasn't all that important to me in my early 20's.(traveled a lot).</p>
<p>Decided to start studying a bit and with providing a paper that I was unemployed I could get my classes for half the price.(so like instead of €400/trimester it was €200 with books and everything)</p>
<p>Kind of annoying that now I work I have to pay it all but I understand why of course :p.</p>
<p>At least the ones connected to my job I can get payed for by my employer but as a bookkeeper I can't exactly ask them to pay for my physics classes.</p></div>		</li>
