<p>water is actually a negative-calorie drink since the body needs to expend energy to raise the temperature of the water to the equilibrium temperature of the body</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd never thought of this. Often during the day I'll just down half a litre of chilled water. How many calories is my body using to heat it up to my body temperature? I feel that there must be some obvious maths that could tell me this.</p>
<p>EDIT: The fact that my seemingly simple question has &gt;290 child comments makes me glad I didn't attempt it myself! Thanks everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is an absurdly small amount of energy.</p>
<p>A calorie is the energy required to increase the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. </p>
<p>However we normally use the term Calorie as opposed to calorie, the capitalisation is important. A Calorie is 1000 calories.</p>
<p>When people say the average person requires 2000 calories a day it is referring to the capitalised variation. So in reality we would need 2,000,000 calories or 2,000 Calories. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep.</p>
<p>i knew someone in college that made this mistake. He was determined to lose weight by drinking <em>cold</em> beer over the course of a year.</p>
<p>that is the story of how he became fat</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really that small. 1Kcal raises 1 Kg (in this case, about 1 l) by about 1ºC. Say you drink a cup (200 ml) of water that is at 17ºC. To bring to body temperature, you need to heat 200 g of water by 20ºC: that is, you need to spend 4000 cal, or 4 Kcal. Now, if you drank 1 l of water at freezing temperature, you would spend 37 Calories/Kilocalories to heat it up. This is actually a lot of energy, considering how much you would have to run to spend the same amount of calories. </p>
<p>It's just that food we eat is extremely high in calories (just look at how hot oil lamps get, or a burning piece of paper (made of carbohydrates). Burning just 1 gram of paper, you should be able to boil 4 grams of 0ºC water. Burn 1 gram of oil, and you can boil about 9 grams. This is equivalent to heating up 108 ml and 243 ml of 0ºC water to body temperature, respetively. And assuming you weight 65 kg, with 1 gram of sugar you should be able to go up 26 m of stairs, assuming no losses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually just really misleading, pop science more than anything.   </p>
<p>There's a reason you need a 75 degree environment to feel comfortable even with a body temperature of 98 degrees. Your body is continuously producing excess heat that it needs to dump into the environment. Most of the energy used to heat that water up is just going to be waste heat, not your metabolism kicking into overdrive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally, the correct answer. Your body is already warm, drinking FREEZING cold water at a high volume would put you into shock, ice cold water starts warming the second it touches air, factors all over the place. It's all negligible in the end as far as calorie expenditure goes, but I guess doing the math for assumed perfect variables is fun for some people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 Calorie raises the temperature of 1 litre of water by 1 degree C. Assuming the water is chilled to standard refrigeration temperature of 4 degrees, it will take 16.5 Calories to raise 0.5L of water to 37 degree body temperature.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;This Product Contains Olestra. Olestra may cause abdominal cramping and loose stools (anal leakage). Olestra inhibits the absorption of some vitamins and other nutrients. Vitamins A, D, E, and K have been added&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, like fiber. You can mix artificial sweetener with fiber powder and eat as much of that as you want. Essentially zero calories. The problem isn't making zero calorie food, it's making one that people would remotely want to eat. </p></div>		</li>
