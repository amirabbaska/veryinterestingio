<p>1/3rd of a 100 degree circle is 33.333... degrees<br />
1/3rd of a 360 degree circle is 120 degrees<br />
1/6th of a 100 degree circle is 16.666... degrees<br />
1/6th of s 360 degree circle is 60 degrees  </p>
<p>There are many many more ways that you can split up 360 without using decimals than 100. It would suck having to deal with decimals when working with 3rds and 6ths of circles.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people are replying to you on why 360 can be easily divided into whole numbers, but not really why it was important. </p>
<p>Today we have calculators and division algorithms and modern fractions. </p>
<p>Instead of using these, the Babylonian scribes would write out tables for others to use, consisting of of pieces of 60 that each division represented. In one column on the table would be a number and the other would have the corresponding part of 60. For example: </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Divisor</th>
<th>Pieces</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>7,30</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It all appears to make sense until you get to 8. The thing here is that they were working in base 60, and the comma is kind of like a decimal place, but not. It means that 8×(7 + 30/60) = 60. </p>
<p>It gets a bit more confusing with other numbers, where 27's reciprocal is 2,13,20, or in other words, 27×[2 + 13/60 + (20/60)/60] = 60. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>30 degrees (1/12 circle) and 60 degrees (1/6 circle) are extremely significant/useful in geometry. Sin 30 is ½ exactly, cos 60 is ½ exactly. The angles of an equilateral triangle are each 60. </p></div>		</li>
