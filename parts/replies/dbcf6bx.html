			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. 95% off the time it's on time throughout the year. I've had my last 3 packages delayed over the last week though shipping ground. Didn't matter because I sent them with a week to spare but if its going to be close I'd just pay the guarantee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your risk is it will arrive later than you thought it would. Nothing more, nothing less. If you're sending a personal gift, most of the time that doesn't matter and you shouldn't do it. If you're sending something for work that a huge project is dependent on, then maybe pay the extra so it gets there on time.</p>
<p>The extra work is giving such packages priority over packages not paid to be guaranteed, and if there are too many of those to work with the normal logistics process, get extra drivers, rent extra (space on) planes, etc. Whatever is needed to move the packages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story also worked for budget and they pimp out their trucks hard to fedex around the hoildays. Ground routes are dicey business to begin with because they are franchised out to individuals. Can make for a headache holiday season when that person is a cheapo and has the most unreliable, probably a crack addict, cheap drivers running routes. So because Fedex is a guarantee pay check for a budget franchise owner they always give them the cream of the crop trucks. So don't try and move around the holiday's you will get a junky falling apart truck. Especially if you are going one way.  </p></div>		</li>
