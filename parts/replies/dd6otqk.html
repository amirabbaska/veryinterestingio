			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. It answer the underlying question &quot;What is Math?&quot;, that is implicitly asked, whenever someone asks &quot;why is 1+1=2?&quot;. </p>
<p>When somone asks that question, they don't care about the definition and the proof; They care about reasoning behind it all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. When you have apples in your hands, and you hold up one and go &quot;one!&quot; and then the other and go &quot;one! that makes two!&quot; you've already presupposed the meaning of the words.</p>
<p>In other words: the definitions came before experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't make sense. It is clear from human experience that if you have an apple and then grab another apple then you have two apples, no matter what words you use to define &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two&quot;. Our brain inately can make this distinction. </p>
<p>Surely that experience led to establishing the axioms that we did… it is not arbitrary in that sense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two is an abstraction. You see during your life great amount of things. You see that they often have nothing in common but the quality of being &quot;two&quot; or whatever you want to call it. You see similiarites between things that are &quot;two&quot; and differences from things that arent &quot;two&quot;. At that point you dont even name it. But by expierience you see this pattern, this common quality of entites and then you abstract away their differences and hold their quantity as an abstraction (that is two). In the same way in which you learn to name a color thorugh seeing many things that are different but are similiar in respect of color. Mathematics is necessery and logical but its root as every form of human knowledge comes from information of the senses processed by human (conceptual) mind. There is not a priori knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cannot agree that math is “nothing more” than a set of definitions. Definitions alone would be inert, lifeless. Math also has rules about deriving statements from other statements. You could argue that these rules are just definitions too, but they are not—they provide actions and bring the definitions to life.</p>
<p>Beyond that, math is meaningful because it is hugely useful. It models many things—hugely many different things. It enables us to reason and to predict better than we could otherwise. It guides us to new discoveries about the physical world. I would allow that these things are extrinsic, that they are outside of mathematics rather than a part of it, so they do not technically speak to whether math is “nothing more” than a set of definitions, but we should not neglect them.</p></div>		</li>
