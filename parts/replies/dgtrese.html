			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Counter EMF is the opposing magnetic force to the primary magnetic force in this case. The principle is the same, just with magnetically induced forces. Another way to think of it is if you have an asynchronous motor, say a DC motor, without a mechanical load it would continuously spin up and gain rotor speed until it flies apart. Thanks to counter EMF there is an opposing force that prevents that. Newton's Third Law, at least in an abstract form, definitely applies. This same force is why a generator becomes harder to turn as the load increases. Hopefully this makes sense.</p>
<p>As an edit: On the physics side of the house there are a number of laws in play that are more specific than Newton's Third Law. An introduction can be found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-electromotive_force" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-electromotive_force</a>. Think of Newton's Third Law in this case as a jumping off point for the basis to explain why counter EMF even exists in the first place. I also need to point out that when I say counter EMF, I am really describing two distinct forces. One is a voltage generated in opposite polarity of the primary voltage while the other is the mechanical opposition resulting from the generation of that opposing voltage. The generation of the opposing voltage and the resulting magnetic filed acting to give impedance and limit current flow is what the OP was curious about vice the mechanical aspects.</p></div>		</li>
