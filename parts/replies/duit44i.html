			<div class="markdown"><p>This generally only happens with people who supplement large amounts of male hormone for whatever reason, usually bodybuilding. Their bodies convert the testosterone to estrogen, so they do indeed get the effects of both hormones being elevated. You can sometimes see it in the gym, the guy who injected steroids without knowing what he was doing. He looks built but also 'soft' from retaining water - he has a 'moon face', acne, emotional lability, and swollen nipples. Knowledgable bodybuilders know how to use drugs to control the conversion of T to E2, to keep the levels of E2 normal while the T is high.  It is quite tricky to do and one of the reasons steroids ought to be controlled substances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>canâ€™t exactly work that way, If you think of your body as a bottle with 2 liquids, You have different levels at each time but each gender has a general baseline ratio. If you have more than one, You typically have less than the other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Then when you see an androgynous person it's mostly due to a switching of hormonal balance from one steady extreme to the other at some point in life, effectively mixing normal characteristics of their gender from normal growth with additional characteristics of the opposite gender due to something abnormal?</p></div>		</li>
