			<div class="markdown"><p>I would reply &quot;Maps&quot;, but this post is a very good summary of what I would have said in more words and less well put together.
Cartography is awesome. Mapping is hard, people with incredible skill in both art and science found ways to generate accurate mapping. But the whole &quot;Flat vs Round&quot; issue is still an issue. And source material for <a href="https://xkcd.com/977/" target="_blank">XKCD</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude" target="_blank">Wiki Entry</a><br />
The &quot;Longitude Problem&quot; is actually very cool and this short article covers it well enough.  </p>
<p>And while I love the fact that we have incredibly detailed mapping of the entire globe at this point and instruments that can delve underwater and into the Earth to find even more data - I think I will always miss the idea that there could be something else out there. And that never again will we have a map of the world with &quot;Here there be Dragons...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I haven't. I read Neil Stephenson's [The Baroque Cycle](<a href="http://a.co/gauqyzA" target="_blank">http://a.co/gauqyzA</a> ) and it comes up in the book/epic. So I looked into the history of it vs the fictionalized account. And, for something we totally take for granted in the 20/21st century, it was an incredibly important and interesting problem to be solved in the 17/18th century.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now would that first example of a map actually be used for navigation or just reference? </p>
<p>Seems to be very simplistic, like using a childs map of the US to plan a road trip. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, most navigation was along the coast. This map probably lists all the coastal cities in the mediterranean and all the major geographical things (like islands, or italy being in the middle, the shape of the peloponese...). </p>
<p>You draw maps like that too and they are totally fine. How do you give someone directions on the back of an envelope? You don't need your map to be accurate, you don't need actual distances, you draw here are you, walk these two blocks, and then there is this roundabout, watch out, it has five exits! so you take the second one, and continue three more blocks, pass the post office and it's on the left. You don't care if the distances and angles are wrong, you have all the necessary information on it.</p>
<p>This map is the same. After city X comes city Y, and then you have to go south for quite some time, until city Z. Then you can continue to the north....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a great A&amp;E TV movie called Longitude that tells the story of how we were able to finally accurately measure longitude in the 18th century, really fascinating. </p></div>		</li>
