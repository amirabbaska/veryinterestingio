			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pauli Exclusion Principle, in this instance, means that you can't have 2 electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.  Basically, when your solid hand is pushing on a solid desk, you are attempting to force electrons into the same state. But you can't... so your hand won't pass through... this is degeneracy pressure. The force you are applying is going into moving electrons to higher states.</p>
<p>Some things can overcome this repulsion- specifically degenerate stars. But they do not violate the exclusion principle... In fact, our sun is small enough that degeneracy pressure keeps it from gravitational collapse.</p>
<p>But if a star is large enough, eventually the gravity will overcome electron degeneracy pressure and it will collapse into a neutron star or a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electrons do not have to be in the ground state. Electrons will normally be changing their energy levels constantly, due to thermal fluctuations. When two surfaces are close, the pressure will arise from electrons trying to occupy the same quantum state at the same time, and scattering off each other.</p></div>		</li>
