			<div class="markdown"><p>Bandwidth has two common meanings: in the signal processing world it is a measure of a width of frequencies, but in the computing world it is a measure of data transfer rates, usually measured in bits per second.</p>
<p>Just because they didn't use your preferred meaning doesn't mean they are wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>when in reality using a larger bandwidth plays a very small role in our high speed internet today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting, it does have an effect on mobile internet. The more band you allocate to data transfers, the higher the throughput.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is like saying that 'decimate' only means 'to reduce by one tenth'. Meanings change and bandwidth colloquially simply has taken on the meaning of 'throughput' in this particular context. So, it is quite correct to use the term bandwidth here.</p></div>		</li>
