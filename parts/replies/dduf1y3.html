<p>As another example, English radio stations censor some works like bitch and fuck. That same song played on a French language station will not be censored.</p>

<p>That may be true but you must account for it being a different language. It's been a while since I've listened to Quebec radio but I don't remember ever hearing &quot;Tabarnak&quot; on the radio. </p>
<p>As far as violence vs sex part of it might just be due to French Canada being a pretty small market. Sex is obviously more acceptable but it's also cheaper. Action scenes with guns, explosions and such are expensive. </p></div>		</li>
