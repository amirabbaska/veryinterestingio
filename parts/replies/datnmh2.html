			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair our current understanding of Black Holes is based on classical (General Relativity) and semi-classical (Hawking Radiation) theories. When the mass of a Black Hole is the Planck mass the quantum effects are fully relevant and you can't expect the equations of General Relativity to hold true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When theoretical physicists that work in quantum physics use the word classical, they mean anything that's not quantum. That includes GR. If the word &quot;classical physics&quot; is used in a classical mechanics class, that means excluding relativity. Physicists will use the same term to mean either, it just depends on the context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So are quantum effects relevant at 20 micrograms? I feel like that's a large mass for quantum effects to start happening, I thought Planck units were just another unit system based off of normalising constants, not limits to classical mechanics.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not exclusively related to mass. The size of the system also plays a role. The order of magnitude where quantum effects are important can be found calculating the Compton wavelength. </p>
<p>If a system of mass m has a typical size of the order of its Compton wavelength (h/m c) then the quantum effects are not negligible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I'm understanding this correctly, what that info means is that if you take the smallest possible mass and compress it infinitesimally smaller than the smallest possible volume, it will form a black hole. Or am I completely wrong? </p></div>		</li>

<p>You might also be interested in the concept of a Planck particle, which is larger than the Planck mass by a factor of sqrt(pi).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't consider it weird, I'd rather think it's all about the distance betwwen the two paricles of minimal mass.</p>
<p>My bare understanding of black holes is that they are caraterized by mass density. If two - or more - of the lightest particle in the universe were to colapse in a signle spatial point, that would lead to maximal &quot;density&quot;, therefore a black hole.</p>
<p>I'm probably incorect on that, it's all based a rough understanding of the matter at hands. But I'd almost confidently state that there's no minimal mass for a black-hole, just that the minimal <em>possible</em> mass would have such a short (in terms of radius) impact that it would go unnoticed for most instruments.</p>
<p>Does it qualify as a correct understanding ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that it was around 3 solar masses. Stars under 8 solar masses during life create White Dwarfs when they die. White Dwarfs cause a type of Super Nova when they get a little less than 1.5  solar masses. </p>
<p>Stars between 8-16(very rough numbers) solar masses create a neutron star after they die, and the neutron stars become black holes if they have roughly 3 solar masses. That is the biggest a neutron star can get. And therefore the amount of mass necessary to create a black hole. Probably. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the initial star has to be insanely massive to leave a black hole behind. Like, 16 times the mass of our sun massive. </p>
<p>And I used the remnant because it has nothing but mass and gravity affecting it's size, and can be used to accurately determine the amount of mass necessary to create a black hole, with no other factors. </p></div>		</li>
