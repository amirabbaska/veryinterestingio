<p>and in any case the fertilizer can also be produced artificially.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's important to mention that the production of artificial nitrogen fertilizers is <strong>insanely</strong> energy-intensive and contributes huge volumes of carbon to the atmosphere. It might seem counter-intuitive, but modern agriculture is really, really bad for the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we're mentioning important things, it's important to mention several more. First, the Nitrogen fertilizer is produced from methane, which can be created from non-fossil sources but isn't because of cost reasons. Second, you and 70% of your friends wouldn't exist without the food production enabled by modern agriculture. Third, chemical fertilizers are actually safer, less polluting, and far more energy efficient to apply than their organic counterparts.</p>
<p>Not saying modern agriculture is utopia or anything, but it's literally the foundation of modern society.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm glad you mentioned this. People naively assume that organic = safer by default. It's not. Many organic pesticides, for example, are more toxic to humans than non-organic pesticides.</p>
<p>If you want to be kind to the environment, buying inefficiently-farmed organic produce is not the way. Modern agriculture, using modern, non-organic processes, produces more food than an organic farm of the same size. Since the demand for food is huge, these less-efficient organic farms are actually less ethical as these farmers chose to produce less food than they could to meet the world's needs. Organic farms also harm the environment due to their inefficient use of land, since more total land is needed to produce organic food than a modern farm. It's a similar deal with the non-GMO trend. GMO crops produce more food per acre than non-GMO crops. Plus, there is really no good reason not to buy GMO foods similarly to why there is no good reason not to immunize your children. The anti-GMO movement is misinformed and actively works to worsen our environment whether they know it or not.</p>
