Every year it grows slightly bigger, hibernate, grows slightly bigger. Eventually one summer it pupates (?) and goes off to mate. It may be a moth.</p>
<p>Oh yes! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaephora_groenlandica" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynaephora_groenlandica</a>. It loves for 10-14 years, all but a few months as a caterpillar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure this is the same caterpillar I saw in the planet earth documentary series, and the unique part about that caterpillar is that it doesn’t hibernate, but actually freezes through at the beginning of winter, and then “defrosts” at the beginning of spring which gives them the advantage of being the first animal to eat the new plants since most (or all) other animals take time to migrate back after winter.
This means that the caterpillar is only really growing/living about half the year, and it takes them 15 years to gather enough energy before they finally turn into a moth, lay eggs and die in one final summer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, metamorphosis is usually timed to avoid predators and maximize resources.</p>
<p>TL;DR if a caterpillar stays a caterpillar too long, its food will go out of bloom, its predators will be in season, and it won't find mates. </p>
<p>Cicadas hatch out of their larval stage every 17 years because 17 is a prime number so a predator that has a life cycle that isn't either 17 or 34 years long is unlikely to be able to adapt to take advantage of the 17 year cicada boom. If it was 16 years, predators with 2, 4, 8, and even 12 year life cycles would match up with cicada years every couple generations. Insects like mayflies, monarchs, and mosquitoes survive on similar concepts.</p>
<p>Edit: theoretically</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is... is this true?</p>
<p>For some reason I'm having a hard time seeing this work out mathematically, like, it's not like predators aren't eating when they're not at a certain part in their life cycle. And, even then, I don't think an entire population usually functions like that, on hard numerical breeding cycles. </p>
<p>I don't doubt you entirely, but a source would be really appreciated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_cicadas" target="_blank">Periodical cicadas</a> in North America have 13- and 17-year cycles, so the prime number thing checks out. And it makes sense that prime numbers would minimize risk of multi-generational disaster, if some of their predators are other bugs with multi-year cycles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's not like predators aren't eating when they're not at a certain part in their life cycle</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're at the part of your life cycle where you're sitting in a cocoon or something, you're probably not killing many cicadas.</p>
<p>It seems there're another theory (see the same link) about why the prime numbers show up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess it's an evolution thing. Natural selection favored cicadas who have the 17 year cycle b/c they were that less likely to run into predators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true - when 17 years are up, so many come out at the same time they saturate the predators. That season is great for predators, but it doesn't stay great because the ir life cycles don't add up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ones that don't stay on the cycle (which happens) get eaten more often and have trouble finding a mate. (No swarm = no protection in numbers &amp; no easy mates.) So, they tend to not pass on their genes as often.</p>
<p>And the 17 year cycle persists. </p></div>		</li>
