			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why it's useful for dating. C14 (in CO2) is produced in the atmosphere, then captured by plants and turned into larger carbon molecules, which then potentially get eaten. Once the carbon is out of the atmosphere, no new C14 is produced and it'll eventually all decay, so you can measure how long ago the carbon was absorbed by a plant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also relevant to OP's question. Carbon 14 dating's usefulness is limited to time in the past where some 14C can be reasonably expected to still be present. You can't use it to date a 3 billion year old sample, because the 14C is effectively all gone by then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention the composition of the atmosphere would be completely different that far back, and even with a much longer half-life, you couldn't be certain of a roughly level percent of Carbon-14 in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>This uncertainty in atmospheric concentrations adds to the noise even going back a few thousand years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know for a fact that it wasn't.  How we know is pretty cool - we can use tree-rings to date stuff back <em>to the year</em>, then date it using C14.  Some years date 'too young' because they seem to have 'too much' C14.  This is from distant memory, but I seem to recall there seems to have been a few events, due to (I think) solar fluctuations that produced a bit too much C14 for a bit.</p>
<p>There are also other effects, like large bodies of water.  Objects from large lakes seem to date a bit young, I think, due to a carbon-reservoir effect.</p>
<p>These are somewhat smallish effects, maybe off by a few hundred years, but they're worth paying attention to.  All dating methods come with an error but some things are not included in this number.  Best thing to do is keep in mind that an 11,000 year date might be 10,5 or 11,5.  Still very helpful, just not as precise as one might like. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently Climate Change is causing a <em>trough</em> in C-14 levels. The fossil fuels we burn have negligible C-14 in them because they are so old. As we burn them, we get CO2 in the atmosphere which again has no C-14. The net result is that the proportion of C-14 in the atmosphere is decreasing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>C14 levels are still double the expected natural occurence, due to an immense spike in C-14 during the 1960's due to nuclear testing. C-14 is generated from nitrogen-14.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Sure. If there's more carbon in the air to interact with, the interaction rate will increase, all else constant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will a measureable spike in C-14 be noticeable in the future from the effects of climate change?</p>

<p>I can't really speculate about that, there are too many variables to consider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on what Lenny said, in a nuclear bomb many many small nuclear reactions happen very rapidly in a chain reaction where the first set of reactions lead to more and more when the emitted particles run into under reacted atoms. In common nuclear reaction there isn't the density of radioactive atoms to allow that to happen. There are also different types of nuclear reactions where different particles are emitted so with different types it may not even be possible to cause a chain reaction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen normally has 7 protons and 7 to 8 neutrons. If it gets hit by a high-energetic proton or neutron, it can lose a proton (and gain a neutron). The nucleus then has 6 protons and 7 to 8 neutrons. In the latter case, it is C-14. There are many possible reactions and C-14 is just one of many things that get produced by cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons split uranium into parts with typically ~45 protons and ~65 neutrons, much larger nuclei, or they fuse hydrogen to helium (2 protons and 2 neutrons), much smaller nuclei. They also release neutrons - if these get captured by C-13, it becomes C-14, so a bit of radioactive carbon is produced by nuclear weapons as well. That makes radiocarbon dating after 1950 difficult.</p></div>		</li>
