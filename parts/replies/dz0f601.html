<p>Yeah I'm kindof disappointed that only the third highest answer (yours) mentions this issue. Pumping fluids is easy. You could slap a centrifugal pump in your chest cavity and be fine in theory, but it's not a complete solution because it comes at the cost of filtering all your blood though a tiny blender. Long term, the damage this does to your blood cells is no bueno. That's why something that mimics the way the heart pumps is preferable, albeit much more difficult to design.</p></div>		</li>

<p>-Chemical engineering student, I know how fluid flow works but don't want to overstate my claim when it comes to bio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turns out the blood vessels need stretch to induce release of nitric oxide at the endothelial level for proper vascular tone (blood pressure). This allows them to withstand changes in pressure, like when you bear down or exercise. Also, the cappilary beds are reliant on pulsatile flow, it's been shown that cappilary beds shunt blood away from them when it's linear flow. Yes, plaque disruption would be less, but placing the pump has a much higher plaque disruption potential than if you just continued life with a pulse. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really an impact on plaque unless you have a very diseased distal ascending aorta or aortic arch, in which case the stroke rate is probably higher (anecdotally).  AVM formation and GI bleeding is suspected to occur as alterations in vWF expression from the linear flow at the capillary level.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a person who used to work with LVADs (bioengineer turned patent attorney) you are generally correct. The fact is that LVADs are awesome for keeping people alive, but not for keeping them healthy. There are dozens of complications, and Cheney's LVAD, which has lasted for a famously long time, is the exception. I mostly worked on pediatric versions, and you dont expect people to be on them for long. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because hemolysis is down the list of potential complications of LVAD behind: ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke,  GI bleeding, and AVMs.   Newer pumps have less hemolysis due to less contact with the impellers of the pump, particularly the HM3 which is mag lev.  If you look at axial flow pumps like the Impella CP hemolysis is more of an issue, but those are short term devices.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>Clearly you're more qualified on this topic than me, but these sound to me like the practical consequences and complications of installing an LVAD. I was interpreting OP's post as asking if there was any inherent advantage to a pulsating pump for circulation as opposed to a continuous flow pump. Since most designs for mechanical pumps we have involve some impeller spinning in a casing, the hemolysis problem came to mind as an inherent flaw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really qualified to answer this in full, but I think the answer is &quot;sortof&quot;. Blood transfusions come with their own risk of complications, so that's never a perfect solution. Also, when you destroy a cell mechanically and not by it's own controlled death (apoptosis), you release a bunch of proteins and compounds that can provoke an immune response and inflammation. Even if you're periodically refreshing your blood supply, you're still going to have to contend with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation.</p>
<p>Would the continuous flow not be beneficial to your blood vessels then? I figured that having the flow constant rather than pulsed would mean that they wouldn't have to go through the strain of constantly expanding/shrinking. But if the continuous flow leads to stiffening, that sounds like it makes them more fragile.</p></div>		</li>
