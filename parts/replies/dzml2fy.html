			<div class="markdown"><p>So before the CMB was redshifted it was visible light? If we existed at that time what would space look like? Would it actually be glowing from that radiation compared to the pitch black we see now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! It was so dense for the first 380,000 years that light couldn't move freely. Eventually the universe expanded enough that there was enough space for light to move freely. It would've looked like a giant white orb for a little while up until that point. From then it started to dim</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can't have ever looked like a white orb because that implies you can be outside looking in, and that there were boundaries, aka the orb surface, so that isn't precisely true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we know the spectral lines of Hydrogen, or the light equivalent of fingerprints of elements, as well as every other element on the periodic table. Galaxies are a big mush of these elements (although mostly H and He). Redshifting causes these spectral lines to shift to the left on the electromagnetic spectrum, or redshift, because if they were for some reason blue, they would be more red in color than what we know they truly are.</p>
<p>So we know where these spectral lines SHOULD be for elements that <strong>aren't</strong> moving away or towards from us, and we compare that to what we see in galaxies. A bit of math tells us how fast it's moving away from us</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, not really. It makes sense, but when you learn more details you find out that there is no &quot;center&quot; to the universe. Expansion is the explanation of why everything is moving away from everything else. Imagine a square. Now make the square bigger. Easy right? Now imagine a grid inside the square: 3 squares by 3 squares, totaling 9 squares like the face of a Rubik's cube. Now make the square bigger. Everything gets bigger proportionally. The universe is not like an un-poppable balloon expanding bigger. It's like a grid that's getting larger, and keeps having more and more empty space </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The metaphor I heard is, imagine a ball. Where on the surface is the center? You'd say the center is on the inside but there is not inside the universe. It's not a perfect image, the universe isn't a ball but like a balls surface, it's infinite in that it has edges from which you can calculate a center, defined as thr point furthest from the edges.</p></div>		</li>
