			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, for the file size, the change is not necessarily very big: an example dataset was 7.7 TB RAW and 5.2 TB AOD. While we do not include all information from RAW to AOD, we also add something, e.g. the results of the reconstruction (e.g. physics objects such as electrons, photons and such).</p>
<p>For the spare capacity, no, we do not yet have space dedicated for all Run 1 data for public access.</p>
<p>The bandwitdh is not easy to estimate, as VM's access the data directly from EOS and not necessrily through portal.</p>
