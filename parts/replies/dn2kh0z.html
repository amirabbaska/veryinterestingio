			<div class="markdown"><p>You still have a weld seam in that case.  The longitudinal seam down the cylinder.  Technically speaking, you could metal brake a rectangle and wind up with one seam as well. I work with pressure vessels and the longitudinal seam is the driving factor behind all our calculations. In storage only, you would have pressure only from the volume of liquid pressing against the container wall. In a circular vessel,  if you looked at a cross section,  the forces would be equalized on the vessel wall. Same amount of force pretty much all the way around. In a rectangular cross section, you'd have an unbalanced force...some pushing out, some pushing down. This makes the corners a &quot;weak&quot; spot because both the forces pushing horizontally and forces pushing vertically are creating a &quot;moment&quot; (engineering term for load stresses and bending) at that corner. Over time, the corner will weaken.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because a rectangle is not uniform like a circle, it is bound to have any one section which is weaker than any other section. This, by comparison, creates a &quot;weak point&quot; in the structure.</p>
