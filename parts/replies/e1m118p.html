			<div class="markdown"><p>just to emphasise the point of &quot;new vs reliable (old)&quot; Tech: Once you send something into orbit, you cannot simply repair it if it breaks on you (speaking of hardware). So to minimize the risk of something breaking, you use parts that are proven to be reliable for a long time. It's a tradeoff of new features vs reliability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, for many things, when it comes to the rigors of space, the newer stuff is much more fragile and prone to breaking. Take computers for example. Most space computers are a decade or two behind simply because the newer stuff is much more susceptible to stuff like radiation due to the smaller components and wiring pathways. The old stuff is more tested, sure, but in many cases its also going to be more robust in absolute terms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty sure the electronic components used are specially hardened to deal with the radiation they’ll experience. I seem to remember when they were doing some Hubble upgrades that even the upgrade was not current gen tech because they had to use something that had already been hardened specifically for that application. You can’t just fly up your gaming rig and put it in there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in automation and that's a serious struggle with our industry. People tend to upgrade every 15 years or so, so our products need to last. People also aren't interested in rolling out new products constantly because there's no need. These things aren't going anywhere for another 15 years at a minimum and we know that our current products work.</p>
<p>So what happens is that we run into controllers from the early 80s all the time and people don't want to upgrade, because it's expensive and it works. It also has extremely limited capabilities, no parts in production and the people who are extremely familiar with them are retiring, leaving a gap in knowledge. </p>
<p>So the automation most people are using limps along with like like .5mb of ram. Our newest products blow everything else put of the water and it's still years behind what could be built. We've gone to 2gb of storage and 1gb of ram, which is huge, but still nowhere near what it could be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. Source: I work in developing space missions.</p>
<p>In general, the technical design is defined in what in space speak is called the &quot;phase B&quot; of the mission, which is 1-2 years after the scientific adoption, or often 10 or more years before launch. Once the design has been finalized, it is frozen, i.e., it is not touched anymore. And it does not need to be touched - the design is done to the scientific specification of the mission, which means that the design with, e.g., older computers, has been shown to be able to reach the scientific goals. During implementation, it is only in very special circumstances that designs are touched again. Examples could be that it has turned out that the technology readiness of certain designs was lower than people thought (e.g., Roscosmos changed the design of the telemetry complex of some space missions after the design had significantly contributed to the Phobos-Grunt disaster). This means that the hardware used at launch is typically 10 or more years out of date. </p>
<p>Note that this is not a problem. Hardware designs for space need to work, and they need to work without any fixes for 10 or more years in an extremely harsh environment. This means that they don't need to include the newest shiny gadgets that are barely tested, they need to use technology that has been proven to withstand the challenges of space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, as someone who is a programmer for a living and is not in your industry, 10 and sometimes even 20, year old equipment is more than powerful enough to run what needs to be run. No point to upgrade your gadgest to the latest and greatest if you're not even going to use the extra computing power... Especially, to your point, if the reliability hasn't been proven yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. And “S” class hardware gets tested like most people would not believe. When they say “radiation hardened” they do not mean “we put some kick ass Oakley sunglasses on it”. They mean “we nuked the hell out of it for a long damn time”. </p>
<p>Specs for stuff that gets into space are very very tough. And for manned missions ? 10x as tough. </p>
<p>Source: designed some systems for an SDI satellite. Worked with guys who worked on the Hubble. Had a buddy who designed some of the electrical system for the ISS.</p></div>		</li>
