			<div class="markdown"><p>Quoting online etymology dictionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pock (n.)  Old English pocc &quot;pustule, blister, ulcer,&quot; from Proto-Germanic <em>puh(h)- &quot;to swell up, blow up&quot; (source also of Middle Dutch pocke, Dutch pok, East Frisian pok, Low German poche, dialectal German Pfoche), from PIE root </em>beu- &quot;to swell, to blow&quot; (see bull (n.2)). Middle French pocque is from Germanic. The plural form, Middle English pokkes, is the source of pox, which since early 14c. has been used in the sense &quot;disease characterized by pocks.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I'm just speculating but I think it likely that in the 14c there was not any concept of particular diseases or infectivity among most folk. The &quot;pox&quot; was just something nasty that seemed to occur randomly, and which could be wished upon those one did not favor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They knew that many diseases were spread by contact with individuals or places where the diseases originated. This is why several cities during the bubonic plague outbreak in the 14th century banned people who had visited places where plague was endemic. Many people at the time also knew that being around a person with plague greatly increased your chances of being infected. They also had a lot of misconceptions about disease, but it is wrong to say that people in the 14th century had no &quot;concept of particular diseases or infectivity&quot; (although they wouldn't have called it that). </p></div>		</li>
