<p>We should focus our energy on saving this planet before making plans to move to one that's already uninhabitable. The way things are going, AGW is going to wipe us out before we are able to find a way to break the laws of physics in order to travel to other star systems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And- what makes you think that there would be no corporate investment in a martian settlement...?</p>
<p>One of the first things that would happen on a colonized mars is mining.</p>
<p>The humans that would be on mars would be the same type of humans as the ones here on earth...because that's where they would be coming from.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's the opposite, this only proves we <em>do</em> have the capacity to terraform a planet, we're already doing it.</p>
<p>If we weren't already inadvertently changing the climate of our own planet, I don't think I'd believe for a second that we're able to do it to another.  </p>
<p>To a certain extent, we just have to do the same thing on mars as we've done here.  Pollute a huge amount and get enough greenhouse gases into the air to cause a runaway greenhouse effect and increase the temperature.  More to it than that of course, but it's a good start and we can get to work on it in the very near future.</p></div>		</li>
