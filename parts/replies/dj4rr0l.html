			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more specific,  the space between stars have an average of 1 hydrogen atom per cubic cm. The space between galaxies has 1 hydrogen atom per cubic meter. For comparison the best vacuum on earth can achieve on the order of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6iameh/what_is_in_the_vacuum_of_outer_space/dj5bj2w/" target="_blank">thousand</a> particles per cubic cm. So space is called a 'vacuum' relative to what we know on earth, but it's far from a true vacuum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the atoms aren't dense enough to be able to absorb any significant number of photons, this is called an optically thin gas.  it's the same concept of why we don't expect any head on collisions between stars when 2 galaxies merge, although the odds are different, the idea is the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the atoms are atomic hydrogen in the ground state (due to low temperatures). The only light that interacts with those atoms is UV light (photon energy of ~11 eV and higher, or wavelengths of ~900 Angstrom or lower). So most light can pass through unhindered.</p>
<p>Of course things aren't that easy and dust, other particles and molecules make things more complicated, but they constitute only a very minor part of the interstellar medium. So while other radiation does interact with those particles, because there are so few, the effect will also be smaller.</p>
<p>Astronomers correct for these effects though when they conduct research. The effect is called reddening. Because red wavelengths are less affected by interstellar material, objects will appear like they emit more red light than we would expect them to, relative to the bluer wavelengths. To fix this, astronomers calculate the approximate reddening they expect based on a number of factors and factor it in into the optical and UV wavelengths by increasing them accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 lightyear = 9.461 x 10^17 cm</p>
<p>Amount of Hydrogen that occupies 1cm^3 at 20°C and normal atmospheric pressure: 4.157 x 10^-05 mol</p>
<p>Amount of Hydrogen that occupies 1cm^3 in space: 1/N_A = (1/6.022 x 10^23) mol</p>
<p>So light travelling 1 ly through the &quot;vacuum&quot; of space will encounter as many molecules as light travelling (9.461 x 10^17) / (4.157 x 10^-05) / (6.022 x 10^23) = 0.0378cm in Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p>So for light coming from Alpha Centauri, that's equivalent to travelling 1.65mm through Earth's atmosphere, and for the Andromeda Galaxy, it's 944 metres. I think it'll be able to punch through that. ;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can do a lot better than a billion particles per cubic cm on earth. Even ultra high vacuum (UHV) is only about a million per cubic cm, and with extreme high vacuum (XHV) we can get that down to about 100/cm^3. Of course the number of experiments where you need XHV over UHV is extremely small, and UHV is good enough for almost anything.  </p>
<p>One of the big problems in this area becomes actually measuring the pressure at such low levels. Typical UHV pressure gauges rely on ionising the gas molecules, and are not reliable below about 10^-10 Pa. XHV systems are moving to using very intense lasers, which scatter from the electrons in the individual atoms and ought to be able to move the lowest pressure measurements from about 10^-10 Pa down to about 10^-14 Pa. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you recommend (layman-accessible) further reading on XHV experiments?  I'd really like to know how they mange to create such a high vacuum, how they contain it, and what sort of experiments require it.</p>
<p>I've heard it said that, like absolute zero, it's &quot;impossible&quot; to attain a perfect vacuum.  Is this accurate, or is it merely a limitation of current technology (or as you said, measurement capability) that limits us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, but what if we examine only the space that doesn't contain the hydrogen atom? </p>
<p>I mean, if in every cubic meter there is 1 atom and you examine/take a sample only of the space between them, will you obtain a true vacuum, then? Space that have really nothing in it?</p>
<p>I can't imagine why would it be impossible, my mind just can't process that situation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but then you can make the same argument about stuff on earth too, if we examine the spaces between the air molecules on earth, surely thats a vacuum too.  at that point you're just debating the definition of what constitutes a vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the gravitational/magnetic effect of the atoms near the &quot;empty space&quot; extend into it, even if the atom itself isn't there. This psuedo-presence fills the space in between atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what /u/wadss said is correct, but I like to expand on the fact that an atom is not located at a single position, but a superposition of all different possible locations, because of quantum mechanics. So it does not make sense to define the area &quot;the atom is not in&quot; because each area has a given chance that the atom is in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the general definition, yes.  </p>
<p>In the pedantic sense from particle astrophysics, no.  At any instant there are ~330 neutrinos and ~450 photons zipping through every cubic centimeter of the known universe.  Though these don't interact with much of anything during travel, including each other and their own type of particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the space between <em>those</em> is truly empty, I suppose.</p>
<p>I don't understand the problem with saying that a space is empty. Is there some law this breaks? Why can't there be empty space? If there wasn't empty space, then wouldn't 100% of the universe be filled with matter of some kind? That would contradict all sorts of things, yes?</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to modern understanding, even if all matter could be removed from a volume, it would still not be &quot;empty&quot; due to vacuum fluctuations, dark energy, transiting gamma rays, cosmic rays, neutrinos, and other phenomena in quantum physics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<p>Also, according to the wave-particle duality light is electromagnetic radiation​, as well as consisting of particles ( photons).</p>
<p>So, while vacuum is defined as a space void of particles that's not really possible in the universe. You can get a space free of &quot;stationary&quot; particles like hydrogen etc, but as you will always have some background radiation (think for example sun light), you will always have photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this. Also, there's atomic particles of other elements scattered about as well. Enough to give space a noticeable odor. Astronauts have likened the scent to a number of <em>interesting</em> things... <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/what-space-smells-like/259903/" target="_blank">Raspberries, seared meat, ozone, burning metal/welding fumes, and rum</a>.
