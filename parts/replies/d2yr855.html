			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget suicide batteries.
This is more an issue with arcade hardware than anything else.  The battery dies, which holds an encryption key or just sometimes calibration data, and the hardware won't boot.</p>
<p>Certain Sega hardware, no sound or won't boot.</p>
<p>Capcom CPS1 QSound hardware won't boot.</p>
<p>Capcom CPS2 hardware, dead battery, dead game.</p>
<p>Capcom CPS3 hardware, dead cartridge battery, dead game.</p>
<p>Konami GX hardware and other hardware they made during the late 90S, dead timekeeper chip, dead game.</p>
<p>Most of these can be repaired, but all behave like a paperweight until the original hardware issue is bypassed or resolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a problem with some industrial equipment, but I've never seen a case where it's a problem unless you let the batteries on the UPC go bad and have a power outage long enough to discharge the system. Proper maintenancr, even if not often enough, usually prevents it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Texas. #2 isn't an issue but #4 definitely is. I used to work at a place that stored electronics and mechanical stuff in a shop... stuff was <em>constantly</em> dying. Finally convinced them to get an A/C area for electronics and &quot;mysterious&quot; electronic deaths stopped. They lived their expected time.</p>
<p>Isn't #5 the main issue for late 90's BSOD? The formula for a capacitor was written wrong or something and that caused all kinds of drama?</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague" target="_blank">The Capacitor Plague</a></p>
<p>Chinese staff defected from their employer and copied an incomplete formula for an electrolyte in an electrolytic capacitor. They sold the design to Taiwanese manufacturers. The Taiwanese manufacturers the built and sold the fault capacitors using this formula.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It breaks when the batteries stop working. </p>
<p>It breaks when it gets shocked like when you rub your socks on the floor. </p>
<p>It breaks when the pieces that it is made of break. </p>
<p>It breaks when it gets too hot. </p>
<p>It breaks when the pieces that make it aren't the correct pieces. </p>
<p>It breaks when the people who make it don't check it to make sure it won't break. </p>
<p>It breaks when the people who make it did not make it in a way so that it wouldn't break. </p></div>		</li>
