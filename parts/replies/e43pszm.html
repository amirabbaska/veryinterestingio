			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all correct, but part of the curve is the Earth moving under the rocket. The closer you get to the equator, the faster you are moving around the earth just by standing on the surface-at the equator it's about 1000 mph. Rockets get launched towards the East to take advantage of this running start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but it takes more energy because you have to compensate for the rotation of the earth which is significant. </p>
<p>Also if you exceed escape velocity (leave earth sphere of influence) in the opposite direction that the earth is circling around the sun you will actually decelerate according to the sun and go toward the center of the solar system. This is how the Parker satellite is aiming for the sun and any other satellites aiming for Venus or Mercury </p></div>		</li>

<p>Get your speed just right for your altitude, and you just stay up, going in circles.</p>

<p>One tiny comment - not for your benefit (since you clearly understand this), but for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>This sentence kind of makes it sound like you match your speed to your altitude, when the better (IMO) way to think about it is that your orbital speed <em>is</em> your orbital altitude. You go higher by accelerating, and lower by decelerating (forward is up, up is back, back is down, down is forward).</p>
<p>Yeah, this is a very tiny, subtle distinction (and again, you're absolutely right in what you said), but it's something that I've seen a lot of people get hung up on (the idea that you get to orbit by going up), so I think it's useful to really emphasize that your angular velocity is your orbit. Altitude only matters insofar as being too low means you'll run into people, mountains, air, or the planet - which will knock you out of orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  You're exactly right. Never really thought about it like this, but it's absolutely correct.</p></div>		</li>
