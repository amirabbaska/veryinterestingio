			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the fragility of human technology over such a colossal timespan, how would such an habitat manage to maintaint itself? I'd expect degradation to act as the most difficult barrier to overcome, especially since I don't think raw materials are going to be abundant in deep space either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah it's crazy to think about generations and generations of people living and dying in service of this ship - would create an entirely new society. But I agree, I have a hard time believing it would ever succeed. Either you run out of resources or some crazy guy blows up the ship after 500 years and everyone's sacrifice is for nothing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if the ship can go fast enough, the ship itself would experience a much smaller flight duration.</p>
<p>To go to another star 1000 light-years away, on Earth we'd have to wait 1000 years for them to get there (and another 1000 years to hear back).  But if the ship was going at .99 times the speed of light, on the ship they'd only experience 141 years.  Or 45 years at .999 times the speed of light.  Or less than 2 months at .99999999 (eight 9's) times the speed of light.</p>
<p>So with enough energy, you can get somewhere as fast as you'd like.   </p></div>		</li>
