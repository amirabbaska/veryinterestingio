			<div class="markdown"><p>A brief search on YouTube for “vacuum welding in situ TEM” returned nothing but that’s not to say it isn’t in a paper somewhere. It would be a very difficult thing to image, as you’d basically have to take a movie at atomic resolution while using a really fancy stage to run both pieces of metal into each other... without shifting your field of view or going out of focus...
I think it’s be great fun to try, but I’d need enough funding to spend a week learning how to use a new TEM stage and trying and failing multiple times!</p></div>		</li>
