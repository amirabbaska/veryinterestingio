			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a Burger King when I was in high school. I remember one day I was working the front counter and took the woman's order. About two minutes later while I'm expediting the order her eyes get wide and she says, &quot;Do you know your cooks aren't wearing gloves!?  That's unsanitary!&quot; </p>
<p>I respond, &quot;Actually, as long as we wash our hands on a regular basis it's sanitary...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a nurse! I know better. We wear gloves! This is disgusting! I'm calling the health department!&quot; She repeats those last few lines at top volume as she's storming out. </p>
<p>I always will remember that because of how bizarre it was. I mean, yeah, nurses wear gloves but comparing nursing to a fast food joint is ridiculous. Got a free Whopper meal out of it though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I wasn't clear. I got the free food because she left. I was about to go on break and my manager, who saw the whole thing, just looked at me and said, &quot;Go on break and yes before you even ask, you can have her food. That b**** was crazy.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always think this when I see posts about bare hands on food. Like with gloves you just keep touching more and more things, but with bare hands (for myself at least) once my hands get sticky or greasy I wash them. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Seems to me bare hands would be cleansed much more often and therefore cleaner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, most of whatever is touched is going into the oven or boiling water anyway.  It's probably more of a risk to the chef than to the diner.</p></div>		</li>
