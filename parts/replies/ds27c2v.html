			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait a second, spicy food is supposed to taste hot? I never knew that, hot peppers never felt &quot;hot&quot; the same way menthol or mint feels &quot;cold&quot;. I don't think it's the same thing. I can feel the pepper burning my tongue and insides but that burn is not same as hot burn. It's more like chemical burn, and heat burn does not feel that way, at least to me, on my mouth or on my skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's not the same sensation, try eating spicy food and then eating hot vs. cold food. The hot food will seem much hotter and like it is burning your tongue, because your brain is telling you that it is even hotter than it is. The cold food will seem relieving, like your mouth was already hot and needed to cool down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought the spiciness of the &quot;hot&quot; peppers made the receptors more sensitive, usually people don't mind cold things as much as they do hot things, so when you eat something cold, it feels colder, when you eat something hot, it feels hotter. I am not sure about sweet, do sugary things taste sweeter? Worth a try next time I try something hot like hot sauce, etc.. </p></div>		</li>
