			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying this is what happened, but often cos use that line for pretense. For example, I was out with a friend who, apparently looked like an escaped from from a distance. Cop pulled us over, used a line like that, and then asked if my friend had tattoos on his arms and strongly encouraged him to roll up his sleeves. He did, didn't have any tats, and the cop explained what she was up to. </p></div>		</li>
