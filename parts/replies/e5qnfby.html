			<div class="markdown"><p>Storm surge affects islands too.  Here's what that looks like:</p>

<p>The height of a storm surge varies a lot depending on the details of the shape of the coastline, so &quot;12 foot surge for a cat 4 hurricane&quot; is only a rough guideline.  It also depends a great deal on the track of the hurricane: since Florence is unlikely to hit at exactly the same spot as Hazel, the storm surge could be less in some areas, much worse in others.  It's a really bad idea to use Hazel as a guide.</p>
<p>However, I can tell you that Hazel did produce storm surge of 12 to 18 feet on the barrier islands of South Carolina, and that simulations of storm surge for a typical Category 4 storm striking Charleston predict flooding of 18-22 feet on the barrier islands.</p>
<p>Once the forecast track is pinned down, detailed storm surge predictions will be sent to civil defense.  Listen to them, and if you're told to evacuate, evacuate.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the topography of the land. A broad, long beach will get a huge storm surge, because there's nowhere else for it to go. A rocky island surrounded by deeper water will fare better, because the surge can flow around the island.</p>
<p>Shallow sand cays, like the Carolina coastline, get hammered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A low lying island in the direct path of the storm is likely to be TOTALLY inundated and it could be MANY days before help could reach them.</p>
<p>Where are they, roughly?     This isn't something you mess with.</p></div>		</li>
