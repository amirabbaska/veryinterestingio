<p>As has been said in this thread, accent is the easiest signifier of class, </p>

<p>I was told there is a &quot;middle class accent&quot; and people can distinguish class based on accent. </p>
<p>Coming from an American perspective, I honestly couldn't tell.  Well, the Scotts I met sounded a bit different.  But among the English in London, I honestly couldn't tell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea to an outsider it’s tough. I’m no linguist so I couldn’t describe the differences but “proper” English is how the Queen/Clare Foy speaks in The Crown series, Stephen Fry, John Cleese. </p>
<p>Working class is how Victoria Beckham, Amy Winehouse, Adele, speaks. </p>
<p>Middle class accent is just not as clipped, aspires to be more like the queens english. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that the Queen's accent is not &quot;proper&quot; English. It's the Queen's English, but I'd say RP is &quot;proper&quot;. &quot;Off&quot; rather than &quot;awf&quot; if you please.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Working class” British accents- and middle, for that matter- vary by region. The Beckham/Adele accent is known as “estuary” and runs from Essex across London and increasingly into Kent and other south-east counties. Liverpudlian working (and middle) class people sound entirely different, as do the Geordies, West Country, Mancs, etc, not to mention the various Welsh and Scottish accents. In general, sounding “local” is taken as a sign of lower class. The more RP you become, the posher you’re considered to be. But it isn’t an infallible rule. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad is Scottish (Glasgow) my mum is from Yorkshire, I grew up in Cambridgeshire and then lived in Staffordshire and now in Cheshire. </p>
<p>Right there I’ve named 5 different accents that have shaped mine. I mostly sound like I’m from Cambridgeshire though. Which is unfortunate as I live in a Northern county so generally people assume that I am posh and middle-class by my accent. </p>
<p>However my mum has a Yorkshire accent which makes people assume she’s stupid as she lives in the South, and to them Northern = uncouth. </p>
<p>Whereas my grandads accent is so strong I can barely understand him.  Uk accents really are more like dialects - there’s lots of slang involved and sometimes we can’t understand each other. </p></div>		</li>
