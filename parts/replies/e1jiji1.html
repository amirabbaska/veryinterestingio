			<div class="markdown"><p>After you eat, your teeth tend to be in a more acidic environment which favors dissolving the enamel on your teeth.  Even though this change is generally relatively small, when you add in a mechanical force (ie toothbrushing), it becomes easier to damage the teeth.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I didn't always do it. Only when I ate what I allowed myself and still were hungry (and going around looking for food). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>cause I eat too fast. I eat less frozen grapes over a longer time than I would eat fresh grapes in a shorter time frame. The same for strawberries. </p>
<p>Of course, less useful in winter. -.-</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but I know that after brushing my teeth I lose the desire to eat anything at all because of how tooth paste changes the way things taste after using it/ the taste it leaves in your mouth afterwords. </p>
<p>Edit: shoutout to my brother who has sworn since we were kids the worst combo you can pair with toothpaste is orange juice (haven't tried it myself so can't confirm) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can solve the taste issue by getting a toothpaste without SLS which is a foaming agent, though it'll now defeat the benefit your describing. For me though it increased the amount of brushing I do because I used to avoid it in the mornings before breakfast.</p></div>		</li>
