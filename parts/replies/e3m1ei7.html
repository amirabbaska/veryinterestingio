			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. My Pop is semi-pro; he retired to Las Vegas, poker is his main source of income but he's got his SSI retirement, too, so he's not living entirely off poker winnings. He's done World Poker Tour a few times (I don't think he's ever made it to the televised part - what you see on TV is basically just the championship finals), but when he's not in a tournament, it's really a job like any other. He goes out several days a week and sits at mid-stakes poker tables for 8-10 hours, playing against tourists and amateurs. End of the day he's usually up about as much as any middle-class worker would be after a day in a cubicle, and through doing this basically every day he's usually got enough points from the casino at 'quitting time' to get his dinner comped and sometimes see a movie or a show for free. Vegas casinos offer a ton of discounts and incentives to locals, too, so he gets a lot of amenities for next to nothing and actually has a pretty comfortable way to spend his 'golden years'.</p>
<p>When he told me this was his plan I thought he was nuts - he'd always played but he wasn't the LeBron James of a poker table or something, I figured he was going to blow everything he had and be flat broke in a year. But it's been several years now and he's still going strong, and is looking at buying a bigger place. So my point is, if he can scratch out a living at it and even be moderately prosperous, the big-time players would have no problem fleecing tourists for a living.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He plays a hundred hours <em>a month</em>- &quot;hundreds of hours&quot; is likely an understatement</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that pro players, especially in larger tournaments, can make informal agreements to share potential winnings. This is called a swap. For example, two players agree to share with each other 5% of their winnings. If one player goes out immediately and the other wins big, the first will at least not be empty handed. This is extremely common. They can also straight up sell shares of their winnings, like $1,000 for 5% of any winnings. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but many pro players are sponsored. The sponsor puts up the tournament entry fee, so the player isn't out any money, and  the player wears the sponsor's logo so it gets exposure. There is also usually some kind of split if the player finishes in the money, depending on the amount.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This doesn't happen anymore.  Even during the boom period when logos/sponsors were prevalent, a very tiny minority of players got their buyins paid for.  The usually deal was &quot;Wear out patch and if you get it on TV we'll give you a grand or two&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a lot of small time loan sharks for the middle tier players. Old dudes with money who like poker will sometimes finance a player say $4000 for 10 $400 tournaments. Anything they win up to $4000 goes to the investor then they take a 50% cut of whatever else they win on top of that. If they come out with only $700 then they owe that investor $3300.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Listen, here's the thing. If you can't spot the sucker in your first half hour at the table, then you are the sucker. Guys around here will tell ya, you play for a living, it's like any other job. You don't gamble, you grind it out. Your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it. Get your money in when you have the best of it. Protect it when you don't. Don't give anything away. That's how I paid my way through half of law school. A true grinder. You see, I learned how to win a little at a time. But finally I've learned this: if you're too careful, your whole life can become a fuckin' grind.</p></div>		</li>
