			<div class="markdown"><p>Likewise.</p>
<p>It's mildly annoying when it happens, but the only time it really bothers me is when I consider the chance of it happening during a Lasik procedure, if I was ever to need that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>seriously i was so worried that i was the only one with this issue. i've done a few drugs and the only other people that have had these experiences are also other friends that have done drugs so i thought it was because of that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so happy there are others like me out there. No one ever believes me when I talk about these eye twitches. Medical professionals always told me that it's not a real thing or to ignore it. </p>
<p>Mine almost always happen when I am reading, but not necessarily staring at a single word or letter for too long, it just interrupts the sentence as I'm reading along. Annoying, but I've become desensitized to it aside from realizing it happened, then instantly moving on with whatever I'm reading. </p>
<p>I'd say it happens to me several times weekly, sometimes several daily if I'm reading a lot. They've been with me since at least as far back as 14 years old (I'm 41 now) that I can distinctly remember, but possibly longer that I don't recall. </p>
<p>They definitely are not these two things everyone keeps commenting that it is. One (saccade) is a constant jitter that is far more minuscule and occurs 24/7, while the other (nystagmus) is a much larger movement that also happens more frequently, even though it isn't a continuous thing. </p>
<p>This is definitely something else, even if it might be related to either of those diagnoses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I very rarely get it too.
The thing is it's for such a short duration( a few miliseconds ) and happens so seldom ( like every few months if even I don't really know because I never cared enough to remember it ) that it's too hard for me to describe it, but I feel it happens when they are a bit confused like I want to look at one direction and in another direction at the same time unconsciousely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this too but quite frequently as it always happens when I'm really focused on something. I tried bringing it up to my doctor but he didn't even understand what I was talking about so I just brushed it off. Sometimes my eyes move so fast it hurts but it lasts less than a second and as soon as it goes left and right I can regain control of my eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! Usually it's when I'm looking very intently at something. It's not something that happens often. I always considered it like a muscle spasm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I just hypothesized something, because I’ve definitely felt this too while reading. So when you’re being spun in a chair and then suddenly stopped you get dizzy, and that’s all due to the eyes trying to lock its focus on one thing but you keep on spinning so it’s not possible. So my hypothesis was that what if it’s caused by your eyes rapidly locking on to each word as you read from left to right. Because especially when you’ve been past an 8th grade reading level your eye can skip from one word to another relatively fast. And probably even faster if you’re reading in your head.</p>
<p>Let me know what you guys think about this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, I get this when I'm trying to focus on visual details of puzzle games, letter or number sequences for example. Lasts 1-2 seconds and I can stop it if I force myself to relax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone seems to get this when they are focused on something. I get random shakes when changing views, mostly when I suddenly look at my fingers close up or if I bend over. (Most recent example, I was doing business on the toilet and bend forward and my eyes shook.)</p>
<p>I also believe I have voluntary nystagmus, as I can voluntarily, on command, shake my eyes horizontally for any duration of time. It resembles exactly the videos seen online and information described in the /r/eyeshakers subreddit.</p>
<p>So maybe these occurences are related for me?</p>
<p>EDIT: got the subreddit wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, along with OP's post, sounds like something very similar that happens to me. Except I can control mine at will, kind of shaking my eyes back and forth very fast. Short bursts, patterns, long extended periods of time, etc... none hurt, and don't seem to have an effect on my vision, I've not had glasses all my life.</p>
<p>I may have to post a video of this, although I'm sure something similar is out there, if someone doesn't get a good ELI5 in here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can do that too! I found some videos of people demonstrating it and it's supposedly called voluntary nystagmus. I've also experienced it involuntarily though. Image those voluntary nystagmus videos but if it only lasted for about a second. That's what it's like when it happens involuntarily. It's really rapid but short lived.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8_js27Xkqnw" target="_blank">video of voluntary nystagmus</a></p>
<p>But again, I've only had it involuntarily happen about 10 times in my life and for about 2 decades now with no other symptoms, no pain, and it hasn't gotten worse. So I really don't think it's anything serious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for this convo link as I can do it too and looked it up long ago. You two should repost this as a main comment as an answer, as I believe like most muscles our eyes sometimes have little spasms, and that's all that OP is referring to, and our ability helps us understand why the human eye sometimes involuntarily moves quickly. Some people, like us, can control our eye muscles better, just like some people can wiggle their noses and ears while I can't.</p>
<p>In fact this is how I learned to control it. I consciously remember noticing my eyes would move for a split second on their own, like OP is describing. In Elementary School I eventually  learned if I unfocused my eyes and opened my eyelids wide, I could create the movement on my own and when done for longer than a split second, my eyes would just shake from side to side. Eventually I learned to control it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. It freaks my wife out, but I have never met anyone who can do that too. At first it happened randomly but then I figured out how to do it at will. For me its almost like starting to go cross eyed a bit until you hit that sweet spot and your eyes start shaking.</p></div>		</li>
