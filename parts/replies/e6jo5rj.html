			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of Tiktaalik, it evolved in freshwater Carboniferous swamps where there was a lot of organic carbon which meant low dissolved oxygen in the water, favouring the development of lungs to utilise oxygen from the air (modern fish routinely gulp air from the surface when deprived of oxygen and lungs evolved from a primitive pouch in the throat that helped with absorbing oxygen from swallowed air), and the environment was cluttered with obstacles; instead of open water it was full of tree roots, mud banks etc, favouring powerful muscular flippers that could push against things instead of being used strictly for swimming and which could be used to help haul the animal across land for short distances, like modern freshwater eels, the northern snakehead, walking catfish, epaulette shark, climbing perch and many other species of fish which can wriggle and crawl across land when they need to in order to reach new bodies of water.  The lack of predators on land at the time also meant that being able to come onto land was a really good trick that gave animals somewhere safe to go and ensured that once animals had a few basic adaptations for terrestrial life, their lineage would capitalise on the advantages and continue to expand, diversify and evolve to take advantage of the newly accessible and unexploited terrestrial niches.</p></div>		</li>
