			<div class="markdown"><p>Set your fridge to be colder. Milk in India, like the pouches sold by Milma will stay good for more than a week without issue if stored properly in a good fridge. Hygiene after your open thr pouch is a major factor is spoiling. Clean hands, clean utensils and clean containers will also affect the longevity.</p></div>		</li>
