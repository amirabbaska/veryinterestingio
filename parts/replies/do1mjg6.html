I think it probably illustrates a fair answer to the question. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pb2XL" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/pb2XL</a>  The trick of it really comes down to being able to judge rotation and practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just the way it hit. What makes it even better is the knives come in sets of three (just some inexpensive Hibben throwers) the sixth one careened of the tree and ended up here. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CTUxY" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/CTUxY</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the difference between a regular knife and a throwing knife? Is there weight differentials in the knife that allows faster and more accurate throwing? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily faster or more accurate, but better balanced. Most knives are either tip or hilt heavy. Throwing knives tend to be balanced toward the middle, maybe a little blade heavy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to balance, durability. If you throw a normal knife much you'll break the handle and possibly break the tip off the blade as well. </p></div>		</li>
