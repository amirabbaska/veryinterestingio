			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on the verge of /r/nostupidquestions here but is there no way to detect a headache in humans without asking them? While the level of pain is subjective can't some sort of scans see the influence of that pain in the head? Basically, I thought headaches were more than simply &quot;pain.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of why we know what a headache looks like on FMRI, for a human, is because I human can tell you when they are having a headache, so you can learn what that pattern looks like.  We don't really have a baseline for insects, nor do I think there is any FMRI type scanning protocols developed for insects.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a scientist using fMRI, I feel obligated to point out here that seducing what the brain &quot;activation&quot; means is not trivial. It could reflect the perception of pain, it could reflect the participant wishing her/his head wasn't hurting, or it could reflect any number of things totally unrelated to the headache itself. In fact, it's almost certainly two or three steps away from the headache since the brain lacks pain receptors! (Not trying to be a Debbie Downer - you correctly indicate how we know when to look for certain things in fMRI. It's just really, really not straightforward what the activity means, even in the simplest of cases.)</p>
<p>EDIT: holy cow, &quot;seducing&quot;...I'm gonna leave it.</p></div>		</li>

Getting them to hold still so I can put the tiny helmet on is the most difficult part. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive lack of sources/in depth knowledge but...
Human headaches are caused by a lot of different things, including pressure along different cavitys/spaces with in the skull, including nasal/sinus, ear, different membranes, different neurons causing hallucinatory pain or different neurons causing real pain, there's so many different types of headache caused by so many different things.</p>
<p>In arachnids/insects their CNS/brain and skulls are so very different, there's so little in common with their anatomy so talking about a 'headache' is just not really possible to identify in most spiders/insects.</p>
<p>Do they feel pain at all is a really complex question, some spiders and insects as a reaction to pain/threat will autoamputate a limb or feeler to get away faster. We know there's a reaction but can that type of reaction be understood as pain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Kinda</em>, there's neuroimaging that is used to attempt to diagnose headache related disorders, and these scans show very specific patterns for certain types of headaches. </p>
<p>More on it here: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825114/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3825114/</a></p>
<p>You have to consider that &quot;headache&quot; is a colloquial term, they can occur because of things like an increase in intracranial pressure, or because of more complex disorders of the various brain regions, as is seen in cluster headaches. </p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AdultEnuretic" target="_blank">AdultEnuretic</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not at all.  They don't respond to what we presume to be painful stimulus in any ways that we can interpret as an expected pain response.  Most insects, if you pull off a leg, they just ignore the missing limb.</p>
<p>Some crabs and lobsters will act as if they're injured, and nurse the injury, or even carry around a severed limb for a time, as though they are distressed by the injury, but insects don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're understating the case that insects feel pain. If you have a quick scan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_invertebrates" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_in_invertebrates</a> there are many experiments that show insects reacting to noxious stimuli in a way that suggests they are actually experiencing pain.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you assume that the ability to feel pain exists because it is of evolutionarily benefit - why <em>wouldn't</em> insects be able to feel pain? Human beings that are born without the ability to feel pain are at risk of damaging themselves during routine tasks... if insects couldn't feel pain they would also be at risk unless their behavior is entirely robotic and instinctual. However, insects have been shown to possess short-term and long-term memory and a certain degree of behavioural plasticity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question that we don't have an answer to. We know what parts of the mammal brain activate during a pain response. Creatures like insects and fish don't have those same brain structures, so we have no real scientific knowledge about their &quot;pain&quot; and how they experience it (or not). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying &quot;we can't prove&quot; something is a really hard statement to prove. I don't think the idea is that <em>we can't prove</em> that plants do or don't feel pain, rather that <em>we haven't yet proved</em> it.</p>
<p>There are very large and active fields right now working on exactly these kinds of problems. We've only begun to scratch the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in one sense it's obviously correct if you interpret it as meaning &quot;we can't currently prove...&quot;</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's difficult to really see how you could ever prove something like this. Perhaps you could undertake the surely much easier task of proving to <em>me</em> that <em>you</em> can feel pain. Your assertion, your howls of &quot;pain&quot; and fMRI scans are not sufficient proof for me, because none of them demonstrate that you have a reasonably similar subjective experience to me.</p>
<p>The simple reason that we accept that other humans experience pain is because they make similar responses to stimuli that we in turn experience as painful. But this is not proof, it is merely quite <em>convincing</em> because humans are all quite similar and therefore we reason that they all experience the world similarly. This does not work at all on organisms with very different biology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, the philosophy of science is such that Science (as in the scientific institutions) never actually considers anything &quot;proven&quot;, only known with varying degrees of evidence.</p>
<p>Could plants feel pain? Not human pain, because they lack a nervous system. Could they experience the plant-equivalent of pain? It's possible, but it's also possible that it's impossible; and you'd have to have evidence to say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants (at least some) DO react to damage (ripping off leaves, bark and that sort of thing) and create chemicals that might &quot;warn&quot; nearby plants and make them change colours or create chemicals so they taste worse. One of those chemicals is what we know as the smell of cut grass.</p></div>		</li>
