			<div class="markdown"><p>The classic game consists of a 4x4 grid.</p>
<p>In a perfect game, you would lose the game by having these blocks in order:</p>
<p>2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(16)</p>
<p>That is the case because you have no moves left, and no duplicate blocks during the loss.</p>
<p>max_score = s(2) + s(4) + ... s(2^(16))</p>
<p>The following recursion is the score that you get by assembling a 2^(x) block:</p>
<p>s(2) = 0</p>
<p>s(2^(x)) = 2 * s(2^(x-1)) + 2^x</p>
<p>That is because you need 2 smaller blocks to get the next block.</p>
<p>By writing a quick python script we get the max score of <del>1835012</del> 3932100. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One mistake: the classic game spawns 2 or 4 blocks randomly, if you get lucky and the last few blocks are all 4s, you can nearly double this score.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, yeah, forgot about that.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>So, the perfect perfect game could have blocks</p>
<p>4, 8, ..., 2^(17)</p>
<p>max_score = s(4) + s(8) + ... + s(2^(17)) - 16 * s(4)</p>
<p>due to the lucky 4s spawning at the last minute</p>
<p>and the max score is 3932100.</p>
<p>EDIT: 4s are spawning at the last minute every time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to the game randomly choosing a tile to place a new 2/4 block, it's mathematically possible, although highly unlikely, for such an end position to be achieved.</p>
<p>Also, as u/zardeh has pointed out, there have been instances of such endings. (unless, of course, the photo is photoshopped, but I don't think so)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, lets make some assumptions to make this easier and get an upper bound:</p>
<p>in 2048, you can only get 2 or 4 tiles, so we'll assume that every tile is a 4 to make our jobs easier. Then there's a good answer on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22803247/in-the-game-2048-what-is-the-biggest-theoretical-tile" target="_blank">stackexchange</a> that makes the math easier, but basically 2^17 is the largest tile, and the best board would be</p>
