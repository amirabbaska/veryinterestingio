<p>If you're wondering about chromium being 4s1 3d5 instead of 4s2 3d4, it's because the energy required to pair two electrons in the same orbital (causing repulsion due to the two negative charges on the electrons) turns out to actually be a greater energy cost than just... having the electron go into the higher energy 3d state.</p>

<p>can you elaborate on this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright so if you set 3 magnets in the table a positive in the middle and two negatives on the outside you have an atom. Now obviously the electrons want to attach to the nucleus but as other comments said blah blah blah angular momentum at a quantum level. Regardless you've got one electron spinning around the nucleus. The second one also wants to move in on that good nucleus booty but the fact that the first one is around means that are repelling eachother. He's saying that the repulsion is so much that the 2nd electron would rather hang out in the D ring than force itself to share the s. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because electrons are both negatively charged, they will repel eachother to some extent. This makes a paired set of electrons slightly more unstable than an unpaired set of electrons, and is one good reason why Hund's rule happens - i.e. fill boxes one at a time before pairing). </p>
<p>Now that rule holds true most of the time because the pairing energy (more unstable = higher energy state) tends to be quite small relative to the big gaps in energy between the different orbitals. But for the 4s and the 3d in chromium, it turns out the orbital energies are really close, and the gap between them is LESS than the pairing energy. So if the electron is looking for the lowest energy state to be in, it's better NOT to pair them up and instead continue on as if the 3d and 4s are all just the same energy, and apply hund's rule.</p>
<p>someone noted before that this seems o only work for chromium and not all the others in the d block before and after it - fair comment. This happens because the energy level of each orbital is HIGHLY dependent on the number of electrons already present in the atom. The energy levels of the orbitals are different for every atom and heck, different for every single number of electrons you might put in that atom. The energies change and the order of the orbital s changes too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading this was a real pleasure. Orbital theory / periodicity etc. is one area of chem I find myself particularly at home in and yet there were a few things you said in this explanation that made genuinely fresh sense of it for me. So thank you. This honestly expanded my understanding of the atom more than anything I encountered during my PhD. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so glad to hear that!</p>
<p>I studied chem myself and got a major in it (now teach it) but one of my little hobbies is looking up the explanations for stuff that nobody really ever explained to me when i went through school. It turns up some absolutely fascinating things. I swear chemistry is one of the deepest subjects there is.</p>
<p>Just the other day I was looking at VSEPR theory with my class and said &quot;this is why there's no such thing as a quadruple bond&quot;... and kinda caught myself and said &quot;better check that...&quot; so we all googled it and turns out there's even QUINTUPLE bonds that have been observed with d block elements. You find the craziest things if you look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>while it is energetically unfavorable to pair two electrons into one orbital, this does not explain what you just wrote. by that logic, scandium would have to be [Ar]3d2 4s1, which it isn't.</p>
<p>the full explanation is some kind of energy gain from the half filled d orbitals in Cr and Mo, or completely filled d orbitals in Cu, Ag, Au, Rg. this gain in energy seems to be higher than the difference between d and s plus the spin pairing energy. there isn't much you can find about that on the internet though. everyone just states that filling half of all orbitals of one kind is favourable. someone in this thread pointed out that there is an entropic gain from this.</p></div>		</li>
