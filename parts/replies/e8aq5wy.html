			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the fuel rods in commercial pressurized water reactors are enriched to something like <del>6%</del> 5% U235, but during operation, the neutrons emitted from it's fission breed a portion of the U238 into fissile plutonium which extends amount of fissile material in the rod. Rod assemblies in the reactor core are rotated from <del>outside</del> inside areas, where the neutron flux is the highest, to the exterior <del>interior</del> of the pile after they have been enhanced with plutonium breeding. Depleted rods are removed from the exterior when it is refueled.  Main point here and I think what OP was asking is that some P239 does get bred in the reactor and extends the fission occuring for power generation; but the process is not extendable to the full potential of breeding all the U238 into fissile material.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the main ideas of a molten salt reactor is online reprocessing. The fuel salt is also the primary coolant, meaning it is pumped around from the core of the reactor to heat exchangers outside the core where the energy is used to turn a turbine. As part of this pumping process, some fuel is diverted to a system that chemically removes fission products dissolved in the fuel.</p>
<p>A molten salt reactor won't have spent fuel, the uranium/thorium/plutonium stays in the reactor until it fissions or until the reactor is decommissioned. Instead, there is a waste stream of fission products, which is already partially broken down into discreet elements by the processes used to remove it from the fuel, meaning that very long lived waste can be separated from stuff that will only take a few months, or a few years, or a few decades before its decayed to stability and no longer radioactive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suppose there is some kind of apocalypse and there is no one left to remove the spent fuel and take care of the reactors. Would the radioactive material just slowly leak out or would it cause a total melt down and kill whatever is left on the planet? Sorry if this sounds totally uneducated, I'm way out of my league here but very curious</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The plants have enough safeguards built in that they would just stop. Nuclear plants are insanely safe, unless you deliberately remove safeties because you think physics can be subverted to the will of the Party (Chernobyl), or you put your emergency backup generators below the maximum recorded wave heights (Fukushima), or you inadvertently cause a loss-of-cooling incident during maintenance due to violation of NRC operating regulations (3 mile island).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reactors are designed to shut themselves down and each is surrounded by a containment structure that encapsulates it. If everyone would disappear, the reactor would eventually shut down for numerous reasons. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to clarify on the first part of this great answer. Legally the enrichment level is 5%, in the US anyways. The core also isn’t one single enrichment level. The outer ring around the core has higher enrichment while the inside has lower. During refueling, fuel assemblies are rotated by moving them into another quadrant of the core and also moving the higher enriched assemblies to the inside. The lowest enriched uranium is removed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it not make more sense for all nuclear plants to operate at that level of enrichment? I realize running a power plant takes more than running a sub but still, if we enriched everything to Navy levels, wouldn't it be better for the nuclear waste situation?</p>
<p>A good analogy would be, we could run poor quality petrol from the 1920's but modern refinement methods allow for higher quality gas and much improved emissions (i.e no lead).</p>
<p>We have the capability, so why not cut down on nuclear waste?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By far the biggest reason is cost.  Enrichment to that level is incredibly expensive.  Enrichment cost is on an exponential scale, to the point where the fuel cost per Megawatt-hour output for the same amount of fuel would be prohibitive.  Enrichment to power plant levels is relatively cheap.  Since commercial plants are meant to be low cost, high enrichment doesn't make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The enrichment process itself produces waste too. It’s achieved by separating out the different isotopes. If you did it for all reactors, a) more expensive, b) you still have to deal with the waste products. It only makes fiscal sense in the context of naval reactors where there are major strategic benefits to be gained from refueling less often. The optimal refueling period is the design life of the vessel in question, so you don’t have to spend all that money cutting it open to replace the fuel - just scrap the whole thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of reason I believe. First is the cost. Getting super high levels of enrichment is very expensive. Navy ships operate at mucb lower powers than civilian power plants, so they don’t burn through as fast. Commercial nuclear plants basically dial up to 100% and leave it that way for months on end. Navy ships will only go 100% in shorts bursts, and cruise at lower powers most of the time.
Also, refueling is costly and slow, and puts a navy ship out of commission for quite time. Having a ship constantly unable to deploy for refueling would weaken the navy’s strategic power. </p>
<p>Thise are just some thoughts though. Not sure how accurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be reused in other reactors but it requires a good amount of processing and treatment. Selling fuel, especially spent fuel, can often be dangerous and not seen as a viable option. People are developing methods of reprocessing spent fuel and allowing them to go through power plants again. However, this likely won’t be widely utilized until our uranium storage gets lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The DUPIC fuel cycle (Direct Use of PWR fuel In CANDU) would allow for spent PWR fuel to be used in a CANDU reactor, requiring only mechanical modification of the fuel bundles so that they fit.</p>
<p>At the end of life, PWR fuel is still some 1.2% U235, which makes it a very rich fuel source for CANDU, which happily operates on natural Uranium.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor" target="_blank">CANDU reactor</a> requires minimal, if any, enrichment so spent fuel which has dropped below the required enrichment level for a <del>pressurized</del> light water reactor could be used.
