<p>If this localized pressure can break the material (either on a  macroscopic scale by separating individual pieces or segments, or on a  molecular/atomic scale by breaking bonds)</p>

<p>This is where I get confused.  Take the specific example of using a kitchen knife to cut an onion.  I am assuming that it is 'cutting' rather than just mushing the onion.  But what is happening at the lower physical scale?   There are some metal atoms moving down and horizontally relative to the onion molecules.  Does it split individual cells open?  I figure that it does, which is how the chemicals get out that cause your eyes to water.  Is the pressure literally inserting the metal atoms between cell wall molecules?  </p>
<p>Also, why does moving the knife make it easier?  I figure that it has something to do with shear forces.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eNiSXyd.gif" target="_blank">This gif might help understand what is happening.</a> In the case of that image it is a blade slicing through steel when viewed through an electron microscope.</p>
<p>It is actually quite interesting what is happening here. As you can see the edge of the blade at this scale is actually surprisingly rounded. There also appears to be a buildup of steel at that rounded tip which doesn't particularly go anywhere despite the material sliding along for either side of it.</p>
<p>I've seen some other gifs where occasionally that little buildup falls one way or the other, but almost immediately some material finds its way into forming a new buildup.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that it takes a lot of force to basically smash apart the granular structure of metal, but on the scale of this image it is easy to focus a small amount of force into a tiny area, thus &quot;becoming&quot; a large amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks to everyone that responded.</p>
<p>The gif is particularly interesting.  The neat part is that if you look closely, you will see that things move in front of the leading edge of the blade.  They are getting pushed out of the way, so at the very small detail level, there is lots of deformation / re-arranging before the material gets separated.  Neat stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is essentially “mushing” the onion, but only along the tiny edge of the knife is being “mushed”.  Thicken that same knife by a 1/4 inch and the “mushed” area becomes more noticeable but you’re still going to cut through the onion</p>
<p>Moving the knife exerts extra force for it to cut through its target easier than it would otherwise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely correct about moving the knife. The shear forces, along the cutting edge and even along the sides of the blade, make a big difference. In fact, basically every material is very susceptible to shear as compared to compression and tension.</p>
<p>As far as what happens at a micro level... You have a metal edge which is actually very blunt at the atomic level, and it is being pushed and slid through the onion. Realistically, breaking atomic bonds is way harder than ripping molecules away from each other, so that's what is mostly happening. Cells also like to stay intact, so if they are cut indirectly enough maybe they are just separated from their neighbors. Otherwise, you are crushing plant cells and ripping apart their internal structures, as you surmised.</p>
<p>Short version is, your ideas were basically correct, maybe just lacking some of the finer details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good question! Well, no material is perfect. Due to imperfections and flaws in the knife, as well as simply repeated use, you slowly deform the edge over time. Maybe it becomes more blunt (the radius of curvature of the edge increases) as metal is ductile, or maybe it chips.</p>
<p>Eventually, as the edge becomes too blunt, you are applying force over a much larger area, reducing the applied pressure that you can achieve. This, combined with the wider &quot;mushed&quot; region, is why people hate cutting tomatoes with a blunt knife. You are either going to mash the whole thing, or if you try to cut a watermelon, it just won't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The edge of the blade is also being subjected to the same pressure as the material it's cutting, so over time the edge will bend or wear away slightly.  This takes a while since the blade is generally harder than the material it's cutting, so it's better able to resist the force, but it still wears every time it gets used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would! Graphene has been used already as a cutting edge (I'll look up the references later, on mobile right now). It is extremely effective, as it is a truly monoatomic edge (mostly - but that's another topic). However, the difficulty of producing and processing graphene means there are too date absolutely no true commercial products using graphene aside from as a marketing gimmick.</p>

<p>Admittedly, it's not really in a controlled way, just sort of floating in solution or at a surface... But, the idea of graphene as an ultra-sharp cutting tool exists, and the idea of a graphene-edged scalpel has been proposed and theorized about for surgical tools and even for things like microtomes.</p></div>		</li>
