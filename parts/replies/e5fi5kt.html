			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how I saw it years ago. But it turns out for an autonomous diagnostic AI to be safe and effective, you need to take into account where it is used and how you acquire the &quot;bunch of medical data&quot;. Because we focus on bringing specialty diagnostics to primary care it needs to work in primary care - with the staff already there.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So that actually required an assistive AI coupled with a robotic camera to help primary care staff that never took images of the eye before take high quality images. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Again because of the environment it will be used in, a probability output was not deemed appropriate, so it actually outputs a clinical decision with a referral recommendation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that's impressive. So you use the robotic system to get good quality data and it actually takes a decision. </p>
<p>Further questions, does is it pose any issues with the doctors in primary care who might feel &quot;overruled&quot; by a machine? A cliche of GP is that they are their own boss and rather like the independence. </p>
<p>Was it hard to get data for the machine learning part?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No issues with primary care docs, because they typically feel uncomfortable making this decion. So they are used to referring these patients to specialists like me - and now they can do it while the patient is with them. That is why I used the term &quot;diagnostic superpowers&quot; for the primary care provider (can be RNPs also).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are different views on the training data for machine learning - we focus on high quality data rather than large quantities of data - though we still used over 1 million samples to train the detectors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very interesting. Many people don’t understand that as a huge part of the role of a specialist is data collection. As a psychiatrist, interacting with the patient is so much of how I get data that I can’t see yet what kind of automation could replace my consults. Maybe a virtual reality approach, at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. The AI system is not perfect, just as doctors are not perfect - as you can see in the discussion section of the paper. SO this will happen.</p>
<p>There are two real-world scenarios in which this can happen with the autonomous diagnostic AI as currently cleared:</p>
<ol>
<li>more than mild diabetic retinopathy is detected by the AI system, patient is therefore referred by primary care to an eye care specialist such as me, who then concludes the retina is normal - this will happen in about 9% of cases given the 90.7% specificity. Patient hears that everything is OK after all and that they need to be reexamined in 12 months (in the US at least)</li>
<li>more than mild diabetic retinopathy is not detected by the AI system, patient is not referred and just happens to be examine by an eye care provider for another reason who discovers diabetic retinopathy. This will happen in about 13% of cases overall, given the 87.2% sensitivity, and we saw this in about 2.6% of cases with the worst disease given the 97.4% sensitivity to vision threatening disease.</li>
