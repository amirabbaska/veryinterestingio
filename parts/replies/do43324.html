<p>Also they can stock up more fat,meaning they can survive longer without food.</p>
<p>This is in sharp contrast to birds, who are constantly losing heat (proportionally more, that is), have almost no fat and spend their days gathering food (rather than sleeping, again, something typical of bigger animals). Therefore every minute of daylight counts.</p></div>		</li>
