			<div class="markdown"><p>As others said, the market is wack right now. Prices have come down in last month but are still high for how long ago they’ve been released. If you’re sitting on a 1060, I think you are just fine. SLI is never good when you’re on a budget. Because if you want more performance, it is cheaper to sell your 1060, and pickup a 1070 or even 1070ti for 320-420 ish depending on how you shop. Otherwise you will spend 250 on another 1060 and not even double your performance when you can spend 400 (less because you would sell your 1060) and more than double. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Some games benefit from SLI, some don't</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two methods used are AFR(alternate frame rendering) and SFR(Split frame rendering). The support for AFR is easy, since one card is handling one frame and the other the next in que. But while this shoots up your raw fps numbers, the frame timing is thrown out a lot. The first frame could have been relatively hard to draw, and the second one quite simple(the explosion on screen is over).</p>
<p>This introduces judder, and is quite noticeable as an undesirable effect. The SFR method splits the single frame into two, and has both GPUs work on one half each. This requires much more developer input in getting it to work, and does eliminate the judder from AFR, but wide support is obviously lacking which means the increased performance is really not worth the cost of the additional card(vs a higher tier single card).</p>
<p>I had hopes for SLI making a comeback as something other than a way for GPU vendors to flog more product with VR, since both eyes need the same frame just slightly angled, meaning you get almost the full benefit of AFR support/performance without the judder.</p></div>		</li>

<p>yeah fucking right. SLI/XFIRE exists to sell extra cards to niche gamers that play it on the handful of games that dont have judder and can actually use all the cards without issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dont forget that not all applications will make use of it.</p>
<p>Some programs dont know how to deal with SLI so they will be buggy, or not run at all. If I remember right you can disable SLI easily enough if you have an issue. If you have 2 cards, it doesn't hurt (unless you find some way to forcibly kill them), and a SLI cable/block usually aren't too expensive.</p></div>		</li>
