<p>Have you ever worked with Mikrotik hardware? They have a setting called &quot;Adaptive noise immunity&quot;. I wonder if this is what the hardware is actually doing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://mainland.cctt.org/istf2008/images/magnetron.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> is what a magnetron looks like. The magnetron generates a broad range of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation (for example, perhaps 2.2-2.6GHz) but the resonant cavities selectively amplify the power of a narrower band of frequencies (maybe 2.35-2.45GHz) using constructive interference and allow those to radiate into the oven.</p>
<p>(disclaimer: exact frequencies are probably different, i just made up those numbers for illustrative purposes)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not quite right. Without the cavities, the magnetron wouldn't generate anything. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically it is a space that resonates at the right frequency, in this case at microwave frequency. The same thing is commonly used in musical instruments like in the space in the body of a guitar, but that's sound waves not em waves but it is a reasonable analogue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a look <a href="http://www.radartutorial.eu/08.transmitters/Magnetron.en.html" target="_blank">here</a>. They show a cutaway view of the device in which you can see the cavities in a circle around the cathode. Electrons fly off the cathode and attempt to reach the anode, but are bent into a circular path by the magnet. This causes them to pass by the mouth of the cavity, which induces it to resonate at its resonant frequency. </p></div>		</li>
