			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I work in a pediatric home health therapy company that employs Occupational therapists (works on fine motor skills) and my wife is a Speech therapist, who also works with OT's all the time on medically fragile kiddos. It's pretty well-established that females have a much more advanced brain development, specifically in cognitive and fine motor skills. It's one of the leading reasons why they believe males are more prone to be born on the autism spectrum than females, and why neonatal cases of females tend to have fewer mental disabilities when they survive. </p>
<p>A few sources, <a href="http://www.healthofchildren.com/E-F/Fine-Motor-Skills.html" target="_blank">The Encyclopedia of Children's Health</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10763428" target="_blank">National Institute of Health</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15151872" target="_blank">US Library of National Medicine</a>. </p>
<p>On a side note: I'm a practicing calligrapher and I love concise handwriting. I'm also male. I cannot tell you how often I hear &quot;your handwriting looks like a girl's!&quot;. I think the top comment hit it on the head when he said it's nature followed by nurture, as neat handwriting is generally perceived as feminine. </p></div>		</li>

<p>When it doubt for future claims, you can always google (or google scholar). it's a good practice if you want to fact check when someone cites 'studies'. People think of google as random stuff/facts, but it's actually really good at finding academic papers as well!</p>
<p>If you're at university, stuff like web of science is good too, but google/google scholar will get you really far, especially in laymen's discussion. You usually can't access the actual papers without a university affiliation(ie, uni wifi/VPN), but you can usually at least find them, and the abstracts will tell you a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's interesting is that we used to be taught to write using the muscles in our shoulder, elbow and forearm in conjunction with our fingers and wrist. So both gross and fine muscle control were used and everyone tended to have pleasing handwriting. Now people aren't taught that and just write mostly using their fingers and wrists. </p></div>		</li>
