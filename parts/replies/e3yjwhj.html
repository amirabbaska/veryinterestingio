<p>we have cross-bred with other human species, namely H. neanderthalis and H. dennisova.</p>

<p>And <em>maybe</em> not just them. There are some unusual properties in modern human DNA that could best be explained by hybridization with yet a THIRD species of Homo, as yet undiscovered.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could you elaborate on those properties? I am also curious if this hypothetical third cross might be pre- <em>sapiens</em>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was discussed in Adam Rutherford's superb book A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived. Don't have it at hand just now. But if you are interested in the genetic history of humans, you should absolutely pick it up.</p>
<p>We know nothing at all about this hypothetical other Homo, but a reasonable guess is that they would have come from the same tree as the Neanderthals and the Denisovians. Just like those two, the DNA of people who stayed in Africa doesn't show the signature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the detailed literature citations, I will enjoy reading these.   Be sure to read the link I added to my OP about newly described fertile hybrid behavior for many generations in the Guenon monkeys, much closer genetically to hominids than orchids.   </p>
<p>Any comments by professional Paleontologists working in the field of hominid evolution ?</p></div>		</li>
