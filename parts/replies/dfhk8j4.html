</blockquote>
<p>Those would both be correct.  Matter and energy would attempt to convert itself to the new normal.  In the process, any spaceship would become unstable and living beings would die.</p>
<p>For instance, if a bubble boundary were to have a difference in Higgs Field energy density, then this could have an effect on the behavior of electrons.  This is because electrons have a low Weak charge, and this charge's interaction with the Higg's Field grants the electron its mass.</p>
<p>Simple gasses and liquids would come out mostly ok.  But materials with complicated molecular interactions like ice, alloys and other solids would really change.  Ice might contract or expand more than usual.  Alloys would could have greatly different properties on the new side of the bubble (turning from strong to brittle or vice versa).  Life supporting molecules like DNA could break down, killing the being with the DNA.  And solids could develop cracks, which could leak vital life support gasses.</p>
<p>And this is only one example.  I just used the Higgs Field example because a bubble of collapsing Higgs Field looks like a bubble of another universe.  This particular problem is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijFm6DxNVyI" target="_blank">the False Vacuum</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought the electron had the same weak charge as the neutrino, which would mean most of the electron's mass comes from its electric charge. Is that not the case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can never observe anything in another bubble.  They are too far away.  We can't even observe all of our bubble.  Probably we can't observe more than some miniscule fraction of our bubble.  Also the bubble continues to expand, just much more slowly than inflating regions do.</p></div>		</li>
