<p>Our current laws of gravity are not just empirically curve-fitted to match observations. They &quot;fall out&quot; inevitably once certain very high-level and abstract assumptions about the nature of space-time are made. No-one has proposed any alternative theory that matches observations at least as well as Einsteinian general relativity while also having this property of &quot;looking like&quot; a legitimate fundamental theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not true. There are many well-studied modifications of GR which satisfy all the nice properties that GR does, such as diffeomorphism invariance and being free of ghosts and so on. </p>

<p>Many of them can't yet be observationally distinguished from ordinary GR, since we can only constrain gravity very well on solar system scales. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm out of my depth here. Can any of these theories be made to give MOND-like predictions? The essential point for my purposes is that (as I understood it) you can't get MOND out of General Relativity without sacrificing its theoretical elegance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TeVeS is such a modification that yields MOND. It has some observational problems, though, unlike other modified gravity theories. Verlinde's new emergent gravity model also reproduces MOND in some limit, but it is a more complicated story than a classical field theory like modified GR. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So we are really not postulating anything crazy with dark matter.</p>

<p>Except for the part where no-one has ever demonstrated that it exists.  No mass occlusions of bright bodies, nothing to point to as a clump in the sky and say 'there is your dark matter'.  All we can say is that our model says it should exist.  If the visible universe is 4% ordinary matter and 23% dark matter, can you really tell me that 'we can't find it' is a satisfactory answer?  Why are we not re-examining our model instead?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that we are postulating a form of matter that's fully compatible with the accepted, very-well-supported Standard Model that defines what forms of matter are allowed to exist. If you see deep-sea whales with scars on their hides that look like they came from squid beaks larger than those of any known squid, you are justified in postulating that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_squid" target="_blank">there's a species of squid out there larger than any we've actually dredged up and measured yet.</a></p>
<p>For some reason when it comes to dark matter there's a kind of grassroots campaign to insist that this is different, and dark matter is actually a shaky, handwavey hypothesis made by some cowardly physicists trying to save their obsolete theories from true progress. No, I'm sorry, it isn't. Just like &quot;turns out squids can be bigger than we realized,&quot; &quot;turns out there's a lot of EM-invisible matter floating around galaxies&quot; is much more of a <a href="https://antimatter.ie/2011/02/11/kuhn-vs-popper-the-philosophy-of-lakatos/" target="_blank">normal adjustment to the variable assumptions that surround our core theories</a> than a plausible sign that the core theories are in crisis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're saying, but to extend your oceanic analogy a bit it would be like saying that the sea was 1/6th whales and water, 5/6ths squid, and not being able to see the squid.  So... wheeeres' the squid?  </p>
<p>I have a college-level understanding of the scientific method, so I get that a lot of more specialized people than myself have put a lot of thought into this.  And I understand that the math is leading them in a particular direction.  But all the same, when we can't find something that is five times bigger than our whole visible universe, at some point skepticisim must creep in.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Dark matter can only interact with normal matter through gravity out of all the 4 forces, which means it can't interact through EM waves (light). Therefore it literally can't block/reflect/absorb light. All light would just pass through it like it's not there. </p>

<p>That is the current best theory that the majority believe should be the case, based on all current observations. Others have formulated their own theories to explain gravity AND include the 'dark matter' data discrepancy. However, a theory of gravity must be able to match all data in every other phenomenon, not just galaxy's rotation. So far, no theories have been more successful in doing that than Einstein's GR, and all of them would require much more unproven assumptions to be made. So the best model we now have is GR + dark matter.</p></div>		</li>
