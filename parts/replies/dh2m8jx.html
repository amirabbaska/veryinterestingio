			<div class="markdown"><p>There are dozens of comments that were deleted automatically and I saw a bunch that were gotten rid of for inappropriate things. That's what I meant. I was and still am searching for some science here and I was happy he linked to that. I didn't see it in search.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted that two hours after OP posed the question. All other answers up to that point were garbage, so thought I'd help out with a link to an old thread... Not trying to claim I did much, certainly not sure why people up voted me, but thought it was likely OP had missed the previous thread </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tbf that <del>article</del> link mentions that tensing the muscles increases the sensation when climaxing, but i find it to be the opposite. tensing the muscles gets me <em>there</em> faster, but if i keep relaxed the entire time...much better feeling when i'm, you know, <em>there</em>. it's like how a meal tastes so much better when you are starving, versus eating a meal after snacking throughout the day. or something like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to sources there, which are generally good especially the guy who was given gold,  try this:</p>
<p>Hold one foot off the floor and rotate your ankle clockwise, keep rotating as such throughout.</p>
<p>Now raise your hand in the air, on the same side as your rotating foot.</p>
<p>Got it? Now draw a &quot;6&quot; in the air with your hand: what happened to your foot?</p>
<hr />
<p>The nervous system isn't like lights in your house, you don't flip a switch and send power to that one socket activating one function. </p>
<p>The nervous system is more like a game of pool: An initial impulse travels through the system, causing subsequent impulses in the area, leading to a state-change in the system.  The impulses and changes may seem random, but they are infact largely predictable and are entirely dependent on the initial impulse and system state. While the goal of the initial impulse might be intended to only cause one reaction (generating muscle tension in the genitals to prepare for ejaculation) most of the time there is some co-activation of  ancillary impulses along the path of travel of the original impulse, leading to plural and seemingly arbitrary outcomes at times (like tension in the upper abdomen and down into the legs.)</p></div>		</li>
