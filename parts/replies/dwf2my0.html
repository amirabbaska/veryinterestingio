			<div class="markdown"><p>But I don't get about this is why one cannot simply start  breathing superfast or trying to keep the air pressed in his lungs.. Why would the heart rate need to increase?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cells in our body need a certain amount of oxygen/minute to function properly. Increasing heart rate increases the blood flow/minute to these cells. If you increase the blood flow and keep the amount of oxygen entering the bloodstream the same (for each heart beat), then the overall amount of oxygen delivered to the cells increases. </p>
<p>Whenever I visit high altitude locations I notice that my breathes are involuntarily deeper and sometimes faster (depending on activity) than at normal altitude. All 3 things (depth of breath, breath rate, and heart rate) help more oxygen enter the bloodstream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to deal with partial pressure in the lungs and the affinity (how well one thing bonds to another). As you increase altitude, partial pressure of O2 decreases, yet the affinity of O2 when attached to red blood cells stays the same. With lower partial pressure, comes lower affinity for O2. Now the amount unloaded into the cells is the same, but the amount of O2 taken in by the lungs is vastly smaller. Luckily, our body has a molecule (2,3-BPG) that reduces the affinity when offloading O2 into cells. So it just shifts everything: lungs take in less O2 but red blood cells are able to let go of more, therefore the net difference is the same as if you were at sea level. This is why athletes train at high altitude, they increase their BPG levels and then go back down to sea level to perform. They get more O2, and release more into the cells: a win win and a nice advantage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but from fitness experience I think your body as a system has to be able to handle the stress, and as a system it needs to learn how to do it. In other words, even though we might narrow it down to needing oxygen, in order to take in more oxygen efficiently, many different sub-systems have to be in good shape, your lungs, your blood, your muscles, each with its respective role in maximizing the oxygen in the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if someone an please clarify. If i go to higher altitude places. While my body acclimates then i would temporarily produce mkre red blood cells? This is during acclimatise period only tho? Or would it continue for say a month/year?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check was I said above in another comment; the heart rate should only be until your RBCs are able to offload more O2 to meet the required net loss of O2. So it should only happen during the acclimation until you are acclimated and your BPG levels are higher. </p></div>		</li>
