<p>also wouldn't be surprised if you got people to take benzodiazepines or another depressant and saw similar effects.</p>

<p>I have ADD and I've been taking adderall for about five years now and  a year ago I began treatment for my anxiety. My doctor recommended fluoxetine and so I began at a low dose. However, I noticed a significant change in my ability to process information or use my executive functioning once my adderall began to wear off. It wasn't the normal downer from my medication, it felt different. We adjusted my adderall to counteract this but I've been wondering since if my two medications interact with each other.</p>
<p>I didn't find much when I researched but I didn't try that hard tbh. But your response framed GABA as the reason behind this and I was like oh duh. Google searched that and found an interesting <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20707986" target="_blank">article,</a> </p>
<p>Anyways yeah it helped me feel a lil less crazy. Good luck on the MCAT! I'm studying for the GRE now to get my doctorate in psych (idk what specifically bc my life is upside down currently). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluoxetine..that's an antidepressant? I'll Google to make sure. Yeah, an SSRI? Those have some funky effects on people. A friend of mine got on it and said she felt &quot;numb and dead&quot; inside...like she couldn't feel anything. They've done cool studies with monkeys who showed lower empathy and higher dominance when on SSRIs. Crazy stuff. Brain chemistry reductive but serious! </p>
<p>My best friend from college is also on ADHD medicine and fluoxetine though! lol coincidence. </p>
<p>I wonder if increased serotonin has a role in memory and attention. It certainly has something to do with mood. </p>
<p>You'll kill it on the GRE! Make sure your quant is decent, but for psych PhDs they're not too hard on you as long as they know you can make it through some stats classes and your research is good. You must have like a 4.0 though! My friend going to grad school in Psych gave me the down low. You smartypants. </p>
<p>Thank you for the luck! It's quite a beast of an exam, but I've almost conquered it (just need to get up to the 80th%-ile). :):) </p>
<p>If you ever want to talk about like how life is upside down I also totally feel that </p>
<p>Being in your 20's is weird/hard...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So brief story short.  I was diagnosed with Manic depression (Bipolar 1 before it was bipolar 1) in 1995 and then &quot;upgraded&quot; to Bipolar 1 with Psychosis in 2008.  Last year, I was finally able to get a proper re-diagnosis.   One of the techniques my psychologist had me do was the &quot;sit there and think about nothing&quot; exercise.   When he asked if I could do it,  I said &quot;yeah. that is easy.  I can go for hours thinking of absolutely nothing.&quot;   Needless to say my diagnosis changed quick from there. </p>
<p>He also believes I have a high level of ADHD and I see someone to get the meds I need.  Problem is, the prescriber can't quite figure it out.  Adderall works fantastic around 30mg, but my heart sits at 110+bpm 24hrs.  Ritalin does next to nothing so I have to head back in to discuss further types.  Happen to have a suggestion in this area?  I am willing to PM you more details of my diagnosis if that helps.</p>
<p>Side note:  I take muscle relaxers for my legs which will have surgery in the next few months and noticed that 10-20mg of Adderall + 10mg muscle relaxers keep my heart rate between 80-99bpm.  I am not finding too much about long term muscle relaxer use though, so I don't want to just go with it to regulate me heart rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off thank you for sharing your story. I mean that. It's part of why I want to go into medicine -- to help people with my basic science and clinical knowhow (which I'll have by the time I get out of medical school). </p>
<p>Honestly, studying is lonely and sometimes tiring but the trust you just showed in me in sharing your story strikes a chord with me. It will keep me going when I want to stop! Thank you for that. </p>
<p>This being said <em>I am not a medical professional and this is not medical advice</em>. I'm a Pre-Med student, and the reason I feel comfortable answering this question with advice is because I have personal experience with family members and bipolar 1 and 2...plus my best friend from college is ADHD and is on the depressive side of things. </p>
<p>So take this as anecdotal advice -- from a patient to a patient. Bring it up to your doc, but it by no means is a well informed evaluation of you...it's just what's worked for either my friends or me. </p>
<p>First off, my best friend is on Vyvanse. That's slow release and contrasts with Ritalin and Adderall in that respect..maybe that could work for you instead? My sister has Bipolar 2 and is on Vyvanse and it all works like a dream for her. Took a while to get the amounts right, but they got there and now she's good. Be patient because it's important to go slow with amphetamines and a propensity toward a mood disorder! You don't want to be thrown into a manic or hypomanic phase. </p>
<p>Secondly, I am prescribed Clonidine off label for anxiety. In all truth it is used as an alpha-2 agonist  for high blood pressure. It's also used for kids who have ADD/ADHD to help calm them down for bedtime. Maybe this could help the heart rate/blood pressure situation? Especially if your heart rate is a little naturally high due to anxiety. </p>
<p>I'm really happy you're finding treatment that works in some measure for you -- it's amazing cause it's like...wow that's how everybody else lives? That's so easy! Funny brain chemistry can be challenging sometimes... :) </p>
<p>Thank you also again for inspiring me to work harder and to achieve my goals! </p>
<p>Feel free to PM me if you want to ask about some of my experiences with the medicine itself. But again -- I'm 100% not a doc! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are most welcome!  I am 100% not Bipolar in any respects thanks to my new psychologist and his willingness to start from scratch.  </p>
<p>Vyvance is one of the ones we are considering going with next.  Hopefully that won't cause as many side effects as adderrall has.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I did some googling based off of someone the things you mentioned and found this.  What is your opinion on things like food coloring and asoartame?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off I'm not a doctor and this is definitely not medical advice -- just some thoughts from an online stranger. </p>
<p>I have read that food coloring (particularly red if I recall?) can kind of make some kids hyper. But then a lot of artificially red colored things are also really sugary? </p>
<p>I've read that aspartame can give some people headaches. </p>
<p>It's honestly like...nutrition is the hardest thing to say yes or no to. It's all dependent on your own body's physiology, and you should go with what feels best for you (but also not just what tastes best to you, lol!). As a plus if you avoid food coloring and aspartame you are also avoiding sugar foods and soda (where the aspartame is used as a way to preserve the food...it's also found in chewing gum so you knock some sugar out of your diet by skipping that too!).  </p>
<p>As far as Oh does this cause cancer does that...cancer is a bitchy disease that has a lot of things go wrong on a molecular level in order to happen. There's singular cause stuff that causes rapid mutations in your DNA -- stuff like smoking or laying out in the sun all the time -- so rapid that that your DNA can't repair itself. But a lot of cancer has no single discernible lifestyle factor that causes it. Ultimately life will end up killing us all. :) </p>
<p><em>I want to emphasize</em> lastly that I am not a medical professional -- just a Pre-Med student interested in health/nutrition who is applying to medical school next year. Definitely hit up your healthcare provider if you have questions. </p>
<p>Even if you find some studies you want to ask your doc about -- they're trained to evaluate clinical studies! So bring it in. </p></div>		</li>
