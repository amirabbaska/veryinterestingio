			<div class="markdown"><p>To take the analogy a little further:</p>
<p>You start to worry that Mom and Dad might ask whose lawns you are mowing. So you make a deal with your friends at school: you'll give them two bucks a week if they <em>say</em> they hired you to mow their lawns for ten. Maybe you even make a show of it, giving them the $10 bill of porn mag money just so that they can hand it back to you in front of your parents.</p>
<p>In real life, maybe the front is a restaurant where your cronies pay their tab in your own dirty cash. Maybe it's an auto repair shop where your friends get charged $1000 to blow out a dent that never existed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dad knows, he frequently uses his collection, and as an avid collector, he saw catalogued articles go missing.  Only problem is his porn stash is also dirty so he can't let your mum know about the missing mags. So you have pay him off as well, and start paying rent for the lawn mower and mowing the lawn at home.  At least that's how my dad started making me mow the lawns.</p></div>		</li>
