			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an American hair straightener that was plugged into an Australian outlet with an adaptor that does convert from 240V to 110V (tested it on other devices). This hair straighter blew up. I later checked the manual and it said never to use it in other counties outside America even with an adaptor. How does that work? Are certain devices affected by another property of electricity aside from voltage that an adaptor doesn't alter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it unlikely you had an adapter that could convert 1000W from 240V to 120V, that would be an extremely large and heavy adapter</p>
<p>What other devices did you test with? Most devices that convert to DC(phone/laptop chargers and small devices) don't care about the incoming voltage so they can give you the false impression that it is working. If it wasn't lowering the voltage then your 1000W hair straightener would become a 4000W toaster</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I meant to say it was a curling iron that blew up. Things that did work properly were hair straightener, phone, laptop, and I think maybe even the hair dryer.
So how can you tell in future in advance which devices will blow up with which adaptors before they do indeed blow up? Do you know of a guide to follow that I can compare products and adaptors against?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting aside: electric water kettles are more popular in Europe for heating water because the higher voltage allows the water to heat more than twice as fast. Only takes a couple of minuets to boil water. Over in America they take forever so most people just heat it up on the stove.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is they key to it. You could never take America to 240-volt mains because we are used to electricity that won't kill you if you touch it. Many males would die from mistakes while puttering.</p>
<p>Meanwhile you could never take Europe to 120-volt mains because they could not get their precious kettles to boil during a commercial break and their civilization would just break down entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the amperage that kills, not the voltage. 110V is easily enough to push a few mils of current through someone's body and kill them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see you use the northern gas supply interface.  Here in Albuquerque we can get almost double the btus out of the standard stove nozzle 2/2 to iugas line pressures and the variable throttling at public-residence junctions.  Couple this with the higher altitude and we can boil our water at least as fast as the Europeans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, MOST modern electronic devices can run on both 110-230v 50/60hz thanks to the adaptors being able to run on either power.  All they need is a plug changer.  </p>
