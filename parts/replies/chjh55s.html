			<div class="markdown"><p>In that article it says that if you peel away the skin of a silkworm, you can see rudimentary wing structures underneath. How does that jive with the whole insect melting into a slurry theory? Are silkworms different, or do the wings not dissolve, our what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading a while ago that insects evolved metamorphosis so that adults and young of the same species would not need to compete over the same resources. I will post the source if I find it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also gave them an edge over insects that only go through incomplete metamorphosis. The latter are mostly just miniature versions of adults and so they have to make compromises in each stage of its life. But caterpillars are masters of eating and butterflies are masters of reproducing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually three major groups of metamorphosis. Ametabolous, hemimetabolous, holometabolous. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ametabolous: Insects hatch from eggs as miniature versions of adults and simply molt from one instar to the next. An instar being each &quot;size&quot; stage of the process. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hemimetabolous: Insects hatch from eggs as <strong>near</strong> miniature versions of adults however don't develop wings or genitalia until adults. Instead of each molt stage being called instars, these juveniles are called nymphs!</p>
</li>
<li>Holometabolous: Insects hatch from eggs as grub like larvae. These soft bodied worm-like young can grow without molting until they reach an appropriate size. Then they typically cocoon up and metamorph in to hard bodies adults. </li>
</ul>
<p>What might not be obvious is that the first two types of metamorphosis have hard bodied (or chitonous) exoskeletons during all stages of development, making molting necessary for growth. Essentially, once these little guys get too big for their &quot;skin&quot; they cut it off, swell up as big as they can (with water), form a new &quot;skin&quot; then go about their day. A little bit bigger. </p>
<p>Though this is a &quot;just-so&quot; story, researchers believe that these three forms of metamorphosis may recapitulate the evolutionary history of metamorphosis in arthropods. Initially, molting was necessary because of the evolution of an exoskeleton. Then arthropods saved up energy for fancy things like wings or genitalia until later life stages. Finally, they did away with a hard bodied juvenile phases and reduced competition between offspring and adults by having very different life stages. </p>
<p>Why the switch from hard to soft bodied young? Maybe the adults became so complex that it became advantageous to reduce the number of instar/nymph stages, eventually reducing to a single larval stage? The microevolutionary steps are widely speculative in most cases. </p>
<p>I'm aware some of the explanation is anthropomorphizing the concepts, but I figured it's an easier way to conceptualize the process. </p>
<p>And some of my sources are behind a paywall, but <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/insect-metamorphosis-evolution/" target="_blank">here's a great article</a> that covers the major concepts!</p>
