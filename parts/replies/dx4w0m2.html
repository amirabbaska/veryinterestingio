			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  Plasma isn't a phase in the sense that solids, liquids, or gases are phases.  The boundary between gas and plasma is fuzzy and vague, and plasma doesn't really fall nicely on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram" target="_blank">phase diagram</a> at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically on a phase diagram plasma would be a huge smear, not a point?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The borders for non-plasma phase changes on phase diagrams can be considered arbitrarily thin, essentially mathematical lines, rather than drawn ones (which have the thickness of the drawing implement).  The border of a plasma region on a phase diagram would be thick, even fuzzy, because the change of state isn't very precise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no sharp, discontinuous transition in the ionization of a gas when you heat it up. There is a continuous curve that goes from zero ionization at T = 0 to full ionization at T = infinity.</p>
<p>The transition between gas and plasma is not like the first-order phase transitions between solid, liquid, and gas, where there is a discontinuous jump in entropy (and a latent heat) across the transition.</p>
<p>There’s no coexistence curve or triple point with plasmas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. A gas can be partially ionised. The hotter particles are ionised but the cooler particles aren’t. The ‘temperature’ is always a spread of energies because the particles are constantly colliding and exchanging energy. As the gas gets hotter you’re basically increasing the proportion of molecules that are ionised. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that almost like an anti-plasma, as in the electrons gets crushed into the nuclei rather than thrown free from them?</p>
<p>(please don't punish me too hard for this question, IANAPhysicist, just asking)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>most plasmas aren't at thermal equilibrium.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very true for terrestrial plasmas.  It is much less true for astrophysical plasmas, mostly because of the much longer timescales and much greater size.</p></div>		</li>
