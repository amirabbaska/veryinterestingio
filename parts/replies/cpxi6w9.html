			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't make any sense though. The particle showed an inference pattern, if they 'ticked into a specific future' why are they still seeing all the different outcomes of those futures when the photo hits the screen? Should they not just see the photo hit one location? </p></div>		</li>

<p>When they measure which slit the photon went through, they do just see one location. When they don't measure, they see the interference pattern. </p>
<p>So the act of human observation changes the experiment, hence the conundrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so confused by the &quot;human observation&quot; aspect. Has the experiment been reproduced with a trained animal observing the path of the particle to prove it's not just human observation? What about a camera filming the results?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are &quot;we&quot; sure the act of measuring did not physically alter the experiement? i.e. you can't &quot;see&quot; an experiment until you fire protons at it.  So we much be firing something somewhere to measure, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it not be that that our measuring equipment (that measures which slit the photon went through) somehow changes the behavior of the photons?</p>
<p>What I mean is that the cause has something to due with the equipment but not the mere act of observing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just it though. When a photon beam is passed through a double slit without measuring what side it goes through you get an interference pattern. However, when you set up the experiment exactly the <strong>same</strong> with the only difference being that you observe which side the photon goes through, <strong>no</strong> interference pattern occurs, instead it is just a regular distribution of particles as if they were not waves at all. Relating back to your question, when the photon is observed in the double slit experiment, it is bound to one possible outcome on the screen behind, instead of the range of possibilities that could have occurred had it not been observed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interference pattern is caused by the electron behaving as a wave; it's not the accumulation of all the different positions the electron would hit were it behaving as a particle. As a classical particle, there are only two bands the electron could hit the screen along. (Imagine orientating the slits parallel to the ground and dropping marbles through them; they'll fall straight down in line with the slit they dropped through.) Interference patterns happen when waves flow through two slits. There are a lot more bands, most in positions a classical particle moving straight towards the screen wouldn't be able to reach. When the electron passes through unobserved, it behaves as a wave, flowing through both slits simultaneously, interfering with itself and creating the many interference pattern bands. When it is observed, it behaves as a classical particle and goes through one of the slits, hitting the screen at a single point each time.</p></div>		</li>
