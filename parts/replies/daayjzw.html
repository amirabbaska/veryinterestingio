			<div class="markdown"><p>37 years ago I coded assembly routines to precisely tune their radio interference to musical frequencies and recorded music compositions with the result. I wanted a synthesizer but couldn't begin to afford one, so I made do with home computers, which I had less trouble getting my hands on. Still never got my first synth until the mid 1990s.</p></div>		</li>
