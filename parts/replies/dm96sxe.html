<p>Order doesn't matter here, though. If you pull out {red,red,red,red,red,green,green,green,green,green} or {red,green,red,green,red,green,red,green,red,green}, you're still going to think the box is about 50% red and 50% green. C(1000,100) is still a very big number, but it's not as big as the number you gave. Specifically, it's 63850511926305130236698511142022274281262900693853331776286816221524376994750901948920974351797699894319420811933446197797592213357065053890.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer for this question.  You take an area or volume and catalog what is inside of it.  Then you repeat this measurement over new areas.  From this you can determine how often you find a new species and then how many more you are likely to discover if you counted everything in the world.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC93182/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC93182/</a> Gives a good technical description of how this process works for bacteria and references ones of animals.</p></div>		</li>
