			<div class="markdown"><p>You were doing so well until you went on a bizarre anti-passenger-train screed. It's hilarious to read, given that passenger train service is the defacto mode of medium-distance transportation on almost every continent except North America. Every other country recognizes the absurdity of pushing individual motor vehicle usage over public transit...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trains are not cost effective for passenger travel because the maintenance costs are astronomical </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amtrak operates an entire national train network for a few billion dollars a year in government funds on top of the tickets. The maintenance costs are not &quot;astronomical&quot; - certainly not compared to passenger flights where maintenance requirements and regulations are bountiful, and the requirements on materials and workmanship incredible.</p>
<p>Trains are very much durable goods and excellent investments for governments. Railways also require a fraction of the maintenance even a small highway does - and much of that maintenance is automated.</p>
<p>A train line? All you need is a platform and a parking lot, and it's completely scalable; a small town doesn't need an expensive station. You don't even need that; there are lines in Alaska where you just tell the conductor where you want to get off - &quot;right after the bridge on the West River.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and commuter needs are at odds, too many stops, and it's not time effective and will drive away customers, too few stops and you won't have enough customers to be cost effective. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commuter needs are met by commuter trains/lines; my city is serviced by something like 6-8 branches which run trains in both directions every half hour to 45 minutes on peak commuter times, and then every hour on non-peak weekdays, and 2-3 hours on off-peak weekend times. There are plenty of lines that have express, long distance, and commuter rail service working together, on the same or separate lines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High speed trains are ever more so expensive and dangerous. In an airplane at 640 mph, any sort of bump, and you have miles space to gracefully dampen it. Any bump in a bullet train, and no matter what, it has to remain on it's rails,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the oddest &quot;anti-train&quot; argument I've ever heard; you're cherry-picking, acting like planes can just fly around willy-nilly. In an airplane, you need incredibly precise and complex navigation equipment, two highly trained operators, and a nationwide system of human traffic controllers, radar installations, navigational beacons, airports, radio systems, meteorological equipment, etc. Have you ever looked at an airport's approach plate? Meanwhile, train engineers are mostly concerned about managing their kinetic and potential energy. Aside from reading signals and speed signs, there isn't a whole lot to do...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tell that to Japan, China, and Western Europe who all have efficient, economical passenger rail systems. It works if you have the population density to support it.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Japan's shinkansen has transported five billion passengers since 1967 with zero fatalities due to accidents. You're misrepresenting the dangers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know about the rest of Western Europe, but for me as a Dutchman it's about twice as expensive and twice as time-consuming to get to work by train as it is by car. </p>
<p>And yes, that's factoring in depreciation, maintenance costs, repairs, insurance, taxes <em>and</em> fuel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird. I live in your country, and employers typically pay exactly the same amount, whether you come by car or train.</p>
<p>Regarding the time-consumption - where in the Netherlands do you live -  bloody Vriesland?</p>
<p>And let's not even get into environmental or danger discussions - public transport in NL beats cars anytime, anywhere, hands-down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Passenger rail is worthwhile when you've got relatively short runs between densely populated, high traffic areas.  That's why subways work in a place like New York City - it's small, with a high population density.</p>
<p>However, passenger rail can <em>also</em> be worthwhile if you re-conceptualize it as a passenger <em>road</em>.</p>
<p>So instead of running rail from San Francisco to LA, we'll simply build a road.  But it will be a special sort of road.  It won't have unpredictable on- and off- ramps.  It won't have human-driven vehicles.  The road will have embedded sensor/transmitter packages that can be easily read electronically.</p>
<p>What this means is that you can build cheap vehicles that are limited to the purpose of operating automatically on that road.  You won't need a particularly high range because the vehicles will be refueled/recharged at every stop.  You won't need high performance vehicles because they'll just travel at their intended speed.</p>
<p>While this may not seem like 'mass transit', it actually is in a sense because you can program your automated cars to draft one another with a fair degree of precision.  But unlike mass transit, you'd be able to drop in and out of the system at regular intervals.</p>
<p>The per-mile cost of roadway is also significantly less than the per-mile cost of rail, so you extend your distance of viability a great deal.</p></div>		</li>
