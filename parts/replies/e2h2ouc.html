			<div class="markdown"><p>This saved my ass once. I remember when I had a LG G2 for a phone/alarm clock and enabled Google Now, it disabled my alarms and auto-snoozed them all due to a programming bug. I had an exam the morning after I enabled it, not suspecting alarm failure the following morning. I woke up on my own late, but with just enough time to get to campus and dash into the lecture hall for the exam. Thanks, brain.</p></div>		</li>
