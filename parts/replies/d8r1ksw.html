			<div class="markdown"><p>Where are the driplines? For a given element, what is the heaviest isotope that exists? For a given number of neutrons, what is the heaviest isotone that exists?</p>
<p>What are the lifetimes of these nuclei far from stability? If they have bound ground states, do they have bound excited states as well?</p>
<p>Shell inversion. Are the energy levels of these nuclei in a different order than what the shell model predicts?</p>
<p>How does nuclear matter behave at extreme N/Z ratios? Can that tell us anything about astrophysics (think neutron stars)?</p>
<p>How are elements heavier than iron formed in nature; where did they all come from? How does the r-process work?</p>
<p>Are there new exotic effects like two-neutron radioactivity (&quot;radioactivity&quot; meaning that the nucleus lives for at least around 10^(-14) seconds before decaying, so it could in principle participate in chemistry)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pause. Is an isoto<strong>n</strong>e a nucleus containing the same number of neutrons as another? Isoto<strong>p</strong>e suddenly makes sense etymologically (same number of protons)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Those would be part of the aforementioned &quot;superheavy&quot; grouping, with a very large number of protons. What FRIB will do is explore what happens with more &quot;normal&quot; (for lack of any better word that comes to mind) nuclei if you jam in a ton of extra neutrons, well beyond what you'd see in nature. These nuclei will almost certainly be very <em>un</em>stable.</p></div>		</li>
