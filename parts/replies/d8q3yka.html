			<div class="markdown"><p>My tinnitus is more noticeable when I'm tired. Without fail i'll have my left ear ringing away while trying to sleep, but during the day not so much/hardly at all.</p>
<p>My question is, why is this? Why is it more prevalent and noticeable when tired, under stress and etc?</p>
<p>It really doesn't bother me at all but for interests sake is there any &quot;cure&quot; insight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wild guess - maybe it's because there isn't much real noise while you're trying to sleep, so the tinnitus is louder proportionally?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that is certainly an element, but even as I sit here now, focusing on it with just the noise of a gentle breeze outside, my tinnitus is not present. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  When everything else is quiet the ringing from tinnitus can be almost unbearably loud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High-five, I think we have the same severity of tinnitus! I'm a low-frequency underwater-like type. </p>
<p>It just could be that during the day when you're out the environment is just loud enough to mask the tinnitus, and when you enter a quiet environment (such as a bedroom before sleep), it becomes more noticeable. That's the same thing that I experience as well. </p>
<p>Well, the more we learn about how the brain functions in relation to sound production, I'm sure we'll figure something out. In some cases of severe hearing loss which aren't neurologically related (don't quote me on that), a patient is able to go from being almost fully deaf, to hearing things at almost a natural level. It's done through a device that's put on the side of the head (can't remember where, but near the ears), and it listens to the environment, and converts it into a signal the brain can process into sound. This skips the whole step of needing an eardrum and tiny hairs in the inner ear to process sound. </p>
<p>So unfortunately we don't have a cure yet, but I think we're getting closer. In my experience the best thing to do is to learn coping methods and to minimize it as much as you can. I might have even learned to naturally tune it out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>Honestly, aside from the initial month or so of first having tinnitus I've never been bothered by it. </p>
<p>Funnily enough my tinnitus came on after a week long ear infection but most likely caused by the loud music, concerts and headphone usage for 10-15 years!</p>
<p>Also low-frequency underwater does pretty accurately describe the noise I hear.</p></div>		</li>

They're a little more expensive than the foam ones, but I'd say its worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I went to way too many basement shows and didn't wear earplugs. If find yourself anywhere loud and don't have earplugs, ball up toilet paper and put that gently in your ears. It's not as good as earplugs, but it'll cut down on decibels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't shoot guns without ear protection.  I can not stress this enough.  My ears are absolutely fucked from years of not caring.  I have a massive box fan to help me sleep and even then most nights the ringing is loud enough to keep me up.  </p>
<p>Also don't install a subwoofer in your car.  Really just be aware of how loud things are and realize that it can do serious, permanent damage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><h1>Quality Ear Plugs</h1>
<p>Go get a 20$+ pair from a Guitar Center or music shop, and you'll find shows sound better than ever, and don't leave you with damage. </p>
<p>Don't wear construction/single use ear plugs; they ruin sound by dampening everything. Musician ear plugs focus on lowering decibels and cutting harsh mid range. </p>
<p>Also, don't use in ear headphones to mask outside noise (e.g while mowing the lawn). If you want headphones to mask sound, get active noise cancelling cans. </p></div>		</li>
