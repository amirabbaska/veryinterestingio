			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Dogs and most other mammals have an estrus cycle, also known as being &quot;in heat.&quot; During this time, the animal is most fertile. If the egg isn't fertilized during estrus, the uterine lining is reabsorbed. This, as you're probably familiar, is essentially the opposite of menstruation, where the lining is shed.</p>
<p>Edit: Since this has been asked a couple times: yes, dogs (and other mammals) in heat/estrus have a bloody vaginal discharge but this is not the same as menstruation as it does not contain shed uterine lining. Estrus and menstruation also occur at different points in the ovulation cycles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, of course, it's not &quot;as long as the lunar cycle&quot;, not for everybody. The lunar cycle is, what, 29 days long? Whereas the menstrual cycle can vary from 21 to 35 days, depending on the woman, and some women aren't even very regular.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since the amount of natural light present at night would vary considerably by the phases of the moon, it may be more than a coincidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would that be true at all? There's millions of years of evolution between us, enough time to give rise to certain traits, while also being enough time to bring death to certain other traits in them. </p>
<p>Your first sentence is a nice guess but it is not certain enough to have a conclusion drawn from it. And with your second sentence, it doesn't even matter. Start and end dates are relative. They change. They're influence by outside factors like present company and prevalent rituals. The cycle length, while subject to some variation, follows the length of the lunar cycle.</p>
<p>In short â€” is it correlated? We don't know. We cannot say whether it is chance or correlation. We do not know, and any other answer is wrong and not at all representative of science. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned earlier, there's only a handful of terrestrial mammals that menstruate. The estrous cycles of cetaceans are hugely varied in duration (anything from seven times a year, to two years at a time) and seem to coincide with migratory patterns and the calving / lactation / weaning cycle. How the signaling works is still subject to further research it seems. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think only the mammals that use menstrual cycles are primates, a few bats, and Indian elephants.  I could be missing a few species, but it's not very common at all.</p></div>		</li>
