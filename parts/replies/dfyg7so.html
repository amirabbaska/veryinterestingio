If water continued to increase in density as its temperature drops (like most other compounds) rivers, lakes, and oceans would often freeze solid in the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the equators don't typically freeze and life there would be &quot;fine&quot;. I also dislike this argument because I feel life would evolve accordingly for freezing environments.. is there anything backing up the idea that life would have a harder time thriving if water froze like other liquids?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about pressure?</p>
<p>I would've assumed that the answer lies in the higher pressure of lower depths. Wouldn't that raise the freezing point of the water molecules?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the 0 point on the Fahrenheit scale was a 1/1/1 salt, ice, and water mixture, therefore coinciding with the freezing point for salt water.</p>
<p>Edit: one should note that this has since changed, but provides a good idea of just how much salt plays as a factor for the freezing point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also, and this is a super-unscientific answer but this is how I'd explain it to a 5 year old, we know ice floats, so even if water at the bottom of the lake did freeze the ice would just float to the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not completely true either. Anchor ice is ice that forms around rocks and other objects on the floor of the water body. Sometimes it breaks off and other times it doesnt. Current plays a big role in preventing freezing as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a beautiful answer and I might tack on something of an unrelated thought: it didn't have to work this way.  A lot of chemicals do not behave in this manner and if lakes froze from the bottom, or ice formed on the top and fell to the bottom smothering the bottom surface, complex life probably couldn't have arisen.  So when people talk about water being important to life, one of the many reasons is because water behaves in this very unusual way that is very important for complex life to exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you answer or provide a link as to why water is so special? </p>
<p>I know it is because I was taught that way but I never knew why. Why is water the only substance (that I'm aware of) that has a density &quot;peak&quot; above it's freezing/melting point? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oof. I know, let me see if I can explain. </p>
<p>Water is polar, meaning each molecule has a slightly positively charged side and a slightly negatively charged side. As water gets colder, the molecules get closer together, hence the increase in density. Because of its shape, the molecules can get REALLY close together until 4 degrees C, at which point there is little enough thermal energy to allow hydrogen bonds to form. Those bonds put each molecule a fixed distance from each other in a crystal lattice, that distance is greater than when they were too energetic for the hydrogen bonds to form. Because the molecules are forced farther apart by the hydrogen bonding, the density decreases between 4 and 0 degrees C. </p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, that does make sense, but like all science, now I have more questions :)</p>
<p>First, I'm pretty sure water isn't the only polar molecule, no? Like, I'm not sure if hydrogen peroxide is, but that's H2O2, right? Wouldn't it behave similarly? Extending that to all of the others, I guess my question is: why only water? Why does no other liquid we know of in existence have this property as well?</p>
<p>Second, and this one might be dumb, but as you force the hydrogen molecules apart into their lattice, doesn't that add to the energy of the system? (I'm thinking like potential energy) because they really want to be bonded, no? And then shouldn't that energy come out as heat and create some boundary where it's trying to cool down but can't because smushing it closer together makes it want to warm back up? </p>
<p>That last one is probably dumb, but I tried to phrase it right.</p>
<p>Edit: another question, but the way you described it also makes it sounds like crystals form at 4C? Why isn't that the definition of the freezing and melting point, then? I thought that you couldn't have crystalline bonds and still be considered a liquid.  I could phrase the question as: how come water can still move around and fill a container of any shape if it has crystalline bonds? </p>
<p>Further edit: in case you couldn't tell, my worst STEM subject was always chemistry.</p></div>		</li>
