<p>A Keurig heats up water pretty quick.</p>
<p>You just have to increase the current for lower voltage to do the same amount of work. Imagine electricity as a stream of water. Voltage is like pressure. Current is like volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>give or take 5 percent loss you will have 90-100 volts not 100 all the time so the difference between an appliance that can run at 110-120 in the states will surely not appreciate 90-100 volts</p></div>		</li>
