<p>Edit: thank you star experts for informing me that at the time iron is produced that is essentially the death sentence for a star.  They produce iron for a time, but death is imminent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my point, to explode they generally need to make iron. If they aren't big enough to make iron, they just burn out without the bang - and whatever it made wouldn't end up seeding our solar system. Any elements you see in our solar system heavier than helium were part of a star that blew up otherwise it wouldn't be here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not fully true. Some carbon comes from low-mass stars. Low-mass stars can create carbon in their final stages of life, and through some pretty violent mixing processes, a lot of carbon can be pushed into the outer layers of the star. When a low-mass star dies, it expels its outer layers in a planetary nebula.</p>
<p>I don't know which creation mechanism dominates for carbon outside of dead stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really important process. As low-mass stars (0.8 - 8 solar masses) enter their final return to the red giant phase as Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, they undergo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredge-up" target="_blank">third dredge-up</a>. All the previously fused material from deep in the core is heavily mixed throughout the star. These stars also have some pretty strong stellar winds, allowing the carbon that got mixed throughout to get pushed off the surface and deep into space.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.1155.pdf" target="_blank">this PDF</a> (Fig. 11) carbon in the interstellar medium is slightly dominated by Asymptotic Giant Branch stars rather than Type II supernovae.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The metals (heavy elements) originated from many star that went supernova and threw out their interior into interstellar space which mixed with the already existing gas clouds. </p>

<p>To expand on this, supernovae often form <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZOiGS2e.jpg" target="_blank">galactic fountains</a>.</p>
<p>The rapidly expanding bubble of hot, metal-rich gas from the supernova <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zRjSi43.jpg" target="_blank">hits the edge of the galactic disk</a> where it suddenly encounters much less resistance from a much lower density of the interstellar medium, allowing it to form a chimney perpendicular to the disk. After arcing well outside the disk, this material then cools and rains down over a large portion of the galaxy, seeding stellar nurseries with metals that will later become planets.</p></div>		</li>
