			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks! I was walking to uni today and my housemates were chatting about Big brother (something I have no clue about so my mind just wandered) and I just piped up “if Avro is so cheap how comes British Gas sells the same stuff to people for like twice what we pay” and they were like.... because they can?
Which didn’t seem a proper answer to me and it’s been on my mind all day lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a few reasons the 'Big Six' charge more, I'm not sure which is the biggest factor though. </p>
<p>One is the fact that they have higher costs due to the fact they are an older company meaning they have to pay thousands of pensions.</p>
<p>Another is that they have a necessary market position to make large scale investments that smaller suppliers don't eg an offshore wind farm or a drilling platform. </p>
<p>Additionally there is heavy regulation on the UK energy market, especially for the Big Six eg they have to give a discount I think to people in 'fuel poverty'.</p>
<p>I heard on the renewable energy supplier 'Bulb's' website that the reason is they have smaller profit margins but should probs take that with a pinch of salt. </p>
<p>There are definitely some others too because it's a mental complicated industry but hopefully that answers you enough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're very correct on smaller profit margin. The first is absolutely true as it's just a smaller overhead so they need a smaller gross profit. Net profit might be larger!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher cost of infrastructures . They actually purchase the energy at cheaper rates as they're are purchasing/supplying in larger quantities. There's a certain % that must go back into the industry as part of ongoing R&amp;D legislated by former PM David Cameron some years ago . But the rest , it's all profit. The big suppliers pretty much walk a fine line between being cartels who collude together to maintain  the price of energy between them something which is massively illegal but very hard to bring to justice if a governmental body begins to investigate. </p>
<p>As far as fuel poverty payments, these are simply 'greenwashing' their ethics and morals to look like they are caring for households in poverty. The temperature must be below a certain level for a certain number of days for a certain length of time. Could be -10c all week during this time, but if there's one day of 2c temperatures in that period, then they don't pay out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain why you think I'm talking about communal grids? I'm trying to understand what you mean.</p>
<p>A vertically integrated power supply means that the same company controls the 'electrons' from generation to selling it to end users. This was the typical setup before grids were opened up to competition. You had a monolithic, government run 'power company' that did everything.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it's more common to have competition in generation and retail markets. They're two very different activities, so you often have companies operating in one sector but not the other. </p>
<p>The OP's post doesn't really make sense in that type of market structure. You don't have the same company generating the power and then selling to to a customer. I guess if you consider the retailer as the 'customer' it does - do you think that's what the OP meant? But if so it doesn't answer the original question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are vertically integrated, though the amount a company generates tends not to be the same as the amount they sell to retail customers. There are also regulations to prevent market manipulation e.g. if a large generator is going to be unavailable the whole market has to be informed before the retail arm bids for power. </p>
<p>Distribution networks and the transmission network are run separately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, sounds similar to the market I work in. THere are leftover behemoth companies from before the market was opened up. They have a big presence in both the generation and retail spaces, but they're not 1-1. And their market share in both spaces is being gradually eroded by new entrants. In the retail space they mostly they try to hold on to &quot;sticky&quot; customers who they can reem with high prices. Generally they're elderly, and in many cases aren't even aware you can change power companies :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A simplification. </p>
<p>The voltage is AC, the electrons you use to light your lights are the same ones that were delivered when you installed the pendent fitting. Because electrons move very very slowly you only see the direct effect of a very few which wobble back and forth, but the indirect effect of billions pushing and pulling all the way back to the generator. </p></div>		</li>
