			<div class="markdown"><p>Pirates generally steal things, historically from seagoing vessels. If their work is government sanctioned, then a more proper term would be privateer...</p>
<p>I don't think anything op said implies that either the term pirate or privateer is more appropriate than mercenary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude (u/freebuju) thanks for a perfect example of the kind of comments that are completely useless to anyone on Reddit, including you, a person who actually felt compelled to take the time to make a comment like this. I honestly don't know what you meant, or what you we're trying to convey.  someday you may grow up and understand Reddit, and possibly even understand this reply. For now, i don't expect someone who wrote what you did to actually grasp the context. Until then, enjoy whatever satisfaction you derive from making these comments. </p></div>		</li>
