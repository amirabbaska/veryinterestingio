			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a neat approach. It makes me wonder, however, about the fact that the radar reflection wouldn't be a perfect spike but rather a noisy hump. How many rotations would you need to fit those humps before an anticipated change in rotation rate would become discernible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even though it wouldn't be a spike, the hump would still be consistent enough. Especially averaged across a few rotations. It might not be the best surface but it's not changing in shape. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're orbiting Venus can't you just illuminate the surface and get the Doppler shift of the return? Since the 60s we've used this principle in the military to detect aircraft because they're Doppler shift differs from that of the ground... Anyway, the shift gives accurate information about the difference in rotational velocity between you and the planets surface. I don't see why OP wants to use a metal target to determine orbital velocity when they can simply use the entire surface. </p>
<p>You can even do this from earth since the orbits of the planets are known as well as the earths rotation:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bounce radar off of it, radar hits surface and has angular momentum imparted to it from planet's rotation. This doppler shifts the returning wave. Changes would be tiny, not sure how accurate the measurements would be.</p></div>		</li>
