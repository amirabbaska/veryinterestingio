			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same experience swimming way off a Greek Island (Symi) looking down in to blue fading into inky blackness. We took a big round round white bowl with us and let it sink and watched this white circle slowly disappearing it took ages, but just before it vanished a shoal of very large fish swam under and past us at an amazing speed. Made me realize in this environment I was as appropriate as a giraffe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be terrifying. This is something that seems very common among people. It's termed &quot;kenophobia&quot; which is specifically the  &quot;fear of empty spaces&quot;, but also used generally as fearing the void. Another one is &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thalassophobia" target="_blank">thalassophobia</a>&quot; which is fear of deep dark water.</p>
<p>I think our brains are just comforted by being able to judge the size and space of an environment, and by tricking our brains by putting an âˆž (or what seems like infinity) in there is immediately unsettling.</p>
<p>It is kind of exhilarating to overcome that fear though. It almost becomes comforting when thinking about the possibility of endless nothingness.</p></div>		</li>
