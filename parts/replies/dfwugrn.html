			<div class="markdown"><p>There is one error- it's not clear that &quot;the ideal is to print exactly as much new currency as we create new wealth&quot;. </p>
<p>The ideal is to maximize the creation of new wealth (taking into account negative externalities associated with any activities.)    It may be the case that having some amount of inflation; probably a dynamic amount based on conditions, increases the rate of wealth creation because it further discourages hoarding.   </p>
<p>TLDR: creating more new money than new wealth may actually be better for creating new wealth faster than keeping those rates equal. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's deflation and it's bad. It's bad because it become more profitable to keep your money than invest it. And without investment, you can't create as much wealth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll only keep money if it's more profitable than actually investing it. Opportunity cost is still a thing in deflation. If deflation is 2%, but a potential investment could net 10%, you'll probably still choose to invest. It may lower aggregate demand for investments, but not by much. Plus, if deflation were happening, your average Joe could save more easily as their savings would <em>increase</em> in value, instead of decrease as it does during inflation. It's a bit of a trade off, but I see no reason why a little deflation is world ending, as so many people seem to claim these days. </p>
<p>Inflation is <em>definitely</em> good for governments though, as it helps them control their own debt easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to remember though is the deflation is bad for debtors, each year your debt will increase by 2%, whereas it is good for creditors. More people are debtors than creditors so it makes sense for that reason too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say that deflation would remove all investment. Just that it limit the movement of money in an economy, which is bad. It lead to less jobs and wealth creation. A slow down of the economy, which is pretty much away bad.</p>
<p>A little bit of inflation is good, any amount of deflation is bad. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And inflation encourages that, which can be bad, too. Would saving money really be inherently bad? It allows for saving and spending on future projects and signals falling prices. Inflation discourages savings, can't that be a negative? </p>
<p>A lot of inflation is bad, and a lot of deflation is bad. I just have a hard time believing some inflation is inherently good while all deflation is inherently bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no inherent &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;badness&quot; to inflation and deflation.  It could be good for some people, and it could be bad for some people.  Once we gave the power to a central committee to try and figure out ideal interest rates, it just became a question of who the winners were going to be, and who the losers were going to be, and who gets to pick them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I said inflation isn't a bad thing, it's actually a good thing if you keep it low and stable. So the word alleviate isn't the right one. The central bank will try estimate the wealth created and the currency destroyed and print the appropriate amount of currency to reach a decent amount of inflation. </p>
<p>The ideal inflation rate should be around 2%. </p></div>		</li>
