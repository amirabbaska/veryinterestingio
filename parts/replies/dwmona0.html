			<div class="markdown"><p>holy shit yea.. i had no idea scopolamine was used during MKULTRA... it's called &quot;devil's breath&quot; for a reason..</p>
<p>For those that don't know, it has been used in a variety of crimes by just average criminals and gangs alike, because it can cause retrograde amnesia, meaning you won't remember things even from the period of time <em>before</em> the drug was ingested, and can cause sleepiness and put the person into a state of extreme suggestability. </p>
<p>for these reasons it's used in robberies, kidnappings and rapes, mostly in south america</p></div>		</li>

Whilst it certainly does possess properties that could lead to what you described the way it is allegedly administered to victims, blowing into their faces from your hands wouldn't be enough to make someone empty their bank accounts and forget about it the following day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are we looking up different drugs because scopolamine is used to treat motion sickness and nausuea as well as reduce saliva production before dental surgeries...
Even the side effects like confusion, agitation, and hallucinations occur in 1/10th of 1%. And even overdoses don't increase the likelihood of those, just produce some heart issues, blurred vision, urine retention, and a few other things....I'm confused.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Large overdoses of nearly all (or all?) known anticholinergics will cause things like hallucinations, confusion, delirium, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The MKUltra project wasn't about some kind of mysterious &quot;mind control&quot; ability ... The reason it's often called the &quot;CIA mind control project&quot; is because part of the project was investigating drugs such as LSD that they hoped would make victims vulnerable to suggesting and manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's somewhat accurate, but nowhere near the whole story. The origins of MKULTRA are largely based on continuation of work of Nazi scientists that came over here during Operation Paperclip. US Navy reports from 1945 included observations of Nazis using mescaline during interrogations at Dachau.</p>
<p>In 1947, the Navy started their own testing of mescaline, scopolamine and others during Project CHAPTER (1947) which then evolved into Project CHATTER (1951-1953). This is what then eventually combined with some other projects to form MKULTRA after numerous other names and projects (ARTICHOKE, CASTIGATE, MKNAOMI, MKDELTA, etc.)</p>
<p>The roots of the program were in drugs and interrogation -- but over the 20+ years that the program was in existence, it expanded well beyond that. Research into hypnotism (MKULTRA subproject 49, 84, others), brain concussions to erase memories (subproject 54), sensory deprivation (subproject 61), electric shock therapy (subproject 62), psychic driving by Ewen Cameron (subproject 68), neurotoxins and biological warfare (subproject 99, 101), study of adolescent gangs and social dynamics (subproject 102), children's summer camps (subproject 103), sabotage of petroleum resources (104), the infamous <strong>Witch Doctor Study</strong> by Dr. Raymond Prince at McGill Universtiy (subproject 121) the list goes on and on and on with more and more interesting subprojects.</p>
<p>There are all documented, I haven't brought up any that can't be backed up by redacted documents on CIA.gov own website.</p>
<p>TL;DR MKULTRA started off as research into drugs and torture as interrogation techniques, but it expanded into all things &quot;mind-control&quot; related. Implanting false memories, erasing memories, hypnotism, cultural dynamics, peer pressure -- if it had to do with influencing human behavior in isolation or groups, MKULTRA touched it.</p></div>		</li>
