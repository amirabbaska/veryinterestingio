			<p>According to this whitepaper they decided to shut it down because the board believed that the scientific outcome was no longer enough to justify the investment for maintaining it.<br><br><a href="http://danskdekommissionering.dk/media/54424/pr%C3%A6sentationsfolder_uk_web.pdf" target="_blank">http://danskdekommissionering.dk/media/54424/pr%C3%A6sentationsfolder_uk_web.pdf</a></p>		</li>

			<p>My alma mater has one. It is tiny and for research only, but it is a nuclear reactor nonetheless. Also is of a design where it is next to impossible to go <del>critical</del> boom. </p>		</li>

			<p>But they want it to go critical? Critical in nuclear terms is a condition met to initiate the chain reaction required in nuclear fission. Fission requires neutrons as an input, and produces them as an output, criticality is the condition where produced neutrons from one reaction will induce another reaction. This is the chain reaction that we need in order to get anything meaningful out of a fission reactor, otherwise the reaction simply dies out. Of course, we need to control this criticality. </p>		</li>

			<p>Oh yeah, crap, I knew that.  I guess I meant it is set up so that the reaction cannot become uncontrollable and bad things happen.  I think I had it described to me as &quot;self-poisoning&quot;?  Something about if it goes too far it also releases something else that starts soaking up the extra neutrons? </p>		</li>

			<p>Maybe I'm not sure, my primary focus is in photonics so have only had some exposure to nuclear physics and can't help you with any of the nitty-gritty details of reactors just the basic overview :). I do know that the reactor on campus is very specifically designed to avoid any sort of overheating or accident, this includes everything from materials used, to building shape, radiation detection systems and everything in between. Perhaps you simply mixed up the wording and are thinking of the measures they've taken to avoid a catastrophic accident? Sorry I can't be of more help, maybe someone more knowledgeable on the details of the subject can chip in.</p>		</li>

			<p>Here's a cool video of Penn State's reactor.  It's different than a power generating reactor. What you'll see it a &quot;Pulse&quot;. The way the reactor is designed has the fuel and control mixed together. It becomes less efficent at higher reaction rates so it effectively starts to explode, then turns itself off.  Pretty awesome to see in person. They'll let you in the room on tours and the reactor is just at the bottom of a pool.<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/6I3JKYdGWTE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/6I3JKYdGWTE</a></p>		</li>

			<p>How can you make a particle go faster than the speed of light in water?</p>		</li>

			<p>the speed <em>c</em> is the speed of any massless particle, and only of massless particles (including light), but the speed of light can be effectively reduced by interacting with particles that apply a sort of drag to the over all light (it's more complicated than that, but just go with it for now). In water, that means that light moves at .75<em>c</em> instead of 1.0<em>c</em><br><br>If you force a particle to go above .75<em>c</em> in water, then you get the described Cherenkov radiation event. At no time does anything go above <em>c</em>, so causality and the other laws regarding the so-called speed of light (as it's a far more universal law than just light, and light can be made to go effectively slower) are not effected. </p>		</li>

			<p>Charged particles from (extremely short lived) fission products, mostly beta particles (electrons) are what makes the glow but there are also a bunch of alpha particles (helium nuclei). Electrons are fairly light weight so they can move pretty fast with comparatively little energy.<br><br>When they pulse the reactor they very quickly increase the reaction rate which generates &quot;a lot&quot; of fission products quickly. Most of these toss off some electrons quickly, some of those electrons will be moving faster than the local speed of light for a short distance.<br><br>You only get Cherenkov from charged particles, not from neutral particles. The light booms (and sonic booms for sound) are due to the interaction of the traveling particle and the medium. Essentially as a charged particle passes an atom it weakly polarizes the atom (shoves the atom's electrons toward/away from itself), when the atom depolarizes it emits the light. Because the particle is going faster than light the emitted light builds up instead of canceling out like at sublight speeds.<br><br>Much like a sonic boom, Cherenkov radiation from each discrete particle has an associated angle that is based on the particle speed and the medium.<br><br>There are actually (fairly unusual) Cherenkov detectors which use the Cherenkov radiation caused by particles and the angle of that radiation to obtain information of the particles direction and speed.</p>		</li>

			<p>High energy particles such as protons and electrons as released from a nuclear reactor. They don't stay faster than .75c for long of course, the release of the energy into light slows them down, so it's almost more of an impact with water event, but has a similar photonic 'boom' to the 'sonic boom' concept.<br><br>Now to be cautious, we're pushing the limits of my knowledge, I've been combining what I already knew with what I've learned or had learned deeper in this thread. I'm even borrowing the phrase photonic boom from another post I saw in this thread yesterday, and there's several images describing the event that have been posted.</p>		</li>

			<p>In a vacuum always.<br><br>In media.. it becomes complicated. There are three hypothesis I know of to explain why light travels slower than C in a medium.   <br><br>A) Photons are absorbed and re-emitted by molecules along the way, with the delay in release being the slow down.  <br>B) Though some light will be absorbed by matter and converted to heat energy etc, the photons that miss molecules effectively travel around them, lengthening their travel path thus effectively slowing them down.  <br>C) Photons are converted from a massless particle to a massive particle while in a thick medium, and thus slow down, then are reconverted upon exit. This one I only heard of yesterday, and was posted else where in this thread.<br><br>I do not have the knowledge/expertise to delve deeper or offer an opinion upon the likelihood of any of the above. But it is a simple fact that in a medium the effective speed of light is less than C, and this is a measured effect not speculative.</p>		</li>

			<p>The light in the water passes through vibration modes turning light photons into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polariton" target="_blank">polaritons</a> which move at 75% the speed of light</p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't, he's saying they can make it go faster than the 75% the speed of light it normally goes in water. It's still less than the speed of light.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's really easy. An electron moving at 0.75c only has a kinetic energy of 4.2 <em> 10^(-14) joules. Fission of a </em>single atom* of uranium-235 releases close to 1000 times more energy. </p>		</li>
