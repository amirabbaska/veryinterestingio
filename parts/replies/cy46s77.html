It's actually really cool. It's the Reed College research reactor, if you want to look up more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a cool video of Penn State's reactor.  It's different than a power generating reactor. What you'll see it a &quot;Pulse&quot;. The way the reactor is designed has the fuel and control mixed together. It becomes less efficent at higher reaction rates so it effectively starts to explode, then turns itself off.  Pretty awesome to see in person. They'll let you in the room on tours and the reactor is just at the bottom of a pool.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the speed <em>c</em> is the speed of any massless particle, and only of massless particles (including light), but the speed of light can be effectively reduced by interacting with particles that apply a sort of drag to the over all light (it's more complicated than that, but just go with it for now). In water, that means that light moves at .75<em>c</em> instead of 1.0<em>c</em></p>
<p>If you force a particle to go above .75<em>c</em> in water, then you get the described Cherenkov radiation event. At no time does anything go above <em>c</em>, so causality and the other laws regarding the so-called speed of light (as it's a far more universal law than just light, and light can be made to go effectively slower) are not effected. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't, he's saying they can make it go faster than the 75% the speed of light it normally goes in water. It's still less than the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>
