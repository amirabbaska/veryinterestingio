<p>What I was going for was trying to show that the rough surface scatters light in different directions. I was also thinking of going into what rough means optically (having surface features greater than the wavelength of visible light in this case, 400-700nanometers), and how hard it is to polish to the point where you get reflection. I was also thinking about going into the difference between projection and reflection, with your eye imaging at the source (your face) in reflection, but for projectors your eye images on the page.</p>
<p>But oh well. At least I didn't go into nonlinear optics.</p></div>		</li>
