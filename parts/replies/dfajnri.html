			<div class="markdown"><p>If the issue was about making a ADHD student sit still during a school assembly, there might be several suggestions on how to get the student to act out their impulses in a less intrusive or distracting way. </p>
<p>For example, the student could be taught to clench or squeeze their hands instead. Or hold an object, like a squeeze toy or something thats something that's tactile in nature but also wouldn't make sounds or distract others if being used. (sometimes spinning a pen might work, but it might be considered distracting enough to others). </p>
<p>Instead of tapping their foot, the student could wriggle their toes instead. This action is hidden inside the shoe and thus not as obvious as tapping the foot. </p>
<p>Notebooks works wonders too. Get the student to write down what the teacher is saying, or their own thoughts, or draw the lunchroom, or just let them doodle onto it. Bonus points if the notebook helps the student to retain knowledge of what the speaker at assembly was talking about. For some, just holding the notebook reduces the distractability enough. </p>
<p>Really, though, teachers shouldn't be so harsh on students fidgeting. Unless their fidgeting is a source of distraction to the student themself or others, teachers shouldn't force them to freeze like a statue during assembly. </p>
<p>Adhd, like mosy psychological conditions, is like a spectrum where each person with it is affected in different degrees and manners. The trick is to for each individual to find their own best effective coping mechanism to deal with the drudgery of school assemblies. </p>
<p>For me, there are two main goals: first is to ensure that the student's actions don't distract others, next is to help the student  effectively pay attention themselves. If the student's figeting or personal coping mechanism is not distracting those around them, i say half the battle is already won and we're closer to an effective solution already. </p>
<p>I'm not an expert in this matter, just someone with mild adhd. My own coping mechanism for boring lectures would be doodling on something, like a notebook. Somehow, it actually helps me pay attention better than if i force myself to keep my eyes peeled on the speaker and not move any part of my body. </p></div>		</li>
