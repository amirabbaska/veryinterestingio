			<div class="markdown"><p>As a molecular biologist: when trying to answer questions about evolutionary sociology (or however you'd classify a question like this), what would evidence look like? It's not like we can dig up a fossil record of Neanderthal jokes. Seems sort of intrinsically bound to the realm of speculation/philosophy to me. So I don't think the requests for evidence in response to the top post are really appropriate. If anything the issue is that the answer to the question as stated is simply &quot;no,&quot; and that interesting as this is, the discussion belongs in a different sub.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting, but there's a natural, binary component to comedy as well. Laughter occurs through comedy, and comedy often occurs when a delicate balance of opposites creates a mental reaction. For example, if I were to say &quot;What's the difference between a single hen and a married hen? The cock.&quot; You might laugh (maybe). This is due to an interruption in the brain's natural process of understanding. In the beginning, you're assuming a difference in the adjectival definition of the noun, e.g. &quot;What's the difference between a red ball and a blue ball? One is another color than the other.&quot; </p>
<p>The punchline changes the context. You might have originally thought, &quot;Oh, one has a husband and the other doesn't.&quot; The punchline re-contextualizes the outcome. Suddenly the fact that they're hens matters, as does the baseness of the answer and the layered meaning of the punchline (in a relational and sexual manner; married women have sex less often, so they get less 'cock' so to speak) The set up is expectation, outcome, and reaction. Laughter is a mental reaction due to the snap change of context, often due to a rejected supposition. This really only pertains to linguistic sources of laughter, but physical comedy often works in the same manner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the difference here is that you seem to be talking about how comedy evolved through the use of language, whereas he is talking about how it evolved physically. I believe that other apes have been observed to &quot;laugh,&quot; or have comedic reactions. The core of both seems to be the observation of something contrary to what is expected but only so long as the result is not threatening. </p></div>		</li>
