			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Different gases will condense or separate at different pressures and temperatures giving way to layers in the atmosphere. The same is true of Earth. However Mars has very little oxygen, nitrogen, or water to form it's own (Earth equivalent) atmosphere because it has no magnetosphere to protect it. In Prometheus the planet was cloudy meaning there were abundant gases.</p>
<p>When you talk about colonizing Mars you're talking about a planet that's dead inside, cold, has almost none of the readily available atmospheric elements required to sustain life, and even the gravity is inhospitable to basic life mechanisms on a lengthy scale. For example long periods of low gravity have been proven to deteriorate the vascular system, sometimes irreparably. </p>
<p>Some have postulated that conceiving and carrying a pregnancy to term in such low gravity conditions would be disastrous or even impossible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The gravity isn't inhospitable to basic life mechanisms, unless you're looking only at multicellular organisms. And even then it's far from a foregone conclusion. I'm not aware of any long-term studies in low gravity effects on the human body, only the long-term effects of microgravity (~zero g), which is very different.</p>
<p>The deterioration of the vascular system, loss of bone density etc. also are only really a critical problem when you go back to Earth.</p></div>		</li>
