			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always a fan of the Bellman-Ford algorithm over Dijkstra's. Not as fast but easier to do by hand. </p>
<p>I can't wait until someone solves TSP in P time. They would be the Einstein of our generation, and it would revolutionize  optimization of logistical applications and being able to translate the solution to all the other NP and NPC problems would be world changing.</p>
<p>What do you think will be the first to happen: someone proves P=NP, or we will optimize quantum computing to be able to solve NP problems in P time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if someone proved P=NP for all cases, we still wouldn't have the P algorithm for every possible problem. We're pretty sure that P!=NP, it's just really hard to prove. Considering that quantum computers would come first, they come with their own can of worms though, not all algorithms are suitable for quantum computers, just like not all algorithms are suitable for multi-processing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I'm not vary familiar in quantum computing, looking to learn more but I'm under the impression the whole concept it a bit above my pedigree. It seems it would require a degree in physics as well as computer science to really get into it </p></div>		</li>
