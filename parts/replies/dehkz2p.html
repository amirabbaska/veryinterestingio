			<div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed this too, that back of house staff is more diverse. A middle eastern restaurant I used to frequent had a several latino men working in the kitchen. The head chef was middle eastern, as was the GM, and wait staff, but the dishwasher/sous chefs were latino. There is also chinese restaurant that we order delivery from and about half of their drivers are white.</p></div>		</li>
