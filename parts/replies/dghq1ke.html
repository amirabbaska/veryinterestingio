			<div class="markdown"><p>How is it a boon to spend time and money rebuilding the NK infrastructure? There's no one to pay the workers, and it's not like NK has the tools/skills to do it on a large scale, so everything except timber, water, and fill dirt will have to come in from outside. </p>
<p>Either from/through China, the DMZ, by air, or a d-day style landing on the shores. But once workers and material are there, they need infrastructure to get to the projects.  So they're building the roads as they go.</p>
<p>Someone will have to go into debt for this, it's not like we can expect NK to pay it back in the next century.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please help me understand. I'm not being sarcastic or anything like that, I genuinely want to know why it wouldn't be a good thing. Isn't pouring money into development good for an economy? Doesn't that spur growth? North Korea would provide an opportunity for most South Korean companies to expand whether that be construction, telecom, banking, etc. Wouldn't the demand for raw materials, workers, and equipment help the companies that produce them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like hurricane relief for New Orleans. It produces jobs in the short term, but the money to do all that has to come from somewhere. Usually the government in the form of disaster relief money.</p>
<p>The government gets that money from somewhere. Taxes or borrowing from other pockets. Usually it borrows from its future self in the form of debt. If debt/income gets too bad, the government actually loses credit rating, which deters foreign investments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Key operating words there is &quot;pouring money into&quot;.</p>
<p>If Korea reunifies tomorrow, by 2050 it'll be leaps and bounds beyond where it is today. Maybe it'll even outpace Japan in every economic metric. But first you have to modernize the region, build all the stuff you said. And that takes time. Coincidentally that's one of the dozens of reasons reunification is left in theory. If you're a politician, and your term is, say, 2017 to 2022, how are you going to get yourself re-elected if all the stuff you promise to happen is going to come to fruition in 2030? These kinds of projects won't finish overnight.</p>
<p>That's only the direct answer. The other issues involve keeping the Northerners out of the South (and more importantly, vice versa) until the two sides can gradually integrate into each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never said it's not a good thing to improve NK, but it's going to cost. And the people that pay are not going to be those that benefit. </p>
<p>Besides basic infrastructure, NK doesn't need any of that. Telecom? That's advanced infrastructure, a little less important than roads and farms. Banking? Who is going to use a bank? The dirt poor farmers? The elite that won't keep their station in a regime change?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would have to build and upgrade most everything. Power grids and power plants. Housing. Transportation hubs. Factories. Everything. </p>
<p>Which seems like a good thing, but where is the money going to come from? Not from the former state of NK. Someone would have to pay for that. </p></div>		</li>
