			<div class="markdown"><p>Meninges is the membrane covering the central nervous system. Its in between this membrane there's &quot;spinal&quot; fluid. Tumors from this part tend to be slow growing and pretty manageble. Many have them without symptoms and never know. </p>
<p>Schwann cells are the supporting (glia) cells of the peripheral nervous system so cells covering every nerve outside the spine and brain.</p>
<p>The pituitary is a gland mixed between a nerve part and a part that developed from the same tissue as the roof of your mouth. The non-nerve part is the one usually getting the tumor. </p>

<p>There can also be secondary tumours which arise elsewhere e.g. lymphomas and metastasize to the brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its slightly wrong but its a technicality. Lymphomas are cancers arising from your white blood cells circulating around your body. They aren't really considered to metastasize because they are already moving about the body. A metastasis is a tumor showing up in a different site while not arising from it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Schwann cells <em>are</em> glia, and aren't found in the central nervous system unless they are transplanted there during research or something. Oligodendrocytes are the CNS equivalent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can both be pedantic here. What do you think an acoustic schwannoma is? Sure it's not an intra axial &quot;brain&quot; tumor, but it's certainly in the skull. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I looked into this because I had never heard of these before as I'm not an oncologist or radiologist, and it turns out the human cochlea is definitely one site within the skull that Schwann cells exist and proliferate in. </p>
<p>Technically I would still not consider that to be part of the central nervous system, because the CNS is &quot;just&quot; the brain and spinal cord. Even though the majority of cranial nerves originate from the brain stem, most of them are considered part of the peripheral nervous system. </p></div>		</li>
