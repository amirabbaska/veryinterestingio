			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm willing to say it's 100% biological. I had never met my father until I was 16. We became close way back when, and it turns out we laugh exactly the same. Truly identical. If we speak you can't even tell us apart of you aren't looking at us. It's crazy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal but when I was around 10 years old I found myself mimicking the laughs of the people I respected, my best friend at the time and later my stepbrother are some examples. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I've got my own laugh now, but who knows. Maybe I've added everyone's laugh to my portfolio and mix them all together for a new, but not original laugh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree - I've noticed my laugh changing over the years. Often I'll hear a person's laugh that sounds interesting, then later I kind of subconsciously adopt it. Strange</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you mean 100% genetic?  Because all of your behavior is 100% biological. </p>
<p>And I doubt any behavior is 100% genetic as we respond to environmental influences.  Although if there isn’t a strong environmental influence, any effect may be tiny. </p>
<p>If I hit you or ridiculed you every time you laughed as a kid, you wouldn’t laugh like your father does now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, we can't definitively say that our response to environmental influences isn't 100% genetic. You presuppose free will which is not a scientific fact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they're asking about different laughing styles, like the cackle, the snort, the Jimmy Carr, the Santa Claus, and why people adopt them...not about the social aspects of laughter.</p></div>		</li>
