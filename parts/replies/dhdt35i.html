<p>Not true. Google provides free browser-based document authoring software, which while not as feature-rich is fully capable of what Office does. Their most lack-luster product in the line-up is their PowerPoint competitor, but the rest is great.<br />

In the end, the tools used by the businesses of the world are going to be the best (or successors to the best) and they often come from large companies.</p></div>		</li>
