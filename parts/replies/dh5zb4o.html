			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Uranium is almost completely unharmful from a radiation standpoint.  Yes it can produce detectable radiation, but unless you live on top of a near surface deposit you will be fine (this situation does exist though).  In Arnhem Land in Australia, some regions were considered evil for millennia because people that stayed there long got sick; turns out it was uranium.  However, uranium is much more dangerous for heavy metal poisoning than radiation.</p>
<p>The reason uranium still exists is because it is not very radioactive.  Every element heavier than iron was created in the supernova over 5bn year ago.  Radioactive isotopes generated in that supernova have been decaying ever since.  The only ones still around are the ones so incredibly not radioactive that, even after 5bn years they haven't completely decayed away.  Compare that to something very very dangerous like Co-60 which is effectively completely gone in about 30 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Uranium is a heavy metal, and pretty toxic from a chemical perspective. The situation you described in Australia was more likely due to Uranium's biological toxicity than radiation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer, although to be specific my question was specifically regarding something refined enough for (chain reaction) fission rather than natural deposits. I'd presume the rate of decay increases to some extent in such materials. </p>
<p>Would for example an unused uranium fuel rod be able to be handled without (serious) health consequences from radiation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. U-238 (fertile) is about 6 times less radioactive than U-235 (fissile).  However, U-235 is 100000000 times less radioactive than Co-60 and only about 80% more radioactive than the potassium you eat all the time in bananas.  So yes, an ingot of natural uranium is less radioactive than an ingot of weapons grade uranium, but it still isn't that dangerous.  I've been a few feet away from an unshielded unused fuel assembly for 10 minutes or so and my TLD (personal radiation exposure meter) measured no exposure.</p>
<p>Enriched uranium requires care for criticality control.  If you assemble a critical mass, the radiation from fission and subsequent fission product decay will kill you. Also, uranium decays by alpha emission; alpha is very harmful but has basically no penetrating power.  Thus an alpha emitter on your skin is not a huge deal but ingested is bad.  Thus, similar to lead, you want to take precaution while handling it so that you don't get it on your hands and then get it in your mouth.</p></div>		</li>
