			<p>I'm sitting in on a cement chemistry course right now and from what we've learned, it would depend on the amount and composition of the gravel. The sand would lower the Ca/Si ratio, so you would have to add more limestone to get back to a standard portland cement composition. The problem is that if the gravel was some kind of feldspar, you may end up with too much sodium, potassium, and/or magnesium in the final cement. There's a decent amount of tolerance to these impurities in cement, so it would probably still work, but might set much more slowly or not meet construction standards.<br><br>EDIT: typos</p>		</li>

			<p>Typically basic additives in water accelerate cement setting, so having feldspar with alkali may cause the cement to set too quickly (flash setting).</p>		</li>

			<p>When alkali impurities are present in the Kiln they end up in solid solution with the C3S, and may change the polymorph and grain size that results on cooling. Some of these phases are less reactive than others, so it's not as simple as the pH.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fair enough. My experience is primarily in using cement as a raw material, not producing cement.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm going to piggyback your response. I'm a ceramic engineer that works with concrete type materials although primarily calcium-aluminate cement and not as much with Portland (calcium-silicate) which is in construction concrete.<br><br>There's nothing inherently impossible about recycling the cement out of concrete, it's just difficult to separate. When mixed with water, cement undergoes a chemical reaction to form multiple calcium silicate (or calcium aluminate) hydrate phases. This is where the strength comes from. The water that's now chemically bound to the cement will dehydrate and come off as water vapor if it's heated high enough. The different phases have different dehydration temperatures ranging from ~500 F to ~1200 F, so by heating to 1500 F you could conceivably drive off all of the water, cool it, crush it, and put it back into a cement kiln to be recycled and reused as cement.<br><br>There's not really a point to do that though, because there's a lot of sand and a lot of limestone in the world.</p>		</li>

			<p>Once cement has chemically reacted with water, the case is closed. It's not a reversible reaction.<br><br>Therefore, no hope to get back the magical powder we call cement.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's totally possible to get the water out. Heat it to 1500 F and the water will dissociate from the hydrate phases, leaving behind only the calcium silicates or calcium aluminates.</p>		</li>

			<p>You can get resilient water out, but the compounds left are calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide and silicon dioxide.</p>		</li>

			<p>Calcium hydroxide dehydrates at 954 F (512 C), leaving you with only CaO and SiO2, the raw materials of cement. </p>		</li>

			<p>Nope, cement is a component that undergoes a chemical reaction to form concrete. You can't just undo it.</p>		</li>
