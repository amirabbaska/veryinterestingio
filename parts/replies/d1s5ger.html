			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sitting in on a cement chemistry course right now and from what we've learned, it would depend on the amount and composition of the gravel. The sand would lower the Ca/Si ratio, so you would have to add more limestone to get back to a standard portland cement composition. The problem is that if the gravel was some kind of feldspar, you may end up with too much sodium, potassium, and/or magnesium in the final cement. There's a decent amount of tolerance to these impurities in cement, so it would probably still work, but might set much more slowly or not meet construction standards.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to piggyback your response. I'm a ceramic engineer that works with concrete type materials although primarily calcium-aluminate cement and not as much with Portland (calcium-silicate) which is in construction concrete.</p>
<p>There's nothing inherently impossible about recycling the cement out of concrete, it's just difficult to separate. When mixed with water, cement undergoes a chemical reaction to form multiple calcium silicate (or calcium aluminate) hydrate phases. This is where the strength comes from. The water that's now chemically bound to the cement will dehydrate and come off as water vapor if it's heated high enough. The different phases have different dehydration temperatures ranging from ~500 F to ~1200 F, so by heating to 1500 F you could conceivably drive off all of the water, cool it, crush it, and put it back into a cement kiln to be recycled and reused as cement.</p>
<p>There's not really a point to do that though, because there's a lot of sand and a lot of limestone in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's totally possible to get the water out. Heat it to 1500 F and the water will dissociate from the hydrate phases, leaving behind only the calcium silicates or calcium aluminates.</p></div>		</li>
