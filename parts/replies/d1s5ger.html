<p>There's nothing inherently impossible about recycling the cement out of concrete, it's just difficult to separate. When mixed with water, cement undergoes a chemical reaction to form multiple calcium silicate (or calcium aluminate) hydrate phases. This is where the strength comes from. The water that's now chemically bound to the cement will dehydrate and come off as water vapor if it's heated high enough. The different phases have different dehydration temperatures ranging from ~500 F to ~1200 F, so by heating to 1500 F you could conceivably drive off all of the water, cool it, crush it, and put it back into a cement kiln to be recycled and reused as cement.</p>
<p>There's not really a point to do that though, because there's a lot of sand and a lot of limestone in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once cement has chemically reacted with water, the case is closed. It's not a reversible reaction.</p>
<p>Therefore, no hope to get back the magical powder we call cement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's totally possible to get the water out. Heat it to 1500 F and the water will dissociate from the hydrate phases, leaving behind only the calcium silicates or calcium aluminates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, cement is a component that undergoes a chemical reaction to form concrete. You can't just undo it.</p></div>		</li>
