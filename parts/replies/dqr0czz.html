			<div class="markdown"><p>For the record, I’m having a migraine as we speak (I had to turn my car around on the way to work). The halos for me aren’t around lights, I get an actual physical manifestation of a pulsating black and white “light” or pattern in my eyes that grows over time. Like a hallucination almost. Point is, I’m not simply seeing an extra light or circle around other lights. I’m seeing something that simply doesn’t exist. It’s trippy in a pretty bad way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps a lot, it's very thourough. But just out of curiosity: How does the light and sound sensitivity that usually accompanies Migrane fit into this? And it seems pretty consistent, not depending on what the trigger was (as far as my own limited view).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The aura, most commonly visual disturbances are thought to occur as a result of the nervous disturbances due to a cortical spreading depression (CSD). CSD is a wave of electrically excitable neurons and their surrounding cells depolarising. Patients experiencing these auras also have changes on an MRI. </p>
<p>The pulsating throbbing felt along the temples is most likely due to the vasodilation of blood vessels caused by CGRP and other inflammatory compounds. </p></div>		</li>
