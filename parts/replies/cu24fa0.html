			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a college course in which we discussed reaction times. Apparently there was recently an Olympic race in which a sprinter was disqualified for a false start <em>even though he didn't move until after the gun</em>. It was determined that he had managed to time the start because his movement so quickly succeeded the gun that it couldn't have possibly been a reaction to the sound. We're talking a matter of hundredths of a second. Evidently, the IOC has done some studies to determine the limits of human reaction time with regards to sound as a stimulus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://cognitivefun.net/test/16" target="_blank">Here's an auditory reaction time test for anyone who wants to see how they stack up.</a></p>
<p>Pair it with a visual reaction time test like <a href="http://cognitivefun.net/test/1" target="_blank">this one on the same site</a> to see the difference. It's pretty cool. Your auditory reaction time should be significantly faster than your visual reaction time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the reason motorsports tend to have countdowns is because they often have starting grids rather than everyone at the starting line. If they just had a &quot;go&quot; and the car or bike in front had a slower reaction time compared to the cars behind it there could be an instant pile up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The delay leading to the start signal is randomized in many types of racing including F1, so they still have to react. The countdown is just like saying &quot;ready... set...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, there's sort of a countdown in F1 - there are five red lights which light up one after another - and when they go out, the racers go.</p>
<p>If there was a fixed timing between the five red lights and them going out, all the cars will just go together off the line, and you won't see Mercedes getting rekt by Williams (Silverstone) or Ferrari (Hungary) at the starts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Even as it is, starts on many kinds of auto racing are some of the most dicey parts.  F1 has lights that lead to the start, and it isn't uncommon for a car to have in issue on the start and cause mayhem.  In NASCAR, they have rolling starts, and the leader can choose when to restart within certain spots on the track.  If they don't go then, anyone can go.  And even with that, if a driver spins the tires or misses a gear, it's a big deal and often causes cars to crash or lose a ton of spots avoiding an accident.  Drag racing is the most similar to sprinters, but they have lights since you have to get the engine revved up before you can go.    </p></div>		</li>
