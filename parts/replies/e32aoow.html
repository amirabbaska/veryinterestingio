			<div class="markdown"><p>TBH this is fine. Even if there were 1000 combinations (not 10k or 100k), no burglar will stand at a door trying hundreds of keys until they find the one that works.</p>
<p>If the area is that lax about security that doing so will not cause someone to call the cops, the burglar would know that, and would gain entry with a crowbar instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, most standard door locks will have 4 or 5 pins, and each pin only has a limited number of different depths it can be cut to due to the tolerances they're machined to - this might be as few as six or seven for some of the more common locks. So the maximum number of possible key combinations is only going to be in the order of tens of thousands. The code number on the back is just the depth that each pin is set at so you can have a matching key cut without actually having an original key in the first place.</p>
<p>eta: the key code might not necessarily be the actual pin depths, but it'll be something that a locksmith can look up in a code table from the manufacturer which gives the correct depths to make each cut, which is just a way of adding a little bit of security through obscurity</p></div>		</li>

<p>be careful when throwing those packages away - not in the trash outside the house where the lock is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first car, in 2000, was an 89 Buick Park Avenue. It had a (round) door key and an ignition key (square), and you could start the car and remove the key from the ignition, and the car would keep running. This &quot;feature&quot; was instrumental in preventing college-aged and oft-distracted me from locking the keys in the car. Both ignition keys were very well-worn, as the car had previously been used to commute 30mi each way into the city and back, and my friend's father, who'd given it to me, had purchased it brand new. It was a boat, it was like driving my living room, but it was a solid first car.</p>
<p>During the summer between my sophomore and junior years at college, I parked my car in the employee parking lot of the strip mall where I worked, and spent my six hour shift in front of the store windows. When I left work, I walked down the row I'd parked in. I got much farther than I'd thought I should've been. I stopped, looked, and said&quot;dude... where's my car??&quot; </p>
<p>The cops drove me around the lot IN THE BACK OF THE CAR (&quot;are you <em>sure</em> you didn't park somewhere else today?&quot;) and my car was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>They found my car three days later in another strip mall lot. The thieves had rammed a screwdriver into the ignition and drive it away, right in front of my face, while I was at work. Several other brown, late-model sedans were stolen that day, in an attempt to pilfer the jewelry store in the strip mall where my car was found.</p>
<p>The kicker is that I was AT the second strip mall the day before I got the call, wondering if my car might possibly be there...</p></div>		</li>
