			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually saw a patent somewhere proposing different ways to change eye color, with actual injections of zinc, iron and gold being one of the methods discussed. I don't know if there's any current research around that patent. It'd likely be really unsafe to do this and even if you did, your body might try to clean it out anyway. Here is the patent if anyone is interested: <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US20120207809" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/patents/US20120207809</a></p>
<p>There's people who have gotten contact lens type implants to change eye color but the results are usually bad (health-wise) and there are a handful of people on YouTube who've shown how they needed to get them removed due to complications. </p>
<p>The best bet for anyone looking to change their eye color would be to wait for a method that is safe. It's probably possible within our lifetimes, but I don't know just how much research and development are going into it right now. The laser procedure is in Turkey and Spain I believe. I don't know how safe it is. Also, at this point it would be easier to come up with a way to lighten eye color by destroying pigment than to darken it or change eyes from blue-&gt; green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that gene expression changed. To put simply, we all have our own set of genes that do not change (there are some exceptions). However genes that are EXPRESSED change over time depending on loads of things. Genes can turn off and on at different parts of our lives (and day). Hormones are quite complicated and powerful, and the whole orchestra of hormonal changes during puberty put together can have some unexpected side effects from time to time. The same thing can happen with hair color and puberty (and hair color and aging!). Gene expression changes. There is likely a gene turned on/off (or multiple genes) that decreased melanin production and/or increased lipochrome production in your eyes during puberty. Why/how? Really hard to say! Bodies do weird stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can change with age, too. A lot of people in my family have brown eyes that turned into hazel as we got older. It happened to my mother, my brother, my grandfather, my uncle and myself. We were all born with dark brown eyes. My eyes are now a much lighter greenish/brown/amber color. They say it happens to 10-15% of Caucasian people as a result of age. It's similar to the hair losing melanin as we age. It's a neat effect. I'm not a fan of any other age changes, but this one, I like. </p></div>		</li>
