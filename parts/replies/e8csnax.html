			<div class="markdown"><p>As a side note, wood was not biodegradable for a long time in ancient Earth because the tiny microbes had not evolved to eat the lignin and cellulose that comprised the trunks and branches.  Fallen trees would pile on top of each other, compressing into peat and eventually into the coal we use today.  90% of the coal we use today dates back to this period of history where trees would not decompose.  Its called the Carboniferous period.</p>
<p>Another note, scientists are actively trying to create bacteria that are able to eat the plastics so that they can be degraded.  There was some news this past April where they created/stumbled upon an enzyme that does just that to the plastic PET.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I've heard about that.  It's obviously going to be great for the environment but terrible for a lot of the reasons we like to use plastic.  Non-biodegradable packaging is super important for a lot of stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, kinda. One of the biggest reasons we use plastic is price and the fact that food neither soaks through it nor does it soak into food. Cans are more expensive and energy intensive, wax paper doesn't really seal around the food, glass is also more expensive...</p>
<p>At my restaurant, we use &quot;styrofoam&quot; take out containers that are made of corn starch or so. They biodegrade in a year or so, apparently, but can hold food just fine for a few weeks. </p>
<p>Take wood - it's biodegradable, but we can build houses with it that last centuries. We have books made of paper which would dissolve in a week outside, but lasts thousands of years in a library. </p>
<p>So biodegradable plastic isn't inherently an issue if the timeline is longer than a week. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  This would pretty much defeat the purpose of using plastics to begin with.</p>
<p>It would be better to learn how to better recycle this material and then process it in an industrial environment to break it down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be careful of packaging that claims a product is &quot;biodegradable&quot;. The term was unregulated by the FDA or EPA for some time so not all products were actually eco-friendly, maybe compostable at best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that very little coal is being formed today? If we sit around for a few million years there won't be much &quot;new&quot; coal since the trees are decomposing instead?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  There are places like peat bogs that millions of years from now will turn into coal seams, but the scale is drastically reduced now that trees rot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say we find/develop yeast bros that like eating plastic. Once they've propogated across the world, is there a possibility that plastic would become useless because it just gets eaten?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar to paper.  Paper is biodegradable but we still use it for a lot of things.  Plastics would be far less useful as packaging for things we don't want stuff getting into (food, medical equipment ect) but still see uses.</p>
<p>So not completely useless but yes on being less useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like we're gonna find a bacteria that's just gonna be everywhere and survive anything, and even if it were, e coli is generally manageable despite being that way. </p>
<p>Most likely, we'd engineer something that eats PET in anaerobic conditions, for example. This would leave ABS plumbing or anything exposed to air just fine. We'd have to rethink how we use PET, but it would lead to both more use when we want things to not last forever, and less use when we want it to stick around. </p>
<p>A water bottle, for example, already has no bacteria inside it, so it wouldn't be an issue, and the outside would only biodegrade if you left it in a damp environment without oxygen, like underground. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is cardboard useless because it can get eaten?  Or wood furniture?
Biodegredation takes time to happen and requires water and sunlight to feed the microbes as well.  Plastics sitting in warehouses and controlled environments should be just fine for extended periods of time.</p></div>		</li>
