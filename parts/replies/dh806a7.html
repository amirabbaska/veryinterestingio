			<div class="markdown"><p>So i'm by no means an expert, and i doubt my answer even belongs here, but your question intrigued me. </p>
<p>As far as i know, humans do not like to be surprised. Music for example is all rythm based, as soon as you screw up the rythm in a song you will notice it and dislike it. </p>
<p>I think it's similar with pen clicking. If you hold the pen yourself, you know exactly when it's going to click. You expect a click and when the expectation is met your brain is satisfied. But if someone else clicks, it's out of nowhere, your brain is confused and dislikes the sound.</p>
<p>Anyways i'm probably wrong on a lot of my assumptions but it was fun to share my thoughts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father-in-law flew the charter plane for Yes' 30 cities 40 night tour back in the day. In conversations with the band, they told him, in concerts, music puts the crowd in a euphoric state. They would build the crowd up and up until the energy was at a tipping point. Then they would purposefully skip or mess up a beat to keep the crowd in check and bring them down a bit. If they didn't do that, that's when crowds turned and would get out of control and people get hurt.</p></div>		</li>
