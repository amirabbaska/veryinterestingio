			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I stuck my hand out of a spaceship window, and disregarding everything else that might happen, would it have a texture? Like if I wave my hand in front of me, there's a little bit of drag on it and I feel wind.
Does the interstellar medium feel different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 atom per cubic centimeter. It won't feel any different from the interplanetary space in the solar system. It's just a big nothing. It is not technically empty but for human scales it is very much empty. There is nothing there to touch, so you won't &quot;feel&quot; anything.<br />
But scientifically it is very interesting and not empty, like tvw said. Since Voyager 1 has &quot;left&quot; the solar system now it is in the interstellar medium and hopefully it can give us some in-situ data about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess this is what my question stems from. The way it reads, voyager 1 is entering some weird plasma substance and my brain interprets that Like itd have a viscosity to it.</p>
<p>But it seems rather its entering something even more empty than our space? And you can't literally feel interstellar wind?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess to get a more specific answer in regards to ops question: so you're going 35mph on earth and stick your arm out the window,  you feel the wind and force against your arm.  Would you feel any type of similar sensation were it possible to poke your arm out a slow moving spacecraft,  (ignoring the freezing or radiation  or dying stuff)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how fast you're moving. One atom per CC would feel like nothing if you flapped your arms around. But if you were moving very fast, say close to the speed of light, then the drag will become a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The drag is virtually zero, when you hit an atom it would be a little like being hit by alpha radiation, which consists of hydrogen cores, but at this low density it would be absolutely safe and assuming you put just your hand into space you wouldn't even need protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be cold to your bare hand?   With nothing to conduct away the heat except IR coming from your hand, how quickly would that feel cold?
(Different I expect in the sun's glare and out of it - in sunlight it might feel hotter than the hottest day on earth right?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spot on on all counts. What it would feel like to wave your arm around in a near perfect vacuum is pretty unknowable though.</p>
<p>On the direct sunlight point, satellites have to be designed with this in mind, and the materials you coat the satellite with are very important as each will have different absorption and emission spectra. Some satellites use a barbecue roll to maintain a constant average flux, which is where it spins on an axis normal to the sun vector, like a rotisserie chicken</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly the boiling of a little bit of moisture on your hands might feel cold. Also, boiling on surface of in eyes and orifices, which would hurt.(and cool down those areas) If your body gives to the pressure, presumably stuff would boil inside, not sure how that might work. Probably some fluids would preferably boil swelling those areas until your skin pulls tight and the pressure stops going down by expansion of the body. There might be leaks both orifices/ears/eyes, and  tears, but suspect things would hold together enough to slow the process down quite a bit.</p>
<p>That said, i wouldn't quite know.. Being a bit lazy, could take for instance estimate the 10^5 N/m² (hmm probably actually a bunch less) and approximate with a cylinder, and compare it with skin strength.(highly optimistic, but ballpark)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you ignore the whole vacuum thing (and the physiological effects that would have), it probably wouldn't feel like much at all. One of the big surprises in the early days of the manned spaceflight program was how much they had to cool the astronauts as they were working, precisely because the vacuum of space is such a good insulator. It's like being in the center of the universe's best thermos.</p>
<p>If you're in sunlight, it won't feel much different than being on earth. At earth orbit, the solar insolation from the sun is about 1366W/m^2. At the surface, this only drops to about 1000W/m^2. The challenge is rejecting that heat. In the case of your body, assuming the rest of you is in a thermally controlled environment, your blood flow will keep things from getting too warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a pet peeve of mine: Why is it that sometimes when genuinely smart people are asked hypothetical questions that have a basic premise​ that ignores reality (e.g. you die immediately in space without a suit), they claim the question is unanswerable and point out lack of information or how the question isn't based in reality as opposed to just answering the spirit of the question (or just not replying at all)?</p>
<p>The first comment in that linked post was basically &quot;saying the person isn't wearing a space suit isn't enough info. Since you didn't tell us things like the reflectivity of their clothes, we can't answer the question&quot;.</p>
<p>If you [the smart people kindly answering our absurd hypotheticals for our amusement] don't know how to answer the question, just say so - we don't know the answer either! Maybe getting to the answer would take too much time - that's fine too!  Too boring of a question? Ok, No hard feelings. Not enough info? Take some liberties and make assumptions. </p>
<p>No one is going to throw a live human in space and see how long it takes them to freeze to check your work. Some of us who don't know a lot about thermal loss in space are just curious as to how fast that could happen - seconds, minutes, hours, etc.</p>
<p>And seriously... The reflectivity of their clothes?!... If I put 3 ice cubes out in the desert sun, one inside a white shirt, one inside a black shirt, and one inside a cooler, I bet the two in the shirts melt at approximately the same speed (minutes) when compared to the cooler (hours).  However, I guess I may be missing how wearing one shirt vs another in space would drastically affect heat loss.........But I really doubt it.</p>
<p>Sorry, end of rant.</p></div>		</li>
