<p>Actually, in the episode, the point was that the strength of the bacteria colony is not based on whether your hands are relatively dirty or clean, but it's very much dependent on the bacteria fauna that you were introduced to when you were born and shortly after you were born. So in OP's case, even if the &quot;dirty hand&quot; touches the &quot;clean hand&quot;, if the child actually has stronger hand bacteria than the dad's hand bacteria, then eventually and very quickly the child's hand bacteria will grow back and take over, and you won't find much of the dad's weaker hand bacteria to stay after a very short amount of time. I think this is the reason why people shouldn't use antibacterial soap, because it actually decreases the immunity provided by natural bacterial found on the skin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much of the child's bacteria would have to be transferred to the dad in order to take over the dad's weaker bacteria completely? Wouldn't a family who kept close quarters all kind of normalize their colonies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the podcast, the colonies depend mostly on the mother, presumably her birth canal and her breast milk. But yeah being a family would normalize it to a degree. If I understand it correctly, transferred bacteria doesn't really take over that of someone else permanently, but the amount transferred depends mainly on the relative &quot;strength&quot; of who has a a stronger bacteria colony. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but the migration of bacteria, does it result in the number of bacteria on the dirty hand dropping, or does the bacteria reproduce quickly enough for that to not happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This episode was my immediate thought, but it does go a little further by stating that bacteria is unique from person to person. I love the idea that some scientist out there is academically studying &quot;cooties&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
