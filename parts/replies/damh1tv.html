			<div class="markdown"><p>It's shit similar to this that makes talking about writing and giving detailed critique confusing, because my skill at writing largely comes from reading voraciously and acquiring knowledge of How To English Good by osmosis. I can't fucking explain why a thing is wrong or why another thing is right, much less the words used to describe the things, but I sure can point out wrong things and convey how to make them right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm <em>exactly</em> the same way. It's frustrating because I wish I could articulate the different rules I'm going off of, but I can't do that because I've never been formally taught extensively with grammar. I just know how to alter erroneous text in accordance with what I <em>know</em> is right, based on the different grammar formulas I've absorbed from books. </p>
<p>I think the best way to put it all is &quot;language be cray&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

They can speak the language, know if something is right or not  but the why and how of so many things are almost subconscious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very, <em>very</em> simple explanation of one aspect of the science that is linguistics. </p>
<p>When you think of all the possible sounds that the human mouth can make (including, but not limited to: tongue clicks, pops, glottal stops, voiced/voiceless sounds like the difference between the and thesis - your tongue vibrates when you say &quot;the&quot; making it voiced) it takes lots of memorization and comprehension. </p>
<p>Look at <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Affricate_consonant" target="_blank">this Wiki article</a> on affricate consonant sounds. We've done a pretty good job of creating the rules for language sound creation but using them in conjunction with the rules of syntax and grammar make language so complicatedly beautiful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's strictly accurate to say the tongue vibrates in an appreciable way in that instance.</p>
<p>Voiced or unvoiced quality comes from vibration (or lack thereof) of the vocal cords.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is, does your bottom lip/top set of teeth vibrate differently or at all when you say /v/ or /f/? The same principle applies, just different articulators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't sound right at all; I pronounce &quot;see amy&quot; without any consonant between them, same with the rest.</p>
<p>It sounds to me like this might be confusion because the consonant represented by the letter &quot;y&quot; is pronounced similarly to the vowel &quot;ee&quot; and, similarly, the final sound of the &quot;oh&quot; diphthong is &quot;oo&quot; which is very similar to the pronunciation of the &quot;w&quot; consonant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The OP here isn't telling the whole story. In singing there are elided vowels and glottal vowels. They are interchangeable depending on the effect you're looking for. </p>
<p>Some people say &quot;See Amy&quot; and they re-articulate the A of Amy...that happens in the back of their throat and creates a glottal attack. Some people don't and add that &quot;Y&quot; in there, that is, they elide the two vowels.</p>
<p>Both are correct. Adding the elision is probably less formal. If you listen to someone trying to speak properly, they'll usually pronounce the words more articulately and therefore use more glottals. </p>
<p>In singing, they are used either way depending on the style of music.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont know how I would represent a soft y sound, but the sound is, IMO (not a linguist, just based on me saying it and having other people say it), definitely there.  If you were to say &quot;See Amy&quot; in conversation at a moderate pace, you can probably hear it</p>
<p>If you very deliberately say &quot;See Amy,&quot; as u/6deadkittensanally did, you won't here it.  Try writing out &quot;Do you want tea or coffee&quot; and have someone else say it as a test to hear the y sound between tea and or.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As one who used to mumble and is self conscious of how others hear him, I work hard on enunciating. But I sometimes think it may make me sound unnatural...robotic, or autistic.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you that the more you articulate the more robotic it sounds, but my guess is that when we are speaking &quot;formally,&quot; that is, trying to impress someone with our language skills, we probably over articulate. </p>
<p>BTW, say &quot;over articulate&quot; out loud...do you connect the R to the &quot;ar&quot; or do you re-articulate the &quot;ar?&quot; The first way has no break between the two words, the other one has a very small gap.</p>
<p>I don't think there's a rule for saying it one way or the other...</p></div>		</li>

<p>For &quot;over articulate&quot;, I'll try to say it with the gap. And I good point - the more formal the discussion, the more I'll pay attention to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rule is - when a word finishes with a consonant sound, and starts with a vowel sound, you transfer the last consonant sound to the start of the next word.</p>

<p>not into it = no tinto w it</p>
