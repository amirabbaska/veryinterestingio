			<div class="markdown"><p>Talc mines in various parts of the country have contained asbestos post-1970. Gouverneur Talc, Engelhard (Eastern Magnesia) to name a couple. I assume you got the 1970 date because of OSHA but they didn't really have a hand in talc exposure and it being contaminated with asbestos.</p>
<p>J&amp;J owned the Johnson Mine in Vermont and sold it to Eastern Magnesia in 1967. That mine has been confirmed to contain tremolite (asbestos). J&amp;J continued to operate their Hammondsville Mine near Reading, VT, for years after 1967 as their Windsor Minerals subsidiary. It was sold to Cyprus in the late 1980s but they Cyprus agreed to keep selling talc from this mine for years after.</p>
<p>The expert reports by geologists on the plaintiffs and defendants side do play a huge role in this litigation and affect the jury's perception of who's at fault. The main argument between experts is what constitutes an asbestos fiber when viewing it through a microscope using TEM. When you look at a suspected sample using TEM, is it an asbestiform particle (fibrous) or is it a cleavage fragment from a mass sample that just splintered off to resemble asbestiform particles? </p>
<p>Cosmetic talc products have never been comprehensively inspected by the FDA. Just look at the recent report about cosmetic imports. It's increased exponentially over the last couple decades and they don't have the manpower to fully inspect or analyze what's in this stuff. And we're dabbing it on our face and everywhere else. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points, many of which are news to me.  That being said, we already know that asbestos is a carcinogen. However, the quantities of asbestos in talc nowadays is likely to be rather small.  Asbestos is synergistically carcinogenic when combined with smoking for lung cancers.  The two main types of cancers for which large bodies of evidence exist are mesotheliomas and bronchogenic carcinomas.  However the carcinogenicity of asbestos for other types of cancers is not as well studied and quantitatively characterized notwithstanding the few studies that show there may be positive associations with ovarian and bladder cancers.   That being said, the best quality, most recent studies seem to show little risk of cosmetic talc use and endometrial cancers.  Therefore, it would stand to reason that if there is residual asbestos it is either too low concentration to be a problem, or it doesn't lead to a large number of endometrial cancers.  </p>
<p>That being said, it would certainly be of value to know what the h is in stuff we repeatedly put on our bodies as you said.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the association I was making was more of an inhalation hazard and not one proven to cause ovarian cancer. I also always think about all the old toll booth drivers that used to sit there all day breathing in asbestos brake dust from the cars stopping right in front of them; I wonder how likely they came down with mesothelioma. </p>
<p>But just because you and I didn't come down with a disease and was exposed to an identical substance, it doesn't mean that a product isn't dangerous. People have predispositions to various things and, like you said, other habits like smoking can cause a synergistic effect.</p>
<p>FWIW, I use Fresh Balls. Look it up! It's awesome. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Tiny crystals, all I can think of is this is one tiny insignificant thing that just stacks with all the other tiny insignificant things. Eventually, that DPS stacks high, not for everyone but still, how can we know what we inhale every single day... I recently found out I was exposed to heated lead paint fumes several times. Walking around breathing road or construction air, drinking water, eating bread, our lack of fucks given to quality of life and product is terrible. </p>
<p>sorry, I am just sad that there is a good chance I won't get to live to +250 the way humanity seems to be going.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Large penalties should be reserved for cases where there is very strong science like with cigarettes and lung cancer or asbestos and lung cancer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMHO, tort reform should require that such large awards address the <em>problem</em>, not to try and compensate a sole litigant for pain and suffering.  An award of nearly half a billion is just insane.</p></div>		</li>
