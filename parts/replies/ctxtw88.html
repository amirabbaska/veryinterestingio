<blockquote>
<p>This is a textbook example of the Red Queen hypothesis [and scarily of prey]?].
Australia isn’t as fertile as New Zealand. Large parts of Australia are inhospitable desert, where living is hard enough as it is. In order to prolong their survival, many species evolved venomous or poisonous traits. As their prey develops venom, hunters must evolve resistance to poison. This leads their prey to incorporate even stronger venom, leading to more resistance, and so on. This cycle leads to ever more venomous creatures.</p>
<p>Geological features such as deserts and isolation led Australian wildlife life down this venomous path.</p>

<p>As an aside, large parts of Australia are very fertile as well, less on average but more in total than NZ.</p></div>		</li>
