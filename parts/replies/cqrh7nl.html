			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think it could oscillate about its equilibrium point a bit.  Even in space, there will be friction/damping (such as in the flag's hooks or hinges), but it would presumably gather some inertia in a direction perpendicular to the direction of motion as it &quot;swings&quot; into place.  Without air to make it behave like a weather vane, it could take a while for this motion to dissipate.  Almost like a pendulum.  </p>
<p>So while it wouldn't &quot;flap&quot;, it could move around for a while when you change directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to put this into perspective...</p>
<p>At 1 AU, the pressure exerted by solar wind tops out at about 5 nPa. This means that if our flag is 1 m², and the flag's surface is all facing the sun,  the force will be about 0.5 ug. This is akin to taking a grain of sand, smashing it into 6 pieces, and <em>gently</em> spreading <em>one</em> of those pieces over the surface of the flag.</p>
<p>So given enough time, yes this will move the flag. However, if any other movements are made, even a hard drive spinning up in a laptop in the ship, the solar wind effect could easily by swamped by other forces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radiation pressure by the sun is much stronger than the pressure by solar wind: About 5 µPa at 1 AU (for a perfectly absorbing flat flag).
A 1 sqm flag weighing 100 g floating besides your very heavy space ship would lag behind 10 cm after one minute, 324 m after one hour and 190 km after one day.</p></div>		</li>
