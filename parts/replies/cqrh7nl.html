			<div class="markdown"><p>No; because the flag is not rigid, the starting and stopping will cause compression which will create waves that change the direction of the energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think it could oscillate about its equilibrium point a bit.  Even in space, there will be friction/damping (such as in the flag's hooks or hinges), but it would presumably gather some inertia in a direction perpendicular to the direction of motion as it &quot;swings&quot; into place.  Without air to make it behave like a weather vane, it could take a while for this motion to dissipate.  Almost like a pendulum.  </p>
<p>So while it wouldn't &quot;flap&quot;, it could move around for a while when you change directions.</p></div>		</li>
