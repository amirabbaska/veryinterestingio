			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I think you should be doing a number of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Encouraging kids to ask questions, and help guide them to find answers.. The questioning in some sense is more important. </li>
<li>Help kids confront their own misconceptions.. there is a lot of data that suggests this is really the only way we internalize knowledge and learn. It also demonstrates to them that science differs from religion by being falsifiable... that is a key fact, they we/they can make predictions and test them. Nature then decides what works.</li>
<li>
<p>Help motivate them to ask questions about nature by discussing the really exciting things happening at the forefront of science.  I find that most people are really interested in science, but they don't know it is science they are interested in.. so try and connect what you do in class to the things that might interest them.. whether those things come from science fiction, daily life, or the news. </p>
</li>
<li>keep up the good work.. you are our front line!</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, specifically, what can we do to convince people that science is not a belief in the same way religion is? How do we show them it's not a collection of scientists-on-high dictating what should be believed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We point out that science differs from religion in that while both tell stories about nature, only one makes predictions you can test.. And the story of science changes.  That is why my new book is called The Greatest Story Ever Told.. So Far.  This is because the story science tells not only changes, it gets better all the time as we learn new things, whereas religion tells the same old story, and that story reveals nothing new about nature, and generally contradicts what we have discovered.. after all for the 3 major world religions, the stories were invented before we even knew the Earth orbited the Sun..  But ultimately show examples of how we have changed our views about nature as experiments have revealed new things to us.. So that we force our views/beliefs to conform to the evidence of nature, rather than vice-versa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But with that changing story, you get things like scientists can't make up their minds. If you're judging it as a religion which is expected to provide a single final answer, then it is bound to not meet your expectations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you fail them? Preventing them from advancing without their science prerequisites? </p>
<p>Or alternatively, if they are completing their work and passing the exams, do we hope some of it sticks and that they may be enlightened later in life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we are teaching kids in order to help them be life-long learners, then the facts aren't important.. we have google for that.. What we need to teach them is how to ask good questions, and how to distinguish sense from nonsense, to filter the information they get from the internet, and of course we have to help motivate them to keep asking questions throughout their entire lives.  </p></div>		</li>
