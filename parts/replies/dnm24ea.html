			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, intrusive thoughts, as an OCD sufferer I know these all too well.</p>
<p>Before receiving treatment (<a href="https://iocdf.org/about-ocd/treatment/erp/" target="_blank">exposure-response prevention with an OCD therapist</a>), they would absolutely ruin days/weeks of my life as I searched for certainty that I couldn't <em>possibly</em> act on any of them. My brain would go in loops for hours reviewing the thoughts, checking to see how I felt about them, seeking reassurance by googling things, etc.</p>
<p>A few fun facts about them - the harder you try to make them go away, the more likely it is your brain starts to think &quot;boy, this sure must be important, I'm going to bring them up more so I'm prepared for what to do if it happens!&quot; The key is to let them float in and out of your mind as best as possible, the less reaction, the better. We have 10,000-20,000 thoughts a day, most are junk mail, these are no different, no matter how abhorrent.</p>
<p>If anyone here is reading the above, and thinking that they've dealt with severe anxiety surrounding the thoughts, I highly suggest you look into some of the symptoms of OCD. There is evidence-based treatment (backed by real science, less fluff) to help reduce the anxiety associated with intrusive thoughts.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a bit of a question... (probably more of a ramble) but does me overthinking every little thing until it gives me some sort of negative thought about myself or others count as OCD? I mean just yesterday I told a stupid little lie that probably made me come off stupid and it has been stuck in my mind ever since, with me trying to think of things I could have said instead and how much better it would have been if I never said anything and it makes me really depressed for literally no reason... This happens to me a lot, when something is happening that I want to stop I overthink about what would happen if I did say it and overthink about what I should do. Sometimes I actually fear my own mind and want to be distracted from it in different things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, I'm not a psychologist, so please don't take anything I say more serious than just some random person on the internet chiming in.</p>
<p>But there is a theme in OCD that deals with similar thought patterns, reviewing interactions and then casting doubt on yourself or wishing you would have said something else. I was in a support group for OCD a while back, and one of the people in the group would review every interaction they had with others to make sure they didn't say anything &quot;dumb,&quot; and if they did say something &quot;dumb,&quot; they'd dwell on it for hours, sometimes even taking corrective action to &quot;make it better,&quot; e.g., they'd call the person and apologize for saying something &quot;dumb,&quot; which, as you can guess, made them look even dumber. </p>
<p>One of their therapeutic exposures was intentionally saying &quot;dumb&quot; things in occasional conversations to get their mind used to it to lessen the anxiety over time.</p>
<p>Again, I'm in no capacity to suggest you do/do not have OCD, but I would consider reaching out to a therapist if you're concerned about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never brought this up ever in my life, This post and thread will probably be the only time I'll ever mention the topic but i suffer from this almost daily. I apologize for formatting, in laying in bed with my wife as she's watching la la land on my phone.</p>
<p>This happens to me all the time, I have no mental conditions other then intense laziness. I'm 28 married with 2 kids and I adore my wife more then anything. I'll be doing the dishes and think about getting THAT phone call from paramedics or many other situations. Other times I think about something possibly happening to my boys. Sometimes I cry, other times I realize my mind is playing games with me. While I've thought about seeking more info about it to make sure I'm ok, I think I actually like it. When an event happens and I've realized it, when I see my wife or kids I'm flooded with emotions of happiness and appreciation for what I have in my life. Not a day goes by where my wife ever doubts what she means to me. Having these thoughts keeps me in check for what I have to lose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a video once if a guy taking about how Samurai would meditate before battle and imagine all the ways they could die. This way they didn't have as much fear of the &quot;unknown&quot; in battle. I think our brains do this as well. </p>
<p>It happens to me a lot. Not only other people, but I imagine what some family members emotions would be if I got seriously hurt. I find it weird that I feel more bad about causing others emotional pain because of something happening to me. Even if it's something I wouldn't be able to control. Even if the result meant I wouldn't ever be able to see that pain they were feeling. </p>
<p>It almost makes me want to not do anything. Not because I'm afraid of getting hurt, but because I don't want others to feel pain from me getting hurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a boat trip a few weeks ago, and another woman on board was carrying a baby. I <em>could not stop</em> picturing her accidentally dropping her baby over the side. It was honestly disturbing. I told my boyfriend I couldn't stop thinking about it, and asked what was wrong with me, and he said &quot;I've just been sitting here thinking about what would happen if a wave capsized the boat right now.&quot;</p>
<p>So, you know, it's completely possible your wife was thinking something equally messed up at the time! Brains are just weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you that there are some things that we should generally keep to ourselves. The content of some intrusive thoughts don't necessarily have to be shared, especially when they're the ones about a specific person (violent or sexual).</p>
<p>However, I agree that we should try to move past the taboo about talking about them in a <em>general</em> sense. A lot of people have these thoughts and worry that they make them a bad person. I know of at least one friend who was genuinely concerned because they thought they were a psychopath or something.</p>
<p>I think it would help some people to know that the thoughts they randomly experience sometimes aren't abnormal; they're something that we all get sometimes, and you don't need to be ashamed of them. </p>
<p>But yes, it's probably best to not tell someone &quot;ya I can't get the thought of <violent or sexual act> you out of my head, how annoying&quot;. But it'd be nice if we could maybe say &quot;I find that I get intrusive thoughts while I'm doing <some random activity or something>. Do you have any tricks for getting them out of your head or distracting yourself from them?&quot;</p>
<p>Just my thoughts! Admittedly it might be a bit difficult to talk about them without getting into specifics and creeping people out, but it would be nice to sometimes have that reassurance that you're not alone and you're not crazy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've wondered the same about myself in the past, then I figured if I <em>were</em> a socio/psychopath I likely wouldn't be concerned about it in the first place, so I'm probably good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I completely agree with you. Some things are better left unsaid for sure. </p>
<p>So, when I was in grad school I was focusing on sexology of literature, and my best friend’s dad, whom I’d known for 23 years, was about to embark on a post-grad journey into sexology. I had terrible parents, so he and his wife were like my ideal parents, and I really looked up to them. As such, I was completely comfortable having academic conversations about sexuality with him. One night we were actually discussing compulsion and sexually intrusive thoughts, and it all turned personal instead of theoretical and academic, and he basically told me he has sexually intrusive thoughts about everyone, and he always has. Especially his brother, sister, and cousins when he was a teen, and that, in his sixties, he’s now into young girls. The cherry on an awkward cake was when he told me he’s had repeated intrusive thoughts about wanting to fuck me. </p>
<p>He became so comfortable with discussing sex, sexuality, and the study thereof, that he sort of forced his lack of taboo upon his audience, which happened to be me that night. His argument was that those impulses are nothing to be ashamed of, and that we should share these things to identify with others and help them to identify with us. </p>
<p>I’m not a psychologist, but I feel like, when I have intrusive thoughts, it feels like a healthy reaction to automatically feel a twinge of shame, even if I know I would never act on those thoughts. Whether he meant to suggest he actively wanted to have sex with me or not, it made me feel uncomfortable to have a father figure say that to me. It ended up making his wife uncomfortable. When I told my best friend, it made her uncomfortable, and made her think I deserved it because “what else is going to happen when you talk to a man about sex?” Long story short, it caused problems. </p>
<p>Some thoughts are naturally repulsive, if not to you, than perhaps to your audience who is not in your head and able to read your intentions or the context of your thoughts. Keep some shit to yourself, or speak to a professional, not the subject of your intrusive thoughts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in New York City when I was 23 and as I left the subway, there was 40+ year old man telling me he could kill me right there on the spot and I wouldn't be able to stop him. He didn't follow through with that (obviously), but it most certainly didn't make me like him more...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as uncomfortable as it made you, maybe it was a good thing because now you at least know the truth. Idk, its hard to say because like you said, thats basically a 23 year relationship that is now probably at best, pretty awkward and stressful to maintain, if not ruined. </p>
<p>There are lines though with truth, and in that context it was definitely not appropriate for him to say any of that to you, i suspect it was far less about adding to the discussion as it was about him trying to make a confession and hoping that you reciprocated his thoughts. &quot;testing the waters&quot; in a discussion where he can play it off as just part of the topic. to be blunt, it sounds like hes a horny old man.</p>
<p>the one thing i will say in devils advocate, is if you are an attractive young girl, you can't really blame the guy for having the thoughts. i don't see it as unnatural for a guy of any age to see a beautiful girl and desire her, but definitely something he shouldn't entertain as a possibility or something to act on, especially in the context of being a surrogate father to you. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That being his mistake. It was his error in judgement to believe that he could openly talk about things with someone who he assumed to be as comfortable as he felt.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>why? You yourself mentioned that you'd never act on them. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some thoughts are naturally repulsive, if not to you, than perhaps to your audience who is not in your head</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then isn't it the audience that needs to attempt to dispassionately process the statements which are said &quot;matter-of-factly&quot; (provided there was some context)? If you felt that his disclosure was devoid of context and ended with him rambling to the point of not adding anything to the discussion you were having, you could have told him you're not interested? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in adult mental health for two years.  While I was there, one of the things we encouraged was the patients to speak about their thoughts and emotions, but sometimes that wasn't done very.....tactfully.  We had a young college intern in the building and she and I (male) were having a conversation with a patient when he said very calmly and matter-of-factly, &quot;I'm thinking about raping you.&quot;  She got up and walked out and never came back.  FWIW, he didn't have a violent history, just schizophrenic. </p></div>		</li>

I have a very close friend who is in mental health field. She used to work in clinics with quite severe cases. Being a very beautiful girl did not help and patients would say really nasty things to her. Part of her training was dedicated on handling/distancing herself from patients comments and it took a while for her to learn to do it.</p></div>		</li>
