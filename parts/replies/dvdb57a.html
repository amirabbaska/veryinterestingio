			<div class="markdown"><p>From the answers in here it sounds like your body doesn't create more fat cells when you gain weight, they just grow. Then they shrink when you lose weight. The number of cells doesn't change much in either process</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The number of fat cells in your body remains constant throughout your adult life, a new study has found. The discovery suggests that the process of weight gain may be fundamentally different in adults and in children.</p>
<p>Adults who gain or lose weight may do so through changes in the size of the fat cells, also called adipocytes, that constitute fatty deposits in the body. Children, on the other hand, may put on extra fat by increasing the overall number of these cells in the body.</p>
<p>This may mean that people who got fat during childhood may find it more difficult to shift the weight later in life, compared to those who piled on the pounds as adults, suggests Kirsty Spalding of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, who led the new research.</p>
<p>Although the number of fat cells remains constant in adulthood, Spalding and her team found that it is not the same cells persisting for ever. There is a dynamic process of cell death and replenishment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, new cells aren't created. A fat cell can stretch up to 100× bigger than it's original state as more fat accumulates in a bubble inside it. Imagine if your whole body grew 100X bigger than it currently is...think about what your new height would be. Same principle with fat cells. Does that make it easier for you to understand how the same amount of fat cells can be present even in a very heavy person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best way to think about is like a chain. You can remove links easily but the more you remove the harder it gets to remove the next one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and those cells take place in the hormone signalling that makes you feel hungry.</p>
<p>Gaining weight after it's been lost is much easier than gaining it the first time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a set amount of fat cells. If you continue to gain fat, they fill up and more are created. When you lose fat, they shrink but the amount if fat cells stay with you. </p></div>		</li>
