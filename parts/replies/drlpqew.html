			<div class="markdown"><p>All combat is an exercise in resource management - you don't use flares when chaff is needed, because you might need the flares later.<br />
Combat aircraft have threat warning systems that analyse things like incoming radar transmissions and missile heat plumes to make an estimation of the likely threat so the pilot can select the appropriate countermeasure.<br />
An active radar guided missile emits radar directed at the target, and is sensitive to Electronic CounterMeasures (ECM) and chaff.<br />
A passive radar guided missile detects the radar reflection off the target from a powerful airborne or ground-based radar transmitter. The radar is not initially targeted directly at the plane, so the threat warning systems may not detect the emissions. ECM is also much less effective against this sort of system due to transmitter strength. The missile may switch to active radar for terminal guidance (from the missile or directly targeted radar from the transmitter), and ECM/chaff is used then, but it may be too late at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radar missiles require radar energy to be &quot;painting the target&quot; </p>
<p>They can't see the target unless someone is shining a big flashlight of radar energy at them. That can be the radar on an anti-aircraft missile platform or an airplane or a ship, or even the missile itself but something has to be doing it, and that's detectable with a device called a &quot;radar warning receiver&quot; </p>
<p>With an IR missile, it's just looking for the radiation the target is giving off naturally, think of it as the target is just glowing in the dark, so there's no way (well, there are a few very high tech sensor systems that look around in all directions for a missile launch) for it to know something is coming after it unless it happens to see a missile launch. </p>
<p>Flairs fortunately are cheap and small so an aircraft will just drop them periodically when it thinks it might have been targeted. </p></div>		</li>
