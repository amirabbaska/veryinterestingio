<p>Numbers are still the same numbers regardless of what base they are in. Different bases don't change the underlying numbers. The only difference is in how you <strong><em>write</em></strong>, or describe that number.</p>
<p>The number 1 will always represent one &quot;thing&quot;, no matter what base you use to describe it. Same with the number 2, or 10, or 20, etc. </p>
<p>In the same vein, pi will always represent the number of times the diameter of a circle fits around the circumference, and no matter how you talk about it, that will never be a &quot;rational&quot; number of times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still an irrational, transcendental number. It's just written as &quot;10&quot; in base pi. &quot;Irrational&quot; and &quot;transcendental&quot; describe properties of the numbers, not of how they are represented.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What they are trying to explain is that there is a difference between what the number <em>is</em> and how it is represented. Though pi might <em>seem</em> rational in a base-pi (since it would be represented by 10), the number pi <em>itself</em> will always be irrational, since a pi number of pizza is and always will be 3 whole pizza plus another .1415... even if your society operates in a base-pi algebraic system and you ordered &quot;10&quot; pizza.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's confusing base with scale. Base 10, or 6, or 16 just refers to the way the numbers are represented (as in, when to add another digit). It doesn't say anything about the values. 1 is 1 is 1.</p>
<p>You can use a scale where 1 = pi, but that just means that your digits are all products of an irrational unit instead of the identity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. As others have said in this thread, you can use base pi and represent pi as 10. But it's not really meaningful. It's all notation--different ways of writing the same idea.</p>
<p>You could write pi as Bleeb in base Blorb, and it wouldn't change the nature of the number. Notation is completely arbitrary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is covered elsewhere in the thread.  First off, pi in base pi would be 10, not 1.  Secondly, changing the base doesn't change what integers are, therefore you still will not be able to find 2 integers (a, b) s.t. pi = a/b, therefore pi will still be irrational.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can such a thing as &quot;base infinity&quot; exist? Or similarly base 1.</p>
<p>Is there a way of understanding numbers and their properties without having to resort to typographical arguments. </p>
<p>For example, as best as I understand it, Cantors diagonal argument depends on base/method of writing. However, if every number could be expressed as a single character or merely itself then the process for determining if the created number is not on the list explodes.</p>
<p>Other proof by contradiction arguments I've read also depend, based on my understanding, on typography/representational methodology.</p>
<p>The corollary to this question in my mind is reconciling finite length on the integer side of a decimal and infinite length right of a decimal. This seems problematic to me for some reason. I would tend to think if you can have infinitely long numbers at all, it should have to be possible on both side of the decimal.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for taking the time to answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess theoretically you could, but at that point everything is completely different and the numbers no longer have an actual meaning.  1 is really the only number that is defined in math.  </p>
<p>And yes, you could have a base 1, the tally system is a perfect example.  I guess theoretically you could have a base infinity too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a pretty big simplification and isn't the real &quot;genius&quot; of the proof. The core idea is that by keeping a list of all the numbers seen so far, you can always construct a new number that isn't on the list yet, and <strong>therefore the list is unbounded</strong>.</p>
<p>You're right that it's <em>reliant</em> on the base of writing, but I would argue that it just <em>utilizes</em> it, like how this comment of mine <em>utilizes</em> English. I could have written it in German like Cantor, but the argument doesn't change.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I don't think you understand how Cantor chooses the diagonalized number. If every number on your list is represented by a single character, what number would you even create? </p>
<p>Cantor's solution depends on putting the numbers into binary. That way, every digit of the number can be deterministically modified by flipping it between 0 or 1. If every number was a single unique character, you'd have no way to construct a new number, regardless of how you would check if it was on the list.</p>
<p>Think: it's called <strong>diagonalization</strong>. You've created a table with n rows and only 1 column. There's no diagonal in your matrix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, I really do understand Cantor. My rub is that I don't understand in terms of 1) base being irrelevant to what a number actually is 2) how base 1 or base infinite enters in to the argument.</p>
<p>From my perspective, it moves the question towards the philosophy side of things where you have to figure out what the hell talking about number and base 1 or base infinity even means.</p>
<p>I get that the argument us beautiful. It is elegant and makes a certain good sense. For me to buy it as true (I have a natural, sensible utter distrust of proof by contradiction, especially when infinity is concerned) I need to understand the two exceptional cases I've pointed out.</p>
<p>Look. I get that it might strike you as nitpicking or just internet ignorant... but I'm a reasonably well read guy who has spent some time trying to understand this stuff. I happen to think it is more complicated than I'm consistently led to believe. From my perspective, Cantor is making an argument about the size if infinity by first assuming infinitely many infinitely long numbers which undergo and infinitely long process... and then makes conclusions about infinity and it's size. It strikes me as a circular argument that begs the question &quot;how many numbers are in infinity?&quot;</p>
<p>So... if you have some insight, above just patronising me, or something I can read that might address my questions, I would very much appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Base infinity&quot; is not a well defined concept in the real numbers, because infinity isn't one. In other systems you could interpret this to define a (not necessarily meaningful) base.</p>
<p>Base 1 (unary) is possible. Counting to 10 goes as such:</p>
<p>1; 11; 111; 1111; 11111; 111111; 1111111; 111111111; 111111111; 1111111111.</p>
<p>Cantor's diagonal argument doesn't necessarily depend on base. In fact, it's arguably simpler to express in binary: assume the reals are enumerable. Enumerate them as a list of numbers S(n). Define a new number whose <em>n</em>^(th) digit is defined by changing the <em>n</em>^(th) digit of S(n) to 1 if it's 0 or vice versa. Your new number isn't on the list, so you did not enumerate the reals. Contradiction. Because the order of enumeration is assumed to be random the actual numbers themselves don't matter, only that you have some way to uniquely write any real number and to change each digit into a different digit. So, as far as I can tell, this works theoretically in any base with multiple digits. Not sure how I'd go about phrasing it in unary to be honest.</p>
<p>A number with infinitely many digits to the left of the decimal place is infinitely large. The real numbers contain no infinite numbers.</p>
<p>A number with infinitely many digits to the right of the decimal place is only finitely large and is usually defined as the value which a particular series converges to; we define the value to arbitrary precision then derive its base 10 representation procedurally. </p></div>		</li>
