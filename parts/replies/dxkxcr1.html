			<div class="markdown"><p>nope, unless it is vaccum sealed. The water leaves the damaged cells (ice needs more room, breaks up the cells) and sublimates out. The damaged cells are now open to oxygen entering the cells, oxidizing and damaging everything in their path. That oxidation alters the taste of the things we taste. For example, fat gets rancid, even if the fat in the cells was a tiny amount. Also, as shiningPate mentioned, the volatile (the taste stuff that can get soluble in air) will leave the cracked open cells, too. </p>
<p>Examples for extremely volatile compounds: Wasabi, horseradish, mustard (if you eat it, you can feel them in the nose), just to name a few. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, air-tight seals - isn't that most stuff people put in the freezer? Note this thread is regarding frost from the inside of the freezer, not inside containers within it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Compounds (water, flavors, etc.) move through plastic packaging at various rates depending on the type of plastic used in the package. It’s usually a relatively low rate, but most people don’t scrub out there freezers ever, so the compounds build up over time. Unless you store all your frozen foods in perfectly sealed glass containers you’ll experience some amount of flavor scalping, which is then available to react and migrate into other foods as other posters have mentioned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't this be far outweighed by unsealed odours, such as the sweat and BO of the people opening the freezer and letting in moist slightly smelly air? I'm finding this question far more interesting than OP's.</p></div>		</li>
