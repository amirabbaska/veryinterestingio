			<div class="markdown"><p>My kids (7 and 4) are mine biologically yet still call my husband and I (their parents) by our first names.  </p>
<p>The oldest one was cycling through what he wanted to call me when he was really little (mamma, mom, mommy, etc) and he eventually got to &quot;Sarah&quot; and just stuck with it.  When our second was born , he followed suit.  It doesn't bother me at all, but it REALLY bothers a lot of people and the general consensus is &quot;I can't believe you let them do that!!&quot; and/or &quot;Doesn't that hurt your feelings??&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm watching my 1-year-old learn to talk right now, and amidst his babbles, it's easy to make out the &quot;ma&quot; and &quot;da&quot; sounds. The desire to communicate with this little human is so strong, that we encourage him to connect those sounds with us. It's easy to see why parents want to be called by name, my theory is that over time, parents have claimed the first sounds that comes out of the baby's mouth. </p></div>		</li>
