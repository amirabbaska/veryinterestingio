			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, here's a quote from Demon-Haunted World by Carl Sagan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Far from being global, such alien abduction stories are disappointingly local. The vast majority emanate from North America. They hardly transcend American culture. In other countries, bird-headed, insect-headed, reptilian, robot, and blond and blue-eyed aliens are reported (the last, predictably, from northern Europe). Each group of aliens is said to behave differently. Clearly cultural factors are playing an important role.</p>
<p>Long before the terms “flying saucer” or “UFOs” were invented, science fiction was replete with “little green men” and “bug-eyed monsters.” Somehow small hairless beings with big heads (and eyes) have been our staple aliens for a long time. You could see them routinely in the science fiction pulp magazines of the ’20s and ’30s (and, for example, in an illustration of a Martian sending radio messages to Earth in the December 1937 issue of the magazine Short Wave and Television ). It goes back perhaps to our remote descendants as depicted by the British science fiction pioneer, H. G. Wells. Wells argued that humans evolved from smaller-brained but hairier primates with an athleticism far exceeding that of Victorian academics; extrapolating this trend into the far future, he suggested that our descendants should be nearly hairless, with immense heads, although barely able to walk around on their own. Advanced beings from other worlds might be similarly endowed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a tendency of people who collect and report abductee stories to edit those stories and make them more palatable.  Like a <strong>huge</strong> number of American abductees have reported meeting Jesus Christ on spaceships, but that somehow never makes it into the lore, because the target audience for this stuff is mostly atheistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting though, like what if aliens have read our religious texts and so to make abductees feel safe with them they make it seem like Jesus is there and cool with this whole thing, or perhaps to make abductees think it was actually a religious experience they were going through instead. I don't think this is happening at all and I do think it's all hallucinations, but if it were happening it would make some type of sense in a way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or maybe the aliens take the place of gods to instill fear and use humans as slave labour. So, for instance, the pyramids <em>were</em> built with alien technology, but also slaves that feared and worshipped the aliens as gods because of the technology that looked like magic. Maybe a lot of gods were like that, so like Thor is really one of the tiny grey alien types.</p>
<p>The whole galaxy is a vast network of empires, each system ruled by its own system lord. Ships would probably be too slow, though, they'd have to have some kind of wormhole network based on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading an interview with a UFO researcher who related an interesting story about a promising-sounding abduction.  Everything sounds classic, one for the books, until the guy mentioned that on the UFO he encountered Elvis sitting in a chair next to a nice fire.  Yeah, close the book.  Apparently this is how you tell a nut-job from a 'genuine abductee', but my take-away was 'this is how the UFO guys end up with tons of reports that sound eerily similar'.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember the commentary on the DVD correctly, it was intentional.  That's part of the reason they went with the Delorean because it sort of looked like a UFO when they admitted that some sort of tank treaded vehicle would have been a more logical ground vehicle for Doc to have used.  </p></div>		</li>
