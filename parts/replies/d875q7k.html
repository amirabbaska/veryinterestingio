			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to add to this as an amateur singer one of my greatest revelations was when I found that singing at certain timbres / different tonalities made it harder for my voice to cut through the other instruments (this is something that I also know from guitar playing) and when I found the right tonality of voice, it was much easier for me to hear when I was in tune. </p>
<p>Grappling with the changes in my perception of pitch with changes of tonality has been a big struggle for me in learning music. Some songs are sung in such a way I can easily hear and match their notes, mostly pop music and thing clearly sung, while others, like rock, can be much harder due to the tonalities used. </p>
<p>So there's some validity to the concern of hearing it different in your head - if you aren't very experienced. I used to practice singing against a wall or in my car so I could more clearly hear my voice reflecting off a solid surface rather than just the voice in  my head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You change the location you're singing at - it's hard to describe but you can let your voice resonate higher up into your nasal passage, or further down in your chest, this can be referred to as 'head voice' and 'chest voice' sometimes. </p>
<p>Head voice will give you a higher frequency tone as well as higher pitch notes. Chest voice the opposite. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you hear yourself recorded, like in a voicemail you left, it sounds very different. Like a different person. A trumpet would think it sounds like another instrument, a flute was used here. It's talking about instruments like they're people, an example of anthropomorphism. Therein lies the comedy. A trumpet isn't going to make a call, leave a voicemail, listen to it, think it's another instrument, or even think at all. It's an inanimate object. It does not have any of these capabilities. Now laugh. There ya go! You got the joke!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. That's why voice teachers and high quality recordings are so important. Good singing is less about what sounds good to you, and more about what sounds good to others. </p>
<p>Example: young singers will often try to create a bigger, more mature tone by focusing vocal placement in the back of the throat. This sounds dark and powerful to the singer, but to the listener it sounds like Patrick Star or Kermit the Frog. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. And why it's extremely useful to record all vocal lessons and go back after and listen to the differences in tone and placement as an observer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I actually do want to learn how to sing I'm going to have to have a live voice teacher who can listen to me and give live correction, right? YouTube could teach me the academics and theoretical mechanics, but only a living ear could help me properly set my voice. Correct? </p>
<p>Both of my parents are theater geeks from way back when and they can both belt it out. I perceive my voice to be naturally dark and gravelly, but I've got this GIANT beak and I know most of my voice comes out of it.  In reality its probably a cross between George Burns and Kermit. And I cant hold a tune for the life of me. Does this mean I need to ask my parents for lessons?</p>
<p>Edit; picture a sexy Frank Oz and you'd be close.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When learning an instrument, it helps to &quot;internalize&quot; pitches and intervals between pitches.</p>
<p>This means you can actually imagine the pitch in your mind. Then you sing it through your instrument.</p>
<p>It's the same way with singers, even more so since their instrument is their body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting... i didn't realize there was a name for it, but this is what i've been doing for years.  it's always made it easier for me to sing along with the music in my head rather than trying to be the one making the music.  i don't have perfect pitch because i can't say &quot;this is an A&quot; and hear that tone in my head, but i have relative pitch and phenomenal melodic memory.</p>
<p>i also learned how to match my singing to the vibrations coming from the equipment when i can't hear myself.  if it literally &quot;feels&quot; right, i'm in key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true I'm a new singer and every lesson my teacher asks me to find an A more specifically an A3. I have a low set voice with a range of C2-G4. I know how the note A3 feels and how I need to manage my air to hit it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about how an acoustic guitar sounds very different if you are standing behind the player (and hence the sound hole) rather than the front.</p>
<p>It sounds deeper, muffled etc but the notes/chords themselves sound the same. </p></div>		</li>
