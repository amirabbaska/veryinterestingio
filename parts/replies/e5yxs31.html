			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on autonomic disreflexia: it's not uncommon to see it occurring based on little things that an uninjured person wouldn't expect. When I worked in neurological rehab, we'd check patients exhibiting signs of autonomic disreflexia for things like;  the shoes may be too tight, there may be a wrinkle in the fabric they're sitting on, bladder/bowel needs may need to be met, toenails too long and impacting the shoe. </p>
<p>The &quot;perceived danger&quot; that OP mentioned is absolutely correct, but when you can't move or even shift your position minutely, a wide range of things can be dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The list of things you check would probably be very helpful to new parents (and vice versa). For example, during crying bouts, we’d check for hairs wrapped around a digit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A foot had snagged on a a thread in the snowsuit leg while putting the snowsuit on and the thread was putting pressure between two toes.</p>
<p>Determined never to ignore a crying baby after that day. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, it's not really normal that little things like shoes being tight trigger such a strong reaction. This happens because the area below the injury stops receiving sympathetic stimulation from the central nervous system, and over time becomes hypersensitive to every little thing as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info! I really only learned enough of this to recognize the issue and to search for possible solutions. I was but a nurse's aide, after all. They pointed, I went. </p>
<p>Do things like auto-ambulators or those fancy new wheelchairs that can raise to a standing position help to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and prevent hypersensitivity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as an extra to add, depending on the extent of the injury, some patients with tetra or paraplegia still retain certain reflexes. </p>
<p>Some reflexes like a knee jerk or pulling away from a hot item are local reactions that happen automatically between the nerves and the spinal cord without much/any involvement of the brain. </p>
<p>Instead of the signal being sent to the brain along the nerves and spinal cord, the brain processing this signal, deciding what to do, then sending a signal back to the limb telling it to pull away, the signal simply reaches the spinal cord and then the limb receives a signal straight back to pull away. Although these reflexes are generally weakened (due to decreased muscle tone from lack of brain control) they can still exist after a spinal cord injury. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can differentiate between the upper motor neuron leasion (UMNL) and the lower motor neuron leasions (LMNL). UMNL has intact reflexes, LMNL doesnt. You can specifically check this with a ‘Babinsky test’. A reflex test performed on the sole of the foot. This will be a positive test in case of a UMNL.
This reflex is present at birth but dissapates when you age but reappears in case of LMNL.</p>
<p>Leasions can be divided in an A, B, C, D, E category and can be complete or incomplete.</p>
<p>The A-E categories are based upon sensory testing (pain and temperature) and motoric muscle testing (0-5, where 0 = no visible muscle contraction, 5 = movement vs resistance over the whole range of motion).</p>
<p>If this topic seems interesting you can always google ‘ASIA’ (American Spinal Injury Association) and the specific classifications.</p>
<p>On the topic of Autonomic Dysreflexia: above the leasion you’ll notice the person having wide pupils, a red face and being sweaty (this is due to vasodilation). Whereas below the leasion you’ll notice white, cold limbs, piloerection (hair standing up) and cold sweat (due to vasoconstriction).</p>
<p>Edit: due to the comment below. UMNL shows a positive Babinski.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reflexes are absent typically the first 48 hours after spinal cord injury due to a phenomenon called, spinal shock. Once you see the reflexes return, you're out of spinal shock and you can take advantage of the different reflexes like the rectocolic reflex or whatnot for treatment of neurogenic bowel for example</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question to piggyback on the first. Maybe the answer is the exact same. I have seen nerve damage to hands where the hands would not prune when exposed to water. Does a paralyzed body respond similarly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pruning actually doesn't occur due to your cells/skin being swollen with water. It is a purely neurological response to you being submerged to give you more traction. Similar to why tires have treads - it gives water a channel to flow through so it doesn't act as a barrier between the two contact surfaces. It is quite literally your body giving your hands and feet treads for more grip while underwater for a while! People with nerve damage do not prune on the side(s) of their body with the nerve damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless I'm mistaken, the current theory is that your brain causes the pruning to improve your grip (increased surface area), which is also why it only happens on your hands and feet. You'll note that your stomach doesn't prune in the bath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard that it’s actually an evolutionary thing—when our hands get wet and therefore slippery, our fingers prune up so we can grip things more easily.</p></div>		</li>
