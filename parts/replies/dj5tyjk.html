			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way of looking at it is that &quot;you&quot; are really a collection of semi-autonomous connected systems. You just don't normally notice that these systems are really largely separate. Right now you are probably holding a mouse or your phone in your hand, but you weren't really thinking about it. Now you're thinking about it, and it's kind of like a <em>supervisor</em> taking notice of a subordinate. So was it <em>you</em> using your hand a second ago, or is it the supervisor that's <em>you</em>? Are <em>you</em> the collection of both of those connected, but semi-separate systems? Are you hungry right now, or thirsty, or horny? Are you generally happy right now, or sort of pissed? All that stuff comes from your ancient lizard brain deep down in the center of your skull, but is that <em>you</em>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. Furthermore, your collection of <em>YOUs</em> have very little to do with one another. Take into consideration the <em>YOU</em> that goes to bed early with the intention of getting up at the crack of dawn to go for a run, but the <em>YOU</em> that wakes up in the morning decides to hit the snooze button five times until it is too late. Which of those <em>YOUs</em> is <em>YOU</em>? Perhaps neither, perhaps none of those wants and desires are really <em>YOU</em>, perhaps there is no <em>YOU</em>. Until, through a force of <em>WILL</em> you intentionally create a <em>YOU</em> who has the ability to supervise the other <em>YOUs</em>. Then you can actually <em>do</em> something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any idea what it is that causes some peoples inner voice to be over active? I have to take schizophrenia medication to sleep. I don't hear voices, but my own voice in my head is constantly talking to the point where I can't relax.
(Not looking for a diagnosis, just some neurological facts)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any response to this would be speculative on my part.</p>
<p>This whole &quot;inner voice&quot; question really straddles the border of hard science and more existential questions which most people today wouldn't consider scientific.</p>
<p>As another Redditer pointed out on this thread, this is a difficult subject to study because it seems to be different for everyone. There are some people who say their inner voice speaks in full sentences, using their own voice. Others would report that there is a mixture of pictures and words, or perhaps very few words at all and mainly pictures. So, in the end it seems that we all experience our inner voice in a subjective manner.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are very few neurological facts to offer on the subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seroquel, probably? Do you find it helps? I take a different one, zyprexa, and I find it really helpful for my relentless inner voice. (And sleep. And it's a mood stabilizer.) I'll have a painful critical thought, but instead of being pummeled by it over and over, it's like a single punch, then it's over. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The other approach to this is a bit more esoteric, and it basically has to do with the idea that your brain, or your intellectual function is not really YOU. It is just a portion of you that performs a job, and this job is to think. So that part of you that is actually &quot;awareness&quot; or &quot;conscious&quot; is observing the portion of you that thinks from a third-person perspective.</p>

<p>Well story time I guess but I was very high one time and I remember distinctly seeing myself performing outside my own body. Like we were sitting at a table by the pool and I remember seeing myself in 3rd person talking, and it was weird but it felt like I was at both places (inside and outside myself) at the same time. This happened to me a few times but I was young like 17-18 back then and it hasnt happened since. Very trippy experience to see myself in 3rd person and 1st person at the same time. </p></div>		</li>
