			<div class="markdown"><p>Chips instead of platters. As an example, a 64gb SSD could use one 64gb chip on its board, a 128 might use 2 64s, and a 256gb would use 4 64s.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what size the average chip is nowadays, but the tech is moving forward fast, so we might have 1tb drives with a single 1tb chip in the near future. </p>
<p>The makeup of an SSD also allows them to gain extra speed from larger drives with multiple chips, up to a point. They can read/write to multiple chips at a time, making a 2 chip SSD faster than a single chip SSD.</p>
<p>I've typed chip so many times that it doesn't seem like a real word anymore. Thanks Reddit.  </p></div>		</li>
