			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as a side note, brown fat sticks around in cold-weather species including some whales and dolphins, and in animals that hibernate, to help keep them warm.  Also, living in a cold environment can cause adult humans to develop much higher levels of brown fat.  Adipose tissue has a lot more metabolic importance than we once thought, and there is a lot of interesting research coming out on the topic!

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>And</em> some plants have something analogous to brown fat; it allows <strong>plants</strong> to give off heat (used in melting snow and/or vaporizing chemicals to spread odors). Skunk cabbage, by its name, uses the heat for the latter.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that the typical winter weight gain is usually brown fat.  Generally it's just a combination of lower activity levels in winter and the tradition of having a lot of wintertime feasts, which leads to putting on some run-of-the-mill white fat.  White fat is still functional to a degree though - we want to gain weight in winter so that we are better insulated from the cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The winter bulk usually comes from all the food during the holidays that are very close together, as well as wearing heavier clothing that helps hide the added weight, so you never really notice it. Whereas you notice a few extra pounds when you're running around in swim suits and tank tops during the summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Despite the common association of anemia with iron deficiency, the two aren't synonymous. Anemia is the resultant disorder when your body struggles to transport oxygen through your body, which can be caused by any number of conditions including vitamin deficiencies, disease, and even <em>excess</em> iron in some rare cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The systems overlap a great deal. E.g. the kidneys are both urinary and endocrine. You're right, fat is an integral component of the skin, but fatty tissue also releases hormones (hence endocrine), and is heavily involved in the female reproductive system too. (And obviously, metabolism.)</p>
<p>Besides, adipocytes are found in many places apart from the skin. They provide cushioning for your internal organs, too. Fat has a lot of uses!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What organ system it belongs to and what tissue it is are not the same thing. The blood, for example, is technically connective tissue, but belongs to the circulatory system.</p>
<p>Organs are commonly made up of different tissues. The circulatory system has epithelial tissue eg. lining the blood vessels, and muscle tissue in the heart and around the arteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to provoke the original commenter to use the word &quot;overlap&quot; without using inflammatory language; also I should point out that fat is very much &quot;generally&quot; part of the integumentary system with overlap in endocrine, much as the pancreas is endocrine with overlap in the digestive system.</p>
<p>Also blood is only considered connective because like other connective tissue it has a matrix (the plasma portion).  Other than that it stands completely unique in being part of the circulatory system and one should not fall back on technicalities in case it confuses young learners of anatomy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an Ultra runner and am very interested in brown fat as when you &quot;hit the wall&quot; your body starts to  burn fat (as the muscles have run out of sugar). I've heard by cutting carbs out of your diet completely you can force your body to start producing brown fat reserves so it can use it more easily (I'm obviously referring to the ketosis diet). Is there any truth to this or is it just another fad/gimmick? I don't want to put myself through the diet if it really doesn't have any real advantage. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point! However, hitting the wall phenomenon is more precisely due to glycogen depletion, leading to lack of substrate to prime the TCA cycle, and thus halting beta oxidation (fat utilization). The way to overcome this is to undergo endurance training, which will eventually increase your glycogen store capacity as well as shorten your body's latency from using creatine phosphate/glycogen to fatty acids. Elite long distance runners can tap into their fat stores almost right from the get go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for replying. It's difficult to get information from someone who knows what they are talking about. I train up to 60 miles a week as part of my training cycles and carb load 2 days before a race, would it be beneficial to cut down on the carbs during training or do the same as I would for a race ( load before my long run day). There is so much conflicting info.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brown fat in general decreases in quantity as we age, while white fat increases. As adults, women also maintain larger stores. </p>
<p>Babies have lots of brown fat to maintain their core body temperature, which is higher than ours in adulthood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The absence of carbs in diet isn't to produce brown adipose tissue (BAT), but to fat adapt. This means there is a belief that eating a ketogenic (low carb, high fat) diet will allow your body to more readily use fat stores, a nutrient we have stored in abundance. There are some studies that show glycogen sparring at low intensities, but an inability to use glycogen when it's needed for higher intensities. </p>
<p>If your goal is to run a lot of marathons, or father, it's worth a try. If your goal is to win marathons, it's unlikely. There is one keto endurance athlete I've heard of winning consistently. Keto has a lot of beneficial research in body comp, weight loss, and disease states.   It's just not for serious endurance athletes. </p></div>		</li>
