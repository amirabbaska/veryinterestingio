			<div class="markdown"><p>G6P is pretty minor.  A cell experiences up to 10000 daily depurination events, an average of 500 deamination events, and fewer than 500 oxidation related mutations daily.  The biggest factor is most likely genetic deficiencies in mismatch repair mechanisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So.... if I am a Type 1 Diabetic does this mean I have a better chance of being cancer free (in comparison to a normal person) IF I have really well regulated insulin control?</p>
<p>On the flip side... if I have poor insulin control, am i MORE likely to get cancer (compared to a non-diabetic)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually don't know. I'd have to do some research to answer that, and there's a lot of variables like I mentioned. Don't want to give any bad info here.</p>
<p>One important thing I forgot to mention is that we also have to account for the fact that fat people simply have more cells and that actually significantly increases the odds of cancer overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating. Thank you for the answer though, I've never realized cancer had any significant connection to insulin production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading through these other comments... they are correct to a degree but miss the main point. What I have written in my other reply to this post is the primary reason simplified. What op has written is the pathway that cancer is mitigated by exercise. These are direct reasons. Everything else is downstream of this.</p>
<p>All that inflammation stuff... it's true to a degree but a lot of other variables are introduced and pretty much 99.9% of people who list that as a reason have no idea the mass of information they are referring to. It makes up multiple fields of scientific study. People with PhDs don't even have a complete handle on that level.</p></div>		</li>
