			<div class="markdown"><p>You could burn more fuel for a given volume of air while keeping the intake charge pressure the same. Something similar is already done with nitrous oxide since it contains more oxygen molecules for the same pressure and volume of gas. More fuel burnt completely means more power gained. This of course is a simplified explanation of all things involved but I think it gets the point across. Something similar but opposite happens now when you go up in altitude internal combustion engines make less power as you go up in altitude.</p>
<p>Significantly so with air planes. And why most airplanes need to use some sort of forced induction to shove more air and thus oxygen into the engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With more fuel as well, yes the same engine would make more power.  Just like when you are at higher altitudes, internal combustion engines make less power. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, limits of flammability are designated as the lower and upper limits of concentration by volume that a gas will burn at in air. For example, ethylene glycol has a lower limit of 3% and upper limit of 22% by volume. If you increase the amount of oxygen while keeping the amount of ethylene glycol the same, you'd also have to remove some of the nitrogen or other air components if you wanted to keep the original amount of total gas the same. Thus, you now have the same number of moles (assuming the system is composed of all ideal gasses) and same volume, but there's more oxygen (fuel) to work with. Because of this, you can now combust smaller amounts of the ethylene glycol (e.g. 3% drops down to 2%), and additionally you can combust larger amounts for the same reason. The reason flammability limits exist at all is because most gasses aren't flammable by themselves, so having too low or too high of a concentration of them in a system won't allow for combustion. So, in environments where more oxygen is present, the flammability range is widened. </p></div>		</li>
