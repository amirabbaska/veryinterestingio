			<div class="markdown"><p>The FCC restricts commercial FM stations to operate between 92.1 and 107.9; the lower frequency range is reserved for non-profit stations like religious and public radio.  I'm not aware of any restrictions within the non-profit band, and I know that NPR and religious stations are often fighting for control of the same airwaves.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have no less than three different frequencies transmitting the same programming audible from my location.  </p>
<p>What was even more annoying was that a lot of the programming was also available for free on shortwave radio or Ku-band satellite, so why take up three valuable FM channels with it?</p></div>		</li>
