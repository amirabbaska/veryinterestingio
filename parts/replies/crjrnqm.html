			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in the sense that pus is mostly a mass of dead immune cells. So at least some types of bacteria would resemble pus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>none of which has any use for pigmentation ... so it too has no specific colour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might be misunderstanding, but that sounds like you're saying function is required for colour.</p>
<p>Rocks have colour...</p>
<p>Perhaps you mean they wouldn't have a unique colour, and there are so many of them that the light they reflect would sum to white?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually many biologically relevant organic compounds are slightly yellow in colour, because the presence of aromatic functionalities in those molecules that typically absorb in the blue-violet to UV region (pi - pi* transitions). It wouldn't be surprising if the bacteria in bulk were yellow or even orange in colour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still don't see how it follows that organic molecules like proteins and DNA don't each have a color - meaning a wavelength (or balance of wavelengths) at which they predominantly absorb/reflect light. Surely these molecules don't absorb and reflect <em>all</em> wavelengths equally (which would make them neutral black/grey/white, depending on relative illumination levels)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain amino acids have color. Concentrate most proteins enough and it will be yellow/orange. Trytophan is the main culprit. Your use of the word &quot;pigmentation&quot; is incorrect. Proteins have color, quite simply, and it has nothing to do with the more system-based context of pigment. </p>
<p>Also the crystalline concept of viruses is limited to those viruses which exhibit regular shape. Not all do. </p>
<p>Not all viruses &quot;inject&quot; DNA or RNA. That's a phage concept. Human viruses enter the cell and uncoat. There's also more functions than you listed. RNA viruses with negative-sense RNA, for example, usually need to bring a polymerase with them. </p>
<p>Finally, the external surface of all viruses is not protein. Some are never found without a lipid envelope. So the external surface is either protein or lipid. </p></div>		</li>
