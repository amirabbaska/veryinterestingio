			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually if competitors get sick during a competition, they are disqualified. The term they sometimes use is a &quot;reversal of fortune.&quot; Many top tier eaters never get sick while on stage (apparently it's quite &quot;unprofessional&quot;), and a few have admitted to purging after a competition.</p>
<p>I think there was a controversy a while back about Kobyashi (the Japanese guy who won Nathan's for a crazy amount of years in a row), vomiting in the final minutes and trying to stuff it back in his mouth to hide it. He violated his contract with Major League Eating and so hasn't been back in the circuit for a while now. </p>
<p>I went to the world taco eating championship last summer and watched Joey Chestnut, Miki Sudo, Matt Stonie, among others eat a ridiculous amount of taqueria tacos in 8 minutes. Chestnut won with about 89 tacos. I was able to talk to Joey and Miki afterwards, and they seemed unfazed. I think later Miki and another female competitor were walking around eating quesadillas and more tacos. It was incredible. </p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://youtu.be/A3jdi-H2AKA" target="_blank">here is the full video</a> of Chestnut winning the taco eating comp last year. Someone filmed it and put it up on YouTube. Enjoy!</p></div>		</li>

<p>He definitely threw up that day.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I always felt like the MLE doesn't have a big enough following to be cutting off your head because of a little contract dispute. But that ship has long sailed I think. Just sad the event really hasn't had worthwhile hype since. Today was just a runaway including judges that couldn't count.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But you can't <em>during</em> the competition.  Obviously not good for spectators, but anyone can eat/puke/eat/puke.  Hell you could just chew it and spit it out with a fake &quot;vomit&quot; sound and no one would know you never actually ate anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kobayashi discussed this on Reddit once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About my bowel movements, what people may really think is that, you know, they might imagine that a huge amount comes out. That’s not exactly the way it is at all. Actually, what happens is I go to the bathroom just like any of us do and it comes out the same way except that it comes out in many, many more times, so you’re going to the toilet a lot rather than going and there just being a huge amount. The other thing is that if there is a lot of water intake it, certainly, the consistency will be soft, not firm.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never had that much food but I've had 11 tacos and 1 burrito from Taco Bell in a single sitting. That quantity of food did some strange things to my body. To begin with it gave me a fever of 100.5 and I ended up falling asleep for over 10 hours. When I woke up I had this intense pressure balled up on the lefthand side of my torso. If I poked it sharp pains raced through my innards and I dashed to the bathroom.</p>
<p>What happened next is hard to explain. The consistency was not right. It wasn't diarrhea and it wasn't solid. It was this half-assed digested frothy feeling shit the consistency of which rose and fell with every few inches. It made a choppy sound as the stream sprayed out of me into the toilet below. There were some wet patches but it was mostly the same soggy bread consistency with hard lumps where I think my body tried to do its job then gave up and put its resources back into colonic traffic control.</p>
<p>The initial blast was frightening but the rest was so relieving. I could feel this great weight lifting from my soul and large intestine with every inch that uncoiled into the toilet below. As with all large poops my feat of the shit stacking up and touching my balls made me flush multiple times but in this instance that may have been a legitimate fear there was just so much poop.</p>
<p>I had one unbelievable poop that though it broke up between my anus and the water it was genuinely one piece that unraveled with every passing moment. I sat there in shock, feeling stretched and broken on the inside, a feeling that was altogether new to me and frankly I loved it.</p>
<p>You've never experienced a poop until you've experienced a dozen taco poop. 8/10 will try again the next time my wife is traveling.</p></div>		</li>
