			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, this reminds me, how about the size limit for vertebrate eyes? IIRC the cornea (and maybe the lens too, at least the part about no blood?) has a thin layer of living cells with no blood vessels. They have to do everything through diffusion which sharply limits the diameter of the cornea</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, bones being supported by water will probably be subject to more stress from things like locomotion, current shear, etc.</p>
<p>&quot;Under its own weight&quot; was the best ELI5 I could come up with to explain square-cube law and I didn't intend for it to directly address the original question. Sorry if it was confusing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the relevant answer (although bones crushing under their own weight really isn't relevant in the water). But I wanted to add some more background:</p>
<p>It's all about oxygen. Oxygen allows you to get about 18x more useful energy out of your food. Which means 18x less searching for food, 18x less resources dedicated just to eating and circulating the food to your cells, for the same food intake 18x more resources dedicated toward building weapons (like teeth, muscles) and technology (eyes, brain, circulatory system, etc.). Oxygen is such a massive advantage that every single predator needs to use it or they'll be out-competed. That means every single cell needs to have access to food and oxygen.</p>
<p>So that brings us to two things: 1) Cube-square law (which other people have explained, but basically the number of cells you have increases at the cube of your length, but your surface area with your surroundings increases at the square), and 2) there's barely any oxygen at depth. This puts a pretty hard upper limit on how big an organism can be, you reach a limit where you can no longer bring enough oxygen to your cells to keep them functioning.</p>
<p>But there's a softer limit where you no longer have enough energy surplus to be a good predator, and the really big organisms down there, like the big jellies, the giant squids, are operating near that diffusion limit. They have just enough oxygen to get just enough food to get just a little bit bigger.</p>
<p>Which brings us to evolution: Sperm Whales. It seems absolutely insane for them to dive as deep as they do. They dive down to 2000 meters of depth, show signs of decompression sickness, and their ribs evolved cartilage links so they don't break. But it works because they use the atmosphere to saturate their blood with oxygen. This rocket fuel lets them eat everything they want down there. They're like next-generation combat jets and everyone they're fighting is on steam technology.</p>
<p>The bigger you are, the more likely a sperm whale (and there are other, smaller deep hunting whales) finds you and eats you. If you're flirting with the saturation limit, you have no chance to escape a sperm whale attack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, I have read that this is precisely the reason why lobsters are not actually immortal. Which they can molt and grow indefinitely, after a certain point they stop molting and begin to waste away, until they succumb to disease or predation. Molting is a stressful process which only becomes more stressful as the organism grows larger, and also after a lobster grows to a certain size, it's scavenger diet is not able to provide enough food to molt or even sustain good health.</p></div>		</li>
