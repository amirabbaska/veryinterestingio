			<div class="markdown"><p>this is super cool and interesting, thanks for that explanation, i didn't know that's how fluorescent lights worked! This may be the wrong place to ask but i'd like to shoot anyways: Do you know <em>how</em> they are converting non-visible light to visible light? I never knew this and am finding this really fascinating all of a sudden how fluorescent lights can take something invisible and add it to our own already-visible things, like some kind of interdimensional portal pulling something out of another dimension and into ours</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with excitation of electronic orbitals at the atomic level. An electron can absorb a photon of a certain wavelength, boosting itself up to a higher energy level in the process. This excited state usually isn't stable, so it decays back to the ground state spontaneously, releasing more photons of a different wavelength. </p>
<p>There's actually two related phenomena here: fluorescence and phosphorescence, but they do basically the same thing, only differing in the specific way the electron returns to its ground state. It's mostly just the details of a given molecule and the structure of its molecular orbitals that determines which process occurs, and what wavelengths can be absorbed/emitted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically, fluorescent compounds will absorb light of a shorter wavelength (higher energy) and re-emit it as light of a longer wavelength (lower energy).</p>
<p>Which is why the fluorescent blue shirt in the example above would have been absorbing UV light, while one fluorescent a vivid green would probably best absorb some type of blue light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually some sort of phosphor compound is used to convert nonvisible to visible for fluorescent lights. They fluoresce or react with the UV light. </p>
<p>Basically they take in the UV light, then they're in an excited state, then they release light at a lower frequency (UV -&gt; Visible) and go back to a low energy state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may not answer exactly what you're asking but I hope you find it helpful.</p>
<p>Color is determined by how fast a photon is &quot;vibrating&quot;. If it vibrates too fast or too slow, then we can't see it. UV light is vibrating faster than we can see, so it has more energy than a photon we can see. Fluorescent colors absorb some of the energy and then re-emit the photon with a slower vibration.</p>
<p>The best analogy I can think of right now: Imagine if you could only feel temperatures between 0 and 150 F. Everything else didn't feel like any temperature. Then you put a pizza into a 350F oven. It goes in frozen, and comes out warm, even though the oven didn't feel warm at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fluorescent colors are able to absorb energy from beyond the range we can see (UV) and then re-emit it in a color we can see. So a fluorescent blue shirt could reflect up to 100 brightness units back of blue, and absorb another 100 brightness units of UV and emit them back as blue light, giving off 200 brightness units of blue in a room where everything else is only giving off 100.</p>

<p>I think you just explained why when i shine my blue laser on a florescent yellow colored paper, it shines back in SUPER BRIGHT GREEN</p></div>		</li>
