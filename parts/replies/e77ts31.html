			<div class="markdown"><p>Cricket,  rugby, soccer, cycling and every Formula 1 have huge international followings. The US seems to ignore them.</p>
<p>If fact I would say there is a split. The major sports in Commonwealth  and other  Western countries are the ones the US ignores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US doesnt ignore soccer as much as the other sports you mentioned, its just not as big as Basketball, Baseball or NFL football. Lots of immigrants who love it and teams like Atlanta are filling 70 k stadiums full of soccer fans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soccer is gaining popularity in the US with the younger generation.  I teach high school and am seeing just as many kids interested in soccer as football.  </p>
<p>I know the games are different but I would say cricket and baseball are similar as are rugby and football.  So we are not as far off as some think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MMA as a whole didn't exist, but amateur wrestling/judo/taekwondo/boxing all existed for a long time. MMA is basically a mix of martial arts, not a completely new invention. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, that's why I wrote that you can argue it did exist before the UFC refined it into it's current form.</p>
<p>There was catch wrestling, vale tudo, jj, and a number of other formats, not to mention the thousands of years of boxing, wrestling and judo.</p>
<p>But the MMA that we see now is significantly different than what we had even 25 years ago. It's changed alot in order to make it a better spectator sport.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add basically every recent competitive game is designed with spectators in mind. Publishers are finally seeing the huge potential. But it will take time until more people catch on. </p></div>		</li>
