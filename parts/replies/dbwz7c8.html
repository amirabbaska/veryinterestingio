This caused Westinghouse and JP Morgan to refuse to invest in the future as he never completed the projects he was paid to do. Tesla was too unreliable for them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good way to start to think about this is understanding how wireless signals are sent. Let us think of radio, wifi, and phone signals. All of these are measured in decibels (measuring power using log). We are able to catch these signals in our circuits because they create current flow on our antennas. So in a way we are already transferring power in  order to share information. </p>
<p>So why don't we just up the scales so we can power things? Well imagine a garden hose with an adjustable nozzle. If you are trying water a bunch of grass then we want that nozzle to let water spray everywhere. This will now provide a wide array of coverage but the impact of the water is pretty minimal. Now lets say we want to clean our car. We need the water stream to be tight in order to remove any caked on dirt, but we only get a small area concentration. We can think of radio in the same way. If we decide to broadcast power over a large area it is providing a lot less power, not to mention power loss is super high due to the water and gasses in the air. This is why we use power lines. It provides a very direct route for power so we can have power in the direct concentrations in our homes. Also, by broadcasting large amounts of power you will most likely jam all other signals that we use on a day to day basis. People always spout some conspiracy crap, but the truth is much less satisfying than fiction.</p>
<p>TLDR: Broadcasting power into the air is not cost effective because of losses felt in the air. Also the jamming effect it would cause on all of our radio, phone, and wifi signals would be a pain to shield.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While all that is true wasn't his idea to not use EM waves? If I understand it correct it would use something like ELF to move surface waves across the Earth. So the transmitter and receiver aren't electromagnetically coupled, but maybe like capacitavley coupled? </p>
<p>However there would still be an asymptotic drop off I guess since E fields decay with 1/r^2 in the far field, so maybe his idea was BS.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't have any geniuses working on this problem right now so it will stay zany likely forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an ideal world, yes.  Unless it was subdued by energy companies who would lose tons of money if his ideas came to fruition.  Kind of like how public transportation was dismantled in the US to get people to buy more cars.  Or how cable companies are trying to slow down Netflix so people continue buying their TV programming.  Or how Big Oil has tried to slow down solar and alternative energy sources.  Or how Big Pharmacy tries to keep Marijuana illegal to prevent their own companies from losing money.  So it's not really as simple as saying that if they were just great ideas then they'd be implemented, unfortunately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert on Tesla by any means, but I thought that part of the reason why people haven't tried to replicate his ideas is that he did a very bad job of actually recording his ideas/hid his ideas? I mean, if he kept the actual science/math secret in his mind, and he only recorded the vague ideas in a physical form, then that could be why everyone thinks it's zany, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no. far, far too much loss over even short distances with perfect resonance, and resonance changes based on atmospheric conditions, as well as the number and placement of &quot;receivers‚Äù. tesla got pretty loopy towards the end.</p></div>		</li>
