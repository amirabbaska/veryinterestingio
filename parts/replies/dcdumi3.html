			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem here is that there are those who conflate &quot;open mindedness&quot; with &quot;you must accept everything as true at face value,&quot; or &quot;you cannot claim that something is false.&quot;</p>
<p>Essentially they're confusing &quot;open mindedness&quot; with &quot;gullibility.&quot;</p>
<p>There is value to being able to accept that some questions can have multiple correct answers, even if you disagree with some of those answers for various reasons.</p>
<p>But too many think that open mindedness should mean that <em>any</em> answer to a question must be equally as valid as any other answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think of this a lot when people talk about ghosts and similar stupid spiritual bullshit. im not closed minded because i dont think ghosts are real nor are you open minded, if you believe whatever someone tells you (ghosts) despite having no proof then you are gullible as fuck and will fall for anything. yet somehow i always 'just have to be more open minded'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Corollary: if someone refuses to humor a hypothetical where their premise is not true (eg. imagine a world where you know there is no god, what would explain the presence of life then?), it means they will never accept your argument because they refuse to even allow their mind to contemplate that possibility.  You can't decide something that you refuse to evaluate in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
