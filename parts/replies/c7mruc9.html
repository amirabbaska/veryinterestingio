			<div class="markdown"><p>Recognition vs. recall is certainly correct, though basically descriptive. The generally accepted reason is that memory depends on encoding, storage and retrieval. Recognition is easier because the object serves as a memory retrieval <em>cue</em>, which is absent (or limited) in the case of free recall. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Encoding, storage, and retrieval are dominantly taught, but like any area of scientific study, academia has long-since shifted perspectives. Less than those 3 separate and distinct processes, the lines seem to be blurred into one explanatory-umbrella of construction (and reconstruction if you want to be more specific about the current topic). </p>
<p>Experiences are not simply imprinted into memory by way of encoding. Instead, they are as much shaped by previous experiences as they are by expectations as they are by the current stimulus and context. </p>
<p>Experiences are not simply stored in memory, as storage would suggest. They are preserved as particular processing experiences, completely malleable and organic, an emergence of the interaction between context, stimulus, task, and prior (similar) processing experiences. </p>
<p>Experiences are not retrieved as much as they are reconstructed afresh each time we consciously recall them, unconsciously recruit them as in &quot;priming&quot;, or feel their influence as a feeling of familiarity when we recognize something. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the simple view of some sort if static 'items' being stored and retrieved, whole-cloth (so-called 'reactivation models) have given way to more constructionist perspectives.  However, from an operational standpoint, retrieval of some sort is still a necessary function in memory  and relevant cueing is an important factor. 40 years of psychological research have shown this to be true. </p></div>		</li>
