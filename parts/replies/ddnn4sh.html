<p>Btw I think for many people delaying nicotine from oversleeping would also cause malaise from withdrawal - much like coffee. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately if you work revolving shifts then your body cannot get used to it. It is like constantly having jet lag. Some people are better than others at coping with it though.</p>
<p>One stategy is to organize your shifts so that you are constantly &quot;staying up later&quot; or delaying your sleep. It is typically easier for people to stay up later than to get to sleep early. </p>
<p>Edit: TrainDriverDad can you indicate  &quot;am&quot; and &quot;pm&quot; ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, they were all am, last week was a relatively good week because all shifts were early and consistent. I find the worst are where I work 9 hours on 12 hours off for 9 or 10 days. They do it so they can fit in an extra shift or 2 over 10 days. I am tempted to hit the DR up for provigil or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rotating shifts are pretty bad from a health perspective, unfortunately. At the extreme end, medical professionals are starting to recognize something called shift work sleep disorder. But all is not lost--if you can, talk with someone in sleep medicine to see what you can do given your schedule. For example, shifting your sleep over a few days can be less harmful than suddenly changing your sleep schedule. There are also some good results using light therapy BUT definitely talk to a doctor before you try that one on your own.</p></div>		</li>
