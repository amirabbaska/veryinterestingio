			<div class="markdown"><p>But how exactly?</p>
<p>Like if you have a lot of kinetic energy you perceive the universe around you as rapidly aging. Would hanging out in an especially strong electric/ magnetic field have any comparable effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy and momentum in the electric and magnetic fields contribute to the the stress-energy tensor just like any other energy density or momentum flux. It doesn’t matter whether it’s due to an EM field, or due to something else.</p>
<p>The stress-energy tensor determines how spacetime is curved via the Einstein field equations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, are there any theories about being in space, not orbit, that have any major effects on life span? Other than muscles going weak from not using them, and if such factors weren't an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>relativistic effects on ageing are negligible- unless you go really close to something really heavy, or travel super fast.  </p>
<p>so being in space won't relativistically affect your lifespan, but you'll probably get cancer because of exposure to radiation and cosmic rays</p></div>		</li>
