<p>Big sites have invested in layers of servers/caching with advanced cache preload techniques to ensure that when you click on something you're getting it from a box near you.</p>
<p>Small sites might have data crossing the atlantic to get the content to you.</p>
<p>So number of boxes / location of boxes is the biggest factor I believe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an additional layer, which is that YouTube does its best to start the video rapidly, even if the quality isn't what you expected. So those first few seconds, when you think you're watching a 1080p stream, that may actually be 480p. If your connection is fast enough, YouTube will then switch the stream which is delivered to match.</p>
<p>Most of the large video content companies do this now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apart from that, there are client side/server side codes which run in background during uploading process. You can compress the data chunk in client side before sending and reduce packet size to an extent. Or upload data chunks via different servers which gives you a much wider bandwidth. Then on the server side they get uncompressed and merged as a single file. These methods are generally used for big files because it requires lots of coding and complex server networks. Developers don't feel the need to do it for images.</p></div>		</li>
