			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have sensitive teeth, it may be worth it to get a European version of Sensodyne's Repair and Protect toothpaste. I know I sound like I'm from hailcorporate, but I'm not. GlaxoSmithKline stopped selling toothpaste with Novamin in the US for some reason, even though bioglass materials make a big difference in a few months for sensitivity. But the Sensodyne R+P US version doesn't have it. Get the Novamin one (or any bioglass toothpaste - I think there are more from smaller brands) if you want to actually help your sensitive teeth long term and not just mask the problem.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, Colgates Pro-Argin Arginine toothpastes fill in dentinal tubules. Tom's of Maine has one with it as well. It has been shown more effective than Novamin I believe, but long term use of both fills in dentinal tubules and that's what matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info; I'm not too familiar with bioglass toothpaste but from my experience most people with sensitivity have a secondary factor (be it malocclusion or periodontal disease) that is contributing to the enamel/cementum wear and/or gum recession, and so I am always hesitant to see products that supposedly &quot;repair&quot; when the source of the damage is not addressed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife is Sensodyne purely because she used to get mouth ulcers and that is one of the only toothpastes (in the UK anyway) that doesn't have SLS in it which is apparently linked to ulcers. I think it's the foaming ingredient, so that stuff feels strange to use because you're not used to non-foamy toothpaste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a minimum of one canker sore at any given time, usually I'd have 4 but at one point I had 12. It was hell. There'd be times I couldn't talk it was so bad. I switched to sensodyne and now I get maybe 2 a year and they are very small. SLS isn't even necessary! Sensodyne foams just fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Triclosan is not banned in toothpastes, only in soaps (such as hand soap and dish soap). This is partly because it was shown to not be anymore effective in soap products than those without it. But in toothpastes, studies still show that it can make a difference, so it won't be banned as of now.</p></div>		</li>
