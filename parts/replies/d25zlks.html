			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you should not be walking around with sensitized C4. That is just a very bad idea. If anything happens to that cap it could ignite that C4. I used to harp on my guys who would do that because &quot;it saves time.&quot; Ok mothafucka, you want to risk blowing open your torso to save 2 seconds to attach your initiating system to your charge? Do it, but stay the hell away from me. Just set your block with a Uli knot and attach the initiator when you need it, good to go.</p>

<p>Edit: a bullet will set off that blasting cap inside the block, but not the block - until that cap sets it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to undermine you completely but the ODA I was attached to was leaving the Charlie's for base defense and taking us with them. Uli knots are shit in my opinion. Everyone on my team had two charges set in their bag at all time per ODA sop. Period. In any event you're carrying caps, who cares? I'm either getting a huge chunk taken out of my leg, or losing my leg. If I have 5-6 caps in one pocket and the C in the opposite pocket, I'm not saving much by not priming. </p>
<p>Again, not to shit on the Charlie's cause often times you're my BFF on the team, but you guys get about an eighth of the demo training I get. I don't tell you how to build C-huts or drive the forklift, don't tell me how to fuck with demo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is about what I expected in response. I remember reducing a cache with some EOD guys once and they were concerned about the direction the bullets were pointing, because they could &quot;fire off in that direction.&quot; Well that isn't even probable, and do you know why? Point being argument &gt; authority.</p>
<p>As to your comment, you're saying there's no difference between a cap going off and a cap inside a block of C4 going off. Think about that one again.  Looks like you were asleep during all that training huh? Just because you were EOD, doesn't mean you're infallible with demo. Just like being a charlie doesn't mean I'm 100% accurate. Gotta go by the argument. You follow your latest render safe procedures that someone else wrote. For everyone else here that isn't as important. So if you want a dick measuring contest, find someone who cares.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several types of detonators. Old-school <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasting_cap" target="_blank">blasting caps</a> with a hot-wire detonator morphed into the &quot;electric match&quot; cap, in which a wire is heated to the point where a tiny amount of primary explosive reaches a point where it will explode. This usually sets off a larger charge within the detonator, which in turn feeds into the explosive- or, in many cases, a &quot;booster,&quot; which may be used more often with certain types of ANFO blasting agents due to their relative insensitivity.</p>
<p>The step up is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploding-bridgewire_detonator" target="_blank">exploding bridgewire detonator,</a> or EBW. Common &quot;blasting caps&quot; have several problems, including sensitivity: they can go off if dropped onto a hard surface, or with stray electrical voltage or even EMF from radios. Remember that some transmitters in vehicles are up over 100 watts, and the electrical leads on a blasting cap can act as an antenna. If they're close enough- pop. So, the EBW uses a very fine wire (usually gold), and enough current is pumped through them that the wire <em>explodes.</em> If insufficient current is applied, it melts, which is not enough to set off the primary explosive in the blasting cap. This usually means the detonator is set off with a large capacitor, which drains itself if it isn't set off immediately, theoretically improving safety.</p>
<p>The step up from <em>that</em> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapper_detonator" target="_blank">&quot;slapper det,&quot;</a> which came about because even EBWs weren't good enough for the American nuclear weapons program. It is much like the EBW but for a flyer plate inside the blasting cap; these require a vast amount of energy to initiate, which (back in the old days) required an explosion itself, collapsing an electromagnetic field with a directional charge IIRC.</p>
<p>There are many other types of detonators, including detonators that can be set off with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonel" target="_blank">NONEL</a> shock tube, and these can be set off using one of a variety of methods including hand-held <a href="http://www.blasterstool.com/blastingnonelinitiators.aspx" target="_blank">initiators.</a> There are also laser initiators that use a fiber optic to initiate the detonator. All sorts of options.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that was a good read thanks! If i could ask a follow up.</p>
<p>It seems like all the options you named aside from the lasers (which i assume is new technology) require a large amount of current to actually detonate,  especially the EBW. When in the field and it's needed at a moments notice to breach something,  is  someone carrying a large battery?
Unless I've over estimated how much power is needed, that would require like a truck battery and some big capacitors!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A blasting cap has a wire that gets hot when you pass current through it, that is in or touching a primary explosive that ignites and triggers the output explosive, which in turn provides the heat and pressure nessary to explode the C4. It's like having dominos that get bigger with each step, the last domino can be very large and require a large push to get over, but the first domino can be as small as you like as long as you have enough intermediary dominos.</p></div>		</li>
