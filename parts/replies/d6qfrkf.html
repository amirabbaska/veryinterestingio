			<div class="markdown"><p>The moderators very much appreciate that you edited this to include an explanation.  </p>
<p>This is a minor reminder that top level comments <em>must be explanations</em>, and comments that are not explanations will be removed (and the user potentially banned, if you're bad enough about it). </p>
<p>Edit:  And <strong>Please keep using the report feature</strong>, we love you all and appreciate your participation and assistance!  ;) </p></div>		</li>

If you are telling me people are reporting them then I'd just like to say a big fuck you to all those who reported.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a post removed by auto-mod it will include a link to message the mods if you think it was in error.  From my experience it's rarely in error.</p>
<p>We don't automatically remove things based on reports, but reports do help us human identify posts that are breaking the rules.</p>
<p>Regarding your specific replies, all of them were removed automatically because they were (<strong>correctly</strong>) identified as being low-effort posts.  Please put more effort into your comments in ELI5, or don't reply to a thread if you don't have a complete understanding of the topic and a willingness to explain it in detail.  Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see one (correctly) removed post in your recent history.  <em>Every</em> removed post includes a link to the moderators to have them follow up.</p>
<p>We act on every request for follow up. If they were removed incorrectly, you should follow up. </p>
<p>The reality of the situation is we see people complain about &quot;good explanations being removed&quot; <em>far, far</em> more often than we see people message us with explanations that were incorrectly removed.  We check, we follow up, we keep statistics. If we're missing something, we count on users to help us find it.</p>
<p>Among the many reasons evading auto moderator is against the rules is because it actively undermines our ability to improve the subreddit.  If something was wrongly removed, we want to fix it systemically.  If it was correctly removed, you're undermining the rules themselves. </p></div>		</li>
