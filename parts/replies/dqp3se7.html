<p>Isotopes anyway. Pretty sure they can't do much to remove radioactive carbon or calcium that's already bound to your bones or something. (Edit. Maybe something to deplete your whole body of all calcium, then immediately start supplements to replace it.) But if you find the right element, you can get that element to bond preferentially to the Cobalt or Cesium still floating in your body.</p></div>		</li>
