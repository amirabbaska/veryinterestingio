<p>There's also a fantastic discussion of quantization in Chapter 5 of Abraham &amp; Marsden's <em>Foundations of Mechanics</em>.</p>
<p>There's <em>loads</em> of other good stuff that I'm less familiar with.  I'd be interested to see others' recommendations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are interested in a more historical work on quantum physics on phase space, I can recommend you to also have a look at <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-proceedings-of-the-cambridge-philosophical-society/article/quantum-mechanics-as-a-statistical-theory/9D0DC7453AD14DB641CF8D477B3C72A2" target="_blank">Moyal's work</a>.</p>
<p>There are indeed piles of good works that could be recommended, but it depends on how interested you are in the abstract mathematics behind canonical commutation relations...</p></div>		</li>
