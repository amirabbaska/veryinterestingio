			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly the kind of thing I was looking for. Thanks for that. </p>
<p>Any thoughts on how existing organisms/species might be able to develop this capability? I'm thinking ultimately about the radiation problem in space travel: material shielding just isn't a practical solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the mechanisms of this system is well known, but I don't see why the genetic systems wouldn't be able to be mapped and adapted to other organisms. Of course, that would be fairly far in the future.</p>
<p>Although, these fungi actively use gamma-radiation as an energy source, for space-travel one would just be needed to be protected from radiation. One of my favourite microbes, Deinococcus radiodurans, can withstand crazy amount of radiation and still survive. As far as I can remember, it can even survive complete breaks of it's DNA due to radiation. </p>
<p>I think it's been suggested that it's DNA repair mechanisms are just so good so that it can keep up with any damage.
That would be a pretty potent cancer protection system.</p>
