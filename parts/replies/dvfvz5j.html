<p>when energy is very scarce (like at the bottom of the ocean), big males are too expensive, so males stay small (anglerfish).  </p>
<p>when energy is abundant (like in mammals and especially humanity and marine mammals), big males have enough energy support, and can outcompete smaller males.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot of animals in energy abundant environments still don't have a lot of competition among males. Males in a eusocial hive don't compete with each other. Neither do males from species that are highly solitary and rarely encounter other members of their own species.</p>
<p>If a male doesn't have to defend a territory or fight off other males, there's no advantage to being large even if there's plenty of food available. Developing to sexual maturity ASAP and (for the solitary species) being able to travel quickly to find mates is more important, and being small helps with both of those things.</p>
<p>And /u/RhynoD broke down the reproductive differences too. Mammals are K strategists - have a small number of offspring, and invest a lot of energy into both creating and then nurturing them to keep them alive. That generally means relatively similar sizes between males and females (sexual dimorphism in mammals is nothing compared to what's found in some insect and fish species), and a social instinct that means this species probably lives in groups where there will be direct competition among males for mates. And both males and females have to live long enough to raise their young; a male who gets 10 females pregnant then dies, is likely to have a lot of his young die because he wasn't there to protect them.</p>
<p>Insects (and to varying degrees reptiles, amphibians, and fish) are R strategists - have as many offspring as possible, put as little energy as possible into them, and hope some will survive. For males, that often means develop fast, stay small, and breed ASAP and as often as possible. If he dies after mating 10 times, that doesn't matter because his death has no impact on the survival of his offspring. For females, that often means getting as big as possible so you can carry as many eggs as possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can still apply the energy scarcity somehow (ie.  in the case of reptiles, cold-blooded)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all birds though. Birds of prey the female is typically much larger. Bald Eagles for example the female is quite a bit bigger than the male. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/andymorffew/25909458731/in/photostream" target="_blank">https://www.flickr.com/photos/andymorffew/25909458731/in/photostream</a></p>
<p>There is an example. Like the info under the photo mentions the female can be 25% larger. If you see breeding pairs beside each other the difference is noticeable. </p>
<p>Hyenas are a mammalian example where the female is larger and even the lowest ranking female is higher than the highest ranking male.</p></div>		</li>
