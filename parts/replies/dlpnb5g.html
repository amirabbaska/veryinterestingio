			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I went to a doctor in when I was in highschool, and he said it was a sudden blood pressure drop and dehydration can make it bad enough to pass out entirely. I had some tests done, and they didn't find anything wrong with me, so they sent me on my way and told me to drink more water. I have no idea what causes the blood pressure drops, but the doctors seemed unconcerned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! &quot;Nothing wrong&quot; with me, sent on my way. Just told to continue drinking tons of water. And maybe add some electrolytes. Totally fine aside from low BP. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean you pass out easily? How many times have you made this mistake(it's pretty dramatic to pass out from dehydration or heat stroke) If you were just being dramatic I like your comment because I think OP is just experiencing his own metabolism telling him to keep things normal. I will say to OP that thirst really won't cause much of a notice until you get dehydrated. The quickest signs of lacking water are a headache and an irritated palate when you eat! Fun post </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I fall to the ground completely unconscious. I can usually see it coming. If I drink a bunch of water and sit or lay down quickly, I'm usually okay. I've been to doctors about it when I was in highschool, and they weren't too concerned. They said it was my blood pressure dropping suddenly and dehydration lowers it further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I wouldn't fuck with it if you know what behaviors cause this than stop them. It's not easy to get in the mind of those doctors without knowing what they know but I wouldnt try your luck. </p></div>		</li>
