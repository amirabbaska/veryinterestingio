<p>None of these are transuranic though, except Curium and Pu-238.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tungsten electrodes for gas tunsten arc welding (GTAW [or TIG]) are alloyed with thorium oxide or lanthanum oxide to facilitate thermionic emission and provide arc stability.  Or maybe just increase current carrying capacity.  Perhaps both.  If anybody wants to dig into that, reply away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Allegedly they will be 2020-2030. Currently they're building one in China because the NRC needs to approve the design, but because it doesn't have a plant to go inspect they can't approve it. So as of right now the plan is to bring people from the NRC to the finished plant in China so they can start building in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an opportunity to see a talk by Ing. Dana Drábová, Ph.D., dr. h. c. mult.</p>
<p>She is pretty much the most acknowledged expert in nuclear physics here in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>During the talk she also mentioned gen IV reactors, the pros and the dangers of fast neutron reactors (these can use U238 as the source of Plutonium for fuel) as opposed to thermal neutron reactors (the good old ones used now).</p>
<p>I'm a high school student so this will be very brief:</p>
<p>Basically the fast reactors are too fast to control properly. When something goes wrong, you have literally seconds (vs minutes in thermal reactors) to stop the catastrophe of having possibly a worse disaster than Chernobyl. </p>
<p>She said that it is definitely possible to build them but people need to be veeeeery careful to design really good automatic safety measures.</p>
<p>(If there is anything wrong, please correct me)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you're right. They're doing things like if power fails control rods are gravity driven. Same as PWR. They've had to literally make new materials because steel becomes brittle and breaks. Also that's why the NRC won't allow it because there's no proof. The cooling is sodium so there is a need to be safe as it is explosive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the dangers of radiation were fully understood Radium was used in all kinds of glow-in-the-dark things. In the late 30s it was included in cosmetics and all manner of snake oil products for various cures. There are even accounts of the girls that painted the watch hands with glowing radium paint that would paint their nails and even teeth with it.</p></div>		</li>
