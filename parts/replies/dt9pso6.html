			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's much support given to planets forcing the solar cycle, given that it is well known that other stars have activity cycles of several years (e.g. <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?2017A%26A...603A..52R" target="_blank">Reinhold et al. 2017</a> and references therein). It is also well known that the length of stellar activity cycles correlate very well with stellar rotation period, which is itself an indicator of stellar age - i.e. stars slow down and have longer activity cycles as they age.</p>
<p>Edit: See e.g. <a href="https://imgur.com/BlwMP9R" target="_blank">Fig 2</a> of <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015csss...18...59D" target="_blank">do Nascimento et al. 2015</a>, which shows the activity cycle and rotation periods for a number of stars, including the Sun (large red symbol at 28d, 11yr). There has apparently been some debate due to the Sun lying between the &quot;active&quot; and &quot;inactive&quot; relations found among other stars (dashed lines), but this work included new results from a number of Sun-like stars and is proposing a new &quot;Sun-like&quot; track.</p>
<p>Edit edit: <a href="https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/17807/tidal-influences-of-planets-on-the-sun" target="_blank">This Astronomy Stack Exchange</a> question has an answer (by my colleague just down the hall, of all people) with some more references. The idea does apparently occasionally get mentioned, but the actual evidence for planetary forcing of solar activity is minimal.</p></div>		</li>
