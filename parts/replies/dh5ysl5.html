			<div class="markdown"><p>So lets say you was currently at port when a warning went out. Would you be better off going out to sea or attempting to flee on land? Assuming impact isn't immediately imminent but it is about to happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the underlying slope of the ocean floor.  Some places drop off really fast and others have a more gradual slope. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends entirely on how fast the ocean gets deep at that point, many bays are shallow very far out so you would have to go far, There are places with a steep drop-off that 50m could make a big difference,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would consult your local area charts, or speak to the local coast guard station. If they are in your port they will know the answer, if they aren't, they have marine scientists that can read charts and help you out. </p></div>		</li>

<p>they wouldnt even notice it (they'd notice it, but not as a threat). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually over the high seas they wouldn't notice it <strong>at all</strong> unless they have special instrumentation.  The tsunami wave over deep ocean has a period of about 20 minutes, a wavelength of about 50-100 miles, and a height of about 40-50 centimeters, so it would be masked within all the regular wind waves.  It's only really close to shore where it's noticeable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhfV-8dbCE" target="_blank">This famous video</a> of the 2011 Tohoku tsunami taken from a ship is likely very close to shore, maybe about a mile out or less in 100-200 foot water.</p>
<p>Here's a graph showing an example of the shoaling process:<br />

<p>I'm looking around the Internet trying to find some numbers for height &amp; wavelength on the shoaling process in different depths and can't find anything, but that's pretty much how it goes.  Anything like the tsunami wave in Interstellar is going to be in really really shallow water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went diving in the Andaman sea a month before the 2004 tsunami, and after I worked in Sri Lanka for three months the next summer, I went back to Khao Lak and talked to people at the dive company. They told me that day, one boat was dry docked and minimal damage was done to it. The boat that was in the harbor was destroyed, but the two boats that were out to sea had no damage. One of the two boats actually had a dive group in the water, and they didn't know the tsunami hit until they finished the dive. </p></div>		</li>
