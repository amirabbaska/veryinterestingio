			<div class="markdown"><p>To support the above, yes this is a trial and error problem that gets solved on a case by case basis. You can use a rule of thumb or some other guideline to approximate how the system will behave, but end of the day it needs to be tested/validated.</p>
<p>To provide a similar example, air entrainment in various fluids is a concern for machinery. Say you are running some oil in a system for cooling or cutting and you have a collection tank (sump) to pump it back through the system. Air will entrain in the fluid and needs some time to separate. Your sump tank volume can be sized (based on past experience for this application) to provide adequate time for natural separation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not true. First principles includes mass balance and constitutive equations (relationship between flux and potential). This is an engineering problem, that engineers solve all the time. In fact, an order of magnitude estimate would provide a reasonable answer without needing any calculus at all. </p>
<p>Once you have the location of the phase boundary, the difference in density is the driving force, and this can be equated to a pressure difference, and then to flow potential. Diffusion is going to work against buoyancy do we need the diffusivity of oil-in-water and water-in-oil; basically a ratio of the viscosities if we ignore capillary effects.</p>
<p>The time to separate is going to be proportional to the diffusivity times the square of distance based upon the transport equation (Laplace’s equation). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feasible may be too strong of a word. I should say practical. I meant that people don't usually do that in practice because its too much work. Surface tension, solubility of each liquid in the other, container geometry, and the exact initial state all need to be considered among other things.</p>
<p>The empirical equation should still follow and match first principles. But instead of measuring every potential variable, it's faster to lump them into easily measurable empirical parameters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are over complicating this. Ignoring most of that only results in errors in high order terms. The competing drive mechanisms are buoyancy, mobility, and drag.</p></div>		</li>
