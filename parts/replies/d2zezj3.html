			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seen the studies and I agree most sommeliers will not be able to really tell what is in a wine. However Master sommeliers are something else. I think there is a movie in netflix about them but the are basically wine gurus that are able to tell what brand year and place the wine is from just from taste (most of the time). It is very impressive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Those people are dealing with an intentionally limited set of top end and estate wines. While it is impressive they can sort between them so well, it's also in a large part due to the fact that they have a limited pool to begin with. It's like if all you ever drank were the wines on the top shelf at your grocery store, you'd get pretty good at telling them apart. </p>
<p>This is also why they are often so easy to &quot;trick&quot;. A very good wine from a winery that isn't in the pool of &quot;world class&quot; wineries, can easily pass as one because the actual criteria to be world class has a lot of elements that have nothing to do with wine.</p>
<p>So it's not so much that they are truely versed in wine (though they are very knowledgable), as it's that they are very familiar with a subset of wine that is currently considered important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the point still remains that the majority of people, as in 99.999%, aren't going to notice much difference between expensive and inexpensive bottles of wine. Often the cheaper bottles are only cheap because the winery is largely unknown and not as well established as the higher end wineries. So there really isn't a reason to gravitate toward any wine over 30-40$ a bottle unless you actually like that specific bottle. </p>
<p>Personally when I need to restock I just walk through my state-store (fucking laws) and grab any bottle under 10$ that looks good. No person I have ever known would be able to tell the difference between this and if I went and grabbed only bottles over 200$. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all very uninformed. You might be talking about grocery store wine. Wines that's are mass produced for a larger audience. But if you think I can't tell the difference between a McDonald's hamburger and one that's grass fed beef, grilled over wood and finished with real cheddar cheese on a home made brioche bun you're just an idiot. Wine is an agricultural product. There are clear signs of better produce, and it's in the taste and how it's grown. </p></div>		</li>
