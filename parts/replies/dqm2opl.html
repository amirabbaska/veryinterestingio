In linear theory for a matter dominated universe this contrast develops roughly as the scale factor, so just on its own by now it would be 10^(-2), hence we need something, e.g. dark matter, to provide an additional density contrast to form galaxies.</p>
<p>Clearly the density contrast is larger than 100 today even on large scales. Central densities in voids are (very roughly) 10^(-2) of the mean density and we find galaxy clusters with Mpc dimensions and (highly definition dependent) bounding densities of hundreds times the mean and even higher average overdensities. Galaxies sit in the centres of haloes and have even higher mean densities.</p>
<p>Lastly, think about the mean density of the universe (off wikipedia using h=0.7) &lt;\rho&gt; = 2.63032x10^(-26) kg/m^3 and compare that with the mean density of the earth which is ~5.5x10^(3) kg/m^3 (also wikipedia).</p>
<p>Nevertheless I think you are correct that time went by at almost the same speed everywhere on <em>large</em> scales. For the very simple toy model of a Schwarzschild metric around a cluster sized object in a perfectly empty space and a point at the distance of the centre of a large void  at  R_V = 60 Mpc from the cluster centre I find for the virgo cluster (M~1.2x10^(15) M_sol, R_c~2.2 Mpc) a Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2MG/c^2 ~ 115 pc.</p>
<p>The relative time difference f due to gravitational time dilation between a point on the edge of the cluster and the reference point in the &quot;void&quot; is</p>
<p>f = (1-R_s/R_c)^(1/2)-(1-R_s/R_V)^(1/2) = 2.5x10^(-5) ~ 13 minutes / year ~ 350000 years / ageOfTheUniverse</p>
<p>Interestingly this does not change for linear scales throughout matter domination: a given density perturbation grows as the scale factor a, the mean density decreases as a^(-3), the scale changes as a, so the ratio of Schwarzschild radius to radius of a perturbation </p>
<p>2MG/(c^(2)R) = (2G/c^(2)) <em> \delta \rho R^(2)
= \delta_0 </em> a <em> \rho_0 </em> a^(-3) <em> R_0^2 </em> a^2
= (2G/c^(2)) <em> (\delta_0 </em> \rho_0 * R_0^(2))</p>
<p>stays constant throughout matter domination. This means the fractional time difference f should be constant as well as the &quot;void&quot; distance scales just as the perturbation scale and their ratio is therefore also constant.</p>
<p>How did you get to the the same ~10^-5 relative difference in time between different spots of the universe?</p></div>		</li>
