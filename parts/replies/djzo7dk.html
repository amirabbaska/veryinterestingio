			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that telling kids that their warehouses and factories aren't working right will make them think drugs are &quot;dangerous&quot;. Yes, this is a great explanation that children could understand, but I don't think this approach would scare them off from doing drugs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Addicts aren't known for their good hygiene, so often it's not until they're in withdrawals or clean they can address things like poor nutrition, tooth decay, infected needle injection sites and the miscellaneous bacteria that have been growing on every part of the body for the last however long. I worked with an addict once who was happy to be clean not because she wanted to be free of cocaine, but because she was very excited to see a dentist and get her rotten teeth replaced with false teeth and eat solid food again. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true, but let's not forget that a lot of addicts are hygienic, well-functioning members of society. They're just addicted to pharmaceutical opioids.</p>
<p>Maybe they got addicted due to an injury or illness which gave them initial access to the pills....or maybe they just started to take them recreationally, because they feel good and their friend offered it at a party. </p>
<p>At any rate, they keep taking them. Now, sometimes they run of pills and end up on heroin. But that's not always the case. Think of folks like Rush Limbaugh. Regardless of what you think about his politics or show, he's a functional human being. He has a job, he's financially successful, etc. His money and fame allowed him easy access to these pills. Then he ended up having to go to rehab.</p>
<p>There are lots of people like this. </p>
<p>There are a lot of well-functioning addicts out there. Not all addicts are homeless, missing teeth, dirty, or have track marks. Some wear suits and are your boss or co-worker.</p></div>		</li>
