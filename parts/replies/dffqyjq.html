			<div class="markdown"><p>So are you basically saying the force of gravity acting on the two galaxies is greater than the rate of expansion? Great analogy by the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. You can accurately model the expansion as a pressure that resists gravity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be better to say &quot;that opposes gravity&quot; as it can end up as greater in magnitude than gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well yeah but there are also objects within our observable universe that cant come together no matter how fast they are moving, due to the expansion rate between them being faster than they can move.</p>
<p>a lot of stuff in our view is forever out of our range even if we do somehow get up to close to c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rate of expansion of the universe is 74.2 km/s per megaparsec (about 3 billion light years). The distance between the two galaxies is less than a megaparsec so the rate of expansion is less than 74.2 km/s. The speed of the galaxies towards each other is significantly more than the rate of expansion.</p>
<p>In fact 74.2 km/s isn't all that fast even at a planetary scale, let alone at galactic scales. It's only slightly faster than Mercury's orbital velocity, 56.6 km/s at perihelion. The rate of expansion just isn't all that fast, it only gets fast-ish once you get to galactic super-cloister scales, and even then gravity usually comes out ahead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for taking the time to give that answer. It makes it easier for some of us to learn when things are put into analogies like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. What an awesome answer</p>
<p><strong>Basic jist of what this said:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you and a friend are standing on a floor that gets bigger. Each square foot turns to 1.1 foot every 10 seconds.</p>
<p>If you are standing 10ft away from each other after 10 seconds you are 11ft away from each other. You could easily walk against the expansion</p>
<p>But if you were 1000ft away from each other that means after 10 seconds you are 1100ft away. That's a 100 ft difference you would struggle to get back to each other at that rate</p>
<p>The bigger the distance the more the expansion. So because Andromeda is close there isn't as much expansion between us as there is an a more distant galaxy</p></div>		</li>
