			<div class="markdown"><p>For clarification what you're describing are conformational epitopes,  which is where the 3D structure of a protein is necessary for epitope binding and recognition. </p>
<p>You also get linear epitopes which is where the polypeptide sequence of a protein is recognised, so whether you're allergic to something isn't necessarily dependent on protein denaturation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting thing is, not all allergies are mediated by IgE antibodies.  There are also Mast Cell mediated allergies.   These allergies can not be tested for with allergy tests.  They are caused by the mast cells themselves degranulating without an IgE trigger.  Mast cell reactions can include allergic type response from non substantial things like sunlight, heat, cold, stress (physical or emotional).</p>
<p>They are poorly understood as of yet.  Two types are: Mastocytosis which has been known about for years, but is extremely rare, and  Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)  which is recently described (WHO accepted it in 2007).  MCAS is believed common by most who are studying it.  But it's just too new to be confident in much about it.</p>
<p>Any mast cell disorder can cause anaphylaxis without needing IgE antibodies to the trigger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American cheese is 'pasteurized processed cheese' (and in some cases, even less 'cheesy' as 'pasteurized processed cheese PRODUCT'), which is to say it's not entirely cheese.  An allergy to american cheese and not other cheeses could be due to additives present in the american cheese and absent in other cheeses.</p>
<p>Whey is often the offender in milk products, but processing can either denature or remove whey.  An allergy to some milk products but not others (including pasteurized processed cheese product) could be due to the processing rendering the product less offensive to the body. </p></div>		</li>

<p>American Cheese by that label, MUST be cheese, and MUST be a blend of 2 or more cheeses. The other label you used, &quot;cheese product&quot; or &quot;cheese food&quot;, on the other hand, are not, but do still have some regulation.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The short answer is: yes (probably).</p>
<p>People say they're &quot;allergic&quot; to things to mean what we normally think of as allergies, which is an immune system response to something (typically a protein). But they also say they're allergic when they mean it makes them feel bad (upset stomach or other symptoms that could be lactose intolerance or other sensitivities/reactions). So there a bunch of ways someone might have a bad reaction to American cheese but not cheddar or (probably to a lesser extent) the reverse. For instance, American cheese may have added whey protein, milk (lactose), gelatin, and several other ingredients that your friend's customer might have a reaction to. Cheddar on the other hand, being an aged cheese (bacteria ferment the lactose to lactic acid) might be ok for people sensitive to lactose (the sharper the cheddar, generally the more lactose has been fermented). Also, the two main proteins in milk are casein and whey. Casein is denatured by acid, causing it to clump together into curds, while the whey stays in solution and gets washed away when the curds are drained and have the excess liquid squeezed out of them. But since American cheese has milk (and protein concentrates that may include whey and casein, perhaps others), someone sensitive/allergic to whey (or un-denatured casein, or caseinates or other additives to processed cheese food) could have a problem with American and not cheddar.</p>
<p>There are fewer possibilities going the other way, but annatto is added to (yellow) cheddar for color. It's typically used in American cheese as well, but often at lower concentrations and sometimes in conjunction with (or replaced by) other natural or artificial colors. Lactic acid is also more prevalent in cheddar than American.</p>
<p>Or, maybe the guy just didn't like cheddar (or american). There are a lot of times people say &quot;I'm allergic&quot; when they just mean &quot;I don't want that&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the symptoms for a true food intolerance (digestive issue) and a true food allergy (immune response) overlap so much that determining if one's symptoms are due to one or the other is pretty difficult without a gamut of tests and/or anaphylaxis (which is unpredictable). a doctor will likely instruct you to avoid the offending food regardless because even if you've never had an anaphylactic reaction before, if it's a true allergy there is always a risk of it. so if you can't say for sure, it's definitely better to err on the side of caution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silly question here. I used to believe allergies can only be caused by stable proteins that survive the effects of acids or temperature, otherwise they would be denatured by stomach acid and that's the end of the problem.</p>
<p>How can it be denatured by the acid in pickles but not in the stomach?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you put an allergen in your mouth, the first thing that happens is your throat gets scratchy and your nose starts running, etc. (not exclusively true but this is a common reaction). This is more of speculation but I would assume that the main way of allergens being introduced to your system is not by assimilation into the blood stream via the digestive system but by contact to the mucous membranes of your upper respiratory system and upper digestive tract (mouth, throats, esophagus, etc.) Breathing in pollen or rubbing your eyes with pollen on your hands initiate an allergic response as well as direct injection of bee venom into your bloodstream via a sting. So there are several possible vectors of incorporation of allergens, not just ones that pass through the stomach. Also there are more types of allergens than just proteins, some which may not be effected by acid or heat as much.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not only that, but other components of the immune system exist all over your body. Once an allergen/pathogen is discovered it can then be presented to other components, which will result in an immune response. </p></div>		</li>
