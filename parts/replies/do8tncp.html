			<div class="markdown"><p>Medical terminology doesn't work like that. The suffix &quot;itis&quot; means inflammation. &quot;Hepato&quot; means liver. So hepatitis means inflammation of the liver. The disease name describes the condition, not the cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As misleading as it is, it actually is much more intuitive to give viruses common names that more or less describe what the virus does; this certainly makes it easier to remember them all if you have to remember 100 different viruses like doctors have to do. </p>
<p>The confusion comes when you realize how vastly different viruses are from one another in structure and function, even though they appear to do very similar things to the body. Even though hep A B and C all have an initial presentation that resembles some degree of liver failure, we've come to learn over time that they don't remotely resemble each other genetically </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cause hepatitis of course. </p>
<p>I'm kidding. Actually, hep E is transmitted just like and resembles hep A almost exactly, being spread fecal-orally and being self limiting, causing death only in people who are immunologically weak and frail to begin with. </p>
<p>Hep D is in the same family as hep B, being structurally very similar to it as a virus, but unique in that it cannot actually cause infection by itself. We don't know how this happened from an evolutionary standpoint, but hep D needs the presence of hep B in order to be active and cause infection. This can occur in a person who has chronic hep B, is in the hep B carrier state, or a person can get both hep B and D at the same time, which is way worse than just hep B alone. Fatality occurs in about 20% of people this happens to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hep D only occurs in the setting of hep B (the virus for hep D uses some mechanism provided by hep B) and it makes the disease progress much worse. Hep E is like hep A except not as common and for some reason associated with pregnant women. Also no vaccination for hep E. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw that the incidence of death from Hepatitis A in this outbreak is about 3% (supposing that they accurately diagnosed everyone with Hep A. It's almost entirely within the homeless community. Since symptoms can sometimes be pretty mild, a lot of homeless people without health insurance might have decided to not get treatment and wait for it to go away. Meaning they weren't registered in the statistics of number of ill. Which would make the death rate even smaller, but the outbreak much worse than would be indicated from the almost 600 known people diagnosed with Hep A. Even so, it's a lot of deaths. I'd guess that it's that high because you're dealing with a population living in harsh conditions and not the best of health, since most homeless people tend to be mentally ill or addicts, or both. They're not getting proper treatment, as healthcare for such people isn't all that different from what they'd receive in 1880s London.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is, you can easily gain immunity to hep A through vaccination when you’re a kid- but nowadays, parents would rather base their judgment and decisions off of fake Facebook articles and extremely rare instances, instead of realizing that these viruses can KILL their children and spread to others.. causing an outbreak such as this one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Hepatitis A vaccine came out in 1995. I haven't heard of any widespread public health calls to vaccinate adults for it. And it's expensive, so even if people want to be vaccinated, they might not be able to afford it. So few people over age 20 or so are vaccinated. The deaths from Hep A in San Diego are mostly among the homeless--people living in poor conditions and in poor health. These are not likely people who are avoiding vaccination because they're anti-vaxxers. They're just not able to afford it and aren't able to keep as hygienic as they'd like to. California property is very expensive so we're seeing very large homeless encampments along areas such as rivers and remote streets. They live in tents and cobbled-together boxes. The situation has been made worse by the city's removal of port-a-potties that had been used for them. I think the thought was that removing the port-a-potties would make life more difficult for the homeless encampments and they'd leave. But instead it made the whole area dirtier. So the area became more unsanitary, and disease naturally followed. The outbreak has spread to Orange County homeless camps now.</p></div>		</li>
