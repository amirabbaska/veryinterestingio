			<div class="markdown"><p>The layout of this explanation is really brilliant! Looking through the observations, our assumptions, etc. and then showing how they reason to the answer is a great way of explaining stuff like this. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, thanks. When was an iron core first proposed and when did we become fairly certain of this? Some things you mentioned didnâ€™t exist until relatively recently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These lines of evidence built up over time:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 1798, Henry Cavendish <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/106988" target="_blank">first measured Earth's density</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the late 1890's, Wiechert made a guess suggesting that the excess density was iron that had settled to the center of the Earth, much the same way that iron settles to the bottom and slag floats the top during iron smelting. (<a href="http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PID=GDZPPN002497891" target="_blank">Link if you happen to read German...</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>By 1906, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3F3zAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA456" target="_blank">Oldham recognized a clearly different zone</a> in the inner Earth using earthquake data that indicated the size of the core.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> to add the important bit from Oldham, 1906 found on pg. 472:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...the central four-tenths of the radius are occupied by matter possessing radically different physical properties inasmuch as the rate of propagation of the first phase is but slightly reduced while the second phase waves are either not transmitted at all or more probably transmitted at about half the rate which prevails in the outer shell </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a bit of a low estimate for the core (2550 km, instead of today's modern estimate of 3400 km), but not bad for a first try, and the first conclusive evidence of an iron core.</p></div>		</li>
