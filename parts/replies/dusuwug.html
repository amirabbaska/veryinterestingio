			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the diversion of blood flow to the outer extremities, some non essential organs (to handle the threat) also slow down. This includes the digestion system. This is why you often see nervous/fearful public speakers or people being interviewed require a drink. There digestion system slows (due to resources being used elsewhere) and their saliva dries up. </p>
<p>Fun fact - Old asian cultures use to put uncooked rice in the mouth of people on trial. The theory being - If the person was guilty, they would be afraid of being caught. Their fear would would result in their mouth going dry and prevent them from spitting out the rice. If not guilty they would not be fearful of being caught and the saliva would enable them to empty their mouth...this of course has very HIGH probabilities of generating false positives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very interesting question. I do not know of any research that suggests this, but it does make alot of sense. I'll do some digging. </p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>Blood draining away from your hands, feet, face because this is where you are likely to take superficial damage.  Think, blocking a charging dog with your arms.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More blood to the heart and lungs = better athletic performance.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more blood to the heart and lungs = longer survivability if you take a major injury.  </p>
</li>
<li>Fun fact, the brain IS critical in these incidents but not ALL of your brain.  Core functions like sight, hearing, reaction time, logical decision making, all those nearer the center of your brain are heightened.  </li>
</ol>
<p>None immediate higher level functions like empathy, emotion, philosophical morality are given less resources.  </p>
<p>This is covered in a good pair of Books by Dave Grossman &quot;On Killing&quot; and &quot;On Combat&quot;  </p>
<p>Grossman references the hypothetical example of the soldier that goes into a gun fight in combat mode and just executes his training.  &quot;See threat, shoot threat, move on to next threat&quot;</p>
<p>But only after everything calms down and the soldier's brain returns to normal operation does that soldier have time to process the moral weight of stuff like &quot;I just killed someone&quot;</p></div>		</li>
