<p>A crown was worth 5 shillings or 100 pence, so it was the natural unit to convert to when you're trying to decimalize with existing coins.</p>

<p>I'm a little confused by this. Can you explain more?</p>
<p>Five shillings has never been 100 pence, not in Britain at least. A shilling was 12d (12 old pence, before decimalisation in 1971) with 20s (240d) to £1</p>
<p>Post-decimalisation £1 became 100 new pence, the shilling became the 5p piece (20 of them to a pound remember) making 5 &quot;shillings&quot; equal to 25p.</p>
<p>A crown, while called a &quot;dollar&quot; historically, and similar in weight to the Spanish dollar, was actually more akin to a British quarter.</p></div>		</li>
