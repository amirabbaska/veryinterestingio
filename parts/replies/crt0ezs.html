<p>Now, you might be able to cover yourself in whatever burns at 20 C and that would work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would an 80°C flame sink in a 90°C room?</p>
<p>EDIT: I guess it wouldn't <em>cool</em> the air, so probably not. But would it be the same temperature as the air around it, then, and just kind of radiate outward as if it were in zero gravity? Would it not be able to keep going because of inability to generate convection? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a flame is caused by an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases heat. So if you were to light such a candle in a hot room, it would only make the room hotter (and of course, the flame would be hottest of all). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, are you saying that an 80°C flame would still be hotter than a 90°C room?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, i mean, i know what you mean... It would add heat, slowing the overall cooling down of the room for example. But the way you wrote it makes it sound like the room could end up above 90°C, which would be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The same flame would be a lot cooler in space vs a 21C room. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple notes as to how they achieved this:  </p>
<ul>
<li>This is a plasma assisted ignition (think, shooting single O atoms into the flow).  This is highly active and promotes ignition even when auto-ignition would not occur </li>
<li>DME has very active low temperature chemistry  </li>
<li>Low pressures (they mention up to half an atmosphere, but most are at ~72 torr)  </li>
<li>Incredibly long (in terms of practical combustion) residence times in the combustor, up to 6s vs milliseconds in practical applications</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this is important:  </p>
<ul>
<li>People have been studying using plasma to assist/stabilize ignition in newer engines, especially at very fuel lean / low temperature / high flow speed conditions which is the way most new combustion ideas seem to be heading</li>
