			<div class="markdown"><p>But is the goal of evolution really to have as many offspring as possible, rather than just have <em>any</em> offspring and pass on your genes? If that's the case, why didn't humans or many other species evolve to have more efficient reproductive system - for example, human gestation lasting only 3 months instead of 9 so that women could bear more children during lifetime? My understanding was that the goal is simply to have offspring, not to have as many as possible and multiply the population rapidly, because it would be impossible for many species to just multiply their numbers into infinity anyway. Among species that have very vulnerable offspring and not take care of them, females tend to produce a lot more young but a lot of them die, in contrast with species like elephants or horses that tend to have only one or two offspring per birth but take care of them so they're more likely to survive, even with such small numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're a bit off on some of this.     </p>
<p>You're right that the skewed sex ratio will select for the sex that is not favored by the ratio. But this is never the result of selection on the group. The selection is on the individual that produces the male. It increases its individual fitness by producing offspring that will produce more offspring. It is not selection on a group level. Other individuals within that group have a lowered fitness as the result of fitness gain of the single individual. So the single individual will have its genes spread around more, but the other group members do not benefit from that, they suffer fitness reduction.    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you will see some species with 1 - 1 pairing, and some with harems of females, but basically never have harems of males.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true, but its not the result of skewed sex ratio at birth. It's the result of male-male competition. The dominant male gets the females, the other males are still there, they just don't get to mate. The sex ratio at birth in these species are still even.    </p>
<p>The reason you see harems is sexual selection. Females choose the most attractive male and preferentially mate with him. In a system like deer, the male comes to dominate the harem through male-male competition, but once he's secured his dominance, the females will only mate with him because he is clearly the most fit male. This way the females will have &quot;sexy sons&quot; who will be able to compete for mates better than their conspecifics. This increases the female's inclusive fitness. So it's still individual selection. And the birth ratios are still 50-50.</p></div>		</li>
