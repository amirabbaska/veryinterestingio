<p>DAB is a much more of a 'complete' standard than HD radio, which is essentially a single company's protocol that many areas in the US have adopted. If/When FM starts to get killed off in the US, it'll probably end up with competing 'standards' and a format war.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except that's not going to happen any time soon because the Emergency Alert System uses a daisy chain of FM stations to relay alerts, coverage will inevitably suffer with a digital system</p></div>		</li>

<p>there's no reason that you couldn't approve it for the 88-108 MHz band</p>

<p>the FCC isn't currently looking into that, because there won't be any leftover spectrum to resell</p></div>		</li>

<p>DAB is an all-digital transmission in a different frequency band, but the two places DAB is usually transmitted (the L-Band or high-VHF) are already used in the US for other things (military telemetry and channels 7 through 13).</p>
<p>HD Radio is sometimes called IBOC because it's <strong>i</strong>n-<strong>b</strong>and, <strong>o</strong>n-<strong>c</strong>hannel. <a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/~liue/teaching/comm_standards/2011F_HD_Radio/index_files/image009.jpg" target="_blank">It is transmitted via two digital sidebands that surround the analog FM signal.</a> (There is also a digital-only mode, but nobody's using it because then there'd be no analog FM signal.)</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico both tried DAB. In Canada, it got deployed in a few cities but nobody was listening, so HD Radio wound up being approved for use there. In Mexico, broadcasters in northern Mexico got alarmed by the potential of losing their US audience when it was tested in the 90s. Instead, Mexico approved HD Radio for stations within 320 kilometers of the US in 2008, and for stations in all areas in 2011.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's a satellite-to-earth system. HD Radio is transmitted on terrestrial broadcasting antennas by AM and FM stations. </p></div>		</li>
