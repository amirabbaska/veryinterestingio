			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of time dilation. The closer you get to the speed of light the less time has passed for the traveller to the point where time stands still for the traveller at the speed of light. Meanwhile at non-relativistic speeds a week has passed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but if you can travel at light speed, then that either means you have no mass or infinite mass. Because infinite mass is improbable, then you most likely have no mass. If you have no mass, and can travel at light speed, then time effectively doesn't affect you; therefore, the distance from earth and you is hypothetically no distance at all and therefore, you can be there instantaneously. For people on earth, it would take you a week to travel back, but for you it would be instantaneously.</p>
<p>Edit: this also means you wouldn't age at all, but the people on earth would have aged a week. This is why traveling at light speed is a form of 'time travel' in a way.</p>
<p>Edit 2: and I didn't mean for it to sound like having no mass IS probable. It is impossible to have no mass or infinite mass (unless your a photon :P)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't you have to stay in the same spot for that week in order to see the light as if you were watching yourself? If you start going back towards the earth you'll reach the light faster and the week will be sort-of fast forwarded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring relativity. If you travelled through the wormhole you'd be seeing light from a week before you left. Now if you travelled at light speed back to earth... It would take a week to get back. So you'd arrive 1 week after you left. So logically you'd see everything in fast forward from a week before you left up until a week after. It would take you a week to get back but you'd see 2 weeks worth of light. But that's ignoring relativity. Travelling at light speed you'd see nothing at all because you'd experience no time at all.</p></div>		</li>
