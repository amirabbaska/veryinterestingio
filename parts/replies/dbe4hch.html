<p>What's stopping people from getting together and creating a community run, not-for-profit, insurance company.</p>
<p>There's a few different SIMPLE options... you pick one... it covers everything... no bullshit.</p>
<p>Would be even easier for home insurance.</p>
<p>I guess you'd either need a lot of capital, or a lot of people to join quickly... to get this started.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trick is remaining solvent. If too many people sign up with major/chronic health conditions, the organization will run out of money quickly. This is why ACA coverage has gone up in price: not enough healthy people signed up.</p>
<p>There's nothing stopping you, you just need a bunch of startup cash and a good strategy for balancing your clients.</p></div>		</li>

<p>not-for-profit, insurance company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FWIW, they basically have those, they're called cooperatives. They're not community run, though.</p>
<p>There's a lot of behind the scenes work though. You have to negotiate prices with hospitals,fraud detection etc. That means employees.</p>
<p>It's doable, but it's kinda the same reason we don't have nonprofits for everything</p></div>		</li>
