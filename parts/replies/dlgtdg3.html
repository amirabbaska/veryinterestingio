			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I've met some ugly people with ugly personalities and no redeeming factors at all.</p>
<p>Beautiful people I've met tend to be nicer and more laid back, less manipulative.</p>
<p>I think it has something to do with how jaded they are. But like anything, it can go both ways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's...not true. Ugly people might have less handed to them, but that doesn't mean that they have more personality. I've met ugly people who could not be more boring (or just more mean) and attractive people that were very fun to be around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconded this. There was one unattracrive guy in Gamestop recently that was taking up my time by showing off his Zelda flask and bragging about how he has a Master Sword that he knows is sharp because he stabs his pillow with it. All this while bragging to the girl behind the counter. I think he'd been there flirting with her for over an hour. </p>
<p>I don't think there was anything wrong with him, it's just that he had the personality of a wet blanket. </p>
<p>On the other hand my step sister is beautiful and funny and bubbly and everyone loves her. </p></div>		</li>
