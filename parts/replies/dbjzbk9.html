<p><em>Article reduction: 72%</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Internet sites like Facebook promote content that gets people to react.</p>
<p>An outrageous lie about a politician will get the people who hate that politician to comment out of anger for the terrible things that the lie claims, and people who support that politician will comment in support of that politician and argue that the whole article is a lie.</p>
<p>More people are getting more of their news from Facebook instead of from other normal media sources, and Facebook promotes news that is likely going to get you to actively react than it is news that is likely going to inform you of the truth.</p>
<p>Facebook will start to promote it as actual news, and it will be to Facebook's benefit because it will encourage more people to share, and encourage more people to respond for or against it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scandal was left unmentioned.  The scandal - the thing that brought everything to a head and forced Facebook to admit they were in the wrong - is of course the end result of this fake news, which the US and the world will have to deal with for the next four years, with the fallout lasting who knows how many decades.</p></div>		</li>
