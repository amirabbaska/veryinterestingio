			<div class="markdown"><p>Well look, Jira is pretty effective at tracing a task from beginning to end.</p>
<p>I wonder if they did QA testing on the completed tasks? Confirm if a target is dead, confirm that they did in fact get the nudes they were looking for. You know, everyday sort of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment I commented on states the situation as fact, but there hasn't been any evidence that would support such assertion, much less multiple sources that would corroborate it. </p>
<p>If true, then this is the biggest leak in the history of CIA. </p>
<p>But it's worth noticing that it came out during a huge scandal of Trump administration's unusual ties with Russia. So far in this scandal, we've seen Mr. Flynn resigning over lying about his ties to Russia, Trump lying about his ties to Russia multiple ties and Mr. Sessions perjuring himself over his  connections with Russia, the last act reaching its climax just as the leak came out. </p>
<p>If true, the leak would provide Russia with plausible deniability in terms of multiple cyberattacks Russian secret services are now considered to be the perpetrators of, basically giving them a limitless cop-out of &quot;CIA framed us&quot;. </p>
<p>The only source so far (unless I missed something) is wikileaks, who have acted in Russia's interest before. </p>
<p>Since there are reasonable doubts of the validity of the story and it's entirely possible that there were ulterior motives, I believe it's worth mentioning that for now, it's a story. </p></div>		</li>
