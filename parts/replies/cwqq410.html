In order to bring the tail end up as much/quickly as possible, would you want to put your front foot as far forward as possible, or is the placement of the front foot of little consequence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Front foot placement is important for height of ollie. For high ollies you need to make sure that the board does not level out too early because that pretty much means you have most of the time reached your max height. A longer slide of your front foot allows for more control on higher ollies. That is not to say you cannot get a high ollie with your front foot closer to the nose, it just is not as controlled and takes much more effort to get it right and high. Rule of thumb is foot futhur back equals a higher ollie. I think in your analysis of this you might have overlooked that skater is putting weight on the board pretty much at all points of time. Back foot on pop and front foot to level out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does make things more clear. </p>
<p>It was an extremely naive analysis, but I think the fault was more with the fact that I didn't consider that the front foot would be moved. To consider the most extreme situation you could have your front foot right next to your back foot - which would not work at all. Conversely having the front foot way at the front will cause the board to change the orientation of the rotation, bringing up the back end - but with less fine tuning than if you would start out with the more moderate position of having your front foot near the middle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I typically put my front foot at about the mid point on the board so you have a greater distance to slide forward. While the back foot is as far back as possible while still maintaining balance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is an especially important information because most people (who never skated) just think the skate pushes you up.</p>
<p>As you clearly said: you are the one jumping and making some stuff to bring the skate together.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But as a skateboarder myself, I very much shared your view. What my program provided was exactly that. I gave kids the basic tools needed to skateboard then I set them free in a skate park. </p></div>		</li>
