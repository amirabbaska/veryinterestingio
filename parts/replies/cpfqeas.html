			<p>The Sun is indeed <strong>very</strong> bright. But the eye can adjust to really quite an enormous range of light levels; the full range reaches across 9 orders of magnitude, although at any given time it can only manage a contrast ratio of ~1:1000 <br><br>Given up to 30 minutes to adapt to darkness, or 5 minutes to adapt to bright light, it can redefine what level of light is &quot;fully black&quot; to move that 1:1000 range around within the full range, to whichever point is most useful for the light level around you.<br><br>So if you walked directly from full sunlight to a darkened room you'd be pretty blind for a while. Hell, I've noticed it just with the illumination from my phone when I'm in bed - if I'm lying with half of my face covered by a pillow I end up with one eye that's dark-adapted and can see okay, but the other is adapted to the brightness of the phone and can't see a damn thing in the dark. <br><br>Edit: <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/please-stop.html" target="_blank">please stop</a> telling me about pirates, <em>I know</em></p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not sure, and can't find a great source on it; there's what seems like conflicting information saying the eye has a static contrast ratio of only 100:1, but that may be reconciled if paired with the idea that it adjusts after every saccade by changing the size of the pupil and making quick adjustments to its own chemistry (to get back towards the 1:1000 &quot;at one time&quot; figure). <br><br>Given that LCDs routinely claim contrast ratios in the millions it seems like there must be something else going on, unless they're being massively over-hyped. There seems to be at least some element of marketing-fiction involved but I suspect we may also have more ability to jump around within the wider range from moment to moment (with the brain smoothing over the switching in the same way as it &quot;covers up&quot; various other limitations on our vision; like the blind spot, or the lack of colour in our peripheral vision). <br><br>Eyes aren't all that easily compared to the technical specs of cameras or display technology - it's the same with trying to compare pixel-based resolution to the eye's ability of the eye to resolve small details, or comparing a frame rate to either the shortest events we can notice or to the threshold on persistence of vision. They just work too differently to make a direct comparison, especially when you include post-processing done by the brain.</p>		</li>

			<p>LCDs that claim <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_ratio" target="_blank">contrast ratios</a> in the millions use the &quot;dynamic contrast&quot; value, the contrast between fully-black cell with minimal backlight, and fully-white cell at maximum backlight. To achieve this the monitor varies backlight according to what it thinks is suitable for the screne it's displaying.<br><br>The more realistic value of how much difference between black and white levels a panel can display simultaneously is called &quot;static contrast&quot;. For TN panels that's typically 800-1200:1, IPS -- 600-1500:1, *VA types -- 1500-5000:1.</p>		</li>

			<p>Oh. Plasma can go up to 20000:1, and AMOLED up to +INF, theoretically. But that's because those devices can have &quot;perfect black&quot; -- i.e. they actually emit their own light per pixel, and pure black pixels don't emit anything. CRT is somewhere around plasma, but that varies grietly by the technology used.<br><br>In real life, the screen's contrast is greatly dependent on the ambient light, but in most situations Plasma/AMOLED technology still beats LED at static contrast.<br><br>But in high-illumination areas (like daylight/direct sunlight) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transflective_liquid-crystal_display" target="_blank">transflective LCD technology</a> can have significantly better visibility and contrast than backlit/emissive &quot;normal&quot; display types. I've seen some of these in the 2008-2010 NOKIA navigator phones, they were really awesome to use in daylight, too bad the tech never really took off.</p>		</li>

			<p>One thing that demonstrates our own eyes amazing ability to see a great range of light is look at camera technology.

			<p>Arguably, this has more to do with our brain than our eyes. Both our eyes and modern (2005+) sensors can see individual photons. There isn't much you can do sensitivity-wise beyond that. Our eyes also have comparably transmissive optical media to camera lenses.<br><br>But whereas photographic media take snapshots or video footage and just... store it, our eyes process the visual information and give meaning to the image. This allows us to recognize features even though the visual information is only marginally there.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, the Sun is apparent magnitude -27, and the dimmest stars visible by the naked eye at night are magnitude +6.  That's a 33 magnitude range.  Since every 5 magnitudes is a 100-fold increase in brightness, that means the Sun is 10 trillion (10^(13)) times brighter than the dimmest visible stars.<br><br>However, the Sun is an extended object, not a point source.  The human eye's resolution is about 1 arcminute.  The Sun is about 1000 square arcminutes in apparent area.  So the difference in magnitude per visible unit area between the Sun and the dimmest stars is about 10 billion (10^(10)).<br><br>I'm not sure how the brightest signal the eye can sense is defined, but the Sun seems like a reasonable approximation, since it seems to be at the limit of what most people can look at without being impaired.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't think the sun is a good reference. It saturates the eye. Using the same logic you could set a camera's contrast to be suitable for night-time photography and then take a picture of a welding flame. You could claim a great contrast ratio, except the flame would be completely saturated.</p>		</li>

			<p>In smaller single engine cessnas and whatnot the instruments aren't very bright so you need headlamps to see. The headlamps have to be red lights though, because your typical LED white lights not only cause loss of adjusted night vision but they leave floaters so looking for traffic becomes damn near impossible.

			<p>Not really - for me it's triggered just by overall loudness.  The cafeteria back in school would often do it just from all the random noise going on.  Although maybe certain frequencies are affected by it more than others, those same frequencies are fine if it's in an overall quieter situation.</p>		</li>

			<p>What if the tinfoil created a smoothing effect on the surface of the moon. Wouldn't a greater percentage of the light then be reflected in directions that are not toward the Earth? The same way that a wet patch of ground appears darker because the light is not dispersed as much when the reflective surface is smoother?</p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly. If the moon was a flat mirror, you would only be able to see it when the reflection of the sun was perfectly aligned. Seeing the moon would be as rare as a total eclipse.<br><br>If it was a curved mirror then you would probably only see a speck of light at any time that was reflected toward you, much dimmer than the moon is now.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; you would only be able to see it when the reflection of the sun was perfectly aligned<br><br><br>Well if the mirror was completely smooth (i.e. a perfectly spherical mirror), then you would always have some sort of alignment except during a new moon or a lunar eclipse.<br><br><br>Think about those convex mirrors used to hope you check around corners.  You don't have to worry about getting the alignment correct, right?</p>		</li>

			<p>Nope, it would be much brighter than the moon is now, but also much smaller.  It would essentially be a very small area, but with nearly the same brightness per square arc-second (had to think for a while about the units for that one) as the sun.</p>		</li>

			<p>I tried to work this out, the sunlight would be diverging from a convex surface so would have lower brightness at the Earth. There would be a virtual image of the sun at around the Moons distance that would appear to be 3% of the diameter of the Sun. I think the brightness of this would be 44% of the sun's brightness though so it would look nearly the same magnitude to our eyes.<br><br>If I've done this right it would provide 1.3% of sunlight, so 60-70 lux, much brighter than the current moonlight.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>If the moon was a curved mirror, it would mostly reflect the blackness of space, but would also reflect the sun.  The sun would then be visible as an extremely bright spot on the moon's reflective surface.  Sort of like if you looked at the reflection of the sun off the back of a spoon.</p>		</li>

			<p>When tin foil is wrapped around a ball it gets all krinkled up. You wouldn't get a smooth, mirror like surface from that. </p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, this would have no effect on the brightness of the moon.  The reason for this is that, uniquely amongst simple shapes, a sphere has the same amount of surface pointing in every direction, so the total amount of light with a reflective surface is exactly the same as with a scattering surface.  The light would be concentrated in a bright spot on the moon, rather than spread out across all the Moon. <br><br>With the angular size of the Sun and the Moon being similar, pointing the moon-sized mirror exactly at one point on the Earth would result in a brightness approximately the same as the Sun, as observed as at the focal point.  A Fresnel mirror could be used in order to not require huge altitude changes relative to the surface of the Moon.</p>		</li>

			<p>Another fun fact:  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=venus+albedo&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8" target="_blank">Venus has a bond albedo of about 0.9</a>, which might mean that it is more reflective than aluminum foil.  Though, it's probably debatable whether bond albedo or geometric albedo would matter more for that comparison.  That also means that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_albedo#Examples" target="_blank">Venus actually absorbs less light from the sun than Earth</a> despite being closer.  Venus receives about twice as much light, but scatters three times as much of it back out into space.  It also means that the proposed cloud cities on Venus could put solar panels on the bottom and top.</p>		</li>
