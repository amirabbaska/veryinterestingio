			<div class="markdown"><p>The Sun is indeed <strong>very</strong> bright. But the eye can adjust to really quite an enormous range of light levels; the full range reaches across 9 orders of magnitude, although at any given time it can only manage a contrast ratio of ~1:1000 </p>
<p>Given up to 30 minutes to adapt to darkness, or 5 minutes to adapt to bright light, it can redefine what level of light is &quot;fully black&quot; to move that 1:1000 range around within the full range, to whichever point is most useful for the light level around you.</p>
<p>So if you walked directly from full sunlight to a darkened room you'd be pretty blind for a while. Hell, I've noticed it just with the illumination from my phone when I'm in bed - if I'm lying with half of my face covered by a pillow I end up with one eye that's dark-adapted and can see okay, but the other is adapted to the brightness of the phone and can't see a damn thing in the dark. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if the tinfoil created a smoothing effect on the surface of the moon. Wouldn't a greater percentage of the light then be reflected in directions that are not toward the Earth? The same way that a wet patch of ground appears darker because the light is not dispersed as much when the reflective surface is smoother?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. If the moon was a flat mirror, you would only be able to see it when the reflection of the sun was perfectly aligned. Seeing the moon would be as rare as a total eclipse.</p>
<p>If it was a curved mirror then you would probably only see a speck of light at any time that was reflected toward you, much dimmer than the moon is now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well if the mirror was completely smooth (i.e. a perfectly spherical mirror), then you would always have some sort of alignment except during a new moon or a lunar eclipse.</p>
<p>Think about those convex mirrors used to hope you check around corners.  You don't have to worry about getting the alignment correct, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, it would be much brighter than the moon is now, but also much smaller.  It would essentially be a very small area, but with nearly the same brightness per square arc-second (had to think for a while about the units for that one) as the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this would have no effect on the brightness of the moon.  The reason for this is that, uniquely amongst simple shapes, a sphere has the same amount of surface pointing in every direction, so the total amount of light with a reflective surface is exactly the same as with a scattering surface.  The light would be concentrated in a bright spot on the moon, rather than spread out across all the Moon. </p>
<p>With the angular size of the Sun and the Moon being similar, pointing the moon-sized mirror exactly at one point on the Earth would result in a brightness approximately the same as the Sun, as observed as at the focal point.  A Fresnel mirror could be used in order to not require huge altitude changes relative to the surface of the Moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun fact:  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=venus+albedo&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" target="_blank">Venus has a bond albedo of about 0.9</a>, which might mean that it is more reflective than aluminum foil.  Though, it's probably debatable whether bond albedo or geometric albedo would matter more for that comparison.  That also means that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_albedo#Examples" target="_blank">Venus actually absorbs less light from the sun than Earth</a> despite being closer.  Venus receives about twice as much light, but scatters three times as much of it back out into space.  It also means that the proposed cloud cities on Venus could put solar panels on the bottom and top.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Presumably the sides would also help? A least for the component of indirect insolation coming from directions closer to the horizon.</p></div>		</li>
