<p>Likewise, if ALL the stem cells get destroyed (like by radiation), the animal will die. However, if even one stem cell survives, that cell will be able to replicate and restore the regenerative ability of the organism.</p>

<p>I honestly didn't know this and am very glad I read this response.<br />
I don't use the word fascinating often, but I think it fits this scenario.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Huh? These &quot;stem cells&quot; as you call them sounds like something we should be researching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed! There's plenty of research being done on stem cells, but the research has been stunted with regards to humans because of ethical/moral concerns from people in congress. If you just google &quot;stem cell research&quot; you can find data from both sides of the argument.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jokes aside, we should be clear that it is human <em>embryonic</em> stem cell research that is controversial for reasons that are not trivial. There are plenty types of human stem cell types (hematopoietic, iPSC, cancer stem cell etc) that receive large amounts of funding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went from an 80% projected recovery rate after three years of intensive PT and care to getting a surgery instead where stem cells were used to regrow my cartilage and was at about ~92% within a few months after surgery. I had surpassed 80% within two weeks of of initial surgery.
Pretty cool to think that I'm like a hydra regrowing my cartilage now.</p></div>		</li>
