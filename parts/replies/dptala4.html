<p>Without the specific heat capacity of water evening out the temperatures, it would be scorching hot during the day and freezing every night. That goes double for the winter/summer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can we detect those?</p>
<p>Do they extend the definition of habitable zone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are sometimes referred to as 'cryospheres,' or frozen hydrospheres. While they do make carbon-based complex aquatic life outside of the habitable zone possible, they also require a strong source of internal heat to maintain their subsurface oceans. In the case of Europa, and the somewhat similar Saturnian moon Enceladus, this heat is provided by tidal heating, which occurs when uneven external gravitational influences cause the interior of a planet to flex against itself.</p>
<p>Significant tidal heating requires strong tidal forces; in the case of both Europa and Enceladus this is caused by being tidally locked to a much larger parent body and in a resonant orbit with one or more other satellites of the same parent body. Finding more bodies like them would entail finding extrasolar moons, which are much smaller and therefore harder to spot than full-sized planets. To date we only have a few known exomoon candidates, and none of them have been confirmed.</p>
<p>However, several red dwarfs are known to have solar systems which appear rather similar to scaled-up gas giant satellite systems. A planet could conceivably orbit beyond a red dwarf's habitable zone and still be both tidally locked and resonant with other planets of that star. Identifying a world as a strong 'super-Europa' candidate would require knowing its albedo (reflectivity) and being able to rule out the possibility of a bright atmosphere (which could be accomplished with spectroscopic analysis). Both of these are harder to do around dim stars with erratic brightness.</p>
<p>A planet could also be sufficiently massive to maintain internal geological activity for a longer period than is possible with a moon-sized body, and keep a subsurface ocean liquid through vulcanism. This makes a narrower window for life to occur, however, as the planet will eventually lose its heat and freeze solid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the great answer! </p>
<p>I like how there’s a parallel between a conventional habitable zone and the “tidal heating zone” around a gas giant that might enable a moon to sustain life.</p>
<p>I wonder if it’s necessary to be in a resonant orbit with another moon since the differential in tidal forces from the very close gas giant could provide the flexing you mentioned if the moon is close enough and big enough (sort of like a beefed up version of the Earth-Moon relationship).</p></div>		</li>
