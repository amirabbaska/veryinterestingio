<p>The signal that refreshes the authorizations on the card is for <em>your</em> receiver/smartcard combination. Multiple receivers will require multiple signals. We (as a customer service rep) can manually send the signal, which was called a &quot;hit.&quot; But there is no real good reason to <em>keep</em> sending that signal once the change got made. The simple &quot;hack&quot; was (and may likely still be) to order the channels you want, wait until they come on, unplug your receivers, call up and cancel the channels. <em>Wait</em> at least 24 hours, 48 to be safe, and then plug them back in. You conveniently miss that &quot;remove authorization&quot; signal and will likely keep your programming for <em>years.</em> No hacking or special cards or voided warranties or even any laws broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DirectTV used to frequently send a &quot;silver bullet&quot; command to all receivers that would disable any hacked cards.  It came via the satellite, so would still hit those boxes not plugged into a phone.  If I tried your method, it was likely the box would still get hit at some point (say at 3AM), unless you unplugged it whenever you weren't watching.  That would have been annoying on its own.</p>
<p>If the box got hit, I'd just wait a few hours, watch some movies on VHS, get the updated hack from my friend, reprogram the card, good to go.</p></div>		</li>

 Back in the mid-late 2000's I accidentally did this with my Satellite radio. I canceled service and shelved the radio. Years later, I'm cleaning out the garage and decide to plug it in for shits and giggles. Lo and behold, it ran for over another year before it was deactivated for good.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cable systems use the same &quot;hit&quot; to tell the device it's authorized, and which channels it can display.  The 2 way boxes would have to reply in order for the box to stay active. If no reply it was automatically sent a deauthorization hit after a certain time so those weren't really hackable to my knowledge.  We would get trouble calls for non-responders often in houses with sub-band signal problems.  It would cause the boxes to reboot and have no channels because they would randomly poll boxes from the head end. One way boxes didn't do this so I assume you could still do this. </p></div>		</li>
