			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfusionist here: They used two simple roller pumps, and beer tubing to go between the mother and the child while attempting to repair holes in the hearts of children. They called it &quot;cross-circulation&quot; and they attempted it something like 45 times in humans. Essentially, they were using the parent or whoever volunteered as the oxygenator, so the blood would pump from the adult arterial to the child arterial (which oxygenates the child so the repair can be done) and the blood would come from the child venous to the adult venous to keep the blood volumes balanced between the two. The problem with this technique is you could have a 200% mortality, meaning you lose two patients- one sick and one completely healthy. You can see how ethically that's a little concerning. It actually almost happened, one mother got a bolus of air and it caused her to stroke and lose higher thinking abilities. She couldn't even remember the names of her children. </p>
<p>I second the reading &quot;King of Hearts&quot;, it is a really good book that describes heart surgery's humble beginnings. </p></div>		</li>

I need more information about this procedure, because that seems medically and ethically intriguing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a long time ago, before IRBs and medical ethics were a big thing. There is no way that would fly today! But we owe a lot to those who were willing to do some of this stuff to get us where we are today.  </p>
<p>I look forward to the day when transplanting hearts and other organs from deceased donors is considered barbaric - the day will come when we can grow functional tissues that are derived from our own cells, eliminating the need for anti-rejection medication.</p>
<p>They called it “cross circulation” and the reply above has a nice explanation of how this was done.</p></div>		</li>
