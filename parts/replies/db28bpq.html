<p>In circular accelerators, the energy of proton beams is generally limited by the achievable magnetic field strength. To increase the particle energy, you can either build stronger magnets or larger rings.</p>
<p>In circular electron accelerators, the maximum achievable energy is indeed limited by synchrotron radiation and not at all by the achievable magnetic field strength.</p>
<p>I wrote a longer post about this a few months ago: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2rkkbv/how_does_a_particle_accelerator_work_what_kind_of/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2rkkbv/how_does_a_particle_accelerator_work_what_kind_of/</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Size matters in that there are technological limits to how much you can accelerate a given particle in a machine of a given length. You'll often see accelerator physicists quantifying this in terms of numbers in MeV/m or GeV/m. This is the amount of energy they are able to give to a certain particle per unit length.</p>
<p>I don't know all the numbers for the latest technologies, but suffice it to say that we can't make things move arbitrarily fast in an arbitrarily small distance, at least not with current technology.</p>
<p>Also for circular accelerators, you have to worry about the bending radius if losses to synchrotron radiation are significant.</p>

<p>Yes, a stronger magnet can bend the beam harder. But then the more you bend the beam, the harder it has to accelerate, and the more synchrotron radiation it emits. Also dipole magnets used for beam steering generally max out at field strengths on the order of 1-10 Tesla, so again we can't bend the beams arbitrarily hard.</p></div>		</li>
