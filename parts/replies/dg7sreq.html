			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also interesting to note the glia in the CNS that correspond to the Schwann cells of the PNS (i.e., oligdendrocytes) are not just incapable of allowing CNS nerve regeneration, but they actively <em>prohibit</em> regeneration by using chemical messengers called glycoproteins. Shielding severed CNS neurons from these messengers will cause them to try to repair themselves by growing out until they complete the process or reach a section with more glycoproteins to stop them. </p>
<p>While it might seem odd that the brain would actively inhibit most CNS neural regeneration rather than make an attempt to repair the damage, some scientists suspect the reason may be to protect the experience-dependent &quot;plasticity&quot; of the brain that allows us to learn and retain memories in the first place (although the exact reasons are currently unknown). </p></div>		</li>

<p>The hippocampus is the only brain area where scientists believe nerve regeneration can take place. It is responsible for making short term memory into long term memory.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost true, but the subventricular zone (SVZ) has also been found to host neurogenesis in mammalian brains. But you're right, aside from the SVZ and the dentate gurus of the hippocampus, neurogenesis is exceedingly rare in the adult human brain. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying &quot;you can and do regenerate neurons&quot; is technically true but incredibly misleading. See, to a layperson, that statement means, &quot;I can grow new brain cells for any region of my brain if I get injured or some of the old ones die.&quot; Which is just not true. Adult neurogenesis basically only occurs in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. And the only regions that those new neurons migrate to are the olfactory center, and the hippocampus itself. So, really, if you suffer a lesion to a different area of your brain, you can't regenerate those neurons, they're gone. </p>
<p>There was even a study (in <em>Nature</em>) published by some very overeager neuroscientists at Princeton which was thought to demonstrate adult neurogenesis in other (pretty much all!) regions of the brain, but very quickly it was determined that they'd read the data wrong and the paper was debunked. So, sorry folks, you can only grow neurons in a very small area and they only do like two jobs--form new memories, and recognize new smells. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if any experts can weigh in, but I was told by my surgeon following multiple leg surgeries to keep the scar tissue massaged and I'd know in about 5 years. I'm on year 3 and I've noticed that there is a little bit more feeling in a couple of spots (those areas now give me phantom itches), but 1/3 of my leg is still paralyzed. </p></div>		</li>
