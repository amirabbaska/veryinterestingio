<p>Again, assuming it's something like new character skins, or extra platformer levels, things that aren't part of the game, but would still have been developed and released as DLC, why does it make a difference? It's not like publishers push a game out the door and then say &quot;Alright, time to work on the DLC;&quot; it all gets developed at the same time. Why not store some of it on the disk if there's room and save the user some hard drive space? </p>
<p>Is it a perceived value thing? Or do people really think most DLC isn't done at launch day? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Downloadable content (DLC) is supposed to mean meaningful content that expands the world of the game (new missions, new levels, new characters, new powers, etc). It's a sort of &quot;reward&quot; for the publisher, a way for customers to say, &quot;Hey, we love your game so much that we're willing to throw you a few more dollars if we can get some cool new things to do in your game.&quot; It encourages the publisher to further develop the game in new ways and new directions and results in a better experience for the players.</p>
<p>But think about what it means when DLC is included on the disc. It means that the publisher <em>consciously and purposely</em> developed additional content for a game <em>that was still in production</em>. It means that, rather put forth their resources to develop a better game (better engine, better AI, better graphics, whatever), they split their resources to develop an okay game <em>and</em> a way to soak customers for a few more dollars over their mediocre product. There is no reason whatsoever to <em>not</em> include that content with the game to begin with <em>except</em> to leech more money out of their customers.</p>
<p>It's one thing to release a game, then spend six months developing DLC before offering it to your customers. It's another thing altogether to release a game with additional cost DLC at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That shows a shocking ignorance as to how games are actually made. </p>
<p>What do you think the devs, engineers, artists, etc. <em>should</em> be doing while the game is in QA? Twiddling their thumbs waiting for more bugs to flow in? That's insanely inefficient, especially if the company plans to introduce DLC at a later date (which they will. Nobody's forcing consumers to buy it. If you don't want to be hosed by the publisher, don't buy the DLC). </p>
<p>What usually ends up happening is the main game finishes up, goes to QA, and then the devs start on the DLC, fixing problems with the primary game as they come in. This allows the master to go gold, with DLC on the disk to conserve resources. Then, after the game is shipped, the DLC is pushed to QA. Any fixes needed (and there are always a few) are included in the &quot;unlock patch.&quot; </p>
<p>This method makes the most use of everyone's time and resources. I'd be interested in knowing if you have anything more efficient. </p>
<p>And just let me reiterate: this doesn't give the publisher leeway to release a shitty game. If I'm playing Street Fighter, I'm going to be pissed if I have to pay for the characters I used to be able to unlock through gameplay no matter where they're located. That being said though, it's not like a publisher says &quot;Alright everybody, time to stop working on the game; it's good enough. We have to pump out that DLC!&quot; On-disk DLC doesn't take away resources from the main game. Terrible games are going to be terrible no matter where their additional content comes from, and vice versa. </p></div>		</li>

<p>An even more blatant example of this is &quot;early-access&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
