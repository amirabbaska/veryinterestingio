			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to think of it in terms of tribes rather than individuals.</p>
<p>Tribes where people tended to have more visible white scleras had better hunters/communicaters, and so ate better, reproduced at a faster rate and naturally outnumber other tribes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one individual hunter, though, usually. Many of these predators, even though some of them hunt in packs, can still hunt effectively as a single predator. Humans much less so, and especially rely on hunting in packs (thinking while evolving, before developing much more effective weapons), corralling, piling on, etc.</p>
<p>So this is a major advantage. Not saying it is definitely the reason, but it seems to all add to the claim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sclera of other animals are also white and their irises are colored. Where the variation happens is in the shape of the pupil and in the shape of the commissure, which determined how much of the sclera is exposed.
