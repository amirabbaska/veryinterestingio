<p>The mesentery got a promotion in name from supportive tissue... to apparently the classification of organ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so what does that mean?  That is, was something new discovered that made it an &quot;organ&quot;?  What is the distinction between &quot;organ&quot; and &quot;supportive tissue&quot;?  Does the distinction in classification have any effect, i.e. will it somehow be treated differently by researchers and doctors?</p>
<p>Or is this a change in name only, with no importance or relevance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, put simply, an organ is a set of tissue that works together to accomplish a task or several tasks. Earlier, we didn't see that the function of the tissue of this &quot;new&quot; organ was connected together to accomplish these tasks. Now, in this case the task is to support the intestines, but this has caused some debate simply because supporting tissue is not considered an organ, but the cells are somewhat different than those found in ordinary supporting tissue.</p></div>		</li>
