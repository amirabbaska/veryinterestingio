			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! This explanation makes the most sense. So basically people being carried try to balance themselves? </p>
<p>Does this apply to objects too? Would carrying a 150 pound live human be easier than carrying a 150 pound object like a box of plank?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you carry them. Weight is weight and the proper carries can negate improper weight distribution. </p>
<p>Specific drags can also do this.</p>
<p>Firefighter carry is a good example. </p>
<p>So really when proper technique is included dead weight doesn't feel so heavy. As a matter of fact sometimes it feels lighter than a conscious person because a conscious person may distribute their weight unintentionally (through panic or inexperience leaving control to someone) making someone being moved involuntarily much harder to do so. </p>
<p>So dead weight may not necessarily the heavier of the weight.</p>
<p>Edit: since people find this stuff kinda interesting... </p>

<p>Also a cradle carry is a good example of a carry that can be used to carry smaller folks than yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a person isn't actually a firefights or marine, and hasn't trained for these situations, they're probably going to be surprised what it takes to hoist 170lbs, even with the right technique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual <em>dead</em> weight, however, sucks. Especially when stiffened up.
You're basically trying to move a log. (And they smell...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except when they don't! Urrrhg. I would (jokingly) yell at my toddler &quot;participate!&quot;. Somehow whenever I was wearing my poofy down coat last winter, she didn't know how to hold on or something (she was 15-18 months), and would be basically dead weight. Omg, so hard to carry. (Before all the nonparents ask why I carried her, 15 month olds walk super slow, parking lots are big, and Wisconsin is cold.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say....15 months is still well within the carrying range for us.  Ours is 21 months and we still carry him around.  They tend to walk slowly and/or aimlessly, so it's just faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At 15 months not all kids are even walking yet. And you mentioned winter coat, 4&quot; of snow would make it nearly impossible for a tiny human to get around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog does this when she doesn't want to get in the bath tub. She only weighs 25 pounds but does this thing where she becomes all legs and slinky-body. I wind up just pushing her in circles on the floor and scooping her up from the opposite direction, kinda like poaching an egg. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog used to do that if I tried to end her walks early. She would just flop on the ground and stare at the street she wanted to go down. I had a few people stop in their cars because they thought she was overheated because they saw this giant limp Labrador on the side of th road.</p></div>		</li>
