			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, because of shielding of two types: any lead that may be present in the walls to shield various radioactive areas from adjacent areas and the building material itself. Building material (concrete, drywall, steel, plastic) does provide SOME shielding from radiation. For the case of sailors in a sub under water, the water that surrounds the sub would provide a great amount of shielding from cosmic radiation, which would reduce the amount of naturally occurring radiation that the sailor is exposed to when compared to being on the surface of the sea or land. The reactor itself is sufficiently shielded such that the workers in the area surrounding the reactor should be receiving a very very low radiation dose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the sailors case less simply because they're underwater where normal background radiation cant get to them.</p>
<p>As for the reactors, yes they are shielded extremely well,</p></div>		</li>
