			<div class="markdown"><p>So perhaps a weird, solely anecdotal thing, but:
I generally have a difficult time sleeping through the night.
I also (based on sleep studies done) go into REM sleep very quickly - so quickly that if other symptoms were seen, I would have been classified as narcoleptic.
The fact that some activities make you fall into REM sleep more quickly means that it's harder to get/stay asleep when you fall into REM. Your body thinks it has enough sleep (due to REM cycles) even if you haven't had an adequate amount of &quot;rest&quot;, thus you're still tired after being in bed for 8 hours, if you immediately go into REM.</p>
<p>Sorry if not appropriate for ELI5. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you lift?  I have found that last year when I was lifting for an hour 4x a week I got more sleep.  Took a 6-7 month break from fitness and I get less sleep/wake up easier lately.</p>
<p>To me it seems like: My body sleeps longer for muscle recovery, which has the side benefit of better REM sleep and feeling more alert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fall asleep almost in minutes and can sleep nearly anywhere or at anytime. I'm not tired and don't seem to have bad reactions or any ill effects from it. But yes I get sleep paralysis normally a few times a week. Is there a connection? :)</p></div>		</li>
