			<div class="markdown"><p>Bobby Fischer often said he was bored of normal chess because the game positions and strategies could be too easily memorized so that play on even the highest level was more about remembering the positions from prior experience and proceeding rather than having to rely on pure analytic thought and deriving the best move.
In fact, he felt so strongly that high level chess was just memorization for the best players and not true inherent skill that he favored a variation of chess that had the back row of pieces positioned in random order for each game so there could be no use of prior memory for the tactics that would evolve in that particular game.</p>
<p>I think it is interesting to point this out because the permutations of practical/logical games of chess, especially as the play level becomes higher, is much more narrow than this number. An easy example is the first 10-15 moves of chess rarely deviate from a collection of openings in high level play because the resulting game would confer a clear disadvantage and therefore, somewhat like evolution, have been naturally selected out of the potential game pool.
So its ironic, that as you get better at chess, it becomes easier to memorize the game and there are less unconventional positions you have to routinely consider as represented by this higher than astronomical number.</p>
<p>EDIT: I found more on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer#Fischerandom_Chess" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> , including a quote from Bobby Fischer:</p>
<p>Fischer heavily disparaged chess as it was currently being played (at the highest levels). As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was to ensure that a game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, rather than their abilities to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.
In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer explained his reasons for advocating Fischerandom Chess:</p>
<p>&quot;In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not know as much as I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn’t do well. They’d get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don’t like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you really nailed it there.  The fact that moves might be <em>possible</em> has no bearing on whether they are remotely plausible.  An entity (person, computer, disembodied head) playing the game with the slightest inclination of playing competitively would self-select out of the vast majority of possible plays.  Thus, as I see it, those ineffectual or detrimental moves should not even be lumped in with the compendium of possible plays because they're just, well... stupid.   :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a little bit the same with Rubix Cubes. (Or any orientation puzzle). There, xx^xx huge number of possible combinations of pieces and positions and orientations that can happen. But given the number of solving algorithms in even the most advanced quick solve methods is less than 100, it's pretty much the same all around. I feel like Chess is the same thing, in a slight way. You may have a huge number of possible positions involving pawns, and number of pawns on the bored, but the truth is that you're often seeing something much more simple like, &quot;Queen within range of take, non-parallel piece move to shadow block.&quot; Which piece is shadow blocking once the pawn moves? Rarely matters, bishop/knight, doesn't matter, it can't move that direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't that kind of make it like Stratego?  Sorry, this is a bit of an off topic comment but I feel like games with imperfect information could also improve the total possible number of moves (&quot;reasonable&quot; moves would be dependent on the way you assign some expected value of a certain outcome which may change depending on the game conditions).  Personally, I find these games to be even more fascinating than perfect information or random chance games as they have elements of both!</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are 10^80 protons in the Universe. Now imagine inside each proton, we had a whole entire Universe. Now imagine again that inside each proton inside each Universe inside each proton, you had another Universe. If you count up all the protons, you get (10^80 )^3 = 10^240, which is nowhere near the number we're looking for. </p>
<p>You have to have Universes inside protons all the way down to <strong>1250 steps</strong> to get the number of legal chess games that are estimated to exist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that every single subatomic particle in the entire observable universe was a supercomputer that analysed a possible game in a single Planck unit of time (10^-43 seconds, the time it takes light in a vacuum to travel 10^-20 times the width of a proton), and that every single subatomic particle computer was running from the beginning of time up until the heat death of the Universe, 10^1000 years ≈ 10^11 × 10^1000 seconds from now. </p>
<p>Even in these ridiculously favorable conditions, we'd only be able to calculate </p>
<p>10^80 × 10^43 × 10^11 × 10^1000 = 10^1134</p>
<p>possible games. Again, this doesn't even come close to 10^10^5 = 10^100000 . </p>
<p>Basically, if we ever solve the game of chess, it definitely won't be through brute force. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, the future of chess seems to be longer games, which push further away from opening theory and into more unexplored territory.  For example, Magnus Carlsen has won many games that appeared to be &quot;equal,&quot; and recently played the second-longest ever game in a world championship match (122 moves).  Players who want to compete at high level will be unsatisfied with quick draws, and that means more moves per game, which means more permutations possible.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That 122 move game was a draw and the last 50 or so moves didn't even need to happen and did receive some small criticism for it.  I do agree with you that games will be getting longer on average but that was a bad example of your point.</p>
<p>To add, I don't care if the game is 200 moves as long as the game is played the way a player wants to play it.</p></div>		</li>
