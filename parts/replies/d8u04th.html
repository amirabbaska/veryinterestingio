<p>Isn't the universe expanding?  So at some point, wouldn't that photon red shift out of a person's range of vision?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you'd also have to consider what kind of candle you're burning, as different waxes and wicks burn at slightly different colors, and blue light can travel further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The further away you are the more unlikely it is you'll see the light, until it's exceedingly unlikely. But there are still some interesting tresholds along the way. How far away can you be and still be guaranteed to see the light continuously, and at what distance is the probabilty 50% you'll see the light during a given second, and at what distance will you se the light at average once every thousand years etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are in a vacuum, yes. But OP didn't specify vacuum, therefore we must assume atmospheric pressure air, which will scatter light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The OP's question is of the spherical cow sort, so I think assuming a vacuum is pretty reasonable. Nevertheless, air will scatter light according to some sort of distribution, so there is always a chance for a photon to reach the hypothetical person regardless of position in the room.</p></div>		</li>
