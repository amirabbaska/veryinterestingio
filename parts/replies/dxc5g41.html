			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Intelligence and curiosity are incredibly attractive to people that are worth a damn, so don't sell yourself short by pre-emptively putting yourself down! You're presumably smart and naturally curious as a result, so fuckin own that shit, MISS.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering when price theory would come up.  I was hoping someone would use price theory to explain the widely exhibited behaviour described from the consumers perspective, namely chasing a negligible saving which is offset by the extra time, effort, and fuel used to obtain the saving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elasticity is often self created by that industry. The consumer as a population is not that educated. They are driven by emotion. They believe in quick fuzy math I save 3 cents and I buy a lot of gas. But 3 cents for 13 gallons saves you 39 cents. That won't buy you a stamp. The consumer would not shop elsewhere over 39 cents but they would to save 3 cents per gallon on a 13 gallon tank. </p>
<p>Gas stations know this and are driving you in with saver cards, loyalty savings etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omfg my wife is so guilty of this. No, I don't care that the maverik on the other side of town is 2 cents less a gallon. We're buying $10 of gas! Its going to cost more to go there than to just buy it here. It's not worth the money and it's certainly not worth the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, 3 cents a gallon difference... Same brand and I got gas on the way home saving myself 20 cents a gallon vs those closest to my work or apartment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although there can be much bigger differences. There's regularly a 20c/litre difference where I live between the &quot;brand name&quot; stations (Shell, BP, 7/11) and the budget operators. </p>
<p>I fill up my 45L tank usually once a week. It adds about 3 minutes to the journey compared to the closest petrol station, and I normally save $8-10.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember in high school I did the math for a friend to tell him how much he was saving by going to the cheaper station. Was like 25c at the time. </p>
<p>Pretty sure he actually lost money on that trip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider that they may want to incentivize lower gas prices. If consumers stopped comparing there would be less pressure on gas prices and they would rise. By &quot;voting with their wallet&quot; consumers can signal their preference for lower prices even at their own inconvenience.</p></div>		</li>
