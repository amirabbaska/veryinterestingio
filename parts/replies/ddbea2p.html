			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a terrible design then... The best cling wrap is the real shit you get at a restaurant supply store. Thick, almost actually feels sticky but it's not, but by God does it cling to <em>ev-er-y-thing</em>. Super pain in the ass when you fuck up, <em>amazing</em> when you get it right. </p></div>		</li>
