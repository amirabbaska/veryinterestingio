			<div class="markdown"><p>The cognitive problems in autism are very likely related to cortical problems, as your post states. There seems to be a very interesting relationship between the severity of cortical abnormalities and the seriousness of the autism. If an MRI has been done to compare the cortex of the relatively normal twin with the one with clear autism, some interesting findings might be observed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting indeed. But even with severe cortical abnormalities, the capacity of neural plasticity and functional adaptation despite structurally apparent deficits means that we cannot simply write off those with severe ASD. So happy to have a conversation discussing ASD without arguing with militantly misinformed idiots about vaccines </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>did not consider nor suggest writing off anyone. But the amount of cortical damage, WHEN correlated with cognitive functions can be very helpful. One still tries utmost to help, but that's not what was writing about. If not very much damage is seen, this suggests improvement is possible. If a very great deal of damage, the maximum amount of therapy is still tried, because often these children can respond well to operant conditioning and shaping methods, etc., which will ease their day to day ADL's.
So, as usual, MRI's and other diagnostic tests are guides, but don't show it all. so the clinical impressions and treatment protocols after a good examination and usual testing (eeg's, basic cognitive testing, etc.) can be more helpful than not to understand and deal with the spectrum of presentations.</p>
<p>Poor Cognitive functioning is the most worrisome finding, but we all know how flexible and repairing the young mind/brain can be. So we still give it our all.</p></div>		</li>
