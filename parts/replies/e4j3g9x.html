			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This can actually happen with your fat in your blood from the Bends according to recent research. You dive, the fat becomes soluble, you quickly rise and it drops out again. Causing strokes and stuff. </p>
<p>It does it with the nitrogen but they found solid lumps of fat from those died while scuba diving I believe. It's either Bends or extremely cold water... But I cba to find the reddit post. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the solid lumps of fat were found during that massive decompression accident where the guy was forced through a 24cm opening. I’m on mobile now and can’t find the article, but the divers in the decompression chambers died because of fat solidification. I doubt that would happen during any normal situation where the bends would occur</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a paramedic with basic training diving emergencies, I’d agree. In a normal case of a diver exceeding their ascent profile, I can’t imagine fat dissolving being an issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fat is actually &quot;soluble&quot; without diving or pressure. Something called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipoprotein" target="_blank">lipoproteins</a> attach to the fat and allow it to become soluble in water. There was a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byford_Dolphin" target="_blank">specific incident</a> where 4 people went from 9 atmospheres to 1 atmosphere. Bubbles formed in all of their tissues (the regular bends), but these bubbles formed very rapidly due to explosive decompression, and are suspected to have denatured the lipoproteins. This crashes the fat out of solution and basically gives you an everywhere-embolism. Fun time.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Pressure doesn't really effect fat solubility, but rapid bubble formation from decompression will mess with it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's another video where I timestamped the actual sound of a pistol shrimp's claw snapping as well as some slow motion footage of the water cavitation. Unfortunately, I'm afraid, <a href="https://youtu.be/QXK2G2AzMTU?t=115" target="_blank">it does not sound like a cartoon handgun.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That you actually mean that the pressure decreases then that, I believe, is called the surface.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the bubble expands as it goes up and shrinks as it goes down (ignoring buoyancy meaning that once it's a bubble it can't really go down..) it can collapse and dissolve into the water if the pressure is high enough.</p></div>		</li>
