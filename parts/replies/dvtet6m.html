			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so people can visualize an example of starch retrogradation: if you have ever refrigerated rice in a closed container before it starts drying out, and wondered why it was extra hard even after reheating it later, that is because the starches were returning to a lower state of energy as they sat in the fridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another interesting tidbit about refrigerated starches which are later re-heated.</p>
<p>Refrigerating cooked starches converts a good portion of it to resistant starch, which survives digestion, and ends up in your colon, feeding your gut microbiome. Refrigerated cooked starches also result in a much more dampened insulin response. Resistant starch is apparently quite beneficial for one's health.</p>
