			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there are some incredible possibilities being developed/discussed involving merging technology with our bodies. The question is how will this affect our evolution? The way I see it, this type of technology will affect us in the way technology always has-- by affecting survival (and perhaps reproduction). As long as the technology itself is not heritable (i.e. babies aren't born with electronic chips embedded in their brains) then it cannot become something that evolves. Now edited genes, on the other hand, which would get passed from parent to child, would be subject to evolution just like any other gene.</p></div>		</li>
