<p>Regular drinkers (or alcoholics, in the extreme case) have changes in their brain dealing with GABA and glutamate which make them less sensitive to alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me If I'm wrong, but I always understood that Alcohol itself cannot (for most part &gt;95%) be broken down to be stored as body fat, and that this is why it can be so dangerous in the first place (from building up in our blood).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is absolutely a pathway for alcohol to product ATP. Ethanol can be converted into acetyl-coa and enter the citric acid cycle. However, high ethanol content can lead to high enough NADH to inhibit formation of acetyl-coa and the CAC/TCA/Krebs cycle. That's where the danger lays, when there is too much NADH for the molecule to be further oxidized by the normal channels. Acetyl-coa can also become a fatty acid and then stored as fat, a pathway which is also inhibited when there is too much alcohol being broken down. If we didn't have those pathways then alcohol would be far more poisonous than it is. Our bodies normally deal with a small volume of alcohol, like those produced by microbes in our digestive tract, and so we evolved to have pathways to deal with ethanol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what percentage ends up as fat, enters the citric acid cycle, or leaves the body in urine after becoming uric acid. There's probably other pathways too. Still, they all rely on enzymes and the downside of not having enough enzymes and pathway activity to form less harmful products from alcohol is being poisoned. </p></div>		</li>
