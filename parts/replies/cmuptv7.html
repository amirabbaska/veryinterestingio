			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the only time I ever go to the bank is to make actual cash or check deposits. Otherwise, my paychecks are direct deposited into my account, and I get free ATM use, even at other bank's ATM's (my bank covers  the  $2.50 or whatever other banks are charging for ATM fees these days). I only go to a physical branch a few times per year.</p></div>		</li>
