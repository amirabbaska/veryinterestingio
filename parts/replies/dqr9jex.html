			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the language.  If it's C/C++ chances are that the context parameter is a pointer and you're good to go.  Dynamic typed languages like javascript or python let you put any type you want so just pass an object, list or dictionary.</p>
<p>If the language is strict and you really are stuck passing a single fixed size integer then you have to do some bit packing.  Any other mathematic trick is either going to overflow the integer or require way to much processing just to access some context.</p></div>		</li>
