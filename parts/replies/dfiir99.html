			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the way I heard it explained was a line is the first dimension and then a plane for 2nd and then the third dimension of course. I didn't really get how a line could be a dimension but I guess it makes a lot more sense knowing that it isn't haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a somewhat cheesy animated short movie, maybe 35 minutes, which shares this name and explains the concept very elegantly. I imagine the story is a lot more captivating in the book, but it's pretty easy to set aside half an hour to watch the movie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of true.  You only need coordinates in 1 dimension to make a line.   You can also imagine a one dimensional system as being a straight line. Any point on that line can be described by a single number.</p>
<p>Now imagine another line perpendicular to the first. Again you can describe any point on that line with a number, however when combining the two you can specify any point on a flat plane. Then add a 3rd... and you can describe any point in space.</p>
<p>However if something is moving (which, is everything, relative to something) -- you can't accurately describe its position with a 3d coordinate system, because by the time you note the position, it will have changed. Thus for further accuracy, we add the 4th dimension, time. So we can say where something was in space at a specific time. </p>
<p>The rest of the dimensions are more abstract. Because we cannot perceive them.  However you can grasp their existence, for me it is easiest to use an Excel spreadsheet as an example.  Open up a new sheet. First of all you have numbered rows. That's 1 dimension. If you put data in the first column of each row, you only need to know the row number to find it.  Now if you start using more columns, that is the second dimension, now to find a piece of data you need to know two values, the row and the column. </p>
<p>Now add another sheet (tab) -- now to find a piece of data you need 3 values, the row, the column and the sheet.</p>
<p>Now open another file... that's the 4th dimension.</p>
<p>Copy the files to another hard drive... 5th dimension.</p>
<p>And it doesn't have to stop there... open one of the files, on one of the hard drives, pick a file, pick a sheet, pick a column, pick a row... now add a comment to that cell. This is independent of the data, thus it's another dimension.</p>
<p>In this 6 dimensional system you need to know the row, the column, the sheet, the filename, the hard drive and whether it is a comment or data -- to <em>address</em> any given piece of information.</p>
<p>Now (brace yourself) -- imagine you lived in the spreadsheet. You can see the rows and columns and comments and data. And even though you cannot see the other sheets or files, you see things on the sheet that must be sourced elsewhere. There's formula referencing data in other sheets. And although you cannot see the sheets, you can presume that they exist, or your sheet just simply wouldn't work. </p>
<p>That's my understanding of how it is presumed there are other dimensions. We can't visualise them or find them, but if they weren't there our model of the universe would fall apart. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That is a great way to explain it. Thank you for this analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No I understand that a line is a dimension. But there are people in this thread saying that an infinitely tiny dot is in fact the first dimension. It's just contradicting statements that I don't know which ones is correct based on what theory. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>supergravity has 7 more spatial ones but i've heard the number 26 thrown around as well. I don't think there's any way to intuitively understand why those numbers should be what they are, its just the way the (very) complicated maths works out. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>do you have any links to good digestible explanations for these additional spatial dimensions? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bit out of my depth to talk about string theory in any detail really. This video gives a reasonable (I think) intro to where it comes from:   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8ccXzM3x8A&t=43s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8ccXzM3x8A&t=43s</a> </p>
<p>If you want to take it further i'd suggest reading some pop science, maybe &quot;a brief history of time&quot; by Hawking or &quot;The elegant Universe&quot; by Brian Greene. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>26 dimensionsâ€‹ is for bosonic string theory. No physicist actually believes it describes the real world, as it only describes even integer spin particles (bosons) like the photon or gluons, but not half integer particles (fermions) like electrons.</p>
<p>String theories describing both are superstring theories, which require ten dimensions to be consistent. These are the ones which could describe the real world. They also contain supergravity as you say. </p>
<p>There's also 11 dimensional M theory, which isn't understood yet. But it is another manifestation of the 10D string theories, as it is related to them in the same way that they are related to each other. </p></div>		</li>
