			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the Carlsbad Desal Plant cost over a billion dollars and contributes 7% of SD County's water supply. (we import 90%, that's right a whopping 3% of our water is from here).</p>
<p>I'm super glad we have it, but we're not a big city and we don't have a ton of farmland either. A billion dollars is a lot to spend for a (relatively) small amount of water. We can get away with it but the plan as-is won't scale to meet national needs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What amazed me is that it's actually been more feasible to build dams and pipe water from Northern California to Southern California, pumping it over mountains in the process, than it has been to desalinate the saltwater that laps against Southern California. Water and salt REALLY like each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also want to add on that the salt (technically, brine) has to go somewhere and Morocco is currently seeing the habitat it drew from changing. </p>
<p>I've forgotten how large the issue is exactly, but I do know the marine life was suffering because of it.</p>
<p>Hopefully they're also looking into what to do with that brine instead of dumping it back into the water source.</p></div>		</li>
