			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my friend uses a whole paragraph he remembers from a movie, with capitals, numbers and symbols added for extended security.
You probably won't need to be this extreme but do use 12+ characters with letters, numbers, capitals and symbols. Don't forget, this is the password to all of your passwords.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and don't save your password on your desktop...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is one of the best. Or what you can do is use the whole paragraph but use only the first or second or last letters if each word, with some caps, symbols, and numbers. SUPER easy to remember and you suddenly have a password that looks like</p>
<p>Oomfu@wPHrf@m,w/C,123,and$</p>
<p>Or something like that. I don't know if you can use commas. But whatever. (I used the first letters of /u/techleak 's sentence and replaced some words with symbols and shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Correct horse battery staple&quot; is not that secure because humans are some what predictable in their language selection. </p>
<p>They may not got every password like that, but they can quickly get some and that's all they need.</p>
<p>Longer sentences and/or gibberish words are better. You can memorize gibberish words if they're funny somehow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LastPass is safe.</p>
<p>I would suggest using its password generator, setting it to 20 or 25 characters passwords with the full keyspace (A-z, 0-9, special characters). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>with last pass you can log into your vault without installing the plugin to retrieve your passwords. Otherwise you can install the plugin and not save your password for the autofill and then logout before you leave.</p></div>		</li>
