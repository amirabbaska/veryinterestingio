			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this was a great answer. Here's my follow up ELI5: so if cancer occurs in cells that are replicating fast such as skin, and kids' cells are replicating really fast, how come you don't see too many kids with cancer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main reason is that there are two types of factors that come into play: proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Proto-oncogenes are genes that are responsible for the uncontrollable cell division when they are unregulated. What controls them are proteins known as tumor suppressors that regulate cell division to prevent these proto-oncogenes from becoming oncogenes. The reason adults are more likely to develop a tumor is that over their lifespan they may accumulate mutations on their tumor suppressor genes, eventually making the the tumor suppressor defective. If you want to explore further check out p53, a very common tumor suppressor protein, that when defective will be unable to regulate cell division.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons that cancer is so high up in the 1-14 years old group is that most youth cancers (cancers you are more likely to get when you're young - not necessarily when you're a minor) are very rare. Funding for research largely goes towards common cancers such as common types of breast, colon and testicular cancer. That in itself is a good thing (you help larger groups) but it does mean that people who get a rare type are often overlooked, or treated with a general treatment - &quot;most types of <em>organ</em> cancer respond to chemo <em>X</em>, so this should as well&quot;, while that is not necessarily true. </p>
<p>Recently (about a month ago), Obama's administration awarded funding to groups who research types of youth cancer, in order to hopefully find cures for children and adults who suffer from a form of youth cancer. </p>
<p>Source; I have a youth cancer; a rare form of liver cancer. Diagnosed at age 22, 4.5 years ago. Finding effective treatments is a pain in the right buttock. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't completely answer the question. You are correct that glial cells are responsible for most brain tumors. But the heart also contains many dividing cell populations including fibroblasts, immune cells, endothelial cells, etc. So the fact that heart muscle cells rarely divide cannot account for the rarity of tumors.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that the majority of tumors in the heart are secondary metastases. In the extremely rare cases of tumors of cardiac origin, they are usually myxomas that originated from connective tissue. Even rarer are rhabdomyosarcomas originating from muscle cells. </p>
<p>This is actually a topic of interest in the cardiac stem cell community, because it would seem that the heart is just a non-permissive environment for cancer. Identifying why could be important for both heart regeneration and also for cancer therapy. Micro-RNA <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211117/#__sec7title" target="_blank">miR-1</a> is of particular interest.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it's maybe because of one of the following reasons:
1) it's fatal before it becomes detectable by current medicine (current medicine can only detect a tumor that is 1 gram in weight and if I remember correctly 1cmx1cmx1cm)
2) because of the blood flow rate and such the tumor  cells have difficulty homing and therefore end up metastisizing or going elsewhere or just not being able to really form a tumor </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscle cells can increase their number of nuclei (most cells only have one) to produce more RNA and therefore protein. They also have a lot more myosin and actin, which are the proteins used in contracting. I don't know a huge amount of muscle physiology but I think they also have stored of creatine, myoglobin, and glycogen as well to assist in ATP generation which is used up to cause the cells to contract.</p></div>		</li>
