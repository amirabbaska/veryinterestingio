			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a somewhat different skill set to do something like that in your head, and 5 seconds is kind of ridiculous. It's a minority of mathematicians who'd even think being able to do that in your head, at any speed, is a worthwhile skill to develop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I While it's helpful to be able to do stuff like that (and definitely really cool, I think we all wish we could do that) I agree. Ramanujian in the movie at least, is a good example. He can do amazing math in his head and understand things intuitively but had no rigoue until later in the movie. </p>
<p>The amazing part of math isn't knowing thinfs, it's knowing things and sharing them. Far too much emphasis is put on being quick, this isn't what math is about. Math is about having the ability to work through extremely complicated systems and see patterns. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's occasionally helpful to know how to <em>approximate</em> logarithms in your head if you do a lot of math that involves them. You can round the number you are performing the operation on to the highest 2 digits and turn it into a.b x 10^c. Then add C to the log of a.b which you can approximate if you know the logs of 1-9. It can be very inaccurate depending on how you understand estimation but you'll usually be off by &lt;1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really difficult for movies to realistically show a scientist being clever, because the audience wouldn't be able to understand it. So often they resort to something that isn't realistic but more familiar to the audience. </p>
<p>Complicated mathematics, for instance, doesn't mean hard sums, it means really esoteric and abstract stuff that you need to study for years in order to understand it. So can't really show a famous mathematician proving some complicated theorem, even if that's how they actually got their fame, because the proof just looks like gibberish to most people. But audiences do know about mental arithmetic, so a (somewhat lazy) solution is to show this famous maths brainbox doing big sums very quickly. </p>
<p>Not saying this is necessarily inaccurate in specific cases. For all I know Ramanujan really was that good at calculating square roots in his head. But it's not what made him such a great mathematician, and is ultimately more of a party trick that wouldn't even help you to get hired as a mathematician (because that's what we have calculators for). </p></div>		</li>

<p>No, he was a &quot;savant&quot; (that probably isn't the right word).  That's why it was made in to a movie.  He was extra-ordinary.  5 seconds is nuts.</p>
<p>Were / are there mathematicians who can do it in their head?  Sure.  Go youtube 'em, they're out there - but that precision in 5 seconds was world record levels.  It wasn't normal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Approximation methods for logarithms are a bit more complex, but follow the same pattern of iterating a set of simple operations until the approximation reaches the desired level of accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To expand on this, you can use a Taylor series expansion to approximate the value of a logarithm. Every logarithm can be represented as an infinite sum of terms. The terms become smaller and smaller, though, so after calculating a few terms to get your answer close enough (depending on the level of precision you need), you can stop. In practice, you'll probably only have to calculate 2 or maybe 3 terms before it's close enough for most everyone's purposes.</p>
<p>Specifically, $ln(x) = 2\sum\limits_n=0\^{\infty}\frac{1}{2n+1}\left(\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right)\^{2n+1}$. (Sorry, I don't know how to write that nicely in Markdown. But if you understand LaTeX notation, hopefully that will help)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could probably also use integrals to calculate the logarithm, using the identity $\int \frac{dx}{x} = ln(x) + C$.</p>
<p>This method is beneficial because you can precisely measure how close you are to the exact answer using a very simple formula (The Runge Rule).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you use Taylor series you first want to adjust your input so that it is at least between 0 and 2, or an even smaller range around 1. This is because the Taylor series for logarithm (centered at x=1) only converges between 0 and 2, and also you'll need fewer terms in the Taylor series the closer your input is to 1.</p>
<p>To shift your input you can use the property that log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b) with precomputed or easily computed values of log(a), for examples powers of <em>e</em> (assuming this is the natural logarithm). So find the smallest power of e such that x/e^p &lt; 2, then log(x) = p + log(x/e^p ).</p>
<p>You want to do similar shifts when evaluating other Taylor series. For example, for any trig function it's easy to adjust the input so that it's between 0 and pi/4, and you can make the range even smaller using the angle doubling formula.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All quotients have been rounded to the nearest hundred-thousandth. Even starting with 5, which is clearly not a fair approximation for the root of 10, it only take 3 iterations to get a satisfactory result for most applications</p>
<p>[(10 / 5) + 5] / 2 =<br />
[2 + 5] / 2 =<br />
7 / 2= 3.5<br />
Result of Step 1: 3.5^2 = 12.25  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[(10 / 3.5) + 3.5] / 2 =<br />
[2.85714 + 3.5] / 2 =<br />
6.35714 / 2 = 3.17857<br />
Result of Step 2: 3.17857^2 = 10.10307<del>2449</del>  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[(10 / 3.17857) + 3.17857] / 2 =<br />
[3.14607 + 3.17857] / 2 =<br />
6.32464 / 2 = 3.16232<br />
Result of Step 3: 3.16232^2 = 10.00027  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[(10 / 3.16232) + 3.16232] / 2 =<br />
[3.16224 + 3.16232] / 2 =<br />
6.32456 / 2 = 3.16228<br />
Result of Step 4: 3.16228^2 = 10.00001;<br />
3.16^2 = 9.9856<br />
3.162^2= 9.99824<br />
3.1623^2 = 10.00014<br />
√(10) = 3.1622776601683793319988935444327 (Windows Calculator)

<p>Edit: Forgot to round the square of step 2; it did not effect the progression of the algorithm.<br />
Edit2: Added calculated square root of 10 (Windows calculator)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10/5 → 2. (5+2)/2 → 3.5.</p>
<p>10/3.5 → 2.857143. (3.5+2.857143)/2 → 3.178571.</p>
<p>10/3.178571 → 3.14607. (3.178571+3.14607)/2 → 3.162320.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First iteration would be (5+(10/5))/2 which is 3.5. Checking that answer we square it 3.5^2=12.25. It's not terribly accurate so we repeat with the first iteration answer, (3.5+(10/3.5))/2 and get 3.17857.  That squared is 10.103, getting much closer. Repeat with 3.17857 and you'll get closer still. The more iterations you do the closer you'll come to the actual square root.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No longer have the text books to check, but that was also the introduction to roots and logarithms in high school maths in the 90s. We were only allowed to use a calculator once we had shown that we understood the concepts, and would be able to get the results by guessing.</p>
<p>Reasoning for this was twofold. It ensures proper understanding of the topic, and trains reasonable guessing, which later on is a vital skill to have for judging if the result you reached by using a calculator is plausible.</p></div>		</li>
