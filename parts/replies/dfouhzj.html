			<div class="markdown"><p>Can someone explain why a &quot;crash&quot; occurs just based off political change or the fear something big might happen? I always viewed it as being afraid you <em>might</em> wreck your car, so for the fuck of it you just take a sledgehammer to it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like you're driving your car, and you're worried a deer might jump out in front of you. You start getting nervous and twitchy, and suddenly you think you see something out of the corner of your eye, so you jerk the wheel, crashing your car. At this point, the deer is irrelevant.</p>
<p>In a perfect market, the future performance of a company is factored into the stock price. Say the long-term economics look relatively stable, and the company has a reasonable plan that should make money. Everyone who believes that has bought stock for what they think it's worth. Suddenly, something changes. Government looks like it's going to change regulations, or the weather affects the price of an important raw material. Now the plan doesn't look so good, so the most skittish people start selling their stock. Now the price is going down, because more people are selling. Then the next most skittish people see both the bad news <strong>and</strong> the price heading down, so they sell. Now there's a feedback loop that can tank the price. At this point, people who are more optimistic start buying up the cheap stock, stopping the freefall.</p>
<p>Now imagine some news comes out that effects an entire major industry. Like the realization that housing is overvalued and overleveraged. Suddenly, a whole lot of people have a lot less money than they thought. Which means that any company that relies on consumer spending (or secondary or tertiary effects thereof), i.e. all of them, now has revise their projections down. So their stock appears less valuable and the crash starts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, people have to understand that stock market crashes do not affect the companies directly. For example, just assume you own a house. It's a good one, close to your work. The current market price for the house is $1mn. If tomorrow, there's a rumour going on that there's a serial killer in the area and hence the market price of the house crashes, will it affect you in anyway (unless there's actually a serial killer)? Unless you want to sell your house now, it hasn't changed anything for you. You still have a good house close to work.</p>
<p>Similarly, the share price in the market will not affect the performance of the company. If the company is good and well run, it will continue to make profits and you as an investor will keep making money. That's why good companies never go out of business because of market crashes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also when banks and investment groups lose money on a stock they have to cover short falls by selling other investments. So if multiple banks and investment groups are invested in the same stock which drops sharply it can have a ripple effect across the stock market as they all start selling other stocks which they deem to be the riskiest causing those prices to drop and potentially creating a second crash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to that, the stock market is a good source of income. When investing in a company you are taking a risk. If the company does well, you profit. If the company doesn't do well, you lose money. The stock market is this x100000.</p></div>		</li>
