			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to your answer, the death penalty is on the table for this particular case.  Death penalty cases compound all the reasons you've given.  <a href="http://www.brodenmickelsen.com/blog/why-do-death-penalty-cases-take-so-long/" target="_blank">Death penalty cases add years to the amount of time a trial takes, vs a life without parole case</a>.  Every phase of a trial gets more scrutiny when the death penalty is a possibility, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the defense team must investigate every aspect of a defendant's life before the death penalty can be applied.  This investigation alone can take a year or more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but time on death row is much more restrictive, with no free movement, meals in cells, and very little interaction with other inmates. So it's still a worse punishment during the wait period. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm glad they didn't fall for his mentally insane bullshit. He had the mental capacity to go to college. He had the mental capacity to know what he was doing was wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sat as jury member for a case about a foreign man ferrying people from one country to another without visas.</p>
<p>The man was caught steering a boat full of refugees, but it was up to the prosecution to prove he KNEW that it was illegal to enter a country without visas.</p>
<p>There was insufficient evidence in our opinion to prove he knew the legal implications of transporting people without visas, some disagreed so we ended up as a hung jury.</p>
<p>It opened my eyes to the legal system a bit more, it isn't so black and white.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He wasn't from my country. I remember sitting down in the stand and they read out his charge and the details of where he was caught and how, and I thought wtf am I doing here this guy is guilty. But by the third day I had changed my mind, based on the evidence and testimonies, and felt that there was a possibility he sincerely didn't realise what he was doing was illegal. </p>
<p>What scares me about trial by jury is that some jurors continued to base their decision on their beliefs and not the evidence provided. Its up to the prosecution to prove guilt, not the defendant to prove innocence. We were the third group of jurors who failed to come to a verdict on that particular case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, subtle but significant difference.</p>
<p>It's not a question of whether they knew it was <em>illegal,</em> but whether they knew it was <em>wrong.</em></p>
<p>In law, there are generally^1 two things required to make something a crime:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actus Rea (wrong action): a result that is harmful</li>
<li>Mens Rea (wrong mind): an intent to do that wrong thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The defenses of &quot;Insanity&quot; and &quot;Self Defense&quot; both rely, to a certain extent, on questioning Mens Rea.  Someone may well be dead, but if the person who did it didn't <em>understand</em> that it would be the problem, there is question as to whether they deserve punishment (of the same nature).  Likewise, Self Defense doesn't question whether there's somebody dead, but argues that the was <em>right</em> mind, that this was a result of <em>helping</em> someone.</p>
<p>--
^1. ^If ^the ^result ^is ^sufficiently ^bad, ^there ^may ^still ^be ^reason ^to ^punish ^the ^person ^even ^without ^Mens ^Rea</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some laws require that the behavior be malicious - it's built into the specific laws.</p>
<p>For instance, libel and slander lawsuits in some countries require proving that the defendant said things they knew were false.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not correct, and what you're describing is a major problem with the American jury system. In the US, lawyers try to convince jurors of the facts and the law. Everywhere else in common law countries, jurors make factual decisions, but judges will vote on the law and give an extremely detailed &quot;jury charge&quot; explaining the law. For example, in a typical jury case for assault in the US, the judge's charge will be maybe 5-10 minutes long, explaining the process and what the jurors need to do. In Canada or the UK, it would probably be 4-5 hours long, with the judge summarizing all the information and explaining all the legal tests and precisely what thresholds have to be met to get a conviction.</p>
<p>FYI it wasn't &quot;knew it was illegal&quot; that was required. What's required is that he knew he was doing the act, regardless of whether or not he knew it was illegal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sat on a jury once about a guy attempting to break into a house.  In his defense, the illegal alien said that the person who offered him cheap legal help gave him that address and didn't show up to court... so he went there to yell at him and saw him inside and &quot;slashed the screen on the window with a knife&quot; to get him to come out.  </p>
<p>All the prosecutor said was &quot;What makes more sense?  That he was slashing the screen to get someone to come out or that he was trying to break in?&quot;.  </p>
<p>The ONLY reason we convicted him was because we found in one of the crime scene photos that the screen was cut deliberately down the sides and across the bottom to hang down like it hadn't been cut.  The prosecutor didn't PROVE anything though... he totally could have pulled a Matlock and shown that picture to the jury with a big reveal after the guy testified.  I was disappointed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm- Lost my sister in a very public case. They had blood of his at the scene, her blood in his house, on his clothes, in his pipes from him washing off, as well as teeth imprints, fingerprints, other DNA, even his family provided witness statements and more. Seemed slam-dunk, but... </p>
<p>He is/was &quot;famous&quot; person who was on drugs, and drunk, and claimed insanity, and the news spoke about it so much that it's not easy to get jurors. Trial started 7 years later due to psychiatric testing, etc. </p>
<p>But the prosecution took their time, did it right, and made sure that they got the conviction. The jury wound up taking less time to order pizza than they did to convict.</p>
