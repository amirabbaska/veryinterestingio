			<div class="markdown"><p>While true for keratinized cells, these cells are not found in the cheek, if a hyperkeratinisation has not occurred (Linea alba). Neither are their desquamation relevant.
Using fancy words when you don't know anything about subject to try to confuse people or for whatever reason is wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keratinized cells are indeed found on the inner lining of the mouth, which includes the inner cheek last I checked. However, I do admit that I didn't know what ELI5 meant and explained this, while correctly, like a medical professional would, which I am.
Didn't mean to confuse people but that is what the types of these cells are called and is their properties that help regulate their maintenance and repair.
Additionally desquamation is not relevant here, as the tissue is literally called stratified squamous epithelium. This is basic histology, and not just fancy lingo to impress anyone.</p></div>		</li>
