			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think about how the air flows, it's being pushed down from the fan, say in the centre of the room creating higher pressure beneath and low pressure above. The air flows out to the 'neutral' pressure on the outside of the room, which then gets pulled into the low pressure above the fan again. Along the way dust gets kicked up and dragged along for the ride and eventually ends up on the fan blade. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so much as drop as it is forced there. Think of a gap under a door in a room with an open window.</p>
<p>The pressure just builds to a higher level in certain places depending on it's outlets.</p>
<p>In the case of a door gap or the edge of the fan blade (or maybe a wing on a car or a plane) there are areas of lower or higher pressure naturally.</p>
<p>Tiny bits of dust are always in the air. so at these points where there is a pressure and a lip, the dust gets deposited. Think tiny tiny little bits of statically charged dust building up at near microsopic levels over time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe more like when driving a truck, an air pocket forms in the bed just behind the cab?  </p>
<p>In this case the cab would be like the leading edge of a the blade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s a little switch on every ceiling fan. It switches the direction of motion. In the winter you would switch the direction and put the fan on low.
It circulates the warm air up near the ceiling down along the sides of the room without directly blowing air on people which might make them feel cold in colder weather.
Just a neat little way to make it feel a bit warmer in cool weather. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But wouldn't the location of the low pressure area depend on which way the fan is blowing? If the fan is blowing air down, the low pressure would be above the blade, as you mention, but when the fan is blowing air up, the low pressure would be on the bottom of the blade. Whichever way my fan blows, I don't get dust on the bottom of the blades.</p></div>		</li>
