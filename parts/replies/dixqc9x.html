			<div class="markdown"><p>It basically creates a government registry of everyone, making it easy for them to track you.</p>
<p>Only problem is, Social Security numbers do the same thing, although most people don't realize that. To be consistent and logical, we should either do away with social security, or we should implement a proper ID system. I believe the vast majority of people would prefer the latter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even worse if you think about Google, Facebook etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the irony is thick.  I've heard people rant and rail against federal ID systems and then two minutes later grumble that it's <em>so</em> inconvenient they're not allowed to look up clients by SSN anymore.</p>
<p>O.o</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Republicans: &quot;A small government shouldn't be able to track anyone they wanted to.&quot;</p>
<p>But the republicans also promoting a ID check for voters. </p>
<p>Being said I believe US need an ID system as well as voter ID checks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a national ID, voter ID becomes trivial because everyone is required to bring their ID to vote anyway. </p>
<p>Thus you solve the &quot;supposed&quot; problem of voter fraud </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't the government track us day to day anyway? After the Vault 7 leaks, where we found out they track through our fucking toasters, what's one more way worth?</p>
<p>Also, now after understanding it, I am definitely in favor of an ID system. There's so many benefits to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think their lack of ID is partly (mostly?) because of a complete lack of trust in their government. Americans make privacy issues out of things that shouldn't really be an issue at all. Conspiracy theories about the government tracking your every move, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a major reason there hasn't been reform is that the credit companies have no interest in it. For each fraudulent transaction they charge the store to run the card. If the customer doesn't notice then the bank gets those charges. If the customer does notice then the bank reverse the charges and rights the theft off of their taxes but still gets the money from the stores for running the transactions. It's win win for the banks.</p></div>		</li>
