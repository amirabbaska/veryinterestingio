<p>We've stored it for 16 minutes.  So I guess it depends on how you define &quot;reliably.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;reliably&quot;. CERN can apparently hold antihydrogen for 16 minutes.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://home.cern/about/engineering/storing-antimatter" target="_blank">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So instead, two superconducting magnets generate a strong magnetic field that takes advantage of the antihydrogen’s magnetic properties. If the antihydrogen atoms have a low enough energy, they can stay in this magnetic “bottle” for a long time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could in theory assemble 26 antiprotons, 26 antielectrons, and 28 antineutrons and get one Fe^54 atom!  Electrically neutral (actually losing an electron and ionizing it means it can be steered with electric fields), but,  anti-iron should act like iron and can be steered with a magnetic field.  If you have many atoms of anti-iron, they can be fused into solid metallic iron, and should have the properties of regular metallic iron.  Except it can't touch any normal matter without annihilation.</p>
<p>There is NO WAY you can store it without a near-total vacuum.  Without exception, any contact with normal matter means instant mutual annihilation and tremendous energy (21kt nuclear explosion per 500 milligrams antimatter + 500mg matter).  </p>
<p>We have wondered if entire galaxies could be made of antimatter, separated by the vacuum of space, and we just never noticed.  It could burn just like a regular sun, even with planets, all antimatter.  </p>
<p>It's believed to be unlikely though, that it would stay apart from normal matter for most of the last 13.8 billion years.   If it collided with another galaxy (they can pass through one another), or gas clouds, we'd expect to see gamma and heat and maybe boil away its mass into gas of antimatter.  We see none of the evidence we'd expect.</p>
<p>A sun of anti-hydrogen would undergo fusion- but there are no &quot;anti-photons&quot;, well, there are, all photons are their own antiparticle, same photons we know and love.  Beta emitter throw off anti-electrons.  We don't get much for radiation particles from ANY sun but our own.  SOME of what our own sun throws off is already antiparticles, they are rarely produced by nuclear processes in normal matter.  </p>
<p>Uranium nuclear reactors make a lot of antineutrinos, which no shielding can stop.  But neutrinos and antineutrinos almost NEVER interact with normal matter, they pass right through with no effect, they can't easily be counted because they so rarely interact with a sensor of any type.  Intangible ghosts, phantom matter, they barely count as existing.  In fact a neutrino can pass through the entire planet with only a vanishingly unlikely chance it will suddenly interact with an atom of rock.  BTW a huge number of neutrino radiation particles from the sun are passing through you every second anyways.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. You may be thinking of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_embrittlement" target="_blank">neutron embrittlement</a>, which is a nuclear process that causes building materials to weaken over long exposure to free neutron radiation.</p>
<p>Neutrinos are, as u/Oznog99 said above, vanishingly unlikely to interact with atoms at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Neutron</em> irradiation often causes <em>neutron activation</em>, which can make ordinary elements radioactive.  As opposed to just contaminating them with radioactive dust.</p>
<p>If it's extreme enough, the mechanical properties may be compromised as it has new, useless nuclei in the structure.</p>
<p>Neutrons should not be confused with neutrinos.</p></div>		</li>
