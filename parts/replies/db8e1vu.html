I've still yet to see any evidence except for 100 recycled news articles blaming russia. They all seem to quote anonymous sources from anonymous high ranking people.. so I'm quite skeptical. Especially with wikileaks sources stating it is coming from an inside leak, that it wasn't even a hack. </p></div>		</li>

Go read the reports by any of the three independent cyber security firms who all investigated this. </p>

<p>I don't really think what Assange says about this matters. He could A) be a Russian front: He got a show on Russian state television, Russia (which murders journalists) has suggested he get a nobel prize, a document dump by wikileaks left out financial transactions between Russia and syria which other dumps of similar documents included) or B) Russian intelligence could just be posing as a leaker. Also, if Ecuadorian intelligence doesn't monitor everything Assange does they're incompetent. I hope to god he doesn't know the identity of anyone who leaks stuff to him because then the Ecuadorian government (which has arms deal with Russia) knows it too.</p>
<p>Also Assange published DNC document dumps from supposedly Latvian lone hacker Guccifer (who couldn't speak Latvian and according to metadata on dumped documents used Russian language settings on his computer), it's weird that they are now claiming that the DNC emails are a leak. </p></div>		</li>
