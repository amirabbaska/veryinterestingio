			<div class="markdown"><p>It can target broken cells, autophagy is a relatively new discovery (Nobel Prize 2016) and there's studies proven when fasting it helps chemo patients as it reduces the amount of bad cells that need to die. There's more on the topic but I'm not sure how much is proven though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chemo benefits comes from the fact that the poisons used in chemo targets rapidly dividing cells. Like cancer. That is the entire idea with chemo.</p>
<p>When you fast, the body goes into maintenance mode, turning off cell division. Because there is no energy and building blocks for new cells.</p>
<p>But cancer cells are not able to turn off cell divisions. That is the hallmark of cancer. So the get hit full time with chemo, while your normal cells don't. So you get far less side effect from the chemo, and it does not destroy your appetite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it has to do with marking of cells with certain indicators, this could be a specific protein which indicate the cell has damaged organelles (small organs which allow the cell to function) or contains unused proteins. Then the cell is engulfed in a autophagosome, sort of like a second shell that allows it to merge with lysosomes. Lysosomes will themselves carry enzymes and will allow the autophagosome wrapped cell to be broken down and reused. Autophagy (cell deconstruction to simplify)  is split into several types so it will differ depending on circumstance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no study on ideal length really. Even Dr. Jason Fung, who pushes it extensively says anything he says would be a best guess. There's a lot of evidence that HGH, mTOR and autophagy start their stimulation in less than 24 hours, so those doing 16 or 20 hour daily fasts would probably benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Autophagy is to some extent ongoing all the time, it is natural cellular process needed for turnover of some proteins, other &quot;old&quot; material and even old organelles (look up mitophagy, autophagy of the whole mitochondria). What takes longer to induced is so called starvation induced autophagy. This is basically your bodies response to having not enough nutrients, so the natural baseline autophagy goes into overdrive to digest all not needed (old, damaged and so on) proteins, remove senescent cells and basically recycle as much material as possible. There is some indication intermittent fasting/time restricted feeding up-regulates autophagy and induces some neuroprotective (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27882110" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27882110</a>) and other beneficial effects (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470547" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25470547</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re correct. 12 hours isn’t really fasting because when you think about it, eating dinner at 8pm and then breakfast at 8am is fairly standard for most. When I did it I waited until 1pm to eat which is about 17 hours</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biological maintenance processes don't really suddenly turn on and off. They upregulate and downregulate. As fasting continues, autophagy increases. Autophagy is always happening to some extent, whether fasting or not.</p></div>		</li>
