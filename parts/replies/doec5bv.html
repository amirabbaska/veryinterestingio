<p>When you tend to shock your body with energy-dense food every lunchtime, your body will release large amounts of insulin around that time every day. This large amount of insulin causes your blood sugar to quickly leave the bloodstream, as well as trigger other food-digestion-preparation things in the digestive system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a myth—blood sugar is kept within a narrow range at all times within healthy humans. Unless you have diabetes or a similar disease of metabolism, your lunch isn’t causing your blood sugar to sharply decrease (or increase). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>which is why intermediate fasting is really good for your health imo.</p>
<p>Also, limiting quick acting sugars in your diet ( unless it's a pre-workout supplement type thing ) is fantastic for health. </p>
<p>In this modern age we forget that it was biologically normal to eat pretty much just once per day or X days. Our bodies are designed for it pretty much but we obviously can adapt to frequent meals. I personally really enjoy eating once per day, it keeps me full and operating at 100%, If I eat the standard 3-5 times a day I'll feel tired and anxious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once tried a water fast, and after a few hours I stopped feeling hungry, even the next morning (&gt;24h at that point) I didn't feel hungry or nauseated, but that afternoon I felt a little dizzy and was craving food so I stopped. Interesting experience, but you should do research before attempting it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water fast is a bit different. You would have felt normalized after 3-4 days, but your electrolyte balance may have been off. You could fix that by making a keto Gatorade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also started sorta-IF about three weeks ago. Don't think it has impacted my sleeping, but overall starting it was pretty easy.</p>
<p>I still eat what I want during the eating hours (I'm not a health food junkie), but my body seemed to adjust pretty quickly to no late snacking and no breakfast. </p>
<p>I'll still sometimes start to feel hungry during the fasting hours, but I just think, &quot;it's not eating time&quot; and my body just... gets over it. </p>
<p>I say sorta-IF, because during the day I'll usually drink a watery sports drink (Aquarius, less than 100 calories, I think) so I am consuming something, but I don't eat.  </p></div>		</li>
