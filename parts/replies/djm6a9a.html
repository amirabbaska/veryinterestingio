			<div class="markdown"><p>I cannot remember the specific species, but several species of catfish lay sticky eggs that stick to the feet of ducks and geese, then once the birds take to the air the eggs surface dries out just enough so that when the birds land in a different body of water, the eggs are rinsed off the feet. This helps with genetic diversity of fish populations in each body of water. I would assume there are quite a few fish species that use a similar method but I've never really looked into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is considered common knowledge in rural Texas.  Dig a pond, and in a year or two there will be black bass.  It is believed to be exclusively the effect of birds (ducks) who pick up fertilized eggs on their feet as the swim around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend had a man made lake made on some land he owned and within a few years fish appeared.  Some ducks were floating around as we were talking about it.  He thought birds that landed or floated around in other bodies of water got eggs in their feathers and released them in his lake.  Obviously not a controlled study but it seemed like a plausible explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many isolated lakes, probably the vast majority, they don't have fish until people put them there:</p>
<p>It's hard to find worldwide stats, but individual states tend to study the fish in their waters.   Here's an example: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The South Fork Flathead drainage <strong>has 356 lakes. Of these lakes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>29 contain genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout </li>
<li>21 contain exotic or hybrid trout </li>
<li><strong>298 are fishless</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>Nearly all of these lakes historically had no fish at all</strong>. As the area was settled, pioneering anglers stocked fish </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering how many were just stocked with fish. I dunno if I would've guessed quite that many, but I can't say I'm too surprised. People love to fish </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some high alpine lakes, they are actually working to eliminate the fish populations.  Many of the species were stocked back in the early days of fish hatcheries before they knew the potential effects of introducing a species to an area.  </p>
<p>I remember reading about one case in which a species of frog almost disappeared from a lake due to the introduction of trout, so they started taking out all the trout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they do this, anyway?  Do they encourage fishermen to fish it out, or take more severe measures, like introducing illnesses particular to a species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've been doing this in many of the streams in Southern California, in an effort to save the mountain yellow legged frog and to reintroduce the Santa Ana sucker into historic habitat.  Fishermen are pretty pissed about it too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very possibly a poor sample to base an opinion on. The region mentioned is high altitude compared to most places and the lakes tend to be glacial lakes or very small and cold throughout the year. Mountain lakes also tend to be very young and impermanent. It could be the case that they haven't been in one place long enough to develop a rich ecosystem. </p>
<p>By contrast you can walk into the bush of Northern Ontario or Quebec, where in some cases people have never even been and find fish in most lakes of a decent size. Like tens of thousands of remote lakes nowhere near human settlements and teeming with fish. </p>
<p>So my guess is that this is a mix of altitude, environment and time that decides whether a lake will have fish rather than some kind of luck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there are lakes a dozen hours from the nearest city in ontario and no roads... there is no way some casual fisherman are stocking it.</p>
<p>In Alberta a lot of the lakes are either too shallow or winters too severe. The result is winter kill where the lakes need to be stocked annually as the entire fish population just gets eradicated every winter due to low oxygen levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget people, often trying to alter the fishery for their own benefit.  I'm dealing with a lake that was manually stocked with invasive carp by some individual in the past.  The carp now dominate and have outcompeted almost all of the native fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Asian carp's rise in America is actually 100% because of what OP mentioned.  In the 1970s there was a guy who owned an Asian carp fishery in the Midwest and they escaped into the wild in a massive flood, which led to the issue with the species today.</p></div>		</li>
