Even if it could get it up to its melting point, liquid wax simply doesn't have enough heat to melt other bits of solid wax.  Similarly, add cold water to ice in a cup, it <em>could</em> freeze the whole thing solid, but only if there's a great deal more ice than water, <em>and</em> the ice is well below freezing to begin with.</p></div>		</li>
