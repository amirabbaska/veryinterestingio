			<div class="markdown"><p>This is real. Oliver Sacks was a noted neurologist and author who wrote factual books and essays about some of the more interesting aspects of the human brain. He sought out people with interesting conditions (and they also began seeking him out) because he wanted to learn and write about them. One of his early books was <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</em>. He was also a clinician who treated patients; in the movie <em>Awakenings</em> he was played by Robin Williams.</p></div>		</li>
