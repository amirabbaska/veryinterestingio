			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible in theory, but it doesn't ever happen. Gravitational waves are caused by a spin-down of massive objects; most virtual particles don't survive long enough to form such stable orbits, and instead directly annihilate transferring all of their angular momentum and energy into the photons that are released. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both? In essence it would come down to the annihilation event occurring through a graviton channel rather than a photon channel. We are currently unable to detect gravitons (assuming they exist); however, we also don't have any instances of pair-annihilation that is product less which would indicate the presence of undetected particles. </p></div>		</li>
