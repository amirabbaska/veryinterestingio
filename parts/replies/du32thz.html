			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so it travels like a wave to you, and the waves are caused by the shape of the object. So imagine dropping both objects in water. The pattern of the waves or the ripples will resemble that of the resulting Booms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a ball thrown in a still pond vs an suv. The shape of the ripples for a ball will be almost perfectly circular and much smaller the shape of the ripples for an suv will have a much different shape and be larger. The difference in magnitude of the shockwave will be less pronounced then the ripples in a pond but it is still a good way to visualize the difference.</p></div>		</li>
