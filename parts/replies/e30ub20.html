			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll selfishly piggyback here to add some additional context.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have known for a long time that water (the molecule) already exists on Mars in considerable quantities:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have known since the Viking missions that the polar caps are primarily made of water ice (with some frozen CO2 during the local winter)</li>
<li>We have known for years that Mars also contains substantial amounts of sub-surface water ice (permafrost) that is in some places less than 1m from the surface and over 50% ice</li>
<li>More recently we have discovered the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaciers_on_Mars" target="_blank">sub-surface glaciers</a>, even at mid-latitudes</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we've known for quite some time and with increasing surety (since the Spirit and Opportunity rover missions especially) that liquid water has existed on Mars in the past for considerable periods of time. We've seen the evidence of lakebeds, of river deltas, of minerals that could only be formed in water over long periods, and so on. This eliminated the possibility that water on Mars was only liquid for brief periods and otherwise was frozen or otherwise locked away the rest of the time.</p>
<p>So we've known for a while that Mars had vast amounts of water, but the water we've found has typically been frozen. In the context of resources for future human colonization efforts this distinction doesn't matter a whole lot, the presence of sub-surface glaciers alone is a sufficient boon in terms of the availability of water to be seen as a valuable key resource. However, in the context of life on Mars the distinction is critical. As mentioned above we've known that liquid water has existed for extended periods on Mars in the past, but if vast geological periods (up to today) have passed while all of the Martian water was frozen (or in the atmosphere) then that puts a pretty severe constraint on the ability of any life that might have arisen on Mars during its wet period to have continued to survive, let alone continue to exist through the present.</p>
<p>In turn this is relevant to searches for Martian life in several ways. If there has been a persistent presence of liquid water on Mars across geological time scales then life that once existed on Mars during its wet period may have survived, continued to evolve, etc. Also, if life on Mars has only ever been microscopic then it would be vastly easier to detect life that was still extant vs. trying to find traces of extinct life (in the form of microscopic fossils, biochemical residues, etc.) Which is, of course, highly relevant to the ongoing exploration of Mars. Additionally, there is potentially some overlap between the study of &quot;refugee&quot; Martian life that might continue to exist in sub-surface aquifers and other life that might exist in subsurface oceans in places like Europa, Enceladus, Ceres, etc. Such subsurface oceans are much more common than we'd believed previously and may be one of the most common habitats for life throughout the Universe, so studying them is of critical importance.</p>
<p>Previously we've had some indications pointing to the presence of current liquid water on Mars but the evidence has been somewhat weak and alternate explanations haven't been completely ruled out. This discovery of a sub-surface lake seems to be much stronger evidence with far fewer possibilities of alternate explanations. It would also, incidentally, go a long way toward supporting the general idea that the presence of liquid water on Mars past the &quot;wet period&quot; is not as unlikely as had been previously believed. If this large body exists then there are probably smaller bodies under glaciers or in aquifers of porous rock, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking the hypothesized temperature of -90 F listed in the article, I came up with a molality of around 36 moles of solute per kg of water. That’s mind-bogglingly high to think all those salts are in solution. Note that this includes ions, so a mole of NaCl would count as 2 moles.</p>
<p>Still a crazy amount of mass, especially considering some of that is heavier ions like sulfates. I’m wondering how thick the brine could be and if there are any archaea extremophiles on earth that could survive such conditions?</p>
<p>Edit- I just realized the pressure of 1.5 km of ice would probably drop the upper limit of molality but I don’t know by how much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the salt. NaCl is different than NaClO4, or CaCl2, or MgCl, etc... but yeah. In my research we were using saturated NaCl and CaCl2 solutions, and 20 wt% NaClO4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Freezing point depression is virtually the same for any solute in a given <del>property</del> solvent (how’d I mess that up?) It’s dependent on the total number of dissolved particles. 1 mole of CaCl2 is the same as 1.5 moles of NaCl or NaClO4 or even 3 moles of glucose. Colligative properties. </p>
<p>Or do you mean you can jam different amounts into solution depending on the salt before it precipitates?</p></div>		</li>
