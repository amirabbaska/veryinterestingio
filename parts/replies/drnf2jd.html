			<div class="markdown"><p>Small clarifcastion - satellites all use roughly the same frequency bands as each other and can and do overlap beam coverage. The larger an earth station antenna the more focused the transit beam is and the more gain their is for the receive for a particular satellite. The result is smaller transmitting antennas are restricted by adjacent satellite interference. </p>
<p>Frequency re use across smaller spot beams has always been a thing but now becoming more common for HTS in all bands. Interest EPIC, Eutelsat and SES are now starting to do this, Skymuster in Australia also does this however the trade off is more terreristrial access earth stations to land it within the spot beam or you become limited in cross strapping into other bands to trunk these smaller beams back to a useful teleport.</p></div>		</li>
