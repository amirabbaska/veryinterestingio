			<div class="markdown"><p>I think correcting pedants about that might be my most favorite thing in the world: no, the force due to rotation is just as fictitious as gravity itself in General Relativity. That was Einstein's entire premise, that being in an accelerating elevator or in a centrifuge must be fundamentally indistinguishable from being attracted to a massive body.</p>
<p>Your teacher who told you that centrifugal force is not real, only centripetal forces are real, lied to to you. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmsXsT0kbbg" target="_blank">You've been educated stupid!</a> =)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he's saying is that the gravitational force is a function of mass and distance, and the rotation of the earth won't change that. You know? It only provides a counterbalancing force. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand what you mean, but it's silly to maintain that there's no distinction to be made. The distinction is actually very clear and easy and useful, and your way of thinking just blurs all the forces together and makes it more confusing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think that's true. A centrifuge is a rotational frame. For example, if you spin a coin inside a centrifuge it will <em>not</em> behave the same as in an elevator or on a planet, due to conservation of angular momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However it is more complicated since the radius would also shrink at the equator since the rotation drives it out a bit and the poles might even get further away. So some people would experience between -.3% and +.6% although I would have to do some simulations first.</p></div>		</li>
