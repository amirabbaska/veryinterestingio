			<div class="markdown"><p>Human rated space tech takes forever. There are plenty of simple probe designs that could be built in 3-5 years, expensive but surely possible. But the killer is the time it would take to reach the the asteroid, up to 30 years. No one has designed anything to last that long and work perfectly once it lands or flies by. It's really not worth sending something to that specific asteroid. It's too far away and there is always bound to be another to study.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think the answer is looking like, &quot;Eh, it's too expensive. We'll wait for the next one.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Itâ€™s not a technical problem so much as a financial one. If $100b and most of NASAs resources were thrown at it, it could be done. No way around the long trip though...</p></div>		</li>
