<p>The question for me is how many natural foods have we destroyed or forgotten as we moved into a factory farm system?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently many old livestock breeds and plant cultivars are threatened by extinction because they don't fit in our highly industrialized agriculture. They may not like certain conditions or they don't grow large enough or they are too difficult to handle. Yet they offer (next to different taste) other advantages like resistances to pests, floodings, salty water, droughts, germs, etc. This is becoming more and more important in times of global warming. </p>
<p>We are facing the threat of a high amount of invaluable DNA forever being lost because those species die out. It's very easy to 'destroy' when it's about breeding/growing but extremely difficult to create new material. The FAO is currently acting on this problem. </p>
<p>If your agriculture only uses a very small amount of species this may lead to severe problems like the acute <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/19/news/bananas-banana-crisis-disease/index.html" target="_blank">banana crisis shows.</a> One disease might easily wipe out an entire plant cultivar on a global scale because this one doesn't have any resistances against it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting that we today eat so few different species every day. There are some groups of san people in southern Africa that still live  like hunters and gatherers (which they had to resort to when bantu tribes took over their lands around 1000 ad). They typically know about 200 edible plants, although half of those are less palatable. </p>
<p>How many different plants do you eat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was watching this BBC show called Wartime Kitchen or Wartime Farm forget which one, and they were talking about how people made do in the UK during the rationing in WW2. And one of the historians was walking around the countryside, and pointing out all sorts of edible fruit and vegetables. One of the things he said, IIRC, is that people just found <em>better</em> tasting foods and abandoned the old ones, but they still grew wild and were still edible. And during the war, people would go out and harvest all the random wild vegetables, fruits, roots, that were perfectly edible and healthy, just either tasted bland or not that great. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned the edible plants in my local ecoregion. Surprising amount of good stuff out there. Lots of berries, lots of edible leafy plants, a good number of fruits, etc. </p>
<p>What surprised me is how good the wild berries taste.  Just as good as our cultivated ones IMO! Also, most edible leafy things I'd find have a real strong and distinct flavor which could easily be culinary herbs, but just arent used that much I guess. </p></div>		</li>
