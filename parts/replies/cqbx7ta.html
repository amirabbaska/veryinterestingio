			<p>I actually meant to put $50+/month. I know $50 is probably low balling it, but I was mostly just trying to generalize. </p>		</li>

			<p>I was wondering the same... I'm paying about $145 after all the premium channels, taxes, and other bullshit, but I think the lowest AT&amp;T Uverse™ plan starts around $80.  I'm so close to reducing it all to HBO Now/Go, Amazon Prime, and Netflix.</p>		</li>

			<p>My comcast cable is 45 a month. It basically just depends on where you live. Dishes package including ESPN is 60 a month once the promotion is over. Sounds like you may be overpaying at 100 but cable pricing is such a regional thing. It varies drastically. It can even very between neighborhoods. </p>		</li>

			<p>$100 A month? I pay £50 ($73) here in the UK, and I get over 300 channels, 150mbps internet, free calls on landline and a free cellphone with unlimited calls &amp; texts. Why is it so expensive in the US?</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Why is it so expensive in the US?<br><br>Horrible anti competitive practices and price gouging.  </p>		</li>
