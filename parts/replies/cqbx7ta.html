			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering the same... I'm paying about $145 after all the premium channels, taxes, and other bullshit, but I think the lowest AT&amp;T Uverseâ„¢ plan starts around $80.  I'm so close to reducing it all to HBO Now/Go, Amazon Prime, and Netflix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My comcast cable is 45 a month. It basically just depends on where you live. Dishes package including ESPN is 60 a month once the promotion is over. Sounds like you may be overpaying at 100 but cable pricing is such a regional thing. It varies drastically. It can even very between neighborhoods. </p></div>		</li>
