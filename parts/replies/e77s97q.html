			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you mean here and I think games like overwatch and DotA with all the different characters are going to eventually drop off in popularity as far as esports are concerned. I think the games that have a better chance in the long run are the ones based less on picking the right character to push a payload or a lane ,and more on being good at the game like csgo or rocket league, where nobody has any special powers like teleportation or invisibility. Everybody has the same abilities and rely on practice and skill alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would tend to agree. Except that in reality (at least as far as FPS goes), we seem to have gone away from an even playing field and into character variety.</p>
<p>Halo 1 - Halo 3 and more or less all of the CoDs until a few years ago were an even playing field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rocket League is a great example of a potential long-term e sport because the system and physics (sometimes janky) are so well defined and it let's players figure out their own unique styles and create new techniques. </p>
<p>Sports are the same way. Skateboarding didn't start out with a 900 by Tony Hawk, it had to first establish moves like ollies. </p>
<p>Football didn't even have a forward pass to begin with, now the game is littered with spread passing schemes. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Honestly Rocket League is the only game I've ever played that felt like I was playing an actual sport. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree with you for the most part, but if you're interested in some further reading on the subject Google the 99% invisible episode about the development of basketball rules! </p>
<p>Basketball is the one sport I can think of that has had a relatively storied history of &quot;nerfs/buffs to the game&quot;, such as the introduction of 3-point shots. </p></div>		</li>
