			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember being told of another famous counterfeiter that was so good that his counterfeit bills actually became famous and got sold at auctions for a lot of money. Not sure his name, but I remember hearing about it from Pawn Stars. Back when Pawn Stars was good and Chum Lee wasn't a dirtbag</p></div>		</li>

<p>He actually didn't directly &quot;spend&quot; the money he made, he would sell the &quot;artwork&quot; to someone, who would use their own money to pay for whatever he was buying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to see one of the best counterfeiters we know of but never caught check out the Omega counterfeit gold coins. I used to own one (got it for gold price, knew it was a fake) but sold it when I needed money for 3x gold price. Because he was so good they are now very collectable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once I photoshopped a small note of my currency (equivalent to $5 dollars) with my dad's face on it. My dad printed it on regular paper matching front and back, damaged it a little to make it looks used and put in his wallet to prank customers. At some point he mistakenly used it to actually pay something and we don't know where it went.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you are joking, but IDK if this can be considered a felony. It clearly was not a real note and was not designed to looks like an actual note, so I guess the fault is totally on the person that accepted it.</p></div>		</li>
