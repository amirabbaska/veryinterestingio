			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been to areas where there are dozens of abandoned cars in the woods.  My impression of why people do that is because;</p>
<p>-The cars were parked under some trees to keep them out of the Sun, but then the undergrowth grew in around them;</p>
<p>-They parked the cars in wooded areas because they would have been an eyesore lined up on the front lawn;</p>
<p>-They didn't want anyone to mess with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I've got a relevant &quot;car in the woods&quot; story. </p>
<p>On a canoe trip in Minnesota, I once found the remnants of a 1915 Oldsmobile (or maybe Cadillac, can't remember offhand) on a random, tiny-ass island in the middle of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_Waters" target="_blank">Boundary Waters Wilderness.</a> It was so old that the wheels had wooden spokes, which had mostly rotted away. The only way you could tell that it was originally a car was the fact that &quot;1915 Oldsmobile&quot; was stamped on the rusted-as-fuck engine block.</p>
<p>I cannot stress how middle-of-nowhere this place was. There were no roads on the island. There were no bridges <em>to</em> the island, nor was there anything for them to connect to if there had been. We were miles and miles from <em>anything</em> recognizable as &quot;civilization.&quot; To this day, I still have no idea what that old junker was doing there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar experience! Found a WWII era VW bug in the mountains in Italy. Rotted tires and completely rusted out. It was in a grove that would have been extremely difficult to drive through even if there were a way to get up the steep, rough terrain in every direction. It was cool to think that there must have been a road at some point that is now completely gone</p></div>		</li>
