			<div class="markdown"><p>The ship accelerates at both ends of the trip, which means the ship is not an inertial reference frame for the entire journey. The planet is (more or less), so that is the cause of the asymmetry. While in constant motion,  the ship sees the planet as slowed down <em>and the planet sees the ship as slowed down.</em> This apparent paradox is resolved when you accelerate the ship's reference frame at either end of the journey, which does funny things to time dilation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also what if you manage to accelerate the planet's reference frame instead?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Communication will be <del>slow and redshifted</del> fast and blueshifted (thanks /u/wonkey_monkey for pointing out that I had it ass-backwards) whether you're on the ship or the planet. Literally like listening to a record played too <del>slowly</del> fast.</p>
<p>If you accelerate the planet and leave the ship in an inertial frame then the people on the planet (in the accelerated frame) will experience less time in total than the people on the ship. You just interchange the roles of planet and ship in your scenario, nothing else changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this: the two star systems are in the same frame while the space ship is in a different frame moving at very high speed. In fact, let's pretend the space ship frame has an infinie number of ships in it that are evenly spaced (say, one year apart) and that people can jump on or off at one star or the other. </p>
<p>If you jump on a ship at star #1 and then jump back off at star #2 then everyone in the star frame will have aged a lot more than you. <em>But</em> if you were in a spaceship and jumped off at star #1 and then waited for the next spaceship to come by before jumping back on, everyone in the <em>spaceship frame</em> would have aged a lot more than you did.</p>
<p>It's not acceleration that causes this. It is simply the effect of changing frames. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the Twin Paradox.  Most people think it just describes the travelling twin coming back younger than the stay at home twin, but that's actually what <em>resolves</em> the paradox.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if everything is relative, what is there to say that the spaceship is the one that's traveling fast?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely nothing.  If you put two twins in closed boxes with nothing but video feed between them, then sent one box off to Alpha Centauri, both twins would perceive the other's clocks as slowing down.  That's the paradox.  It's not until they are <em>reunited</em> that you can determine who it was that traveled and who stayed at home (which might be neither, if the other twin followed the first to AC and they'd reunite with the same age).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why couldn't we treat the spaceship as stationary and have years pass for the people in the spaceship while only weeks pass for the planet-dwellers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can do exactly that.  The math all works the same for both.  In reality, yeah, it's pretty easy to determine whether it's you or the entire rest of the universe that's moving.  But it's sometimes simpler to treat it that way, in much the same way that geocentric astronomy is sometimes mathematically useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In essence, what causes this asymmetrical time dilation?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not.  Special Relativity is quite symmetric.  It's not until the the twins are reunited that any asymmetry is revealed.</p></div>		</li>
