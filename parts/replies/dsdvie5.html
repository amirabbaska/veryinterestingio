			<div class="markdown"><p>You can spin up a machine on a cloud hosting service like DigitalOcean really fast.  It is easy to set up a mail server but hard to do it correctly.  If you want to simply send email, you can use telnet on port 25.  Boom!  YOU are now a mail server.  But, if you want to send and receive, you must register your own domain, set up your own DNS, install your own RBLs and antivirus software, set up user accounts, and configure everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you read this and decide to set one up for the love of all that is good <strong>disable relaying</strong> before you even <strong>think</strong> of starting the server. </p>
<p>I have used a digital ocean droplet as a relay (from a VPN interface, not the internet facing one) before and scanning for open relays started within 5 minutes of the server coming up. It had likely always been scanned, I just had nothing listening to notice. </p>
<p>Really if you want to run your own SMTP server learn in a lab first, then read <em>every</em> log entry for a month after standing it up and if you don't know what it means <em>find out!</em></p>
<p>Don't even get me started on DNS amplification attacks....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very little actually. Just like Word is a program and how Excel is a program. An email server is merely a program that has a focus on receiving, storing, and distributing messages.  </p>
<p>There are free email servers for all computers, including your <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=free+email+server+for+windows&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-b-1" target="_blank">basic Windows computer.</a>  </p>
<p>However, Email has become a bit of a quagmire. Building an email server from a home PC is kind of like driving a Model T Ford on today's roads. It might even look like a joke if you have a Tesla and a McLaren pull up to it.</p></div>		</li>
