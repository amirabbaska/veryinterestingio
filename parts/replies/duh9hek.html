			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about refrigeration, because I store mine in the pantry. </p>
<p>I live in Alaska, and left my bag of potatoes in the truck overnight when it was -30. The next morning, I brought them in and tried to thaw a couple in a bowl of warm water. </p>
<p>It was disastrous. They were black and almost soot-covered, and when I tried to shred them for hash browns they just turned into mashed potatoes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All fruit/vegetables are made from cells. These cells contain water inside them and are held together as a shape by cellular walls.</p>
<p>When water inside a cell freezes, it rips those cellular walls apart. Depending on the speed at which you freeze water, you can get lots of crystals forming on some parts which leads to tearing and tissue damage. Or if you gradually and slowly freeze that water, it will then expand and mostly fit inside that frozen cell, with much less damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can be refrigerated (though it changes the taste) but should be cooked or boiled before being frozen. </p>
<p>Freezing potatoes turns them black, similar to how if you peel them and let them sit out in the open they will get discolored. I'm not sure exactly why, but they &quot;oxidize&quot; in some way.  </p></div>		</li>
