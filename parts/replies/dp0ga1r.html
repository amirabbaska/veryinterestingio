Doesn't seem too far fetched, <a href="https://www.space.com/23091-haumea.html" target="_blank">Haumea</a> spins at about 4h/revolution, about 30% faster. With the next 2nd or 3d generation of space telescope (next one being the JWST) I guess we'll be able to confirm/infirm this idea. Would be interesting</p></div>		</li>
