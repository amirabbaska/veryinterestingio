			<div class="markdown"><p>The Phoenician alphabet is descended from the earlier Ugaritic alphabet, which actually had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic_alphabet#Abecedaries" target="_blank">two letter orders in use</a> at the time, the Northern and Southern Semitic orders. The Phoenician alphabet (and thus its descendants) just happened to use the Northern Semitic order, so it's really just an accident of history. The Southern Semitic order is still reflected today in the Ethiopian Ge'ez script. Interestingly, Ethiopians often refer to the Ge'ez as halehame (after the first four letters of the Southern Semitic order) just as the words alphabet, abecedary, abugida, abjad etc refer to the first two to four letters of the Northern Semitic order and its descendants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that the Southern Semitic order has been retained very conservatively in Ge'ez after millennia, and Indic order has been retained in Japanese kana centuries after exposure to Brahmic scripts, I'd say letter order just tends to be one of the most conservatively preserved elements of whichever alphabet a culture begins using extensively, more so than letter forms. Cultural dominance probably played much more of a role than any innate property; the Phoenicians happened to use Northern Semitic order, so the Greeks happened to keep more or less the same order when they adopted the Phoenician alphabet.</p>
<p>The same question is often asked about <a href="https://imgur.com/a/GUJ4s" target="_blank">writing directionality</a> among other things, but as this chart shows, current dominance of a linguistic property doesn't necessarily mean that dominance was inevitable (or even foreseeable).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet (more technically an abjad) and adapted the letter forms for Phoenician consonantal phonemes not found in Greek to represent vowels. Hebrew/Aramaic and Arabic are more directly descended from Phoenician. In a sense, almost every alphabet/abjad/abugida in use today originated with the Ugaritic alphabet (which may have been influenced by the Egyptian use of some heiroglyphs to represent phonemes). Even much later alphabets such as Korean hangul may have been informed by the <em>existence</em> of Phoenician-descended Brahmic scripts, if nothing else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Hindi language (which descended from Sanskrit) spoken in Indian subcontinent, groups the letters by their sound. Firstly, the vowels are spoken then the consonants.</p>
<p>The vowels are divided into two sub categories, the short vowels and the long vowels with each sub category pronounced alternatively. Example, in English the words pin and peel both have the 'e' sound in them but it is more stressed (or long) in peel. Thus, in Hindi there is a short 'e' followed by a long 'e' (yes, 'e' is also a vowel in Hindi)</p>
<p>The consonants are again divided into sub categories based on where the sound is produced and how the tongue, teeth or lips interact while pronouncing. Example, there is a sub category in which, while pronouncing the letters, the lips will touch each other. In English they would be similar to letters, P, B, M. Or there is a category where the tongue strikes the bottom of the mouth while pronouncing the letters (example, T, D in English).</p>
<p>So this guy, Mr Watt may have been true and I think he must have researched Sanskrit or Hindi to reach the conclusion. Just Google or wiki Sanskrit language and you will find that it has been spoken since 1500BC.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further, in each consonant cluster of 5 in Devnagari(Marathi, Konkani, Hindi, Nepali, Sanskrit etc), the order is : unvoiced, unaspirated plosive (क, च, ट, त, प); unvoiced, aspirated plosive (ख, छ, ठ, थ, फ); voiced unaspirated plosive (ग, ज, ड, द, ब); voiced, aspirated plosive (घ, झ, ढ, ध, भ) and finally nasal (ङ, ञ, ण, न, म) at the respective tongue positions (velar, post-alveolar, retroflex, dental-alveolar, labial) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indian way of ordering alphabets to be very logical. Most indian languages are spoken as they are written. Every sound produced in these languages have a corresponding letter too. So learning English was interesting to me because of how seemingly unrelated spelling and pronunciation can feel at times. It's a lot of conventions one has to understand and memorize. It wasn't exactly hard but interesting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there not also possibly introduction of the letter into the alphabet and therefore later letters in the alphabet <em>tend</em> to be used less frequently? I note that ABCDE are everywhere whereas X and Z less frequent. J is an exception to this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Must be <em>some</em> truth to that, but also different people introduce letters in different places.</p>
<p>Cyril and Methodus, designing the first Slavic script from a Greek basis, introduced letters for each non-Greek sound right <em>before</em> the nearest (Byzantine) Greek letter/sound.</p>
<p>So, for example, modern Cyrillic alphabets start with <em>А-Б-В-Г-Д</em>, corresponding to <em>alpha-NEW LETTER-beta-gamma-delta</em>. The letter <em>beta</em> was at that time pronounced as a V-sound (as it is in modern Greek, and in contrast to Classical Greek), so they added a new B-sounding letter <em>before</em> it. Also, that's why a Cyrillic V looks like a Latin B.</p>
<p>Now, why the Latin G, being an innovation derived from the Latin C, ended up between F and H, I have no idea.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Also, specifically about X and Z: both are (equivalents of) common letters in Classical Greek; the Romans inherited them through Etruscan intermediacy. The Romans used X as a replacement for CS or GS every place they could, but Z only appeared in rare loanwords from Greek (e.g. <em>zona</em>). It makes sense Z would end up at the end (in contrast to Greek and Etruscan alphabets, which placed it near the beginning). The X seems to have been moved near the end by the Etruscans, who (from here on I'm just guessing) probably didn't use it nearly as much as the Romans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is interesting from this is the idea that there was indeed some intention. I foresee: Improved alphabet, finally simplified English spelling (and get rid of terrible word pairs: effect/affect, etc.) and make keyboards more rational -- qwertyuiop offends me but i have to use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In English the [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency](first" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency](first</a> dozen most common letters) are E, T, A, O, I, N and S, H, R, D, L and U, more or less in that order.  Those were the first two columns of keys on Linotype typesetters so they were quicker to type.</p>
<p>Notice how all the vowels are there, with U right at the end?  It's a toss-up whether U or C are more common, depending on the corpus you examine for letter frequencies.</p>
<p>It also makes substitution cyphers easy to crack because if you add up the frequency of occurrence of each letter in the cypertext and match those up with a &quot;standard&quot; English letter frequency table, you can work out what the substitution is.  You only need the most common consonants and vowels to start to get &quot;guessable&quot; words, and the rest becomes easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that the I/J and U/V are splits from earlier latin unified letters (I/J as we use them now both coming from I, U/V both coming from V) It would seem that they were shoehorned next to their letters of origin in the alphabet, which explains why they're non-sequitur to the original layout of putting new-ish letters toward the end.</p></div>		</li>
