			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband started feeding the stray cats around our house back in the 90's. We started doing the &quot;catch and release&quot; method of controlling the population.  </p>
<p>There were a couple of litters that were born during this process.  For one litter, the mom was familiar with us, and brought her kittens to our house for food and we could pet them and everything. </p>
<p>We noticed that the mom cat had a specific purr-lilt call that she would make while trying to corral her kittens together.  </p>
<p>Later in life, whenever me or my husband made that call, those (now grown) kitten would come running.  It was very useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've witnessed this as well. My family has previously taken care of two pregnant strays and both of the mothers had very distinct vocalisations that they used to call their kittens and instruct them around which I had never heard any other cats make before. It kinda felt like that scene from Jurassic Park 3 when they realise just how sophisticated the raptors level of communication was. It was cats instead of dinosaurs, but I still thought it was pretty cool at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, if only I could!  He passed away a few years ago. </p>
<p>The call was most like a very high pitched rolling &quot;r&quot; rising to a higher pitch at the end.  I'm sure there were frequencies or variances that we couldn't repurrduce, us not being actual cats.  The kittens seemed to understand our attempts though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One point of note about dolphins is that they use these call to refer to a dolphin that isn't present. This <em>could</em> suggest that dolphins do associate these signature calls as part of their identity rather than an attention grabber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a &quot;family tune&quot; growing up that my dad would use a lot for the same reason. I was surprised when I learned that not many people do this. It seemed like a simple and obvious thin to do to easily find your group of you got separated. I still whistle it with my girlfriend if we get separated in the grocery store, 20 years later. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! My family has a &quot;shhh shhh&quot; signature. When I started dating my now wife she thought that it's disrecpectful to call parents or siblings like that. But now she is more and more convinced. She hasn't used that yet herself but I can call her by that sound and she doesn't make a fuss over it anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom had one with my and my brother. Its a running joke that mom can find us ANYWHERE so long as we can hear that whistle. Its so distinct and constant. Shes the only one who can whistle like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My roommates family does the same thing. One day I was out with them and she was trying to call to her sister with the family whistle, and someone on the other side of the store responded. Her sister trotted up a few seconds later. So either someone decided to fuck with them or another family uses the same whistle, but either way, it was hilarious. </p></div>		</li>
