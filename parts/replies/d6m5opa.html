			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently there's a character limit?  Who knew.  Here's something introduced to add to the craps section.</p>
<p>Craps:  betting on a hop (one roll bet) pays to 30 for 1, 30 to 1, 15 for 1, or 15 to 1.  The deference here is academic in this case, most casinos are only for one, but to one is better.  The 30x payouts are for pairs (hard ways).  Let's say you think 11 will come next roll.  There are 2 ways to roll 11, 6-5, and 5-6, if you have problems seeing this, pretend the dice are different colors.  2 dice x 6 sides = 36 combos.   You have 2 ways to win out of 36.  Or, 1 in 18.  This bet at best pays 15 to 1.  So win 16, lose 18.  That's 88.8% giving the house an edge of 11.2%</p>
<p>Edit, I didn't want to get into this as this was just an example of house edge, but let me say a little more about craps.
A.  Craps examples rely on a ton of terminology, most of which I didn't want to devote the time to explain.<br />
B.  Yes, there a ton of examples I could have drawn from here but given that craps generally is a 2 state game (pre and post come out) and quad stage if you want to talk about the differences between pass and don't pass, I felt that the hop bets offered a more concise example of house edge.
C.  You'll note I make distinctions between for 1 and to 1 betting payouts.  I could have made that more clear.  So here that goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>All odds in craps are based on the total of two 6 sided dice.</li>
<li>The total number of combinations rolling 2 dice are 36 (6*6)</li>
<li>While pass, don't pass, come, don't come, place, buy, put, and purchased lay bets all pay the same, craps prop bets generally fall within 2 pay scales; for 1 and to 1.  Excluding combination bets like the horn or 3-ways(which are truly just composite bets using the formula I'm about to show you [the exception being the any 7 bet on a non to 1 table]), hop bets (bets on 1 roll of the dice) are paid 1 of two ways
30 for 1, 30 to 1 for pairs, 1,1 2,2 3,3 ect
15 for 1, 15 to 1 for everything else like the yo  (11) in the example or say something like the 5,3 ( this bet means that I'm betting that 1.  The next roll of the dice will total 8 and that 2.  The eight will come 5,3)  </li>
</ol>
<p>Since the dice are the same color, you can't tell if the 8 comes 5,3 or 3,5. It makes no difference in reality however, because we know there are 2 ways to make a 5,3 8 just like there are 2 ways to make a 5,6 11.
The difference in the to 1 vs the for 1 look like this.
I bet 1 dollar on 15 for 1 hopping 8.  It wins. I get paid $14 with my original dollar staying in action  (if you don't want it to stay in action for the next roll when they are paying you say &quot;and down&quot;)</p>
<p>On a to one table that payout changes to me being paid $15 with the bet still in action.   For 1 is essentially saying that the bet is being paid 15 FOR the $1. The dealers will (kindly) leave your action up for you because:
A.  It pisses off players when you take their action down
B.  It pisses off the casino when you intentionally remove money from action.</p>
<p>This same example applies to the 30x bets as well, just substitute 29 and 30 respectively.</p>
<p>Last thing on dice.  You can quickly compute the frequency of any number coming up by using 3 methods.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it a pair?  If yes, it's 1 in 36.  If no, it's 1 in 18</li>
<li>7 has the highest mode at 6. Excluding numbers 8-12, the number of combos of a number can be quickly calculated using the formula N-1.  Therefore 7 occurs 6 times, 5 occurs 4 times, 2 occurs once.  All these should be assumed to be out of 36, and since 7 is the average, all numbers above 7 are mirrors of the numbers below and vice versa.  3 is the same as 11, 6 is the same as 8 and so forth. </li>
</ol>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was fucking glorious.  I worked in the industry for years from everything to owning blackjack tables, to dealing poker to playing poker professionally and I still hear, &quot;oh but my friend wins every time he plays blackjack,&quot; so often from otherwise reasonably intelligent people.  I can count cards but most people don't even realize with short term variance you can <em>still</em> lose.  Anyway, awesome, informative post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People just tend to be fundamentally bad at odds and risk.</p>
<p>The way I like to explain it to people who don't get it is to say let's flip a coin, heads I win and tails you do.</p>
<p>If the winner gives the loser a dollar, this isn't a bad bet, but nor is it a good one.  The odds are 50/50.  You might win the flip ten times in a row, but play the game long enough, and neither of us is going to end up richer than the other.</p>
<p>Now let's say that I'll give you $2 for every loss, but you still only have to give me $1.  This is a really good bet for you.  It doesn't matter if I win ten throws in a row, and you're down for a bit, play the game long enough, and we'd expect you to have taken twice as much money from me than me from you.  </p>
<p>Now, let's talk about risk:  let's say we're betting where you have to pay $1000 for a loss, but I give you $1001 for a win.  This is a good bet for you, in the sense if you could play the game out long enough, and you'll end up earning money, but, if all you have is $1000, and you need to pay rent with it, you won't want to do it.  The downside of losing is so bad, and the plus is so small, that you would want to pass on this bet. </p>
<p>Now, if you were a casino with millions of dollars of a bankroll, you <em>would</em> want to take the bet.  There isn't much risk of running out of money.  You wouldn't earn much in the short term, but, if you could wait out your opponent, you would earn in the long run.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, that's tough. People make tons of basic strategy mistakes that give a huge advantage to the house in bj.  I think perfect BS gives like 0.6% house edge and the way most people play it's like 11% or worse.  That said, crops has tons of bets that are 11% or worse.  Depends on the gambler.  If you can stick to pass with odds, come with odds, place 6 and 8 you're golden, if rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, spot-fucking-brilliant write up. I love it.  A few quick questions.  I've seen a few casinos in vegas, primarily on the strip that have changed some of the rules/payouts.  How far off does this move the .6 for perfect play? On to craps... I'd heard that DON'T pass is actually a smaller house edge but that playing it can get you lynched (seriously folks, don't play don't pass on a hot table).  Lastly, iirc if the field in craps pays 3-1 on a 12 it's actually a respectable bet.  Any truth to the last two?  Can you comment on the &quot;craps no more&quot; tables where 2,3,11,12 are points?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure the exact edge change. Go to wizard of odds and input the specific rules,  it'll spit one out for you.
Don't are slightly better, like .07% or something small.<br />
Triple pay one one does indeed make it respectable.<br />
Never seen craps no more </p></div>		</li>
