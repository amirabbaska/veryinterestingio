			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a handful of discussions floating around on the topic. This person suggests a strip of cooked bacon is about 50 calories, which isn't bad at all! In terms of health I think bacon isn't bad, although it can be pretty salty.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bigger concern with bacon and other cured meats is the role that nitrites metabolising to nitrosamines has in the absence of reducing agents. Eating bacon by itself is a lot more provably carcinogenic than most other foods.</p>
<p>Good news, though, is that ascorbic acid is a wonderful reducing agent and ubiquitous with fruit and vegetables. Get a good, real serving of those in with your bacon and you've blunted that effect while reaping all the other benefits, too.</p>
<p>Bad news is that &quot;no nitrate&quot; bacon is usually bull. If it says &quot;only uses natural celery salt,&quot; that's akin to calling HFCS &quot;sugar free--&quot; said celery salt is basically just &quot;natural&quot; nitrate and functionally indistinguishable.</p></div>		</li>
