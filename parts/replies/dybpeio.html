			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me in order to have any of these behaviors, insects first have to be shown to have some more basic but abstract level mental processes - ie. do they even have concious level thought or emotional responses, nevermind &quot;play&quot;. In recent years I've seen a number of papers for experiments intended to determine whether insects even have &quot;intentional thought&quot;--ie is everything they do completely instinctual or do they have the ability to assesss and make a decision. Some of these were kind of weird, like wiring up flies nervous systems and then playing images of a closing predator or food object. In another they clipped half the mouth parts off of queen bees so they couldn't fight, then introduced them into a hive with another queen. In the latter case, the injured queens avoided fights with the other queen, implying they knew they were weaker and likely to lose any fight they engaged in. It doesn't answer the question of whether they actually play, but it does demonstrate they are capable of intentional behavior rather than being complete autonotoms</p></div>		</li>

<p>But then you have to define &quot;conscious&quot; and &quot;emotion&quot;. And if you're not careful, you might define those words in such a way that a Tamagotchi is &quot;conscious&quot; and has &quot;emotions&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since a Tamagotchi is deliberately designed to emulate a conscious being with emotions, indeed intended to pursuade the user (with some suspension of disbelief) I'm not sure that's such a bad thing. Perhaps one corollary to Clarke's law is that sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from biology. Or seen from the other end, biology is just a form of technology and the distinction between engineered and evolved is meaningless once engineered versions can replicate the functionality well enough.
The holy grail of computer science is to produce an artificial intelligence that is self aware, conscious and intelligent on par with a human. How would we know if we have succeeded if we define consciousness to exclude 'man made'? After all, nature itself is full of mimicry. Good luck spotting an ant mimicking spider among her hosts if you don't know exactly what to look for, and they are part of the jumping spider family, otherwise one of the most distinctive and readily recognised families in the entire arachnid kingdom (most people don't even realise that tailless whip scorpions or Romans aren't, actually, spiders).
So where do you draw the line between consciousness and successful mimicry thereof ? And because consciousness is such a fungible concept to begin with isn't a successful mimicry in fact the  same thing for all practical matters ? Turing certainly thought so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be curious to see if the injured queen displayed that behavior in response to any injury, not just one directly related to combat. I'm not convinced that demonstrates intentionality. Any queen who is injured might avoid conflict for instinctual reasons. Some ants have fairly complex behaviors associated with injured states in themselves and other members of their social groups. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They tested combinations of 2 uninjured queens, 1 each injured/uninjured and both injured. Been several years but recollection is the injured queens in all cases appeared to show conflict avoidance, moving to remote corners off the hive and turning away if the other queen was nearby. Uninjured queens in all cases sought out conflict (which is the normal instinctive behavior)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hermit crabs or any burrowing species would fall under this definition</p></div>		</li>
