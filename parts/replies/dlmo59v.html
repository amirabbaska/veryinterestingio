			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh this is excellent, thank you! It must take so much dedication but I can imagine even small breakthroughs would be so worth it. The way you explained teaching more abstract concepts makes a lot of sense, but as someone with all my senses it's hard to imagine not just /getting/ something when you experience/interact with it in day-to-day life. Having even the slightest bit of site or hearing would be a huge asset I imagine, too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad that helped! It's a fascinating field, and you are so right, little wins are celebrated in a big way. We do all sorts of unique things to communicate, and it's all unique to each individual since the degree of disability and cognition varies. Until I got into the role I'm in now, I had no idea about any of it.  This is a great platform to raise awareness, so I was super pumped to come across your question! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That movie nearly traumatized me as a kid! Seeing how they had essentially written Keller off as just a screaming idiot (literally) they could only shut up with sugar was so disturbing. And then to see the journey in drama of her becoming such a poet was equally as satisfying. </p>
<p>But yeah, left me terrified at the thought of what my parents would have done if I had been in her situation and even further terrified at the thought of how hard I would do if it were me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deafblind people are just like you and me (well, aside from the vision and hearing I suppose). Just like anyone else, different Deafblind people will perceive things in different ways and find different things funny. </p>
<p>Deafblind people can be very competent members of society, with some assistance. For example a Deafblind person can use a computer, if they have screenreading software and a braille output. A Deafblind person could surf Reddit, and could be reading this right now. Maybe they're reading /r/jokes</p>
<p>I find it better to just act as if it's someone who speaks a different language. Sure, that language isn't verbal, but ASL is a language. BSL is a language. LSQ is a language. Its more of a language barrier to me then anything else.</p>
<p>Of course what I'm saying mostly applies to AFTER they learn the language and after the original process of teaching. </p>
<p>SOURCE: My father is Deafblind, and I have met many other deaf/Deaf people, blind people, and any combination through him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may sound silly, but do young deafblind people know they're deaf blind? Wouldn't they think what they are experiencing is &quot;normal&quot; and what they are being taught is possibly from a more experienced deafblind person. In saying that, how do you communicate to them that they are both deaf and blind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, what they know is normal.  I work with only congenitally DeafBlind adults (they were born that way or lost sight/hearing before the age of 2), and it's incredible to watch them interact with and navigate the world.  We don't really explain that they should be able to hear or see and can't.  We have trouble with things like, for example, nudity outside of your bedroom (most of our clients live together with other DeafBlind roommates).  Since they can't see that everyone else isn't naked in the living room, they don't have the concept that it's not normal.  So again through various ways of communication, we work on more social concepts, like privacy, again with lots of patience! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how do you explain to the deafblind person that everyone else in the room knows the deafblind person is naked, but the deafblind person can't tell that the others are naked? If I was in the situation, I would not understand how they can detect nudity but I can't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can kind of speak to this in a different way. There a family I know who 4 years ago had a baby very very premature. So premature that the baby was not ever supposed to survive. Thankfully she did, but the girl has had so many problems because her organs weren't fully developed yet. She has to breath with oxygen because her lungs aren't good enough and she never learned to eat with her mouth because she had a feeding tube in he beginning. Now she's 4 years old and does things regular 4 year olds do, but she refuses to eat with her mouth and always uses her feeding tube because that's normal to her. It's not normal to eat with her mouth and her body tells her no. So I would assume in this case if they are fully deaf/blind then that would be completely normal to them. It wouldn't be the same for us imagining being in that state because we know a difference and quite frankly a much easier difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but at 4 she already recognizes what she does is different but feels right to her. In my mind a deafblind will never make that distinction right? But if they do, how? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious, but what percentage are at hgher IQs? I know Helen Keller was exceptionally bright and thus it was easier to learn the abstract. Do most of your patients have developmental disabilities. As well? </p>
<p>Also, when reading her writings there are a lot of words that are &quot;fillers&quot; that seem to be even more difficult to teach than the abstract that can't be easily discovered by the senses. I'm guessing she signed what she meant and then had another person come in and &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; grammatically speaking. Is it the same in ASL? I hope my questions don't come off as ignorant, I only have minimal experience with people (mostly students) with similar disabilities. </p>
<p>You have a real talent for being able to communicate in such a unique way! I'm so amazed at what you do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question, and absolutely not coming off as ignorant - it's a very unique field that so many people know nothing about (I was one of them before I started in it!)
I can only speak to the clients I support, not the deafblind population as a whole, but for some reference, we support 65 clients across the province - only 4 or so would have literacy skills.  Most of our clients have a moderate to severe developmental disability.  Our oldest clients now are in their 50s, and have Congenital Rubella Syndrome (their mothers contracted Rubella when they were pregnant).  This used to be the leading cause of deafblindness.  Outside of their sensory impairments, they don't suffer from a lot of other ailments.  Now, the leading cause of deafblindness is micropreemies (babies born in and around 25 weeks gestation).  We have wonderful technology that can keep these little ones alive outside of the womb, but unfortunately a lot of the treatments, along with their prematurity, contribute to very significant developmental and health trouble.</p>
<p>And you're right - just as ASL is it's own language and doesn't translate directly to English, other forms of sign language are similar, so the intervenor would translate it filling in the blanks to make it grammatically accurate.  Most of our clients are taught SEE (Signed Exact English), which translates English word for word, and is different than ASL, which relies a lot of facial gestures, which doesn't work when you're visually impaired. </p></div>		</li>
