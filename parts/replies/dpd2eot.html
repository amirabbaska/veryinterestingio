			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Cuz each planet rotates and orbits the star at very different rates than of earth. And I like the coordinated universal idea that can tie them all together</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, part of the issue is that the human body has spent the last...forever really...getting used to a 24 hour cycle.</p>
<p>Some experiments have shown that adjusting just to Mars' 24H:40M day cause negative reactions in near and medium terms. To clarify though, what I am referring to is living on a cycle planned for 24.66 hours. Basically what appears to be the case, is that you end up living as though every day were Daylight Savings (the bad one).</p>
<p>Biologically, it may just be better to live on a normal 24 hour clock, even though it will frequently desynchronize from the local day/night cycle. Considering that the vast majority of settlements/space-stations don't really NEED to operate on their local planet/asteroid's time, and you'll be indoors anyway (you can dim/brighten the lights to match a normal day/night cycle), this shouldn't be that difficult or inconvenient.</p>
<p>As a note, even &quot;Space Farmers&quot; won't really need to synchronize with the local day/night cycle. We've shown that in vertical farms (basically hydroponics farms where EVERY variable is tightly controlled, from the humidity of the air to the specific frequency, strength, and time the grow-lights are on) you can achieve ridiculous efficiency, both in terms of grow-time and resource use. So, the farmers won't even care about exposing their plants to sunlight directly.</p>
<p>That said, the research on this has only just begun really where there are two notable studies. One from ~40 years ago or so which said &quot;Everything should be fine!&quot; but has long been criticized as not being properly done, and a relatively recent one which implied the health/mind issues. So, more research into extended/contracted sleep/wake cycles is clearly needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A “Universal Time” within a solar system can only be as fine grained as relativistic effects permit. Time runs at different rates in different frames of reference according to speed, acceleration and gravitational fields. You might not notice the effects at scales of a second or more, but the atomic clocks on GPS satellites run faster than the same clock on Earth and adjustments are continuously made to cater for it.</p>
<p>Beyond a solar system you can’t really begin to construct a universal time. You can only really talk about how time is moving within particular frames of reference compared to one another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to relativity the concept of &quot;Now&quot; becomes fuzzier and fuzzier the further apart things are (edit: or the faster and direction they are moving.  Distance amplifies the effect.)</p>
<p>Relative movement means events A and B that appear simultaneous in one frame-of-reference can be A before B or B before A from other frames of reference.</p>
<p>And it's not that they <em>appear</em> to occur in a different order and &quot;in reality&quot; there's some universal &quot;true time&quot;, the events <em>actually</em> occur in a different order for different people in different frames of reference (ie distances and movement).  No one person can say they are experiencing the &quot;true&quot; event order.  It's all... relative.</p>
<p>Relativity is a serious mindfuck.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the idea they use in The Expanse, where ships in a certain area run on the time of whatever the major port there is. Or whatever time they need to run on to do business, e.g. ice haulers dropping shipments off at Ceres probably run on Ceres time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ISS officially stays on UTC, but depending on the activity, and which side it is being done out of, they will adjust accordingly. If it's a progress arrival, soyuz arrival, or a spacewalk out of the Russian part of the station, the involved crew will shift to Moscow time. If it's something being done out of the US segment, they'll slide to Houston time.</p></div>		</li>
