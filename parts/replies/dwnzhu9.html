<p>Don't know the specific numbers, but even a class 1 near IR laser is visible as a faint reddish dot. I remember reading the human eye is responsive to IR to somewhere around 1200nm - though only under 1000nm with class 1 power lasers.</p>

<p>Edit: commented to the use of your word unlucky, which I guess could mean you are in a bad bad situation with lead incoming soon, or that you will lose eyesight which (for a short exposure, to be safe here) wouldn't be the case with class 1 lasers.</p></div>		</li>
