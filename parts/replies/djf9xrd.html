			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much it; your references validate your existence. If I have a relationship with people at the company you're providing as a reference then I can usually find someone I know there and get a real reference. Beyond that it's a crap shoot. </p>
<p>I've offered myself up as a reference loads of times and have only been called back a hand full of times. I'm called back perhaps 5-10% of the time even if my previous employee has used me as their primary reference. </p>
<p>Take this with a grain of salt however. I live in Vancouver, BC and we're fairly progressive. In more traditional places I'm sure references are more important.</p>
<p>Edit: In 15 years I've had 1 reference check that's resulted in a hire. The rest of the time it's had absolutely no positive or negative affects. &quot;Did they work with you? Are they good? Why did they leave? Anything else?&quot; Then they tick yes on a box marked &quot;are they a real person&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting chance is that I'm also asked for references to work in Vancouver, so this is relevant, thanks. However here's a thing about the traditional places. The reason I asked is because references are pretty much non-existent in Russia (or they used to be in my circles). We have an &quot;official employment record&quot; which more or less replaces them, because reasons for leaving your previous places are all on record. And also HR is required by law to provide a statement that you worked on such position for such dates. But lots of people work without record for tax evasion, like working on record is seriously considered a benefit. In this case they won't give you anything and won't admit they know you. So usually nobody bothers asking. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In fact, they may say nice things about you to help get you a job because they don't want you knocking on their door again.</p>

<p>Companies also give false positive references so they gain a reputation of being a place where you can be fired and still land on your feet.  Also, may employees leave and stay within the industry (and rightfully ignore any and all non-compete agreements): giving a good reference to a crap employee is a great way to sandbag your competitors.</p></div>		</li>
