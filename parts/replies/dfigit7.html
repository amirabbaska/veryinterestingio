<p>So in principle, a small procedure entering the jugular could open a highway to all your cortical neurons.</p>

<p>In principle indeed. An artificial connection through the blood brain barrier would probably pose a huge risk. Not to mention the material properties required to make such a device practical. It would need the right biocompatibility, flexibility, tensile/compressive strength,  and should be able to be easily replaced to name a few. Preferably it should also grow with a body as it grows older.</p>
<p>But who knows what will be possible some decades from now..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I see a huge array of barriers and complications to be overcome for anything like Musk has described to be achieved in reality. However, he has an impressive record and you never know when the next great leap is going to come.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem like you've given this some thought.  If what Elon musk proposes is possible, which it likely is since a human being conceived it, it would change mankind wouldn't it?  It would give man instant access and instant far reaching ability without the need to expend much physical energy or effort.  I don't know that we as a species are ready to deal with a reality created by giving that kind of power to common man.  I'd be interested in hearing thoughts on what that reality would look, feel, and be like. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to pin down precisely, because the technology to do this isn't even in its infancy - it's really far off (though that's not to say that we can't get to a place that's far off if we move fast enough in the right direction). Things that might be true of that kind of world:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You could have a bulk record of sensory information backed up to the cloud and relive a moment in perfect detail. This means any encounter with police, a sexual partner, or stranger in the street, could be recorded and shared for anyone to live through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather than having instant access to Google to ask it a question with a thought, you could have cloud access to whole databases as easily accessible as your own memories. With a moment's thought, you would summon any fact from Wikipedia as easily as you could remember what you had for breakfast yesterday from your own personal memories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information security would be terrifyingly important, as your own mind could be hacked into and exploited. An attacker might make you wake up in the middle of the night with false memories that your spouse turned into a zombie and is trying to kill you, forcing you to kill them in self defence.</p>
</li>
<li>Similarly there may be people willing to have other people control them by livestreaming thoughts from person A's mind to person B's body. Couples could switch bodies with one another for fun. Armies may be populated with soldiers controlled in part by AI which can synchronise the movements of 20 men in a way that would be impossible for 20 individuals to achieve.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mind boggles to think of the ultimate possibilities of the kind of neural interface that Musk is hoping to bring about, but it should be remembered that the technology is very theoretical at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could virtually give you instant access to any information (as fast as the internet can go). What this does if I understand it right is to replace our input system (typing on a computer) and output system (reding the result of our google search). So you would input a google search only by thinking of it and google would put the result directly into your head. (It'll probably not work like that but just to give you an idee of what it can do)</p>
<p>I have seen video about people puting low radioactive metal inside their finger tip and this would allow them to feel radio frenquency. In the same order, I've seen people installing screen under/replacing their skin on their arm and getting blood pressure, hearth rate, ... through this device.</p>
<p>What he's proposing seems ridiculously crazy but it can be done in a not so distent future.</p></div>		</li>
