<p>Thanks for the response, I learned something today :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This part of physics is a bit beyond me, but the problem is &quot;how do we accelerate the rocket?&quot; This requires doing work, which requires energy.</p>
<p>Every energy source we have now requires mass. We initiate either a chemical reaction (liquid and solid fuel) and expel the oxidized resultant, or a nuclear reaction. Both require putting fuel mass on the rocket, and that mass must be accelerated at least partway to the destination along with the rocket and payload.</p>
<p>Other posts here have talked about beaming energy to the rocket. For example, shooting microwave radiation between two towers with dishes is a real thing, but inefficient. Rockets need a <em>lot</em> of energy - that is a lot of mass, and we need to accelerate far faster than we can imagine. We talk about 10km/s in this context but the human brain cannot truly grasp that. Nothing we see travels that fast close enough to our point of view for it to make sense. Our atmosphere won't allow it in practice. What this means is we need to take something heavy and apply so much energy to it that it travels faster than we can comprehend. Faster than a supersonic fighter jet. Faster than the SR-71 was capable of.</p>
<p>Since we don't have a massless energy source and no current technology to &quot;beam&quot; the vast quantity of energy required, we will be using chemical rockets to launch from Earth's surface to space for the foreseeable future. Maybe someday we will invent an energy source like a warp drive that can produce vast amounts of energy from relatively tiny quantities of mass, coupled with a rocket motor capable of converting that energy to thrust. If so, it will probably be after all of us leave this planet the usual way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense...I just think of all of the sci-fi movies and shows and the ones that show it seem to have some kind of reactor rather than like an engine haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>another important thing to to consider is that rockets dont consume energy to produce thrust, they consume <em>mass</em>. when you sit on a rolling chair and push someone else on a rolling chair, you both move away from each other, at varying speeds depending on your relative masses. all methods of locomotion rely on this. your car uses wheels to push the earth back slightly and itself forwards. jet engines grab the air in front of them and throw it out backwards really fast. since rockets must traverse a vacuum, they carry all their reaction mass with them in the form of fuel. combustion is merely a method of forcing the fuel out the rear of the rocket at a great velocity in order to push the rocket forwards.</p>
<p>even a massless energy source or efficient energy transfer beam would not allow a rocket to accelerate indefinitely in a vacuum, since it has nothing to use that energy to push off of. there are ways we can make our engines eject their mass at greater velocities, but true massless vacuum propulsion is impossible under out current understanding of physics.</p></div>		</li>
