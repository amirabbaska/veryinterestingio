			<div class="markdown"><p>I once visited a Wat in Thailand where the monks would speak to English speakers about stuff. It was really nice. </p>
<p>I was expecting to be speaking to one monk with a bunch of other Farang, but there were many monks. Only one spoke English and would translate what were talking about to the other monks so they could learn English. It was really neat. I highly recommend visiting Wats that have that program. </p>
<p>I am personally curious about the &quot;family obligation&quot; aspect. I remember hearing that every family is supposed to have a monk in it to help the family transcend. Is that even remotely true or common? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, well. Sort of. There is nothing in any scripture that says a member of your family has to be a monk. But, it is taught that your family gets oodles of good karma if you do ordain. So, there's often an expectation that you ordain, because it's not only good for you, but good for your family too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now is it better that &quot;everyone should for a limited time&quot; or is it better to have one devout monk family member who spends their entire life as a monk? </p>
<p>Obviously both is best, but I'm curious which is better for the family Karma. Again, Thank you for the response. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, though this seems very chaste, in Buddhism, being a monk isn't necessarily a lifelong commitment like in Christianity. Yes, many monks remain monks their entire life, but it's also common for people to be monks only for a short time. In Christianity, quitting your vows is sort of like betraying God, but in Buddhism it's common and practiced. part of the &quot;middle path&quot; thing. Buddhism is meant to improve your life, and sometimes that means just being a monk for a year or so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly correct on Christianity. I can only speak for Catholicism since I don't know Orthodox monastic rules (though I imagine it's somewhat similar) and Protestant monasticism almost does not exist. You can be released from temporary vows as a novice without a problem, though being released from permanent vows is trickier. It's not &quot;like betraying God&quot; unless you abandon your vows without permission. Numerous people have entered and left monasteries without going to Hell over it.</p>
<p>There are also oblates, people who are attached to monasteries as lay members who attend services with the monks and such but don't live there and can have families, etc. but live in the spirit of a monk.</p>
<p>There are also third orders, where you become a full member of, say, the Franciscans, where you follow the Rule of St. Francis but you don't live in a friary or follow the exact same disciplines. You can be married, for example, there are some Franciscan saints who were married lay members.</p>
<p>Catholic religious/monastic life is extremely misunderstood by people outside of the Church.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some monasteries specialize in this. In Russia, some even provide a sort of rehab for heroin addicts. Community, hard work, holy communion and prayer is the programme, and of course, no obligation to become a monastic!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. And similarly, you could be required to live as a guest like this for years before taking vows, even if you are pretty sure of your commitment. Depends on the tradition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>if you're interested in reading about this sort of thing, I recommend a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Empty-Mirror-Experiences-Monastery/dp/0312207743" target="_blank">The Empty Mirror</a>. it's not a long read but I thougth it was a very nice one.</p>
<p>what actually made me pick this one up is a story the author tells about a monk who spent the whole day raking the zen garden, when the master walks by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Isn’t it beautiful,' the priest asked the master.</p>
<p>The master nodded. 'Yes...your garden is beautiful; but there is something missing..'</p>
<p>The old gentleman walked slowly to a tree growing in the center of a harmonious rock and moss combination. It was autumn and the leaves were dying. All the master had to do was shake the tree a little and the garden was full of leaves again, spread out in haphazard patterns.</p>
<p>'That's what it needed,' the master said.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend and I randomly started taking meditation classes one weekend. I went home, he stayed in the area and became a Buddhist monk. I wouldn't say this is 100% true for everywhere, but in the states they'd likely ask you to just start taking meditation classes. You probably can't be a tourist monk who shows up with the clothes on their back and wants to be supported by the temple for 2 years. Not because they'd judge you, all living beings that are drawn to the Buddha can improve their karma. </p>
<p>But because it's not practical. Show you're actually committed. Take classes for a few years, finish the first course of advanced meditation classes, then express interest in becoming a monk once you really know what that means.</p>
<p>There's no red tape, there's just a finite amount of resources and some person they've never met probably isn't going to get the lion's share of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would depend a lot on the sect/type of buddhist temple. Buddhism means a lot of different things in America.</p>
<p>I imagine the red tape would more come from the government and whatnot, considering taxes and debt. I often wonder what would happen if, with all my student debt I just trekked it to the nearest monastery, abandoning my home and lifestyle. Though the government can't do much if you don't intend to make any more money (can't take what isn't there), I imagine most monasteries have to conform to certain government regulations.</p>
<p>To be fair though, I wouldn't trust a Buddhist monastery that wouldn't take in a wanderer, assuming that person doesn't violate any Buddhist precepts. But  my ideal buddhism is probably very different from the reality of Buddhism in America. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen many monks of all ages in Thailand sightseeing and taking photos with ipads, smartphones, listening to music with headphones, playing games etc, you said that a bowl for alms is one the few personal items they have but they seem to have more gadgets and toys than I do haha. Can you clarify if that sort of thing is frowned upon and some monks do it anyway,  or is it accepted that a monks lifestyle is not as restricted as it once was? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy. It depends. So, some of the younger monks that you see are Novice Monks, basically teenagers or young men who are spending a year or two as monks. I did this even though I grew up in the US. The point is to learn in depth about Buddhism, learn discipline, and also to gain merit, both for yourself and for your family. Merit is like good karma, the more you amass the closer you are to enlightenment, and even if you don't achieve it this lifetime, the better off you'll be next lifetime. So, for these novices, things can be a little more lax. They also may be abusing loopholes. For example, maybe the abbot (head monk) in charge of their temple said headphones and MP3 players like iphones are okay to use for listening to sermons, but then they get bored and download music or games onto them. </p>
<p>For the older monks, things are more complicated. Depending on the sect, your personal belongings maybe strictly limited to the traditional robes, an alms bowl, and no more. But things get fuzzy when you talk about what <em>the temple</em> owns. So lets say at a rural temple they have a van that goes around to pick up the kids who live far away so they can study at the temple. The temple took in donations in order to buy it. Who's on the title to the car? Typically, it's the temple that's listed as the owner, but it's either the abbot or senior monks who handle administration that bought it. So, does this violate the ban on possessions? Of course not, it's for the temple, and really it only directly benefits the children, the monks don't even use it!</p>
<p>There's lots of things like that, where technically it's temple property. Some monks will travel frequently, so it's convenient to have a cell phone if only so you can call to be picked up from the airport, or whatever. Many sects are very flexible, in that if it helps you teach and spread Buddhism, and doesn't interfere with your path to enlightenment, it's okay. But mostly only for new things, where there isn't tradition or precedent. </p>
<p>Also, many temples are very tech savy. They have laypeople who are very good with technology set up things like podcasts for sermons or discussions. So there may be some reason to have tech toys.</p>
<p>Now, about ipads. Just like there are priests who abuse children, or imams that encourage forced conversion under penalty of death, there are monks who go directly against the tenets of their religion. In this case it's less horrific abuse and more embezzling temple money to buy things for themselves. There's so many cases of temple corruption, all you have to do is google. </p>
<p>So, in short, as long there's a reasonable excuse to have them, most people don't mind, as long as the monks are following the spirit of the Buddha's teachings.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I made an account just to say that one time I volunteered to run a ton of cat6 for a Buddhist temple, because their wifi wasn't super awesome and their phones kept getting interference. Everyone there was super awesome, but I had to wear shoe coverings the entire time. At the end I accidentally stepped outside while wearing them and couldn't go back in again. My boss is Buddhist and was the one who told me about it. I should ask him if theres anymore work that I could do over there, it was pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I went to a temple with a bunch of Thai kids. While one monk lectured the kids on Buddhism, another monk showed me photos of an ordination ceremony on a digital camera. There is lots of communal property (housing, household goods, etc) and from what I saw of Thailand I doubt an iPad is considered any less of a household good than a broom.</p></div>		</li>
