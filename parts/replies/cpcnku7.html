			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that this is not a stable orbit. Normal orbits don't have to be a perfect circle, as when the satellite comes closer to the body it's orbiting, it will accelerate, and when it moves away it will decelerate. However, light moves at c and can't accelerate or decelerate. So, this is only possible at exactly one distance from the black hole's center, and only if the light is at that perfect distance, moving perfectly perpendicular to the center of the black hole. If not, it will either fly away or enter the black hole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought light slowed down when passing through a medium like glass or water? Or was that disproven ages ago? I only remember it from childhood (and I'm sure I'm not confusing it with refraction). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth pointing out at although static black holes don't have stable photon orbits, rotating black holes certainly do.  And since any black hole will pick up angular momentum from the surrounding matter, rotating black holes are the more practical solution to consider.</p>
<p>However, since the stable photon orbits of rotating black holes are inside the event horizon it's not something we could ever observe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The bright disc is not orbiting light (we couldn't see it if it were orbiting), it is an accretion disc.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not!? Suppose one could create a very large neutrino gas (hence it does not interact electromagnetically). If the mass-energy density becomes concentrated enough near the center of the gas, for whatever reason, one could theoretically create a photon sphere which is still inside the outer layers of the neutrino gas. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure whether it would be a neutron star or something more exotic, but there are definitely mass distributions that meet your criteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up question to the back-of the head thing. My thoughts can be summarized as: &quot;How close will the back of your head appear?&quot; </p>
<p>Thinking about this question led me to the hypothesis that it will depend on how large this &quot;zone&quot; we're talking about is. The smaller the zone where light can orbit without being sucked into the black hole or launched off into space, the smaller the back of my head will appear. </p>
<p>Secondary to the above question: will my head appear free of optical distortions? How far down my neck/the rest of my body will I be able to see?</p>
<p>I imagine these also are constrained by the size of the light-orbiting zone, but I'm curious if there will be any sort of lateral distortion parallel to the plane of my orbit, because too far on the one side, light will get sucked into the black hole and never make it back to my eye. But too far on the other side, it will escape orbit and also never reach my eye except perhaps at a much wider arc. </p>
<p>Therefore, will the back of my head appear tear-dropped in shape, due to the hard(er) boundary on the side of the event horizon and the soft(er) boundary on the other side?</p>
<p>Edit: reading other comments stating that light will only be able to have one orbit (since it doesn't accelerate nor decelerate) has led me to a modified conclusion/question: won't it then be a single photon-sized spot on the back of my head that I'll be able to see?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For how far away the back of your head would appear, I don't see why it wouldn't just be the circumference of the &quot;line&quot; you're looking along.</p>
<p>And for how <em>much</em> you could see, you'd at least see a line, as it's a photon sphere, not a photon circle. </p>
<p>I would imagine there'd be significant image distortion, but I can't speculate on what form it would take.</p></div>		</li>
