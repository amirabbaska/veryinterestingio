			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the challenges was to describe and organise the data in a way that can be understood and reused by &quot;outsiders&quot;.  </p>
<p>We aim not only at preserving separate &quot;bits&quot; of data, but also enough information to keep the context clear even many years after the data is published.  This means to capture the whole environment: the datasets, the virtual machine platform used to analyse it, the analysis software code, any configuration files, etc with the appropriate documentation.  </p>
<p>The underlying infrastructure hosting the data is using CERN technology called EOS that is managing over 100 PB of disk space in total. <a href="https://eos.web.cern.ch/content/about-eos" target="_blank">https://eos.web.cern.ch/content/about-eos</a></p>
<p>The CERN Open Data portal itself is a customised instance of the Invenio digital library technology. <a href="http://inveniosoftware.org/" target="_blank">http://inveniosoftware.org/</a></p>
<p>The physics analysis examples use CernVM virtual machine technology. <a href="http://cernvm.cern.ch/" target="_blank">http://cernvm.cern.ch/</a></p>

<p>Just in case someone didn't recognize it, 100 PB is 100 petabytes, meaning 100,000 TB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the data cataloguing, most of the metadata come from the Internal CMS Data Aggregation System (DAS) and we adapted them to the Open Data portal metadata schema, which took approximately 8 months. (ad)</p></div>		</li>
