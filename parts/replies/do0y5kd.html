			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, consumes to me means continuous power, so no. An empty die would have more electrons in the cells than a fully written one, by about half. But you wouldn't continuously power the NAND. Otherwise it wouldn't be possible to turn off the device off and keep data. I'd also like to clarify my statement above, I was trying to state that writing more data does not make NAND heavier, but lighter. No idea by how much though.</p>
<p>Edit: it does take a lot more energy to erase a block than to write or read. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, and the voltage is related to charge present in the cell.. Q=C*V so more voltage is more charge, and electrons have mass.</p></div>		</li>
