<p>all the drinking water</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is absolutely nothing compared to other water uses.</p>
<p>An adult person drinks one or two liters per day, compared to fifty liters average for laundry and bathing. And personal use pales compared with agriculture.</p>
<p>That's why outrage about bottled water companies being allowed to buy water from cities are ridiculous. Drinking water is nothing compared to irrigation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, some of the outrage isn't about type of use, it's about where its used, and the fact that it's being sold for profit without any significant recuperation from the local governing body.</p>
<p>I live in Michigan, and so in the Great Lakes watershed.  Any farmer, or even huge farming company, may be using more water than a bottling company, but it's all more or less staying within the watershed.  Any water that isn't absorbed by crops is just going back to the source.  In contrast, Nestle and the rest are taking that water, bottling it up, and shipping it across the country/globe.  That water is <em>gone</em> from the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>Nestle, Coke, and the rest are then selling that as a product for profit and all they pay, in Michigan at least, is a ~$200 license fee.</p>
<p>Add on the whole &quot;Nestle is evil&quot; thing, or the fact that bottled water is just sort of a ridiculous product in most circumstances anyway, and a lot of the outrage is varying degrees of reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible to really drain the Great Lakes watershed?  I mean, those lakes are the size of seas, and filled with plenty of rain.  If the level of the lakes does drop by a foot or something, won't it just reduce the flow through the St. Lawrence Seaway?</p>
<p>Michigan can worry about contamination of water, sure, but I can't imagine how depletion would be relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate nestle as much as we all do because of there monitization of water on the same token let’s look at how much water Lake Michigan has, and importantly how much evaporates every day</p>
<p>Lake Michigan is 22,300 mi2, or 23.67% of the total surface area of the Great Lakes.
820,000,000,000 gallons of water x 23.67% = </p>
<p>According to information in this study: glisa.umich.edu/media/files/projectreports/GLISA_ProjRep_Lake_Evaporation.pdf</p>
<p>    ... a 1-day loss of 0.5 inches of water from the total surface area of the Great Lakes (94,250 mi2) represents a volumetric flow rate of 820 billion gallons per day</p>
<p>194,094,000,000 gallons or 194 billion (that's billion with a b) of water evaporates from Lake Michigan every day during the fall months when the water is warmer than the air (the highest amount of evaporation of the year occurs in the fall).</p>
<p>Stolen from HardOcp talking about foxconn getting approval to take 7millions gallons of water daily from Lake Michigan </p></div>		</li>
