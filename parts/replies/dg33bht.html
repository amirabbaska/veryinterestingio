			<div class="markdown"><p>Most is actually from ocean plants called phytoplankton (think algae). </p>
<p>Numbers vary from 50% - 85% because it's impossible to calculate.</p>
<p>Also some are trying to create essentially algae farms for 2 reason. Certain types of algae are very healthy to eat and they are great at taking CO2 out of the atmosphere along with producing oxygen. </p></div>		</li>

<p>All those exist in places without coral reefs from my understanding. Are there any commercially eaten fish that would disappear without a reef?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>phytoplankton produce oxygen. There used to be much more, but warming oceans have killed off populations. So, it was closer to 80-90% of our oxygen before the 1900s.</p></div>		</li>
