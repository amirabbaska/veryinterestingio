			<div class="markdown"><p>So now onto the big question - how the hell is GTA V so accurate?</p>
<p>I went to LA for the first time, a year ago. I had never been there, before.</p>
<p>... But damn if I didn't know exactly how to get to the boardwalk with the amusement park on it, once I got to that hill that I always went down, on my way to the mask store.</p>
<p>My GF at the time didn't understand why I turned the GPS off. Or how I got us to where we needed to go. </p>
<p>But my man Franklin totally understood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or why you ran all the red lights.  Or why you drove on the wrong side of the road.  Or why you murdered a hooker.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or why he spun around in circles a few times and then a tank dropped right in front of him and he proceeded to use it to run from the police and military for the next hour as he racked up hundreds of innocent civilian casualties. And then all she had to do was pick him up at the hospital after a couple hours and he was all good to go sans a few hundred bucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, the development team spent several weeks touring the greater LA area to get a “feel” for how the whole region flowed. They took key elements (like the beach, airport etc) and recreated them as best they could. Each team worked on a different landmark, and then after they blended them together in closer proximity so you didn’t have to actually drive for 3-6 hours to get to the inland desert etc</p>
<p>There’s got to be an article out there somewhere....I’m too lazy to find it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read once that a man played <em>L.A. Noire</em> with his father who lived in LA in the late forties and he was surprised how accurate his dad said it was. Only a few churches and big buildings were moved a few blocks, he said. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>here’s something interesting: remember the fuselage that was showed at LAX in GTA V? the broken down airplane. that actually existed there about 8-10 years ago. it was a 767 that blew its engine during diagnostic testing. it has long been scrapped but it was cool seeing it in game when I had actually seen it in person at work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guys, the marketing and dev budget for GTA V was $265M. I repeat: TWOHUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION, which is more than a quarter of a billion USD. They had all the resources in the world to make this game, more than many/most high calibre Hollywood movies. I learned they literally actually &quot;scanned&quot; LA and the landscape to get it into digital format.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way god intended. Id gladly skip another big budget hollywood film or two for GTA VI. Although i probably wont buy unless they tone down the Overcharging of in game currency to promote microtransactions and improve their servers</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep, they did. That is what I have found from a quick Google search. Pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this should be top comment.</p>
<p>Game design isn't like film, no matter how hard we wish that analogy to be true. It's not a clean, reliable, easily taught production line of scripting/casting/storyboarding -&gt; filming for two to eight weeks -&gt; editing for half a year or more -&gt; distribution.</p>
<p>Game design is more like having an idea while taking a dump -&gt; write the script overview on a sticky note -&gt; film it with cardboard props on a weekend -&gt; retakes for one or two or three years -&gt; two weeks of intensive editing -&gt; distribution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah best way I can describe it is organized chaos. Not as much chaos maybe for larger teams/companies. Being on a small/er puts more on each person and it feels like a lot of jumping around between parts of the development. I haven't made an open world but the process of making games is similar in general. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Software dev would be a lot less chaotic if people were in the habit of writing out plans before hand, figuring out how to solve their problem and how to structure the solution. A lot of craziness can be avoided if you treat it like architecture and you write blueprints beforehand.</p>
<p>There's a reason people were able to make some crazy complex shit is really low languages. You look at some of those older devs work and they have binders of notes and plans and proofs and shit like that.</p>
<p>Edit: agile doesnt mean abandon all forms of planning software architecture. Even with single sprint features it's good to sit down and draw it out and ask a senior if your design makes sense, especially if it involves changes to database schemas or design patterns that might be difficult to refactor later</p></div>		</li>
