			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's both.  Your body is also exhausted (assuming you actually exerted yourself physically during the day).  But physical exhaustion requires rest, not necessarily sleep.  If you sat on the couch for 8 hours watching TV, that'd be enough to physically replenish your body (repair your muscles and so forth).  But your brain would still be &quot;muddied&quot;.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd actually debate this one part.  Tissue regrowth seems to happen more when you sleep.  Thus while people in growth stages (babies, teenagers) sleep more.  </p>
<p>one of the unwritten rules of weightlifting, if you expect to make gains, you better be getting your 8 hours of sleep.  After all, when your muscles &quot;get big&quot; its literally asking your body to grow new tissue.  (Just googled it.  apparently sleep has a positive effect on the release of growth hormone)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little bit, yeah.  After one night without sleep, you'll have less ability to stay focused on a task (like taking a test), less innovative in any solutions you have to improvise, and your brain will have to work harder to use logical reasoning or remember things.  </p>
<p>A single night without sleep isn't <em>that</em> bad on your brain, though you will likely take the test more slowly and feel more mentally worn-out afterwards than if you'd gotten a proper night's sleep.  If you pull more than one all-nighter in a row, though, or go multiple nights with only a few hours' sleep, the cognitive problems will worsen dramatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add, as a suffering insomniac, it's something that your brain can slightly adjust to. You get use to less sleep and learn to function.</p>
<p>BUT, and this is a massive addenda, you learn to function with less sleep, but you can't function with none after a certain length. The longest I've gone is 5 days on about 4 hours of sleep. You stop being able to think, you lose quite a lot of reasoning ability, and all patience is shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not.  It probably would, though, knowing how complicated biology tends to be.  There are almost certainly more reasons that your brain needs sleep than just a CSF flush.</p>
<p>Brain science is still in its infancy; there's <em>so much</em> that we don't know about the brain.  We didn't even know about the CSF-flushing thing until 2012.  Maybe a few decades from now we'll have a better answer to your question.</p></div>		</li>
