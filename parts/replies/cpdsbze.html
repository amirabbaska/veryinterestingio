<p>If you delegate drafting bills to a committee then why does it matter if they do it in secret or not? Can anyone interfere with the committee's work?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, pretty much, although obviously he's got to get a majority of the committee members to agree with him.  (Each committee has X members from each party, BTW, but the head of the committee is always from the majority party.)</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Because if word gets out that the majority party is  letting popular bills languish in committee, the majority may end up as the minority after the next election.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The party leaders in the House and Senate could lean on the committee members.  So could the President, or any of their constituents.  </p>
<p>This is why being head of a committee, or even being on it, is a big deal.  You get to kill bills before they've even progressed from zygote to fetus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a step between the first and second steps where congresscritters will meet with other congresscritters to try to get them to vote for a bill. Which often ends up adding unrelated parts ( often called pork ) to a bill.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The public needs to choose whether they'd rather get things done, or have well-written efficient bills that don't get passed. </p></div>		</li>
