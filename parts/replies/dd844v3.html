			<div class="markdown"><p>The lens would be relatively flat and focus on far objects. This is the reason why people get Presbyopia (old age long-sightedness): the cilliary muscles gradually lose they function to stack up muscle fibers and as such push the lens into its round close-focussing shape. The eye tends to stay in its rested state.</p>
<p>Don't confuse this with myopia (short-sightedness) and hyperopia (far-sightedness), which are caused by the shape of the eyeball and don't have anything to do with your lens/cilliary-muscles. As you can see, these are different things, which is the reason why there's no such thing as correcting your myopia (eyeball shape) with just getting old and suffering presbyopia (losing ability to focus on close objects)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can unfocus my eyes at will, but it does give me a headache if I do it too many times or hold it for a long time. Normal? I use it when I need to find a word in a wall of text. Somehow by unfocusing my eyes but focusing in on the word in my head my ability for pattern recognition goes up. Really handy reading 1000 page documents for the 5 times a clause is referenced.</p></div>		</li>
