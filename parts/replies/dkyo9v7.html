			<div class="markdown"><p>But OP's question doesn't ask how it developed &quot;on purpose&quot;. They asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If humans have evolved to have hair on their head...</p>

<p>Which is a perfectly acceptable phrasing since it only states they evolved, not with &quot;purpose&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, but humans still have hair all over their bodies - most of it is fine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellus_hair" target="_blank">vellus hair</a> that hasn't been thickened into terminal hair by exposure to androgens. Mutations may cause this hair to become terminal, leading to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirsutism" target="_blank">hirsutism</a>. Cases may vary from slightly more abundant in atypical locations, such as <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8320/29938596615_30e72299e6_b.jpg" target="_blank">facial and arm hair in women</a>. More extreme cases present as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrichosis" target="_blank">Hypertrichosis</a>, and may involve complete body coverage (e.g. <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/bd/4a/a5/bd4aa5cbe691f335d2f1ea335ec614c7.jpg" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/bd/4a/a5/bd4aa5cbe691f335d2f1ea335ec614c7.jpg" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?biw=1920&amp;bih=916&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=Hypertrichosis&amp;oq=Hypertrichosis&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l4.3881.3881.0.5098.1.1.0.0.0.0.109.109.0j1.1.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.109.j2w-CCNLwQw#imgrc=_" target="_blank">etc</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have evolved to have longer hair on our heads than other primates, and in the case of men, often a higher density of hair on faces. That facial hair is also commonly thicker than other primate hair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the most perplexing things about human evolution. The only other mammals to have gone hairless are either aquatic, burrowers, or animals that have a lot of fat and size, and the only ones that go hairless except for some bits on their head and face are aquatic. </p>
<p>Nobody knows and it's pretty weird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but it's also not ideal to assume there isn't an advantage as well, just because we can't think of it.  It may be that there is some advantage or was in the past.  </p>
<p>It's also worth noting that as with anything that happens to men after child rearing age, evolution is way less active. Evolution (even the anthropomorphic kind) doesn't much care about you after you breed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a sex linked expression from the mother's genetic lineage, there's a good chance it offered no direct advantage in survival.  However I recall reading somewhere that it signaled to females that the male was ready to mate and start a family and so it wasn't a useful survival adaptation so much as a social one.  I don't think we can look at human traits as just &quot;what's good for survival&quot; because we are much more social animals than solitary ones.</p>
<p>Baldness happens between 20-40 in most men, so, well within prime child rearing ages.</p></div>		</li>
