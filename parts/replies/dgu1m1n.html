			<div class="markdown"><p>5G is a going to be a slippery slope. AT&amp;T just pulled what they did calling HSPA+ a 4G network; they are marketing a 5G network that is just another LTE rollout. It was front page sometime this week.  There's what 5G is intended to be and then there's what will happen through various industry shenanigans. </p>
<p>Edit: BTW the standards &amp; chipset guys HATED when AT&amp;T did this with 4G...but at the same time it got things moving and got people's attention. Hence, slippery slope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think we can bank on any dramatic technology changes for the Winter 2018 roll out, but I sure can't wait to see what we can do for mmWave infrastructure. I think the only things being talked about sub-6 are massive mimo, full duplex, and coexistence.</p></div>		</li>
