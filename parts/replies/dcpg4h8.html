			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, spontaneous congenital defects or anomalies are more likely to stem from the egg rather than the sperm, as sperm are in constant production from the time a boy reaches puberty and so are more susceptible to acute genetically disruptive factors. Eggs in the ovum are in in suspended meiosis from birth, and only an incredibly small fraction ever get to metaphase II (ovulation), allowing for a much longer time for eggs to have transcription, duplication, or other errors.</p>
<p>But, I agree wholeheartedly with this commenter. In statistical gamut of in vivo fertilization, you can only get an idea of risk of defect. The only way to test gametes would be in vitro fertilization, but even that could lead to spontaneous defects after fertilization.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that mutations are more common in sperm cells, rather than the egg.  Since they are constantly being reproduced there's more chances for transcription errors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but then arent there more chances for there to NOT be transcription errors?</p>
<p>...i hate math</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically transcription errors wouldn't be much of a problem. Replication errors are the real problems. If there is a transcription error when making RNA then usually that just won't produce a good protein and another produced transcript would make a good protein.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sperm have a higher rate of mutation, comparatively, because of the rate of production and lifespan of sperms, but especially looking at fertilization I think genetically abnormal sperm have mobility issues or compromised acrosomal reactions to prevent them fertilizing the egg. Maybe abnormal sperm that complete fertilization either meet an egg that is closer to the uterine cavity, or other sperm have already initiated but not completed the acrosomal reaction? I recall in my genetics class (albeit in 2009) that the majority of live birth deliveries with genetic defect are replication errors after fertilization or due to existing defect in the ovum. Something like 9:1 ovum:sperm abnormality is what I recall. Will do more research this evening to support! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I read that point mutations are more likely to [occur in the sperm] (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/17/science/genetic-mutations-tied-to-father-in-most-cases.html" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/17/science/genetic-mutations-tied-to-father-in-most-cases.html</a>). Chromosomal mutations (such as Down syndrome) are more likely to occur in eggs. You are correct in that age does increase the likelihood of mutations in both cells. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that oocyte meiosis II only completes <em>after</em> the sperm has penetrated the egg, so nondisjunction occurring during anaphase II would not be caught if you were only looking at the gametes separately.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are so many opportunities for things to go wrong after fertilization! Two perfectly healthy gametes can result in a baby with abnormalities due to something not happening at the right time, environmental factors, or just plain poor statistics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, during spermatogenesis the primary cell completes both meiosis I and meiosis II. The product of meiosis II in males is  four haploid spermatid cells, which then elongate and develop into mature sperm cells. Nondisjunction can occur during either meiotic division, creating sperm (or egg) with too few or too many chromosomes. If that sperm fertilizes an egg, it will result in an embryo with chromosomal abnormalities. Also, a Sperm Aneuploidy Test can check a sperm sample for chromosomal abnormalities before fertilization if you are going the IVF route. Embryos can also be tested for these abnormalities before implantation. </p>
