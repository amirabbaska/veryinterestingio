			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering this too. I wonder if it has anything to do with babies relying on milk from birth. If you've ever had a baby, you know you are never supposed to give them a bottle of milk to go to bed because the milk will sit on their teeth and cause decay. If you've ever had a baby, you also know that the easiest and most effective way to get them to sleep is usually milk. </p>
<p>I imagine that back in cave days, mothers would nurse their babies and toddlers to sleep all night long (obviously with no toothbrushing afterwards). This would start to cause decay after 3 or 4 years, which is probably when the children would naturally wean anyway. I wonder if their adult teeth came in just in time for their baby teeth, also sometimes called &quot;milk teeth&quot;, to decay. An adult caveman diet would not have any milk or other sugar-dense foods, so decay wouldn't be as big of an issue. </p></div>		</li>
