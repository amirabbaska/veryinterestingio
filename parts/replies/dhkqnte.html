This causes your dog to die while on the leash while an adult can walk safely. You should leave your children outside too. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Story time.</p>
<p>This actually reminds of that time I traveled to the outskirts of Bangkok to see a small shrine dedicated to Buddha. The shrine was build into a small mountain cave, and sat just by the entrance of it.
I ventured deeper into the cave and at the end of it, I noticed that my heart rate was going up quickly. Sweating and breathing got more intense, with every breath getting heavier and less satisfying.  So with all the symptoms, I realized something was wrong with the air so I ran out fast with extremely fatigued legs. Remembering that place, I did notice how air tasted tangy and metallic although I can't precisely determine which gas was in excess concentrations there (CO2 maybe?) </p>
<p>edit: the shrine was rather small, by a river and a village. I reached it by crossing a bridge with train tracks.</p></div>		</li>

I wore one of <a href="https://www.pksafety.com/bw-hw-gas-alert-clip-extreme-h2s-monitor.html" target="_blank">these</a> when working underground (and often above ground as well) because it could overtake you before you could get a good whiff of it.</p></div>		</li>
