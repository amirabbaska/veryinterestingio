			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really bad answer. Once the second crayon dealer realizes he can sell all of his crayons by selling them for $2.90 he will. Gas is really important so the price will not reflect the market value, but prices will drop over time.</p>
<p>The reason gas prices are high at the moment are far more simple. It takes a little while for oil to go from the ground to refineries to the pump. If oil remains at $40 a barrell, then we can expect gas prices to slowly drop. As gas companies will be selling the gas from the oil which they purchased $40 instead of the gas they purchased for $70.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you got it slightly more correct than the original post, your combined responses do not cover all of the bases. There are a ton of factors, but I'll cover one of them in a bit more detail here. The prices you see at the pump do correlate fairly well with the current economics in play in relation to crude oil and gasoline. There are several things at play here. One is that crude oil and gasoline are two different products and are therefore not linearly correlated in price. The other is that the price of both is affected by both the supply and demand of the product. </p>
<p>The reason why crude oil prices are low is because there is currently an oversupply of crude oil. Crude oil is near useless without being processed through a refinery. However, there is a finite number of refineries. Therefore, while supply increases, demand stays the same. This causes the lower price of crude oil. </p>
<p>Gasoline is a byproduct of refining crude oil. This, in and of itself, means that gasoline prices can only really fall so far due to the significant costs associated with refining. Also keep in mind that refineries produce MANY different products. Not just gasoline. Also diesel, kerosene, asphalt, petroleum jelly, fuel oils, etc... All of these must be factored into the equation so it is not really a fully linearly proportional relationship considering. </p>
<p>However, one of the biggest contributors right now to the lack of drop in gasoline prices is because SUPPLY of GASOLINE is down relative to the demand despite there being an oversupply of crude oil. This is because several rather large refineries are currently being repaired and are not running right now. Because demand has stayed the same and/or increased slightly, supply has gone down. Economics, in this case, dictates a RISE in gas prices. The greater margin between the demand for gasoline to the current supply results in greater profit margins over a smaller volume of product. This offsets quite a bit of the reduction in crude oil prices that you see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also need to factor in that a lot of distributors buy gas or oil at a hedged value many months in advance. So they pay one price no matter how the crude fluctuates. This works when oil is on an upward trend like it was early last year, but doesn't when it drops massively like it did.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oil prices have been low for months now.</p>
<p>The real reason is that refining capacity does not track crude production capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is retarded and not close to reality. </p>
<p>California is expensive because they run a very special (expensive) blend of fuel that is only made at certain refineries and they need to get paid extra to compensate making a product they can't sell anywhere. Making your problem worse  there has only been one refinery built in the US since the early 80's. Refinery capacity utilization is running at record rates and many refineries have even deferred maintenance because of the current high margins in the refining business. </p>
<p>So what normally happens is, there is an oil glut. Oil prices go down. It is cheaper for refineries to make fuel. They make good money for a bit, but eventually they all compete away the margin because they have more refinery capacity than demand for gasoline. End result, gas tracks oil prices. </p>
<p>In the current game. The refineries are selling every single barrel they can make. They have no reason to cut gasoline prices because that would only increase demand they can't fill. There is too much oil so prices sink. The refineries margin goes up and has been at a record high for most of the year. Refineries are extremely expensive to build and the new regulations make it extremely unfavourable to build. </p>
<p>Oil producers are losing money badly, as they have made huge capital investments into production and now there is no revenue to sustain operations. Oil refining companies (marathon, Val√©ro, etc) are making bank. Integrated companies are doing poor to ok.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most states do. In PA it is high as well, because it is (supposed to be) used to maintain the roads, which are constantly in disrepair because PA is the trucking hub of the east coast. It's in the 30c range as well. I find it funny, because as much as people blame oil companies for being greedy and price gouging, the state takes just as much if not more profit per gallon than the companies do (then again it's split between refinery, transport and drilling)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because people want to circlejerk about how rich people are bad and Cali is made up of all rich people and corporations are bad and all they want is money and corporate greed and aaaahhhhhh!</p>
<p>Yes parts of Cali are more expensive than others because we can afford it, but on the whole this is not the reason Cali gas is higher. I guess it's truly a Californian thing to know why our air doesn't look like China's anymore...</p></div>		</li>

<p>The question itself is just a loaded question for the forum to vent about how the big scary corporations are evil.  No one wants a real answer and they will refuse to believe it if you give it to them... they'd rather call you a shill.</p></div>		</li>
