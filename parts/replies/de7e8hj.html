			<div class="markdown"><p>So if pi can't be expressed as a ratio of integers, but it is the ratio of a circle's diameter to its circumference, that means that no circle can have a circumference and a diameter that are both rational? Or at least they can't both be terminating decimals?</p></div>		</li>

<p>With the possible exception of a circle with a radius of 0, that is exactly correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always saw this differently, as a circle itself is irrational, or instead, there is no such thing as a circle. In physics, a quark would have a defined size or rational dimensions, and even if you take string theory, the string would have rational dimensions. That also means any orbit would never be a circle and will always be contracting or expanding.</p>
<p>In mathematics, is there anything that relies on a circle being rational?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I'm getting my Ph.D. in math, and it took me longer than I care to admit that c/d = pi and the formula c = pi × d mean exactly the same thing, and that once you know pi is irrational the second equation makes it entirely clear  that one of c or d is irrational.<br />
EDIT: ACK. Longer than I care to admit <em>to realize</em> is what it should be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately, [Johann Heinrich Lambert's] proof requires advanced math we'd rather not get into.</p>

<p>But OP <em>specifically requested</em> that it be explained to a five-year-old!</p>
<p>EDIT: Ok, what's the &quot;explain like I know school maths&quot; version?  Is it something along the lines of &quot;cos(½π)=0, and there's a geometric approximation of cos(), and if you follow that line of thought, you eventually end up with something that can't be explained if π was a fraction?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really tired and my brain is foggy, and I'm also way out of practice with calc, but:</p>
<p>ELI5: I think this tries to come up with an function that has the property of being periodic (something that, when given an input, outputs something that repeats itself after a certain <em>period</em> of time, consistently) under the specific conditions that the input given must be rational. It then goes on to prove that the function doesn't end up being periodic when given an input of pi, therefore by contradiction, pi isn't rational.</p>
<p>The proof of the function not being periodic involves suggesting that the function has no fundamental period. (In other words, for a function to be periodic, the <em>period</em> has to be able to be reduced to a single smallest real number, but no further.) It has no <em>fundamental period</em> because a smaller period can always be found (re: the bit about always being able to generate an <em>arbitrarily smaller</em> and smaller period).</p>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, though. 1940s math lingo is so hard to interpret sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
