			<div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically arbitrary, just like 0 degrees Celsius. There's a reason it was chosen, but mathematically, true &quot;zero&quot; would be absolute zero. Similarly, true &quot;zero&quot; for sound would be 0 pascals. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My house is 20C right now. Taking half of that value as 10C makes no sense. Converting the temperature to Kelvin and dividing by two, <em>could</em> make sense.</p>
<p>I would have described dBHL as being arbitrary since if humans suddenly had better hearing tomorrow, math/science don't change, but our capacity to hear and the scale does.</p>
<p>Fahrenheit is based on frozen sea water and &quot;normal&quot; body temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds pretty arbitrary... Based on some sample of people at some time and averaged. The decision to base it on that isn't based on anything intrinsic to the universe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A decibel scale needs a reference level. The threshold of hearing is a pretty good 0 db point since most measurements relate to human hearing.  20 micro Pascals is the SI equivalent. The Pascal is  kg⋅m^−1 ⋅s^−2</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many things are based on norms.  Arbitrary is the incorrect word to use here.  0 dBHL is a derived norm, therefore based upon a rational and procedural system.  It can be described as normal human hearing because it is based off ANSI specifications which were largely based upon, and continually updated from the entry hearing exams of military personnel.  </p>
<p>dBHL makes an audiogram easy to read, and makes detection of hearing loss simple.  Measuring hearing loss in dBSPL would make a normal audiogram a massive curve and we already deal with doctors failing to understand what normal hearing is with the simple system in place.   </p>
<p>Just because you don't like it, and it isn't based upon some physics based, nicely packaged system does not make it arbitrary.  Hell, even the gram is continually updated because we learn new things.  </p></div>		</li>
