<p>Here is the FBI saying Phone encryption is bad because it makes their job harder.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two sides of the same coin. Though I don't really feel like mobile phones are any safer than computers, and probably less so with as new as they are. </p>
<p>Then again, your personal device is much less the target of an attacker these days. Why steal one person's data when you can hack Google, Home Depot, The DNC, et cetera and get millions of users information?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Encryption works because it makes it hard for everybody to get past it. If the Feds mandated a secret backdoor that they could use, it's only a matter a time before it's discovered. Let's assume the person or group that discovers the backdoor does not have good intentions and does not reveal it. Think of the damage that could be down against a person, corporation or nation.</p>
<p>On a moral level we should defend the rights of those accused of crimes just as much as we should defend the rights of law abiding citizens. Think of the 1st amendment it's not there to protect popular speech but unpopular speech. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with the answer, the logic of &quot;the FBI said it, so it must be true&quot; is unbelievable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope that's not quite what I said. I'm not re-reading my post just at the moment but my meaning was more along the lines of &quot;Even the FBI thinks it's a good idea, and I wouldn't exactly expect them to be on the latest trends'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was thinking. I'm a privacy-conscious person, but after a certain point, it's too burdensome even for me to try to avoid intrusions (as much as it pains me to even say that). </p>
<p>While blocking your PC's mic/camera are trivial and won't interfere too much with a person's routine, most of us would never cover up our phone's cameras and mic, and that phone is with you an inordinate amount of time, especially computer to a laptop or desktop.</p></div>		</li>
