<p>The German V2 rockets used this in WWII</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They even had an <a href="http://www.cdvandt.org/v2__computer.htm" target="_blank">analog computer</a> (The PDF in this link is in German though) to take the gyro and accelerometer data and steer the rocket on to the correct ballistic trajectory. Then it would shut down the engine and it would coast to the target. The residual fuel/LOX also added about 1 ton TNT equivalent explosive to the impact. The two got rammed together at impact. The early V2's used ground radio, a beam rider, but was quickly changed to inertial, due to fear of jamming. The V2 was a very sophisticated design. Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM-65_Atlas#Design" target="_blank">early Atlas missiles</a> also had radio <em>corrected</em> guidance.</p>
<p>There are MARV's, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuverable_reentry_vehicle" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuverable_reentry_vehicle</a></p>

<p>one of the reasons that large nuclear weapons went out of favor after the '50s</p>

<p>The Russian where the last to do this. We quickly had enough accuracy to reduce the size of the warhead. For instance the funny, 3 in line design of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM-65_Atlas" target="_blank">Atlas Missile</a> was because part way into the design process, the national labs (Los Alamos) were able to make the bomb much lighter. The original design had 5 engines, ala Saturn V style. They just cut the blueprint to the 3 inline, to remove the extra 2 engines.</p>
<p>I have also read that because the destruct radius <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/481144.pdf" target="_blank">scales as the cube root of the explosive yield</a>, it is more efficient to use more, smaller warheads than one really big one. Even if you are targeting one place. You would spread them around the target area. There is a &quot;sweet spot&quot; of yield versus number of warheads. I once read it was around 100-300 Kt and not more than 1 Mt.</p>
<p>Edit: added a link (PDF) the cube root scaling factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hoelzer's talk was a fantastic read. Really made me appreciate the amount of genius that went into the rocket science of the day. It was also nice to see that already in 30s, they used Heisenberg's uncertainty principle to describe the behaviour of PIs (like von Braun here), long before phdcomics existed.</p></div>		</li>
