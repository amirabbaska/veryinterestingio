			<div class="markdown"><p>OP is asking about fatty acids, not fatty esters. And saponification is NOT about creating fatty acids, but rather fatty acid <em>salts</em>. Salts are not fats, as you have implied. This is mentioned in your link.</p>
<p>You did get the part about Fight Club right, although their description of the chemistry was more accurate, if less detailed, than yours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was not implying that fats are salt but I can see where I wasn’t being very clear when I suddenly referred to fatty esters without an explanation. OP was asking about fatty acids and this is what I was referring to with my initial sentence. Most of the fatty acids we deal with are in solution and exist in their salt form but again I wasn’t being very clear about that either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What do you think is the difference? Any weak acid is going to have a counter-ion in a neutral/uncharged solution, and that's going to dissociate in solution. Like the making a fuss about protons vs. hydronium ions in water - distinction without difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Way to jump down someone's throat by reading half a sentence and thinking you have enough information to belittle them. As the person said, fatty ester =&gt; fatty acid salt is the process of saponification. Therefore, fatty acids act as soap does; the process of saponification creates sfatty acids. The second sentence in the link the person posted says &quot;soaps are salts of fatty acids&quot;. What part of this was inaccurate?</p></div>		</li>
