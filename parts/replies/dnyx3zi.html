<p>in order to rectify past disadvantages (e.g. slavery, Jim Crow) that have influenced these students to this day.</p>

<p>In the interests of accuracy (and because this is the top post), I think it's important to note this is NOT why University of Texas or the Supreme Court felt that the program was consistent with the Equal Protection clause. UT said, and SCOTUS agreed, that the university has a compelling interest in providing a diverse educational environment for students. That is a permissible reason to discriminate based on race.</p>
<p>If they had asserted only &quot;past disadvantages&quot; argument, I think they lose Justice Kennedy and it ends tied 4-4 (J. Kagan did not take part). The case at least partially turns on Justice Kennedy's personal beliefs about what &quot;equal protection&quot; actually means, which is an important part of the answer to OP's question.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I think your answer was fantastic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What exactly does this mean?  Could an institution have a compelling interest to provide a non-diverse educational environment?  It seems both would be discriminating based on race, one is just more socially acceptable, which doesn't matter in the eyes of the law (but IANAL and don't know much about this).</p></div>		</li>

Makes sense if you look at some of the top schools in California where AA doesn't necessarily exist. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's best answer given limited infos, and there's hypothetical best answer. Strictly speaking, if there can be personal interviews with a large numbers of Supreme Justices, then it would be even better.</p>
<p>&quot;Do they personally see each others as impartial despite disagreements?&quot; If it's a solid yes, then it would be very convincing.</p></div>		</li>
