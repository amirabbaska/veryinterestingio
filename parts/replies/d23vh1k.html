			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  <a href="http://www.cwladis.com/math104/lecture6.php" target="_blank">http://www.cwladis.com/math104/lecture6.php</a> goes into detail about the setup.</p>
<p>For someone's question about what happens if air gets into the iv, little bits of air usually just go and return from the vein to the right side of the heart, then get stuck in the pulmonary arterial system and don't cause any problems. Big bits of air, or if your patient is unlucky and has some sort of heart defect causing blood to go from the right to left side of the heart without passing through the lungs first (shunt), these can go to the arteries supplying blood to important things and block the supply of blood to those organs. The organ we worry most about is the brain. So when taking out a big central line from the neck vein, we put the patients in something called trendelenburg where their feet go up and their head goes down, and we tell them to hum, so if air goes in it goes down and not up.  It apparently also raises the venous pressure above that of atmospheric pressure, thus reducing the risk of air being aspirated.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes at least 20mL of air to cause damage when going into a vein. Any amount of air going into an artery though can cause extensive damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had a both transoesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography with bubbles (agitated saline contrast?  I think that's what it's called).  Anyways laying on my side and I can see the echo monitor with the Tech, Doc has a little pump on the IV he pumps (agitates I guess) and then he injects the saline.  Boom one whole side of the heart foams out for a few beats.  Creepy as all hell but cool as can be.  I think it was first time the cardio doc (fellow) had done one as well because you could tell he was totally having fun and giggling at the screen with me (100% professional don't take that in the wrong way)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably true. The problem is that if they were healthy, why are they in the hospital? :p</p>
<p>For my learning, I've never primed an iv line myself/stuck around to watch it (sorry!) How many cc are in a full line?</p>
<p>Also the first rule of medicine is to do no harm, so it's important to minimize any iatrogenic harm we could do to our patients. </p>
<p>(Something like 10-35% of people have a hole in their heart called a pfo, patent foramen ovale. It's super common, and usually doesn't cause problems. There is a risk of things like blood clots and air bubbles going from the right side of the heart to the left side without going through the lungs. The systemic arterial blood supply is what we worry about the most, because that's things like strokes, spleen or kidney infarcts, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Small air bubbles (or maybe just a small amount of air) is a-okay. In fact, it's used for some treatments. I had to get tested for a potential hole in my heart and they basically put an ultrasound on your chest while at the same time squirt air bubbles in your heart.</p>
<p>It is just about the coolest thing ever because only the air bubbles show up (you don't really see much more than a shadow of the heart, but the bubbles show up as bright white). They go in, ball up together, and then ESPLODE.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nursing school taught me. We had to learn how to calculate the drip rates and everything because someday we might end up without an IV pump. What if the power went out and a plug connected to the generator wasn't available? Or I could end up in a rural hospital deep in Africa with Doctors without Borders or something. So we learned all about infusions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore its a visual confirmation that the IV is patent and actually working. No drips means no flow, means the IV is leaking(infiltrated) outside of the vein and into the extracellular space, is kinked and stopped, or is blocked somewhere else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really necessary when you're using a pump, though. For (homecare) TPN, many times the pharmacist will spike the bag and remove all air from the bag/line for the patient prior to home delivery. I'm on home hydration therapy, and we also remove all air from the entire system, including completely flooding the drip chamber, so that we don't have to worry about air alarms if/when I'm up and mobile and things get turned around the wrong way in my bag. </p>
<p>Of course, when you're running into a central line, you're not concerned about IV infiltration, and the pump will alarm for blockages up or downstream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, a completely run through line would give you no visual indication of speed of administration, or lack thereof.  </p>
<p>Highly important prior to the widespread use of pumps to control rates of fluid administration, and in medical areas where these pumps are not used (such as anaesthesia)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pumps are still used in anesthesia. There is no way I'm calculating a manual drip rate every time I need to change rate. A little drop in blood pressure usually is easy to manage by give a fluid bolus, but that would be obnoxious to do manually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>meh, won't do much unless it's a big &quot;dosage&quot; (50ml or more) or it's injected directly to an arthery (which your average joe wouldn't be able to find anyways) though it could vary from person to person, however I can see how it would be horribly harmful if done a few times, as gas bubbles don't really belong to the blood stream.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, I think this shouldn't be done anyways unless it's a demonstration and it's done under supervision by medical proffesionals</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>people always freak out about bubbles, but what I've been told is that it would take pretty much the entire tubing to be filling with air to create a risk of air embolism. The only reason we were so meticulous about getting all the bubbles out is because patients or their families would panic if they saw a bubble headed into their site. </p></div>		</li>
