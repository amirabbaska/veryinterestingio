			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, some people don't understand terminal velocity. It drives me nuts when people argue about throwing a penny off of a skyscraper to kill someone. The terminal velocity of a penny is not going to even break the skin. It will just sting a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slowing down the impact is important, skydivers are trained to do this, as well as fall on their back.  All of your internal organs are &quot;tied to&quot; your back, so if you fall there's 2 impacts, you hitting the ground and your organs hitting the front of your body (objects in motion...).  So the best way to survive is to make the impact take place over a longer time (think of how a mattress or foam pit slows you down, even if it's only a little bit it's slower than instantaneous and it is linear), and land on your back so that your organs don't become &quot;detached&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would also have a lot to do with how the force is distributed. Our bodys arent static objects. Without tension you could land on a limb which- in reality can take the brute of the force (ultimatly shattering) whichever limb you land on, while takig 90% of force and not allowing much, if any to be distributed to the rest of your body. Youd have a couple completely shattered bones, but aslong as the force isnt shot up your spine or concentrated in the centre of your body you can survive. </p></div>		</li>
