			<div class="markdown"><p>Because true ‘steam’ is invisible - very hot water as a gas. What you see is slightly cooler, with basically flying liquid water - hence, visible. </p>
<p>Your hot wet pot gives off invisible vapours, until you take it off
And then your less hot steamy pot gives off clouds of visible “steam”</p>
<p>Try holding your hand or a glass over the pot and you’ll see condensation from both pots </p>
