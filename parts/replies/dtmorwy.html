			<div class="markdown"><p>And for small drones it does not matter they are not efficient. They are rarely more than a few 100 meters away from the pilot, often much less. You can easily land and call it a day or just put in a new powerpack and fly on.</p>
<p>That is a more pressing issue if you build full-size flying machines that have ranges in the order of 100s of km. A variation of 50% makes a huge difference, also the technology becomes more tricky, as you have four or even engines (and all that goes with them) to tend to instead of just one big one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-induced_drag" target="_blank">induced drag</a>. </p>
<p>The purpose of a wing is to create lift.  In order to do this, the air pressure below the wing is higher than the pressure above the wing. Near the wingtip, the high pressure air from below the wing will flow sideways towards the lower pressure on the upper surface. This creates <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Airplane_vortex_edit.jpg" target="_blank">wingtip vortices</a>.</p>
<p>These wingtip vortices are a significant contribution to the drag on the wing - all the kinetic energy that goes into creating them must come from the wing. If you take a wing and replace it by four wings of 1/4 the size, you now have four times as many wingtips for the same lifting surface, and hence produce more induced drag for the same lift. </p>
<p>For this reason, longer wings are more efficient than shorter ones - which is why gliders (for which the lift/drag ratio is very important), are designed with very long, thin wings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit misleading. Humans CANNOT fly quadrotors. They must be stabilized by computer control. The human then asks the computer to pitch forward, backward or sideways, or to yaw (turn around the vertical axis). These inputs are easy to understand. The computer turns these requests into power output to each rotor many times per second - which a human could not do.</p>
<p>Helicopters CAN be flown directly by humans, though the controls are complex (joystick, rudder, power and blade pitch). It takes practice to be able to do this. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is also misleading. A quad-rotor aircraft could be designed to be mechanically piloted by human input with practice.  </p>
<p>The reason they're not is because of inefficiency of scale economically, practically and physically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you scaled a multicopter to the size of a manned aircraft, a humans reaction time <em>would</em> be sufficient to fly it directly, just like a helicopter. Conversely, if you scale a helicopter down to the size of a small RC model, a human <em>cannot</em> fly it directly, unless it is stabilized by either a flybar (a mechanical gyroscope which helps stabilize the helicopter to a level manageable by a human), or a computer (which does the same by running a control loop, known as a <a href="https://www.rchelicopterfun.com/flybarless.html" target="_blank">flybarless system</a>)</p></div>		</li>
