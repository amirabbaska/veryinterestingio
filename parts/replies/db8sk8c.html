			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all true but in most cases the shipper cares more about on time delivery then the customer.</p>
<p>We deal with time sensitive deliveries every day on custom product. If that package doesnt show up the customer is calling me instantly because most likely their plant cant run until the package shows up. It is then my job to find out what the fuck happened and also compensate the customer so we dont lose their business.</p>
<p>Customers dont take &quot;well the shipping company fucked up&quot; as an answer when they are losing thousands of dollars every minute they are down. </p>
<p>Also trust that the carriers dont give a fuck about the seller, when we call to find out why our package never left the hub for overnight delivery you have to talk to 3 or 4 people before you get a straight answer.</p>
<p>This happened when we used UPS who we dropped because they couldnt deliver next day reliably and now with FEDEX though with many fewer issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work military and we have the same issue. I have a plane that is supposed to be in Afghanistan three weeks ago still sitting waiting for a part. The part left the factory in October. The factory is about 1300 miles away. At this point a horse and buggy would have gotten this plane off sooner. </p></div>		</li>
