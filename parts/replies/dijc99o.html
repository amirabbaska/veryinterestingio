<p>Most large scale operations are gonna stick to some combination of physical filtering, reverse osmosis, ozonation, UV light, and chlorination to treat their water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really done at waste plants. Generally the large masses are settled off then coagulants are added too allow flocculation and settling of the smaller particles. It can have biological treatment to get rid of some nutrients in the water, but mostly chlorine (US), Ozone (Europe), and UV (most places) disinfect the waters to kill the smaller guys. They definitely are not filtering at a bacterial level or using boiling, or reverse osmosis at a medium to large scale place. That would be incredibly inefficient and expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily, giardia cysts and not at the bacterial level in size and things their size are absolutely filtered out physically. As OP said, chlorine is not effective at killing the cysts. And obviously everyone's water is not being boiled at the treatment plant.</p></div>		</li>
