<p>I'd hazard to guess being out of water isn't a particularly pleasant experience for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes, the old &quot;I'm suffocating, this isn't all that pleasant chaps&quot; haha.</p>
<p>You raise a good point on pain and the understanding of how pain is processed by different creatures though. Even amongst humans we have different levels of pain tolerance, so knowing exactly if an Octopus is in pain or it receives the stimuli as being something else (&quot;I'm not in water, I know that's bad&quot;.. rather than &quot;Ow I just stubbed my tentacle on a rock&quot;) is hard to know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know most organisms feel pain, but are you saying that we process pain differently depending on the organism?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Full disclosure: all of my research is with fish and not mollusks.</p>
<p>When it comes to fish, though, it's not thought that air exposure causes pain necessarily, but we have found that handling fish out of the water (not surprisingly) triggers a stress response. If I had to guess I'd imagine prolonged air exposure has a similar effect on octopusses, and it's probably not entirely unlike the sensation you get when you hold your breath for too long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyoneâ€™s side stepping this question. </p>
<p>Octopuses 100% feel pain and I am quite confident in assuming that lack of oxygen would cause them pain. This was highly debated in the mid to late 2000s, and ultimately decided by the UK to classify octopuses as honorary vertebrae. This means that for the sake of vetenary procedures, they must be sedated to protect them from unnecessarily cruel pain. Octopuses are highly intelligent creatures. </p>

<p>I only hope the archetuthus council eventually classifies humans as honorary cephalopods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a radio program I listened to last week I learnt that octopuses can hold some water inside them which helps them breathe on land. Some can survive for about 20 minutes. In some parts of the world there are octopi who live in rock pools and at night they move from rock pool to rock pool by walking over the land.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>James Wood is probably the most down to earth scientist. When I was in high school I emailed him on a whim and got a personal reply with a reading list - the next day. Dude took the time to answer each of my general questions in detail and then encouraged me to read more. </p>
<p>i failed math and science, but had I had a knack for it I definitely would have pursued marine biology. I love cephalopods!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied abroad in Bermuda in College and did a project on squid ink with him. He was wonderful to work with and is truly down to earth. He has a PhD and is a well known cephalopod expert but refuses to be called Doctor and only goes by James. He worked his butt off to make sure my classmate and I got published in a scientific journal when we had statistically significant results.</p>
<p>I ended up not sticking with marine biology and pursued other interests instead but I felt lucky to work with him.</p></div>		</li>
