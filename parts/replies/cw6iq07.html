			<div class="markdown"><p>all other things being equal, muscles increase in strength proportional to the cross sectional area of said tissue. You list seven good other factors but have forgotten perhaps the single most other important factor which is the insertion and origin points. small differences (.5 inches) in origin and insertion points can themselves account for 10-15% differences in strength, all other factors being equal, because <strong>leverage!</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly this is a huge factor for why some muscles are stronger than others, but I don't know whether it accounts for a large effect <em>between individuals</em>. I don't think there is a large difference in insertion points between different people, but I would love to learn more if you have a reference!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is certainly not the case universally.  Professional bodybuilders have extreme muscular hypertrophy, far in excess of strength athetes on the whole - but many are of average strength, and none of them lift anywhere near the levels of Olympic weightlifters and elite powerlifters having far less hypertrophy.  This is also true for drug-free bodybuilders.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is absolutely the case, it is so absolutely the case that it has it's own classification. It's the square law of physics. The key part being &quot;all other things being equal.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I added this. My gut instinct is that the effect size is probably less important than CNS adaptation, technique, and stabilizing muscle strength. </p>
<p>Look at some of the best olympic lifters in the world. These dudes are CRAZY strong but not all of them look absurdly muscular. They probably wouldn't even stand out among a crowd of body builders in a gym, but they have incredible ability to generate just the right power at just the right time with just the right body movements to move incredible amounts of weight. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>CNS adaptation, technique, and stabilizing muscle strength are all valid, but what I was referring to is the actual density of muscle fiber type per muscle. Arbitrary Ex: a quadriceps with 70% type 2 fiber will be able to lift more than a quadriceps with 50% type 2 fiber. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine other large primates would be interesting to look at as far as CNS goes. Chimps aren't particularly massive but ARE massively strong compared to humans. Gorillas have somewhat comparable mass to humans but are a hell of a lot stronger. I wonder what science says about this. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Care to link to any pictures? Because every picture I've seen show guys that are absolutely huge, but often have fat, making their muscles <em>seem</em> less pronounced. They're still very large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a section from an <a href="http://www.strengtheory.com/complete-strength-training-guide/#section2" target="_blank">article</a> on Strengtheory.com:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Type II fibers are more responsive to strength training and grow more than Type I fibers do, so fiber type distribution may limit long-term strength potential somewhat. However, that’s purely theoretical, because research has shown that elite powerlifters (average squat/deadlift of about 285kg/630lbs, and bench 170kg/375lbs) actually have about the same Type I/Type II fiber ratio as untrained people, which leads you to believe the sport itself didn’t select for people with a fiber ratio skewed toward Type II. So it may be a concern for someone with an unusually high proportion of Type I fibers, but it won’t be for the vast majority of people.&quot; </p>
