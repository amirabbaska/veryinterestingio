			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  The salt is eroded off of rocks by rainwater runoff which flows into rivers and then the ocean.  The salt does not build up in the rivers because the water is constantly flowing.  The salt accumulates in the ocean because there is nowhere else for it to go.</p>
<p>You can get the same effect in dry basins with where there is no outlet.  The Great Salt Lake &amp; Dead Sea are salty because rainwater runoff gets stuck there.  Death Valley has dry salt beds.  Those salt beds are created by rainwater runoff which evaporates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely.  I'm sure there's a lot of direct saltification, if I can invent a word, as ocean water  interacts with seabeds and sea shores.  If that were the only factor, the seas would not be as salty as they are.  They would have reached an equilibrium long ago.  However, because salt gets left behind in the evaporation phase of the water cycle, salts and minerals accumulate in the oceans, seas, and salt lakes.  Water leaves pure, and returns slightly salty.  Over the ages, it just builds and builds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They did. </p>

<p>It does not. This assumption led to some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Joly" target="_blank">erroneous attempts to date the Earth in 1899</a>. </p>
<p>There are various outputs of salts from the oceans as well as the river input, which mean that salinity has been stable for a few million years at least. The amounts of individual dissolved ions have changed in proportion to eachother over geological time, though this is more of a subtlety to do with changing rates of certain inputs/outputs and is not necessarily saying that total salinity has increased. </p></div>		</li>
