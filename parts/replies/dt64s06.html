			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. 1-5 digits count exactly like you'd think. When you twist your hand and show your fingers horizontally, that's 6-9. Then for 10-99, same thing, except you start at the forehead...ex: index finger touching forehead, then release from forehead showing 3 more fingers horizontally, that's 13. When you need 100-999, same situation, except you hold your counting arm with your other hand. So for 100, you hold your index finger up, and then you hold that wrist with your other hand. If there are request I'll bust out Ms paint and give you a more accurate representation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So many good memories haha...Blackbuster, Jerky Guy, Jigga selling chart levels.  I’m still convinced I was victim to one of the worst “sharkings” in Bond room history</p>
<p>Unemployment’s too...I still tell people the story of after a particularly busy unemployment when I was still a runner.  I got home and immediately passed out on the couch. I was living with 4 other guys at the time who just had a regular college Friday night all in the same room, drinking beers, ripping tubes, laughing, plying music...they even said they checked once or twice to make sure I was still alive.  Then next morning I woke up and was confined to that couch all day...my legs were pure concrete from the amount of orders I had run all over the place and the amount of stairs I had walked up and down.  The few times I went to the bathroom I had to slide against the wall.</p></div>		</li>
