			<div class="markdown"><p>yep.  plus one to this explanation.  IAA is one of a class of plant hormones called Auxins which, among other things, promote cell elongation.  If you express that hormone highly on one side of a cell, it elongates more on that side and effectively steers away, allowing a stem to tilt leaves and flowers depending on the direction of light (or other inputs)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what happens with seeds in space.  I'm curious.  Don't they run experiments like this on the space station?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is, simply because I do not know, a seedling that would otherwise die due to <a href="http://blog.parkseed.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/zucc_root.jpg" target="_blank">negative geotropism</a> (where the plant can't tell what's up and what's down, causing the plant to try and grow upside-down (I can grow some seeds to see if I can find one that shows the issue)) would be able to survive and the plant, if left floating, would have the roots grow in one direction and the shoot in another. Basically what you would normally expect but now possible for these affected seeds. If the plant is stationary and, say, the lights are off at an angle, the stem would bed to position the leaves at the optimal angle for photosynthesis. I think the only outside factor that would then really affect a seedling would be light. Now, if the plant were to grow larger and the root system able to develop more and more while free floating (maybe super humid air to keep roots moist enough?), the roots may end up growing more spread out than in gravity cause they aren't trying to go down.</p>
<p>There are tons of other factors that would need to be addressed in such experiments and the ones tested on the international space station probably addressed them. Of these, right off the top of my head, would be a difference in water potential between roots and leaves otherwise there wouldn't be the &quot;pulling&quot; force for the water to go from roots to leaves.</p>
<p>Thanks for the question. Really a good one with results that would be very interesting. </p>
<p>Edit: Found one buts it's kind of difficult to discern due to its small size. </p></div>		</li>
