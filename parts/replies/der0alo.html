<p>Fun fact: if you freeze bacteria to use them in your lab for a later experiment, they're dead if you didn't at glycerol to the tube. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but even without that, freezing, then defrosting to like 2 degrees celsius, then freezing it, repeat a few times, is still going to degrade the quality of the meat, even if it doesn't give bacteria a chance to get <em>really</em> busy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the bacteria though, so it's not a guarantee. </p>
<p>I've never tried freezing a tube without glycerol and then plating it, but it wouldn't surprise me if a few survived. And usually we're storing them in a much more aqueous solution than meat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>XL1 blue. I froze them after spinning down and decanting for use in mini prep, to realize on the following Monday that I forgot to save some of each clone. I was able to get enough of them to grow so it turned out alright. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few are likely to survive, so you probably will get some colonies if you plated them on a rich media
Depends how long they're frozen too though </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off u/pseudopad's comment: when meat is frozen too slowly or constantly thawed and refrozen, you can see the destruction and it's what we refer to as freezer burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And actually, if you make sure to <em>dry</em> <em>the</em> <em>hell</em> out of the <em>surface</em> of the meat when you freeze it, then you cook the frozen meat, it's better than if you &quot;gently defrost it&quot;.</p>
<p>Throwing regularly frozen meat into a hot, oiled pan is a disaster, but a dry-frozen (wash, dry, freeze un-covered on parchment for a while, then bag) is outstanding, and for rare-meat fans even better, than unfrozen.</p>
