			<div class="markdown"><p>You are symmetrical, thus, the needed height of pillow will be the same for both side.  You just need to find the perfect thickness of pillow. </p>
<p>Alternatively, there are foam based pillows, and also ones filled with things such as buckwheat husks, which can be manipulated or will deform, and then stay in whatever shape you need. I make a little dent in my buckwheat pillow to get it the right thickness for my head/shoulders, works just fine. </p></div>		</li>
