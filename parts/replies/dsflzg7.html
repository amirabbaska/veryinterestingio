			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I did not mean to suggest that the North's dialect would have stopped evolving, merely that due to the isolation and lack of outside influence (especially Western) that the loan words common in the South would be absent. It's interesting that they have picked up loan words from Russian though I didn't know about that.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to hear from a Korean about their perception of the differences as a native speaker. I wonder also if there's a difference in the formality of the language used in day to day conversation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also love to hear from a native Korean about those differences. I had to do a fair amount of looking things up for this answer, and it was interesting to me as well that Russian is the predominant language from which loanwords are borrowed into North Korean. I would be willing to bet some money that there are words for modern conveniences in South Korean that are absent in commonplace North Korean, if only because much of the North Korean population does not have access to many of those luxuries we take for granted. That being said, there are also likely words for things in North Korean that South Korean doesn't have, simply because they haven't needed them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>North Korea wasn't really isolated until relatively recently. Untill 1990 it was an ordinary closed Communist country, not that different from Russia or Poland. It followed a policy of self-reliance, but not isolationism. It was only after the collapse of the SU that it forged a different path, choosing isolation whereas countries like China and Vietnam were moving in the opposite direction. With Kim Sungs death in 1994 NK's new and unique policy was codified as <em>Songun</em> - Military First. That is the basis of its current reputation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In South Korea, the government has come out and changed certain rules or spellings of things. They have gotten rid of words staring with an “L” sound. The Korean surname of Lee is actually just pronounced “ee “ in the South. Although in the North it still has the “L”. </p>
<p>I lived in Korea for 2 years back in the early 2000s and I’m sure the language has changed quite a bit just since then. Korean is fascinatingly different in different geographies. I was with a guy from Seoul in Pusan (a southern city near the coast) and he literally could not understand the teenagers talking on the bus. Their slang was so different. I remember trying to understand the Daegu dialect was very difficult. </p>
<p>If I remember right, North Korean’s way of speaking is looked at as old fashioned as the South has adapted and changed at a more rapid rate. Maybe similar to how British sounds “old-fashioned” to Americans?</p>
<p>I think language and culture is so fascinating - great question OP</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate to be someone who cites Wikipedia, and that’s all I’m basing this on, but it says the North Korean standard is based on the Seoul dialect. You can definitely correct me if I’m wrong, but I just remembered reading that once. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why would North Korea ever do this though? Most citizens don't even (officially) have access to media from Seoul.</p></div>		</li>

<p>in spite of the proclamation that Pyongyang be adopted as standard, most of the new Munhwaeo is still firmly rooted in the standard that held sway for so many previous centuries, that is, the dialect of Seoul.</p>
