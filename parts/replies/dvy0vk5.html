			<div class="markdown"><p>But I thought the water was pretty much incompressible? The pressure changes above and below the submarine, sure. But does the density change enough to make a difference? Isn’t that why things normally <em>don’t</em> reach an equilibrium, but sink to the bottom?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding was the boat did shrink due to the increasing pressure, resulting in a smaller volume of displaced water. It seems that this decreased volume is more significant than the increase in the weight of the displaced water because the commenter said the boat tends to sink faster at deeper depths. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The submarine’s weight stays the same because no mass was added to it, and it’s volume is constant because its walls are rigid. </p>

<p>This is incorrect. &quot;Spherical cow&quot; physics, as you learn in high school, is a vast simplification. This math will work fine for a demo experiment with a toy in a fish tank or swimming pool. When you start talking about a cylinder 100m long and 10m wide made of real steel and not mythical perfectly rigid &quot;unobtainumium&quot; you can't ignore the volume change as you go down.</p>
<p>Sub school is seriously no joke. You should trust them to understand the physics at work with the boat.</p>

<p>Take a look at the photos <a href="http://www.andhrapolymers.com/submarine_acoustic_rubber.html" target="_blank">here</a>. As you can see, the rubber tiles alone are a non trivial fraction of the sub's volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a stupid question at all. They don’t... because the sub remains pressurized inside to approximately surface-level air pressure the whole time. So while it may be many atmospheres of crushing pressure outside the sub... it’s only a single (maybe slightly greater depending, but not much, just guessing) atmosphere of pressure inside. </p>
<p>Decompression is required when you spend a certain amount of time breathing <em>compressed</em> air. Since they’re breathing regularl surface pressure air, they’re not ongassing that extra pressure, therefore don’t need to offgass (decompress) it, and can surface more or less immediately. </p>
<p>TL/DR: Basically, they’re already at the surface in terms of air pressure, so no deco necessary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/Fiyero109 If you're anything like me, your first question after this answer is, what's special about compressed air?</p>
<p>Scuba divers need compressed air to inflate their lungs against water pressure pushing on their chests. Similar to how you can't open the door of a flooding car.</p>
<p>Then when scuba divers ascend, all the gas in their body stays at the same (above 1 atm) pressure, while the water pressure decreases. Now that the water isn't pushing back as hard, the gas expands and gets into nasty places like your joints.</p>
<p>In the sub, on the other hand, the hull is in between the water and the sailors' chests, so they can keep the air at 1 atm. You may not be able to open the door of a flooding car, but you sure can open the glove box.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am also an ex-submariner, and you are right about the pressurized hull.  The exterior pressure has none or a negligible effect on interior hull pressure.  The pressure inside the hull actually moves from a pressure to a vacuum over time submerged, but it has nothing to do with depth.  Before a dive, the crew will actually &quot;take a pressure&quot; on the ship and suck in as much air as possible with the ventilation system.  On board there are many systems run by compressed air, so you need air compressors.  These take a suction on the ships atmosphere, and not all of that air returns to the atmosphere.  It's either kept in some type of air bank, or goes outside of the pressure hull through leakage to the main ballast tanks.  Over time, use of the air compressors will actually draw a vacuum on the ship, and the only way to get more air is to surface or snorkel (sending a mast up at a shallow depth and sucking it in without having to reveal location).  The atmosphere on board a submarine is obviously critical to the crews life, and as such is monitored and tightly controlled.  There are several instruments and pieces or equipment that measure and maintain atmosphere to stay pretty damn close to what it is at the surface.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Given that the volume of a submarine decreases under pressure, PV=nRT dictates that the pressure would increase unless the submarine has systems designed to keep the pressure at exactly one atmosphere.  It wouldn't be a major pressure change, though.  The volume of a submarine doesn't even come close to be halved at depth, so with no change in the amount of air inside, the pressure would only go up to one point something.  So your ears might pop, but you're not going to get the bends.</p></div>		</li>
