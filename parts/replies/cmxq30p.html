			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that it is easy to contaminate Mars, but impossible to test native life after that contamination. If life exists on Mars, or we can find evidence of past life, it is much more profitable to find it first and THEN contaminate the planet so that it becomes more Earth-like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only partially true. If the DNA was totally different from earth life, that would clearly tell us that life arose separately on Earth and Mars.</p>
<p>But it's possible that life arose first on Mars and spread to Earth via meteorite (or vice versa). If that's true, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_contamination#Issues_arising_from_biological_contamination" target="_blank">forward contamination from Earth</a> could make it impossible to determine whether Martian life existed before we started sending rovers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should still be able to do a phylogenetic analysis of the bacteria.  If it's more or less the same as species on the earth today, it's modern.  If it's got divergence times  millions of years old, then it's probably from an asteroid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes several assumptions:  </p>
<ul>
<li>That the rover has a gene sequencer tool on board.  </li>
<li>That the DNA sequence of any given bacteria is known  </li>
<li>That the bacteria didn't mutate from the interplanetary radiation  </li>
</ul>
<p>And probably more that a professional could tel you about.</p></div>		</li>
