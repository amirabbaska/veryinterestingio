<p>Just a heads up, Iceland isn't part of the eurozone or the EU, we use the Icelandic Krona. It did take a BIG hit during our financial crash and still hasn't recovered fully even though the country is booming. Well, as much as a tiny little country of 320.000 people can boom. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Euro isn't really functioning that well. By tying powerful economies like Germany to countries like Greece, it makes German exports artificially cheap, and Greek exports artificially expensive. That means wealth flows to the rich nations in Europe, and the EU doesn't do enough to put it back. Most countries in the world have cycles of printing money to pay for things and running inflation, and then defaulting on debts. Some EU nations likeItaly used to do this, but can't anymore without replacing it with a new financial culture. The whole Eurozone crisis wouldn't have happened if the Euro didn't exist, they would have all just defaulted on their debts and printed money, but Germany can't allow that to happen to its currency</p>
<p>That said, the Euro works to a limited level because the nation's in it are fairly stable and similar. A currency that balances the needs of Congo and Qatar would be impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so people understand:</p>
<p>This is why a lot of countries, like China, have been accused of devaluing their currency.</p>
<p>A devalued currency makes exports cheaper for China.</p>
<p>In the case of the Euro, it hurts weaker economies like Greece which can't export goods as easily</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m going to have to pretty heavily disagree with your reasoning here. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on the viability of the euro, and the reasoning is very different.</p>
<p>It’s not functioning that well because for the most part, the Eurozone is a monetary union (same currency, common central bank) but not a fiscal union (practically non-existing tax paying to the eu or spending from the eu). When you have countries with different economies and business cycles, like Germany and Greece, the eu can only choose one monetary policy for the currency - with different needs for the Greek and German economies this is a bad situation. In other big monetary unions (like the USA or China) the federal government can increase spending in hurt areas to alleviate the pains of monetary policy, but in the EU there’s no significant spending from the EU budget on this. If you were to put similar economies in monetary unions (e.g. Portugal, spain, Italy and Greece together) then it would work, because they have similar needs from currencies and business cycles.</p>
<p>The good part of the euro is the ease of use for trade, and because of stable currencies for all European countries. Italy DID NOT print money to pay its debts, just like the USA can’t and will never do. There was and is separation of central banks and governments. In the past, Southern European countries got into trouble because their central banks increased inflation partly in order to make it cheaper for the government to pay back its debts. Also, the governments faced high interest rates for their bonds because of the unstable currency and lack of international backing in case of a default. The euro made it very easy for countries to access easy credit, and some were very foolish with the new credit (Greece).</p></div>		</li>
