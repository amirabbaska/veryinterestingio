			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't really popular, and aren't grown that commonly in a commercial setting. Lots of hobbyists grow them, but in Australia, they can be had commercially IIRC. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in the US they are popping up more and more in your regular old grocery stores, especially in urban/suburban areas. I would just keep an eye out for them. They are quite good when they are ripe but not so great if they are green whereas some people like their cavendish ones a bit on the green side. When they are ripe I actually prefer them to cavendish.</p></div>		</li>
