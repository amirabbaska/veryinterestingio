			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for being the first person I've seen to point this out. The literal definition of wholesale is selling large quantities to be retailed. Bulk quantities do not equal wholesale. </p>
<p>There are some wholesalers who do both, but once they start selling to consumers they are acting as retailers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. If you go to Costco and buy a pallet of pickles, you're buying retail, not wholesale. The fact that you are the end consumer purchasing means the supplier is not selling to you wholesale. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Costco is not a wholesaler, its a bulk consumer store. There are very few items left that actual small restaurants and convince stores buy from Costco, mainly cigarettes and candy. </p>
<p>Costco's bread and butter are six figure income suburban households with kids, most small restaurants and convince stores have moved to companies like Gfs that have a mixed retail/freight model with a better ordering system.</p></div>		</li>
