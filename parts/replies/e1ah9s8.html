<p>Theoretically yes, but there's not much evidence that it's happened.  A number of studies have looked. The largest (that I saw) did see that blood recipients showed a brief spike in cancers, but not in the long term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the magnitude of increase in cancer risk varied considerably among groups of recipients and among different cancer types during the first 6 months after the transfusion, the relative risks followed similar temporal patterns irrespective of transfusion indication or anatomic site, suggesting shared underlying mechanisms. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers pointed out that blood recipients presumably have pretty major problems at the time of transfusion, which probably accounted for the correlation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has been speculation that blood transfusions could promote or facilitate tumor growth (2,28,29) and thus could precipitate incipient cancers. However, we speculate that other mechanisms unrelated to blood transfusion could account for the observed increased incidence of cancer at early times after blood transfusion. For example, selection bias (or confounding by indication) could have occurred if, as is likely, some recipients were transfused because of early symptoms [such as anemia or bleeding (30)] from occult cancers that were not diagnosed until after the transfusion. It is also possible that, in some cases, there may have been a lag between the diagnosis of a cancer and its registration in the cancer register. In addition, hospitalization, which is nearly invariably implied by the registration of a transfusion, is itself associated with an increased chance of detection and diagnosis of malignant disorders (31). Our finding of an increased incidence of squamous cell skin cancer, which rarely necessitates blood transfusion per se, may reflect such surveillance bias.</p>

<p>There are definitely cases of tissue transplant recipients who developed cancer in the donated organ; in at least one case, a donated kidney developed a type of cancer that the donor had suffered from many years earlier, suggesting that the tumor was still present at a low level, but well controlled by the donor, until the immune-suppression associated with organ transplantation allowed it to grow out. Of course, blood transfusions don't need artificial immune suppression, so this is less likely to be an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a type of cancer called NET. It's very slow growing, so chances are some organs can have cells that are cancerous, but they wont show up for years. </p>
<p>If your option is certain death or possible NET later, you should definitely go for NET as it is unlikely to result in anything for years and in that time you should expect advancement in cancer treatment. And even if you get NET the long term prognosis is really good. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Part of the reason why cancer is so hard for your immune system to deal with is because it originates from YOU. There are tons of mechanisms that are used to train your immune system to ignore anything that looks like you. Otherwise it would risk damaging healthy tissue. </p>
<p>But if you had cancer that originated from someone else? Even the best matched donor will have some differences from you. The immune system can target those differences and go ape shit on that cancer without consequence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated.</p>
<p>For example, if you are injured in some way, your immune system is the cleanup crew to remove debris, dead cells, and so on.  Some of what needs to be removed is &quot;you.&quot;  So there are ways to override the self-recognition lockout.</p>
<p>Another example: when your cells are infected with viruses, your immune system needs a way to kill your own cells to stop the virus.</p>
<p>But the short answer is yes, if the general pattern to ignore things that look like you fails, this is part of how many autoimmune diseases are thought to start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is kind of something that they do for some blood cancers that require bone marrow transplants. It's the &quot;graft versus cancer&quot; response. The problem is that the white blood cells from the donor that are attacking the cancer also attack healthy tisse and cause graft versus host disease, which can be fatal if it isn't treated with immune suppressants. So it's a really tricky balance to strike. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not cancer, but sort of along the same lines: there is a very serious complication from donor white blood cells that are not able to be cleared from the transfusion recipient's blood (for a variety of reasons) and which then mount an immune response against the recipient.  It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfusion-associated_graft-versus-host_disease" target="_blank">transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA GvHD)</a>, and has a mortality rate of over 90%.  There is no effective treatment for it, it can only be prevented by irradiating blood products that will be given to recipients at high risk, which inactivates white blood cells.  Happily, we understand the risk factors fairly well, so it's possible to prevent most cases of it.</p></div>		</li>
