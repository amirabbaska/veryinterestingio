			<div class="markdown"><p>Has there ever been a problem with a pharmacy not having what you need?  </p>
<p>Why I ask is my last pharmacy wasn't going to be able to get me any of my medications for over 30 days, but they never informed me. I submitted a refill, waited, and when after a week I received no notification I went in.  They first said, &quot;check back later.&quot;  So I waited a few more days, and then I was down to my last pill.  I show up, and was told the same thing.  I said I can't do this, because I'm out and can't function without them.  I won't die, but I have a limited amount of time before I start getting sick and can't get through the work day. That's when they finally admitted there was a supplier problem and it might be a full month before they have any.  This was right before closing, so I went into full panic mode. They wouldn't help me find any in town either, so I went on the mad rush trying to find places still open. Found one 24-hour place (which has since ended that, so if it happens again, I'm SOL), which had some from a different supplier. </p>
<p>Anyway, if my life depended on it, I would be in even a worse panic. Your life does depend on it. uggg....Now I'm panicking for you. :-(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do not worry. That is not all pharmacys, the one I use, I actually use to work at and they were lovely people who wouldn't lie to someone. I think that may have been circumstances. I have gone 10 years and have never missed a dose of the important stuff. I say it like that, because sometimes I run out of vitamins and gotta wait till I hit up the store. My doctors are really strict about not skipping doses. Like they grill me when I go, and like interrogate me to make sure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know on allowed.  All I cared about was getting my medication.  I don't know if there's a difference between whether going without would kill a person or not. I imagine if it would kill me that I could have went to an emergency room. As it was with mine, I wouldn't die, but again, I'd be very ill to the point of being unable to work. </p></div>		</li>
