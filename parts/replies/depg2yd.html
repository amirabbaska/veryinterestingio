			<div class="markdown"><p>Each cosmic ray has much, much more energy than a typical photon, and hence their number density has to be very low to be in energy equipartition with starlight. Hence, shouldn't it look more like rare <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vFTJZjnjsk" target="_blank">flashes of totally oversaturated detectors</a>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting signal. Followup question: why is the signal spread diagonally in a line like that? Is it perhaps a property of the lens not being tuned for the wavelength and therefore the flash of X number of protons is refracted? Or maybe a property of the sensor electronics to distribute the energy across the photodiode array?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cosmic rays don't have to pass through the lens (and if they did it'd make very little difference to their trajectory). They pass directly through the sensor from all angles (since they can come from anywhere in space, or be formed by particle collisions in the upper atmosphere). Hence, some hit multiple pixels in a line, as they pass through many of them. The length of the line can give you a clue about the energy and/or the trajectory of the particle. If you mount six detectors (which are basically CCDs) in a cube, you can build a fully three dimensional cosmic ray detector,  like these schoolkids did...   <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUCID" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LUCID</a>  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of processes that mediate this equipartition.</p>
<p>The starlight to infrared equipartition is quite straightforward. Dust in the interstellar medium ('ISM') is heated by the UV light from stars (principally through the photoelectric effect but also from ionization). The dust heats up and glows, reaching equilibrium with the star light.</p>
<p>Cosmic rays also heat the dust in the ISM through collisions, but their interaction tends to be much weaker than the ionization effect from starlight. Still, absent other factors the two will eventually come to equipartition.</p>
<p>The galactic magnetic field and cosmic ray equipartition is also easy. Cosmic rays are charged particles (principally protons) and therefore confined in the galaxy by the galaxy's magnetic field. Particles with significantly higher energy than that which is stored in the magnetic field are not confined and escape. The result is that the observed energy spectrum becomes saturated close to the maximum permitted by the magnetic field.</p>
<p>I also forgot to mention that the bulk kinetic energy of the ISM and the ISM gas pressure are also in equipartition with these other quantities. The ISM's magnetic field is generated (or at least amplified) by the motion of the ISM, which is a hydromagnetic fluid. This process, probably a kind of dynamo-like mechanism, converts kinetic energy into magnetic energy, keeping the two roughly at the same level.</p>
<p>The relationship between starlight and the ISM gas pressure energy is less obvious. But it can be observed that if the density of starlight were significantly higher in the galactic plane (say 20--100 times higher), the photon flux would begin to levitate matter away from the centre of the galaxy, reducing the typical density, and so reducing star formation.</p>
<p>In-galaxy cosmic ray production (probably) occurs principally through a process known as diffusive shock acceleration at supernova shock fronts. Particles bounce between magnetic fluctuations across the shock front. The spectral energy from the process is related to the background densities and magnetic fields, which over a long enough time period tends to bring the energy of these three into a degree of equipartition (but this is probably the least certain of all the equiparition mechanism I've mentioned). Supernova remnants may also be responsible for generating turbulence in the ISM and therefore supplying the bulk kinetic energy.</p>
<p>The equipartition between the CMB and the others may be coincidental. </p>
<p>There are other processes at play here as well.</p>
