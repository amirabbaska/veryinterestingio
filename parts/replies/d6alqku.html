			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in fact, you can see the &quot;ring&quot; structure in this <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/BusterJangle-Charlie.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> of the Operation Buster-Jangle (I dunno who named them) Charlie shot.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pt3frUHzDk" target="_blank">video</a>. Sorry about the music. Think about the gas circulating in a horizontal donut shape. It's not unlike the convection currents in a pot of boiling water, or the smoke rings blown by vapers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Military projects are named using a very long list of common words.  Two are chosen at random.  The idea is to avoid any subconscious association of the purpose of the project with the name  The names are reviewed just in case the name coincidentally describes the project. </p>
<p>Charlie was probably the 3rd test (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie...).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11e8XyUBqRQ" target="_blank">this one</a> to be the most illustrative â€” the angle is perfect. You can really see what's going on in there, the torus ring.</p>
<p>Also, about the names: the individual test names were sometimes just named by the scientists in charge of the series. They had themes. There was one series where they were named after scientists, another after trees, another after Native American tribes. The first two shots of devices designed by the Lawrence Livermore lab were named after the director of the lab's godparents (Ruth and Ray). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's popular to hate on vape culture on reddit, but the vape tricks are an excellent way to show this.  The exhaled vapor is warmer than the surrounding air, and it's translucent.  You can see the movement more clearly than with a video of dense smoke or a chart of how the gas moves.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the coolest things I saw in high school science class was a tiny mushroom cloud. The lesson was about fire needing oxygen to burn. The teacher lit a candle and put one of those bell jars, usually used with the rubber mat and vacuum pump, over it. When the candle burned all the oxygen it released a small puff of smoke that formed a mushroom cloud about the size of a coin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a &quot;soda&quot; can and put about a half inch of heating oil in the bottom of the can. Set the can on some hot coals and let it sit there. Make sure no flames are reaching the top of the can. After about 30-40 min the oil in the can starts to boil. You will hear the can start to tink.  Now things get fun.  You see heating oil does not burn by just throwing it on a fire.  You can put a fire out using heating oil.  The oil needs to be atomized and mixed with the right fuel air mixture to ignight. By letting the oil in the can boil you are atomizing it. The vapor escapes the can through the opening and starts to mix with the surrounding air.  After the mix is right whoosh!  A massive mushroom cloud. A twelve ounce can once produced a two story cloud about five feet around. Make sure there is nothing above or around you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The closest we have come to a zero-g / space test was at 400km/250mi from the surface of earth, in a detonation known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_Prime" target="_blank">Starfish Prime</a>, the last successful high altitude test of Operation Fishbowl.</p>
<p>There are plenty of videos you can check out, but note that these are all taken from within Earth's atmosphere, and as a result what you're seeing in those images is mostly the effect of the energy and debris of the explosion interacting with the atmosphere.  As a result it doesn't really reflect what an explosion in empty space would look like from an observation point in space.</p></div>		</li>
