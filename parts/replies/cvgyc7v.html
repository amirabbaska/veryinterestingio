			<p>As much as I appreciate that this is a joke, the risk of contamination is still there despite our absolute best efforts. Some bacteria/etc can survive ridiculously extreme temperatures/conditions and are extremely hard to kill, even surviving the vacuum of space and extreme radiation</p>		</li>

			<p>And if this contaminate were to happen, these bacteria may end up surviving in this water on Mars, essentially populating it?</p>		</li>

			<p>While destroying it's chances of finding out it there was something there and chancing our bacteria killing whatever might be there.</p>		</li>

			<p>How different a DNA from a hipotetical martian bacteria be from the bacteria we have on earth? Could they be identical?</p>		</li>

			<p>Statistically that seems impossible.  The smallest DNA of bacteria on earth is about 4 kilobites.  That's something like 1.3 x 10^1204 combinations, or possibilities for differences.<br><br>On the other hand, DNA emerges by chance but it does not get selected by chance, so we might expect to see striking similarities.  However, even in the same conditions there's still a huge chance for differences to emerge in DNA due to genetic drift, the emergence of mutations which do not harm organisms.</p>		</li>

			<p>It was. It was also radiation treated, but some bacterial organisms can survive both. Bacteria are resilient little things. A class of bacteria known as the &quot;extremophiles&quot; are renowned for surviving the most extremes of nature including heat and radiation. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>We actually did. Some people managed not to follow it, so the rover is literally not allowed to.<br><br>Before the rover was sent off, some engineers made some last minute adjustments to one of the instruments (after it had been sterilized and sealed) and didn't tell the officer who looks after interplanetary-contamination (didn't follow the procedure). She only found out after it was sealed away for launch (or in flight, can't remember), and had to rule that it therefore wasn't sterilized enough to be allowed to approach any sort of surface water.</p>		</li>

			<p>The find is from orbital images.  We'd need to land something near the sites where this apparently liquid water occurs to study it directly.</p>		</li>

			<p>You mean how far they have traveled? Not very far at all, relatively speaking. We are talking less than 30 miles for ANY of the rovers.</p>		</li>
