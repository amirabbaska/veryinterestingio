<p>Really, this is what makes movies more awesome than real life - right?  The whole idea of a movie is to be in something that is not real.  Let's just take something that isn't even really science fiction - like Star Wars.  We all love that, right?</p>
<p>I think the problem comes from trying to say stuff is science when it's not.  But really, I love fantasy and science fiction (and superhero movies) as much as anyone else.</p>
