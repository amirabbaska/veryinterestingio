<p>When I was working in union plants (as an engineering student), almost all of my projects had some sort of barrier related to a union. One project was developing local parts storage throughout the plant, the goal being to eliminate walk time for workers all the way to the main stores crib. When they needed parts they could go to a smaller local crib instead.</p>
<p>I was out labeling the new cabinets - not stocking them, or moving parts - just applying labels to the cabinets. I got chewed out by the union head and &quot;written up&quot; for a misconduct. The next day I had to go out there, pull an operations worker away from his duties, give him a label maker and give step by step instructions on what to print and where to stick each label. It was absolutely humiliating for both of us. Me looking incapable of doing any kind of hands-on work, and him taking orders from a 20 year old.</p>
<p>Another time at a different job, we were testing a new plastic type in a double-screw extruder before running it to production scale. In order to run the test, the perfectly capable head engineer and I needed to pull a union worker off his regular task to operate the machine. At one point the operator needed to go offload a pallet, and in the 5 minutes he was gone another union worker came by, saw us running the machine without a union worker, and filed a complaint.</p>
<p>I work at a non-union plant now, and if I need to test something, I let the operators and specialists know what I plan to do, what the risks are and what to expect, what the goals are etc. and I go get the work done.</p>
<p>The best part is that operators will happily help me out anyways without being instructed to, because there's no union body enforcing a particular job description on them. Workers that get involved and interested in the improvement projects learn more and better themselves, and often end up scaling the ranks more quickly. The company is now known for high internal promotion tendencies, and I'm confident that it's partly attributed to a lack of union vs non-union barrier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post. American who doesn't like unions who also reluctantly admits some workers in his industry need one. Unions are not inherently bad and have achieved many invaluable workers rights. That's a good thing. Yet in many industries, unions have gotten too strong. Especially public sector unions.</p>
<p>Firing--gives much greater flexibility to American industry in size of workforce which is more able to quickly respond to both increases (because there is lower risk in new hiring) and decreases in demand compared to what you will see in Europe.</p>
<p>Example: Teachers Unions.  In 2013, New York City (where I live) paid 30 million (30 million!) in taxpayer dollars to teachers who were deemed unfit to serve in the classroom. It's almost impossible to fire them. Uniformly, they get removed from the classroom but still collect their salary and benefits. In 2012 it was only 22 million. I have no idea what it is today. This is a recurrent problem.</p>
<p>American education sucks. It does. Really. While far from the only reason, teachers today come from the bottom of the barrel. Their scores, on say, college admissions testing, are far below those of other successful applicants. Yet efforts to improve results are frequently met with ardent resistance by teachers unions. Recent efforts to improve pay to recruit higher quality teachers were met with resistance. For example, one state's endeavors to provide higher salaries to teachers resulted in furthering entrenched union interests. If any teachers were to be fired, it had to almost exclusively come from newer recruits. The obvious result is that entrenched, underperforming teachers retained their jobs, with a pay raise, against more qualified candidates.</p>
<p>The same is true when it comes to measuring outcomes. Teachers unions routinely resist any initiatives to introduce such measures. </p>
<p>In Michigan a few years ago, when the state took action against public sector unions, schools would bus students to participate in political protest measures instead of doing their jobs.</p>
<p>Unions are out there for themselves. Union leadership is an entrenched interest. The US pays far more for the education of each student than other countries do yet has inferior results. Much of the funding for increased education exposure goes not to improve the quality of education but to line teachers own pockets.</p>
<p>Politics: Unions are a racket.</p>
<p>Unions in many industries are a political tools. Unions advocate for laws requiring industry to hire only union workers. Then they advocate for laws which require all employees to pay union dues. Then they send this money to leftist politicians who advance union interests. Regardless of political affiliation, employees are obligate members of a union and fund, through a portion of their paycheck, lobbying efforts which promote the interests of the union, rather than their own interests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was member of an ATF local, and heard horror stories about the yearly convention. Basically it came down to the locals made up of younger members fighting for progressive change and the established powers refuting change. Another thing that I think helped keep my local on the level, was the fact that it's all graduate student teachers. No one gets to consolidate power long enough, because everyone graduates or drops-out in 2-6 years, thus it always had new leadership and new members.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Unions are pretty weak these days in reality, I mean by comparison to other special interests. They haven't stopped the gradual wage decline and they are very unpopular among many Americans, even Democratic-leaning ones. Nobody thinks they are doing a good job and as a result don't think we need them.</p>
<p>It's funny too that Unions basically exploited the same hole in our Democracy that every special interest group is exploiting, yet they get the most shit these days for it. Corporations and Trade Orgs are doing the same exact thing--buying politicians and cooking the legislation in their favor.</p>
<p>We need to completely remove any ability for organizations to do this kind of thing. The currency of elections should be a vote, not dollars. If people want to get political and put their people in office, make them use their own personal money (capped as it is) and their own personal time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Corps/TradeOrgs are all or nothing. You either aren't affected by (or otherwise don't notice) what they do or you lose your job and don't have a say anymore.</p>
<p>A bad union grinds at you. You get to bask in its magnificent shortcomings and failures. Every day you eat lunch with guys who proudly and loudly talk about how they're &quot;takin' the company to the cleaners&quot; while everybody knows the business is not doing <em>that</em> well. They tut when you perform even an inch over what is legally required of you. They preach comradery and will hang you out to dry in a quarter of a second if somebody with more seniority or who is better friends with the union steward sticks their foot in it.</p>
<p>Anyway, it shouldn't be any surprise that back room deals don't earn the same kind of ire as in your face hypocrisy and incompetence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My company goes to trade shows and have to work with union guys. So, if I want to clean up my booth, I can't because the union needs their cut, even if the union guys are nowhere to be found. If I need to move something out of the way with a pallet jack, I have to wait for a union guy or else they go off on you for it.</p>
<p>I also had a friend who did set up for big events like concerts/festivals. He basically said they try to get away with as little as possible, straight up refuse to do certain tasks if they aren't part of their jobs (even stuff that would take a couple seconds), but they still want the most amount of money or else they'll threaten to strike. And he's proud of all this. Talking about it like it's the best thing ever. Not only that, they practically gang up on other workers who don't fall in line. If they perceive someone as being an overachiever or anything like that, they go after him in one way or another. </p>
<p>If I was in a union maybe I'd be like that too. And maybe he's not even wrong. I mean I get that those rules are there to protect workers from not having to do multiple jobs for the same pay as a single job, and protect multiple jobs to keep them available for many people, but when I hear people talking like that it just sours me to the idea. They're not in it for the system and the benefit of workers in general, they're in it because they basically get to be lazy as fuck but still get paid really well. </p>
<p>I'm not saying I think all unions or like this, just the ones I've seen or the ones I've heard about from friends in unions. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Shit like this is why I hate &quot;stick it to The Man&quot; types who think it's a sign of nobility and pride to avoid doing actual fucking work during the day.</p>

<p>This is one of the most frustrating things in the thread to me, this absurdity where people gang up on a hard worker to drag him down to their lazy-ass level. </p>
<p>My workplace isn't unionized, but I have had a bit of experience with this. When I first started at my current place anytime I hustled or tried to work extra hard, I'd get scowled at by my supervisor and accused of trying to steal his job or talking bad about him behind their back. And it's just... fuck, what's my incentive to work hard if I gotta deal with that, you know?</p></div>		</li>
