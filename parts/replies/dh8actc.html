<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It has to do with the difference in energy between where the electron is and the available energy states it can move into (or the same thing with vibrational/translational/rotational energy states of a molecule).</p>
<p>The energy light has is tied to its wavelength: shorter wavelength = higher energy. To excite an electron, a photon passing by it needs to have almost the exact amount of energy required to go from one state to another.</p>
<p>Example: Hydrogen has a ground state of -13.6 eV, and the first excited state available is -3.4 eV. For Hydrogen to absorb a photon, it needs exactly 10.2 eV, which is 122 nm, in the ultraviolet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all cases that I know, the exciting wavelength must be shorter (higher energy) than the emitted wavelength.  Basic limitation of photoelectric rules still apply- even if you have 10,000,000 photons of 10% less energy than needed, you don't get any effect.</p>
<p>UV excites all of them.  Blue LED charges green and red but not blue.   Green LED charges red but not blue or green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see, and I guess by extension the shorter wavelength would impart more energy onto the material. I guess that's why you will see phosphorescent materials 'charge up' much faster on a sunny day, compared to being exposed to light from a light bulb.</p>
<p>It would be cool to use a UV laser on phosphorescent materials to make draw on them!</p></div>		</li>
