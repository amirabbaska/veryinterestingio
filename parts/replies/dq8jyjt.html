			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually because of the controversy/inconclusiveness of the findings that the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mars-science-laboratory-curiosity-rover-msl/" target="_blank">Curiosity</a> and <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/rover/" target="_blank">Mars 2020</a> missions were designed to operate in locations where water may possibly be. It's not so much that there's a hypothesis that water leads to life, but that any place left with liquid H20 has enough ambient energy/heat to support biological reactions found in living organisms (microbial and otherwise).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I'm aware, Curiosity cannot prove that life existed on Mars with its on-board instrumentation (well, except if they manage to catch a fossil on camera, but...).    </p>
<p>There's another mission (ESA's Exomars) that's more dedicated to the search for life on Mars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out &quot;smarter every day&quot; on youtube. He has a video about the drill on curiousity and it has a special compartment with a test for biological processes. This test can only ne conducted a limited number of times due to the sterile nature of the equipment and has yet to be used. They're waiting for somethin good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, Curiosity cannot prove that life existed, but it's payload is designed to determine if there is a statistically significant probability. In particular, the mass spectrometers on board are designed to detect organic matter; while this cannot prove that there is life, it does provide evidence that it is not outright impossible for life to have existed.</p>
<p>That's the funny thing about well-designed experiments: ultimately there are two hypotheses that need to be evaluated regardless of the claim. They are the claim itself (in this case that there is microbial life) and the counter-claim. Experiments serve to immediately refute one of the two claims (in statistical terms, &quot;reject the null-hypothesis&quot;), or provide evidence that can support the claim. In this case, the experiments are designed to reject the claim that there is life by measuring the absence of organic matter. If none was detected, we can infer that there cannot be life at surface level in the areas studied. Since that isn't the case, we need to now refine the experiments (i.e., send Mars 2020) and keep searching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'sample analysis at mars (SAM)'-device of Curiosity includes a gas chromatograph (GC) with several columns for organic materials and a mass spectrometer (MS). It is well suited to detected higher organic molecules, which would be direct evidence for life on Mars. </p>
<p>None have been detected so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We should be looking for other ways life could find &quot;enough ambient energy/heat to support biological reactions found in living organisms (microbial and otherwise)&quot;.</p>
<p>Instead we focus on finding life as we know it on Earth. Quite frankly, extremeophiles tell us we dont even know how to correctly hypothesize life on Earth well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve always wondered how contamination by earth could be possible, when we sanitize the spacecrafts beforehand. I understand that some extreme microbial life can tolerate traveling through space, but I thought that could only happen if it was in the interior of an asteroid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because no sanitization process is 100% reliable and we got a few things that are extremely difficult to get rid of (mostly : spores and tardigrades) without destroying whatever you're trying to sanitize.   </p>
<p>There was some fun articles on what they found on satellites after their re-entry into the atmosphere... Things that lasted a decade in orbit followed by re-entry in the atmosphere and were still alive... </p></div>		</li>
