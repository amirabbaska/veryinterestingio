<blockquote>
<p>This book presents a model for team building ... based on sound research, and the model is meant to ... sustain the high performance of teams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then you say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no evidence that leadership courses or team building courses work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If his model is based on sound research, is this not evidence that team building courses work?</p>
<p>I feel it would be beneficial to elaborate on what you feel makes his model effective, or at least try to answer OP's question about evidence. For instance what is an overview of the results from the &quot;sound research&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A possible counter explanation: The book examines research and finds that there is no evidence that leadership training and team building increases effectiveness. Instead, it offers a model for team success that does not rely on such strategies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I squarely believe team and leadership exercises are ineffective as productivity boosting tools.  The bigger the organization or department the less effective and shorter lived any effect. The norm imo is 80/20 rule. 80% of the work gets done by the top 20% of the team.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think catalyst00 is necessarily contradicting themselves. Just because the research exists doesn't mean the courses are research-based. Management consulting firms who conduct that research do it to support their own businesses. They may keep it fairly close to the chest.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with said research, nor with the book &quot;The Rocket Model&quot;, but I have read &quot;Time Talent Energy&quot; which is written by two senior consultants for Bain &amp; Company. They talk about their research into leadership and how to build teams, and they offer suggestions based on that research. I don't doubt that it exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then how can there be an effective model that uses those techniques?</p>
<p>Based on his post and your explanation, the book would say something like &quot;there was no evidence before of team building being effective, so I studied the situation, made a model, tested it and found it didn't work either&quot;. Bad selling point of a book if it about a failure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for asking for clarification and being specific on what the contradictions are.</p>
<p>The book presents a MODEL, not a course. When I hear course I interpret that as formal learning with an instructor in a class setting. So courses / classes are setup for instruction but aren't created to follow up on the progress of leaders and the performance of their teams.  When I say there isn't evidence that leadership courses or team building courses work I'm referring to formal learning environments that teach leadership.</p>
<p>There's evidence to support the Rocket Model works because there's a component to the model that makes an effort to identify metrics of team performance with the purpose of measuring team performance. These can be different for each team since not all teams are the same.</p>
<p>The framework was developed based on scientific research and studies of groups over 30 years.  I'm not familiar with the methods of research so I don't know which method they used.  But I know that he's still collecting data from teams across the world.</p>
<p>To summarize: The Rocket Model was developed by Dr. Curphy over 30 years by studying teams and team performance from teams across the globe.  The evidence lies in the data that was collected from the performance of teams that use the Rocket Model (I'm not sure if he used data from teams that didn't). Most of these teams are the ones that the author has worked with, as he will instruct these teams on the Rocket Model and then follow up with these teams to measure the output of team performance to see how the model has impacted their teams.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Basically what you are saying is courses not associated with Dr. Curphy don't study the effectiveness of their courses.</p>
<p>I feel like you haven't looked hard enough if you believe Dr. Curphy is the only one out of hundreds of others in this field who care about researching and gathering evidence to support their claim that their course is effective.</p>
<p>Really there is two parts to the Rocket model:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whatever methods the team's engage in that defines the activity that is intended to increase their performance (what I would classify as a course, despite Dr. Curphy not directly instructing it)</p>
</li>
<li>The research that goes into both the process itself and the measuring of success/performance beyond the completion of the course.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although intertwined, they are separate concepts.</p>
<p>So still, to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no evidence that leadership courses or team building courses work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>contradicts what you are saying about the Rocket Model, as if the rocket model involves no team building and no leadership training, what do they actually do for part one specified above? Do they just take a special pill and somehow work better as a team after that? I doubt it, more likely they do some variety of activities that would be in the same vein as the activities done by other team building courses.</p>
<p>If my education has taught me anything, it is the scientific process. One that involves a hypothesis, independent variables and a dependent variable, including a control, followed by analysis and a conclusion.</p>
<p>In this case, the dependent variable must be something that classifies as a &quot;team building course&quot;, as the hypothesis of &quot;The Rocket Model is effective at team building&quot; relies on some sort of team building being attempted.</p>
<p>If there is actually 'sound research that the model sustains the high performance of teams', then the model must have characteristics that can be pointed to. It cannot simply be only number 2 as referenced above, as then it is simply a measurement device for performance, and therefore does not &quot;sustain the high performance of teams&quot;.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as referenced earlier, other courses must have some sort of metric for the teams whom go through their program's success. I highly doubt so much craze would be existent in this field commercially if the creators of the courses had no evidence of improvement.</p>
<p>But if they do study it (highly likely), and they don't have evidence of their success, then what makes the Rocket Model different? What about the Rocket Model leads to team success?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book explores the nature of teams, leaders, team performance and what makes teams successful.</p>
<p>The Rocket Model was created in response to the lack of leadership courses based on scientific research. When I say scientific research I mean a disciplined approach to researching, collecting, and measuring the data of team performance.  </p>
<p>The evidence is collected from the teams that the author works with as he does follow-ups with them and measures the output of teams that have used the Rocket Model.</p></div>		</li>
