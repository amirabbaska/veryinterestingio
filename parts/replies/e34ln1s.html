			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to contradict you, I just want some clarification, but aren't a lot of the prehistoric aquatic reptiles absolutely massive? Like, dwarfing the terrestrial dinosaurs, in a lot of cases? How could something that large have evolved on land first? Or did they grow once they adapted to the water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Blue Whale is believed to be the largest animal to ever have existed, larger than all dinosaurs, marine reptiles, etc. All whales evolved from the same common ancestor, which was a land mammal. This includes both the Blue Whale and the Dolphin. The earliest specimen that bears the label &quot;whale&quot; is a land animal that was about the size of a wolf.</p>
<p>So, without looking into marine reptiles in particular, I would suspect that the growth to these large sizes happened after the move to water. A quick look says that the largest marine reptile discovered was an ichthyosaur, approaching the size of a blue whale. Most Ichthyosaurs are much smaller, with the smallest being around 1 meter in length. This diversity in size could only have developed after the move to water.</p>
<p>I'm no evolutionary biologist, but my understanding is that changes in size are a very common adaptation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a minor correction: The Blue Whale is the largest animal that ever lived, by mass. But not by length- several dinosaur species e.g Argentinosaurus, Patagotitan were significantly longer than the blue whale.</p>
<p>Blue whales cheat because they don't have to worry about their own weight crushing themselves to death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As seems to be the case with most animals, extinct or otherwise, marine reptiles often have their size greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>The largest pliosaurs seem to top out at around 11 meters long and ~11 tonnes (e.g. <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/randomdinos/art/Toothy-Toothy-Whales-Mk-III-630335385" target="_blank">these</a> estimates based on accurately restoring species based on measurements published in the technical literature), though larger estimates have been made in the past based on poor remains and/or poor methodology. Most pliosaurs would be smaller than this.</p>
<p>The largest mosasaurs were a bit longer (maybe up to 13 meters) but were also more elongate and lightly built, so probably didn't weigh more than big pliosaurs (though accurate estimates for mosasaur weight are frustratingly rare, I don't know why).</p>
<p>There are a couple of giant icthyosaurs (Shonisaurus, Shastasaurus) that could supposedly reach extremely large sizes (~20 meters) but, like with mosasaurs, I've yet to encounter an accurate estimate of their weight. </p>
<p>Even large mammals exceed the size of most big marine reptiles (perhaps bar the giant icthyosaurs), for example check out the absurdly large extinct elephant <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/asier-larramendi/art/The-largest-land-mammals-in-history-546034047" target="_blank">Palaeoloxodon</a>, with one species perhaps exceeding 20 tonnes (nearly 4 times the size of a modern bull African Elephant). Very large sauropod dinosaurs were even bigger, with estimates of over 70 tonnes being common for the really big ones (though they are all very fragmentary and poorly known). Granted most dinosaur lineages didn't exceed 10 tonnes - that's basically limited to a select few giant hadrosaurs, and the aforementioned sauropods - but still.</p>
<p>I admit to being quite uneducated on the evolutionary history of pliosaurs and mosasaurs (other than mosasaurs being closely related to snakes), but I highly suspect that they evolved their giant sizes after returning to the water, not before. I've never heard of multi-tonne terrestrial reptiles outside of dinosaurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They got very big, yes. But it's easy to get bigger once you're in the water and don't have to support and move all that weight around in the same way. Their body's buoyancy in the water helps support their weight, and pushing themselves through it is much easier than moving around on legs.</p>
<p>As a parallel you can look at whale evolution. They started out quite small when they first moved into the water. It was only after that that they grew in size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitpicking: birds ARE reptiles phylogenetically, so your statement, while not wrong, is something like saying &quot;dogs and mammals&quot;. </p>
<p>To elaborate for GP, some non-Avian reptiles like sea snakes give live birth specifically to work around this issue (ovoviviparity)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are. Most sea snakes are fully aquatic, with one primitive genus that isnt (it still lays eggs, and must do so on land). Birds I think will be tied to land as long as they lay eggs. Squamates are a lot more eviloutionarily flexible in that regard, with lineages regularly swapping between eggs and live birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice example of convergent evolution: Ichthyosaurs, dolphins and sharks. Three different classes all landed on very similar body designs, seperated by 100s millions of years and with diverse intermediate ancestors.</p></div>		</li>
