			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Probably the most difficult barrier to entering the field of mathematical or computational biology is the need to become proficient in both fields: the math/comp side and the biology side. Standard curriculum at most universities tends to be pretty stove-piped, so it's hard to develop both. So, make sure you get enough of both fields. In math, things to consider are differential equations (ordinary at least, partial if you can), linear algebra, probability, stochastic processes and numerical methods. In bio, consider general genetics, cell biology, evolution and biochem. I'm not saying one should take all those (yikes!), but all are really helpful.</p></div>		</li>
