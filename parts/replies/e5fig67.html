			<div class="markdown"><p>That absolutely needs to happen. Diabetes is the most important cause of blindness in many areas of the world- and we know how treat and manage it so blindness and visual loss can be prevented.</p>
<p>I am convinced that increasing productivity in healthcare is key to increase affordability and drive down cost, and that autonomous AI can achieve that.</p>
<p>Our focus is on safety, and so we wanted to make sure that IDx-DR qualified for the highest level of scrutiny - the FDA. Now that we have passed that highest hurdle, getting to these other areas is equitable and feasible - and on our roadmap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the answer.  I agree completely, and I'm glad to hear this is a direction you are planning to go in.  Making these kind of diagnostic tools available in underserved parts of the world can have an enormous impact in getting proper treatment to people that need it, and in improving overall quality of life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Higher productivity for a product or service leads to lower prices, all else being equal.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>High cost of healthcare is one the major problems, and decreasing productivity in this sector is making it worse every year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I see autonomous AI as one of the ways of turning this around, increase productivity, and thereby decrease what we all spend on healthcare - all else being equal.</p></div>		</li>
