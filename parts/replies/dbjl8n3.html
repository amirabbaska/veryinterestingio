<p>There's been pressure on FB/google etc to start curating these, because it's become fairly clear that just being true isn't enough to win out.</p>

<p>I think the bigger problem with modern journalism is that there is too much truth out there. In an age of information, there's enough truth to go around for everyone, and it's easy to tailor make your own reality by cherry picking facts that fit your perspective. I'm not trying to say that truth is relative or anything. Data is still unbiased, but the collection and analysis of it is not.</p>
<p>Journalism used to be higher quality because news was so sparse that the media needed to report on anything and everything people might want to hear. Now there's so much information out there that it's no longer a question of what people want to hear; it's a question of what they want to hear most. The end result is that you have media outlets reporting on anything and everything that supports whatever narrative their audience prefers (up to and including trivial bullshit like random tweets and bathroom graffiti), while ignoring anything that doesn't.</p>
<p>I know there is blatantly false information getting thrown into the mix as well, but my point is to explain why people are also losing trust in news that still meets the bare minimum of &quot;not technically lying&quot;. Besides,  it's this glut of clickbait journalism that allows fake news to thrive in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the reason things get sticky is because both Facebook and Google are private entities and don't have any legal obligation to screen or vet content on their sites for truthfulness. However, people argue that a moral obligation does exist, and this leads to a whole new debate on corporations as entities, the necessity of governmental oversight on publicly spread information, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is an issue when a source publishes articles that say (actual examples) that Hillary is a demon, or Obama is a Muslim. They're objectively false, but tend to get a lot of shares because it fits a certain narrative.</p>

<p>Or when you are told possessing leaked emails is illegal but the news source has &quot;special permissions&quot; so everything you are learning about it should come from them...</p>
