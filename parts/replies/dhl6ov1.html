			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question that I have to ask: what makes you choose &quot;unionized&quot; over the common word &quot;deionized&quot;? You seem like you know what you're talking about, so I assume that you're familiar with it, but &quot;deionized&quot; is so common that it's generally just referred to as DI water.</p></div>		</li>
