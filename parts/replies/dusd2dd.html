			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, any mark on the paper you can make can be your legal signature. Technically, you could draw a smiley face, and as long as you drew it, It would count. </p>
<p>Not sure how all this would work out if you were actually investigated for fraud though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing, basically. A verbal contract, an e-mail saying &quot;yes that's fine,&quot; a smiley face and a rabid squirrel chewing &quot;I agree to the terms and conditions&quot; into their front door are all enforceable as contracts, provided it was you doing it (or training the squirrel and deploying it). </p>
<p>Signatures exist only as tradition when only a few people within that circle would sign things - if a king signed a document, everyone would know the signature, and it was a public ceremony. However, when that street cleaner fella signed something using an X because he was barely literate, it still would have come down to proving the signature is real. </p>
<p>In every case, the key is proving that the person agreed to the thing they were agreeing to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The terms and conditions of your credit card contract require you to sign the back of it. </p>
<p>If you’re going to argue that you didn’t sign it, you’re arguing that you breached the contract. Seems like a good reason for the credit card company to deny a chargeback. </p></div>		</li>
