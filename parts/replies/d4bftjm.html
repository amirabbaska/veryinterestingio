			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, so I actually studied this as it relates to prosopagnosia (face blindness). </p>
<p>It's not actually specialization! Our ability to recognize faces utilizes a different cortical functional unit than object recognition (demonstrated by individuals lacking object recognition, but normal face and vice versa).</p>
<p>However, specialization does occur with faces! Infant chimps and humans are both able to distinguish between human and chimp (respectively) faces at a young age, but lose this ability as they age and develop specialization for their species-specific faces. </p>
<p>As well, studies on individuals who had expert object recognition (think hobbyists - cars, model planes) demonstrate that expert/non-expert recognition utilizes different parts of the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's up! Prosopagnosic person here. I can't differentiate faces worth a damn. And yet, someone having a pretty face is still a very important thing to me in a potential match. It's pretty absurd. I'll be looking at someone, thinking &quot;Hey, is she pretty? I hope she's pretty,&quot; while simultaneously being unable to see the face as a single entity (face-blind people process it as a collection of separate objects).</p>
<p>Imagine me here, trying to check someone out, going down the list. &quot;Eye shape pleasing? Check. Cheek bones angled correctly? Check. Nose of acceptable dimensions with minimal deviation from centerline? Check. Forehead to lower-face ratio? Uh oh... Guess I'm not attracted after all.&quot; And I wonder why I'm single.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't that imply that it's <em>extreme</em> specialization if we've essentially developed specialized hardware?</p></div>		</li>
