			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on size of vessel, size of injury, type of injury, and whether it’s an artery (blood away from the heart) or a vein (blood back to the heart). </p>
<p>In general, if it’s a sharp (knife/scissor) injury &lt; 50% of the diameter we can repair it with fine, non-absorbable suture either by itself, or using a specially prepared piece of cow heart lining to help bridge any gap. If it’s due to an energy device or a ballistic (gun, etc) or &gt; 50% we usually have to resect (cut back the edges) some on either side due to underlying injury (heat/shock wave) and bridge the gap using a variety of techniques (freeing up of the surrounding tissue on either side to bring the edges together without tension, taking a piece of vein from elsewhere in the body, a cadaveric artery if it is a large vessel that’s injured, or a piece of prosthetic material (think gore-tex)). </p>
<p>In rare cases, we plug the hole as best we can and then put a stent graft in through the blood vessel to temporize the situation. My partners did that when the spine surgeons got into the largest blood vessel in the body (aorta) in the chest (exposure was difficult). They positioned the graft based on one partner feeling it pass as he held his fingers in the hole (akin to the Dutch boy and the dyke).  </p></div>		</li>
