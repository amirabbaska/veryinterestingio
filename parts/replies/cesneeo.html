			<p>Ozonation is fairly common, yeah. It provides a reliable disinfection dose at the treatment plant, but doesn't necessarily have the residual treatment chlorine and chloramines have. The chemistry of chlorine works great: it forms various species of chloramines as the water makes its way to you , providing lasting disinfection even if the disinfectant is no longer technically Cl2.</p>		</li>

			<p>Environmental engineer here: while that answer is a good analogy it leaves out a critical point in /u/omguhax's question.<br><br>Chlorine-resistant <em>strains of bacteria</em> are uncommon because that would involve a mutation that fundamentally changes the cell wall's chemical structure. However, there already are chlorine-resistant <em>pathogens</em> out there. The two major ones that come to mind are <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em> and <em>Giardia lamblia</em> - the former was responsible for a major outbreak in Milwaukee.These are ubiquitous protozoans which all people are exposed to frequently, particularly in developing countries, but primarily only affect small children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients. However at high enough doses they can affect everyone...for specifics about what happens inside the body, you'd have to ask an gastrointernologist.<br><br>Their normal &quot;form&quot; is just as susceptible to chlorine as anything else, but they have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apicomplexan_life_cycle" target="_blank">complex life cycle</a> in which they can produce oocysts with distinctly resilient wall structures. These live for extremely long periods of time and can survive harsh environments, such as a disinfection process at a water treatment plant.<br><br>Ultraviolet radiation has been used successfully. It uses a certain wavelength of concentrated, invisible light (typically 254 nm) that is absorbed by thymine and uracil - key components of DNA and RNA respectively. The oocysts are not actually killed, but the radiation causes an excess of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine_dimer" target="_blank">molecular dimers</a> in their genetic code that make it impossible to replicate. When a cell can't replicate, it doesn't matter <em>what</em> it is, it has no way of infecting a person.</p>		</li>

			<p>The only problem with ultraviolet radiation used at the beginning of the distribution system is that you don't get any residual protection throughout the pipes, which can be risky if bacteria are growing on old pipes.

			<p>Right, no one uses UV alone for that reason. Just like ozone, it's only effective when the water is actually in the reactor. Typically chloramine is added, but hypochlorite (aka &quot;chlorine&quot;) can work as well. It requires far less total chlorine than a straight-up chlorination system because with those you have to super-chlorinate the water and then de-chlorinate to bring it back down to safe levels for drinking.<br><br>Also, UV requires a very good pretreatment system to reduce turbidity as low as possible.</p>		</li>

			<p>Licensed water operator here. Plants that feed Chlorine gas or liquid or even granuals do not need to super chlorinate then de-chlorinate. They will add enough through out the treatment process to maintain a residual ranging from .21ppm to 4.0 when it leaves the plant. Chloramines are made by mixing CL and ammonia. This boosts the oxidizing power of chlorine allowing the use of less CL. The reason is because CL byproducts can be harmful  </p>		</li>

			<p>to add- The main reason for adding CL is because we can measure it in seconds. Major draw back to UV and Ozone is that the bacteriological test takes 24hours. A plant would have to store the water for 24hours until the test results came back that it was clean. </p>		</li>

			<p>My phrasing might have been inaccurate (super-chlorinate does not mean super-saturation), but straight-up disinfection <em>does</em> need to be higher than the residual amounts unless you like wasting chlorine. You can add higher amounts of chlorine than necessary, to a point, but unless the chlorine is stabilized (with cyanuric acid or similar complex-forming agents), it won't do any good. Also, 4.0 ppm is higher than the amount allowable in swimming pools in some states, so unless you have an extremely long storage time or some daylight exposure, you shouldn't be sending that out in people's drinking water.<br><br>Chloramines do not have a higher oxidizing power than hypochlorous acid (aka &quot;free chlorine&quot;). If they did, chloramines would be the preferred disinfectant over other chlorine forms. However they are more stable and less likely to form carcinogenic chlorine byproducts in the distribution system - where this transformation can't be as easily monitored.</p>		</li>

			<p>It can work in some cases, such as as when a system uses chlorine gas and not all the gas has formed acid or hypochlorite or chloramine. But that's just removing excess chlorine and bringing it more in line with a normal average than it is removing it all. </p>		</li>

			<p>Technically, your stomach is full of chlorinated water.  Hydrochloric acid contains a way higher concentration of chlorine radicals than tap.

			<p>Are you referring to this? -<br><br>&gt;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC242125/" target="_blank"><strong>Chlorine resistance patterns of bacteria from two drinking water distribution systems</strong></a>, H F Ridgway and B H Olson<br><br>&gt;<em>Abstract</em>  <br>&gt;The relative chlorine sensitivities of bacteria isolated from chlorinated and unchlorinated drinking water distribution systems were compared by two independent methods. One method measured the toxic effect of free chlorine on bacteria, whereas the other measured the effect of combined chlorine. <strong>Bacteria from the chlorinated system were more resistant to both the combined and free forms of chlorine than those from the unchlorinated system, suggesting that there may be selection for more chlorine-tolerant microorganisms in chlorinated waters.</strong> Bacteria retained on the surfaces of 2.0-microns Nuclepore membrane filters were significantly more resistant to free chlorine compared to the total microbial population recovered on 0.2-micron membrane filters, presumably because aggregated cells or bacteria attached to suspended particulate matter exhibit more resistance than unassociated microorganisms. In accordance with this hypothesis, scanning electron microscopy of suspended particulate matter from the water samples revealed the presence of attached bacteria. The most resistant microorganisms were able to survive a 2-min exposure to 10 mg of free chlorine per liter. These included gram-positive spore-forming bacilli, actinomycetes, and some micrococci. The most sensitive bacteria were readily killed by chlorine concentrations of 1.0 mg liter-1 or less, and included most gram-positive micrococci, Corynebacterium/Arthrobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas/Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium/Moraxella, and Acinetobacter.<br><br>[Emphasis added]<br><br>I am a layman and do not understand the implications of this; elsewhere in the thread, it's implied that chlorine 'resistance' is impossible because microorganisms are made of organic compounds that simply can't withstand chemical attack.  <br>Could an expert contribute some thoughts on this paper, please?</p>		</li>

			<p>You can't think about chlorine (or UV, or ozone) disinfection in terms of antibiotics. Antibiotics target very specific proteins in the bacteria which are required for either replication or building up the protective cell wall. However, small mutations in the DNA coding for these target proteins can lead to immunity against that antibiotic. This mutation will be passed on to the bacteria's offspring, the strain became resistant.<br>Now chlorine is a whole different story in that it doesn't target anything specifically. It simply attacks any biomolecule you can imagine, just because it is so reactive. There is nothing involved which could become resistant in the first place.<br><br>It's like choosing between entering a house thru a door and shooting a bad guy (antibiotic), in which case he made be saved by a bulletproof vest (immunity). However, you could also just burn down the whole house (chlorination).<br><br>EDIT: Typos, wording</p>		</li>

			<p>There is a difference between antibiotics and antiseptics. Antibiotics usually have a very specific target on or in the bacteria that can become inaccessible/resistant as the bacteria mutates. Over time these mutations are selected for and the antibiotic loses its efficacy. Antiseptics, on the other hand, don't have such specific targets. They can hit entire components of the bacteria such as dissolving the bacterial membrane, or in the case of chlorine by disrupting the function of ALL bacterial proteins--as opposed to some antibiotics which target ONE specific protein. <br><br>So bacteria can't become resistant to antiseptics in the same manner as they can with antibiotics.</p>		</li>

			<p>Maintaining water pressure is a vital part of water hygiene for this reason. If there is a drop in pressure, for example caused by a leak downhill, water can be syphoned into the system from any connected outlet. This is the reason all water storage tanks have what is called a &quot;Type A air gap&quot; in UK water regulations. One of the worst risks for this is where someone has been using a hose for example and left it lying running on the ground, if there is a pressure drop dirty water from the ground can be syphoned in and contaminate mains water.</p>		</li>

			<p>The water pressure itself doesn't kill the bacteria.
