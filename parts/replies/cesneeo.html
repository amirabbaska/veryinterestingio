			<div class="markdown"><p>Ozonation is fairly common, yeah. It provides a reliable disinfection dose at the treatment plant, but doesn't necessarily have the residual treatment chlorine and chloramines have. The chemistry of chlorine works great: it forms various species of chloramines as the water makes its way to you , providing lasting disinfection even if the disinfectant is no longer technically Cl2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ozonation generally just replaces the bulk of the chlorine that is used up treating the water. They still add a chlorine residual at the end, because it's part of regulations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US ozone by itself isn't the most common technology to use. Selection of treatment processes is typically governed by laws and regulations, water source (and what is in it to start), and what the water is being used for. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sodium Hypochlorite, by far, is the most common chlorination chemical.  It produces a residual that is easy to measure with common tools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally it's just a matter of whatever is most feasible fiscally. Basically every water treatment system uses something to get the large trash out, something to get the smaller crap, and something to kill any organisms. Filtration and suspension suffice for getting crap out of the water, and then one or more methods of chemical or other treatment kill the bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget water pressure. By compressing such an almost incompressible liquid you create a secondary limiter to bacterial growth. I believe the standard for pressurization on a municipal water line is 150 PSI. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's the pressure that kills them, but if there is a leak in the system the water will always leak outwards instead of anything dirty getting sucked in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water pressure itself doesn't kill the bacteria. It's called a &quot;French press&quot; where you take water or a liquid at a certain pressurization and suddenly reduce it at certain points. This forces the bacteria to decompress and they die. Just like humans get decompression sickness from rapid pressure changes while diving. </p>
<p>Slightly different biological mechanics though. </p>
<p>Edit: to answer the question directly though there have been something developments in extremely high pressure liquids and gases that kill bacteria at around <a href="http://mobile.foodnavigator.com/Science-Nutrition/High-pressure-to-kill-foodborne-germs#.Utr4cDMo4m8" target="_blank">37,000 PSI with pressures alone</a>. </p></div>		</li>
