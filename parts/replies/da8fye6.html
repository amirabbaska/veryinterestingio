			<div class="markdown"><p>And also don't forget there's trillions of barrels of kerogen as well. That technology isn't perfected to extract it yet, and the cost of crude would have to be over the $100 a barrel mark to make it competitive.  But they are already working on that. </p>
<p>One report I read estimated there to be 1.8 trillion barrels of recoverable kerogen under Wyoming and Colorado alone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good question is, what is the pollution difference between easy oil and fuels like kerogen. With shale oil there is a massive increase in co2 and other pollutants. It becomes a bleak picture environmentally speaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you handwave away the extraction and transport, very high. That is, if you give me a lump of pure kerogen, I can turn a very high proportion of the energy content into liquid fuel using only energy that is stored within.</p>
<p>However, the problem is that unlike liquid fuels, kerogen is solid, and extracting it requires actually digging it out of the ground instead of tapping a hole and having it gush out. The exact energy costs of doing that depend a lot on the particular deposit in question -- if it is very deep, it will likely never become extractable, if it's near surface it might be very EROEI-positive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just in terms of shale oil, there are nearly 5 trillion barrels of it.</p>
<p>&quot;A 2008 estimate set the total world resources of oil shale at 689 gigatons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that oil shale is not shale oil - oil shale is much more energy intensive to produce and refine than shale oil. So in practical terms there's a lot less than the amount in the ground implies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For others, we know there is some oil but we haven't assessed the amount of oil. We know there is some oil there but we don't know how much.</p>
<p>Where biomass existed in the distant past, we know that there has to be some oil. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A kilometre under the seabed at Wilkes Land in east Antarctica, they found sediments containing the pollen of plants that only thrive in the tropics today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it hard to believe that plants that thrive in the tropics today would be the same as plants having to survive a six-month darkness every year. Or were there only annual plants?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geologists are very good at taking data, such as what environment a specific area was in the past, and what other, similar, known areas are like, and extrapolating this to identify areas where oil/mineral deposits are likely to be.</p>
<p>Its an estimate with a high degree of uncertainty, but it gets you in the right order of magnitude (usually).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't know it exists, it's just likely to be there. If (as very simplified example) you have previously found oil every 500 miles, then you expect to find several new locations within the next 10,000 miles. Statistically.</p></div>		</li>
