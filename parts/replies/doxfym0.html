			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually happened to my GF, I think she was on Tri-Lo-Sprintec, her insurance stopped covering the name brand and when she switched over she couldn’t even stomach the pills without throwing up. Doing a bit of research we found out that this was not an uncommon side effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a somewhat similar reaction with tri-sprintec; the generic my pharmacy switched me too really messed me up. Same for the other pill I was on before that (I can’t remember for the life of me what it was called now, started with an L), the generic was so bad. Weird how that works </p></div>		</li>
