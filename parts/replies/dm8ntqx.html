Such as the upper ream of the chalice, or the shape of the spoon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but compared to what? I went looking for a skyrim cup and found <a href="https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls/images/4/4f/Cup_000f08f8.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20120922170324" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
<p>If you look carefully, I'm not sure there's more a couple more edges to the rim, compared to your image. The visual improvement comes from shading (in this case, I think maybe something like bump mapping making the inside not look smooth) that gives the transition between the side and top of the cup more texture, so the sharp edge is less visible.</p>
<p>e: staring at it again, I take back the &quot;handful&quot; bit. There might be 2x as many edges to that circle... The straight lines are still visible though, if you look carefully.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, my point was games as late at Skyrim still had visible polys on things which were &quot;supposed&quot; to be round.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm looking at a recent screenshot from an <a href="https://i.redd.it/esygkxss5ciz.jpg" target="_blank">actual video game (Forza Horizon 3)</a>, and it's so smooth I can't tell the car isn't real even after being told so. Hence was my question -- did we really make such a big leap in rendering hardware to allow smoothness beyond human perception, or are the rendering algorithms actually different.</p></div>		</li>
