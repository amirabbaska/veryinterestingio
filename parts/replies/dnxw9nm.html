			<div class="markdown"><p>In the biography of Carlos Hathcock called &quot;Marine Sniper&quot; Carlos works with a spotter named Burke who fired a lot of rounds when they pinned down a whole NVA regiment. Both men had quite a few kills from that but without Burke, Carlos would have been in deep shit.  That book is phenomenal, by the way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of those 4, 3 wrote books about what happened.</p>
<p>Of those 3, 2 were published.</p>
<p>Of those 2, just 1 got a movie deal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the difference between a player and a coach (minus the age difference and undesirability to continue playing after a certain age). They both understand the game and at the top levels they could both play the game on the court. It's just one has a better idea of the field of play and overall strategy while the other has a better idea of the actual mechanics in the moment. Sort of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spotter is your more experienced shooter. They should be the one with the rock solid understanding of ballistics and whatnot. The shooter has obviously been through the same training, but more recently and most likely has less real world experience.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The nav may recieve some basic pilot training, and the pilot some basic nav training, but the similarities end there. </p></div>		</li>
