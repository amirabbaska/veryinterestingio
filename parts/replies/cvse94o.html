			<div class="markdown"><p>This exclamation has never been satisfactory for me. I am a C4/5 quadriplegic. I sleep on my back at night. I don't have enough Mobility to adjust my body, and I try to refrain from moving my arms at night because it sets off spasticity in my legs.</p>
<p>Every morning when I wake up, my wood is flat. If you are careful enough to sneak off the sheets without setting off my spasticity, you can see that. However, as soon as I move and my leg spasms go off, fairly soon after (within a minute) you see my morning wood show up. So clearly my morning wood is not just the last in the series that I have overnight. It seems like it's more of a bodily reaction to getting moving. </p>
<p>Have there been an actual studies that prove this is the source of morning wood? If so, how do some people have it so reliably/consistently? If it just so happens that you woke up during a nighttime erection, Shouldn't you also wake up other times when you aren't sporting wood?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, I use a sleep cycle app that wakes me up outside of REM sleep. I often don't wake up with morning wood. When I do wake up with it it's usually because I was dreaming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I don't use a sleep cycle app, but my body is pretty into my schedule now - even if I went to bed late and my alarm is off, I'll still get up around the right time, so I am never in a deep sleep when I wake. </p>
<p>For a while I thought I had low T or something like that, because I wasn't getting morning wood... ever pretty much.</p>
<p>But then I noticed when I take naps in the day, I usually wake up in the middle of a dream, and a rock hard one that won't go away for 20 god damned minutes.  Gotta be REM boners</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If your sleep cycle app wakes you up during REM sleep, wouldn't that mean you would wake up to morning wood more frequently? The explanation above states that it happens during the REM state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im with you on this one, top comment cannot be the entire story. For the past 9 months ive been waking up at 4:30 am for work. Like cockwork, wood arrives between 5:30am and 6:30am, pretty much coinciding with the sunrise. Im betting circadian rythm plays a role in this as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your statement makes a bunch of assumptions and presumed causations.  You say you get an erection after waking up... why do you assume this is the same phenomenon as &quot;morning wood&quot;?  It could very easily be something completely different, such as a sudden change in blood flow/pressure to the region, which stimulates a cascade of physiological reactions leading to strongly increased likelihood for erection.</p>
<p>Similarly, you ask if you should wake up at times without morning wood... well, yes, REM is 15 of 90 minutes of an average sleep cycle, so the vast majority of the time, this is the case.   People who wake up with an erection every day don't do so because they always have an erection in the morning, it's because they are on a very set and regulated cycle (again, 15/90 minutes, so it's pretty easy to predict REM), and they wake up during that time.</p>
<p>Causation and correlation absolutely must be kept as separate considerations.  If you try to lump everything into some larger frame of cause-effect, it definitely won't make any type of cohesive sense, and will generally be factually dubious at best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to live in an SRO &quot;Hotel&quot; in Brooklyn - the kind of place you check into in order to commit suicide. My tiny pathetic room overlooked a vacant lot full of garbage and used needles.</p>
<p>I fell into the habit of peeing out of the window to avoid having to go down the hall to the bathroom. This was especially enjoyable when I woke with an erection and got to arc my stream from three stories up. Even better were the winter nights when a light snow would fall on my cock and the piss arc produced a tiny bit of steam midflight.  I guess &quot;you had to be there&quot; but this was deeply pleasurable and one of the central memories of my time in NYC.</p></div>		</li>
