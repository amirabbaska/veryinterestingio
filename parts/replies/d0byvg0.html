			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a nice video and says what you say it does. However, I was expecting to see some images of &quot;what space really looks like&quot;, what the Orion nebula would look like if I was flying around it, and the video disappointed me on that front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how precise you want to get. In threads about what Mars really looks like from the surface, someone always brings up how hard it is to get any image to look exactly like what the eye sees. Even the raw pictures won't be exact, since the capture method is different, and even more drift comes in when you have to display that image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would make sense if the cluster is relatively dense- I'm not familiar with it. But the starlight needs to have something to reflect off of. No matter how intense the light, if there's nothing nearby to be illuminated by it, the night sky wouldn't glow.... at least that's how I see it in my head</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with this.  Telescope/eyepiece combinations are afocal.  What big aperature gets you for eyepiece viewing is big exit pupil at high magnification - due to the way the human eye works, big faint things are easier to see than small faint things, and the bigger the exit pupil (until it gets bigger than your eye's pupil), the brighter the image.  What a telescope is really doing is effectively placing you much closer to the object; the bigger the aperture, the closer you can get while still preserving the object's surface brightness.  Another way to put it is, for many astronomical objects, it's not that we can't see them naked-eye because their surface brightness is too faint.  Rather, it's because they're too <em>small</em> on the sky.</p>
<p>I've been lucky enough to get to use very large telescopes for eyepiece viewing, and the higher surface brightness nebulae are mind-blowing.  You can see enormous amounts of detail in the gas clouds, billows and folds and all kinds of other stuff; they seriously almost look like black-and-white photos of them.  Now, it is true that you need to be dark adapted to see this, so it wouldn't be evident from the middle of a city, but from rural areas bright nebulae like Orion, Carina, the Ring, Dumbbell, Eskimo, etc.  would be <em>spectacular</em> if we were much closer to them than we are now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally agree with you, <em>but</em> I want to emphasise the point that you are still typically looking through a telescope under ideal conditions. The surface brightness of the Orion nebula is about 21-17 mag/arcsec^2 while the Milky Way and the other galaxies we can see are around 21 mag/arcsec^2 . So yeah, it'd be a bit brighter than the Milky Way, but you'd still need to get somewhere pretty rural to see it well.</p>
<p>I think we're actually both on the same page. I was just trying to make sure that nobody was under the impression that the night sky would look like <a href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/16/image/a/format/large_web/" target="_blank">this</a> or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say quite a lot brighter than the Milky Way in some cases, but yes, it won't look exactly like the Hubble pictures, and you won't be seeing any colors besides maybe a faint gray-green for the most part, although my friend did claim he saw bright red in Orion through a <em>very</em> large telescope.  Just looked gray to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm that all you would see is a grey-white cloud as I have seen that from the Orion Nebula. Living up on a hill in Interior Alaska allows me the opportunity for some decent quality star gazing. I don't currently have a telescope (it pains me so), but I make due with my 300 dollar binoculars. With these binoculars I like to look at Orion's daily chase of the 7 Maidens/Sisters (the Pleiades). Below Orion's belt, around where his nether regions might have been if he was human, you can see 3 dots in a vertical line (coincidence?). The center of the 3 dots is Orion's Nebula, and with my binoculars I can see the aforementioned grey-white cloud emanating from it. Originally I had no idea what it was, so I googled it. Lo and behold, I realized I was looking right at Orion's Nebula.</p>
