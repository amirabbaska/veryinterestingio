<p>Rockstar most likely planned on releasing the game on PC from the beginning. In fact, their plan was pretty genius, as rather than making GTA V a PS4 and/or PC title from the start, they released it for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, PS4 and Xbox One in 2014, and PC in 2015. I bought the game <em>twice</em> (once on PS4 and the second time on PC), and I know some people who bought it <em>thrice</em> (PS3, PS4, PC).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All GTA games since GTA3 back in 2001 have always had a staggered PC release of around 5 to 8 months later than their console counterparts.  GTA 5 is no different as it came out on PC 5 months after the upgraded PS4/XBONE release.  That should tell you the intent for a PC release was always there and the petition did jack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely. No one thought that Rockstar was going to release GTA V on consoles only. That’d be ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds optimistic. Bare in mind, not only does GTA always come to PC, the wait time between the console and PC release was actually pretty normal. So that petition was basically &quot;do the thing you always do&quot;</p></div>		</li>
