<p>Most all carriers support it now, by it's only if both parties have the same carrier and supported devices.</p>

<p>And only if the the call is not transcoded down to some other codec while in transit. Just because it's G722  at each endpoint, doesn't mean some SIP device in the path didn't force it down to G729. In which case it's like making a &quot;lossless&quot; copy of a vinyl recording, all the bitrate in the world will not make it more clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In between the two phones is a network of devices that relay your speaking voice to the other side. Not all of these devices are operating at HD levels.</p>
<p>The analogy I used is copying music. Pretend you want to send your friend a copy of your favorite song. You both own devices that can flawlessly copy and play CD quality recordings. However, you can't ship a copy directly to your friend. You have to send your copy to a middleman, who makes yet another copy and sends it along to yet another middleman, so on, and so forth, until finally <em>some</em> copy of your original copy gets delivered to your friend.</p>
<p>In this chain of middlemen, there may be a middleman that does even own a cd player. He only accepts, copies, and ships vinyl records. So, your CD get copied to vinyl, which is not as clear, has hissing, needle scratching, etc. </p>
<p>Before being delivered to your friend, the vinyl record gets recorded back onto a CD, but it will never sound any better than it did when it was on vinyl, because you've simply copied all the hissing and scratching onto a CD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, lossless copies of vinyl are very popular in the piracy world. Vinyl records can offer higher dynamic range and resolution than audio CDs, and with the proper equipment vinyl rips sound absolutely beautiful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't doubt that some people prefer vinyl sound (this has actually been proven even in blind-testing vs CD), but this is not because it has better specs. It just doesn't. But there are two reasons for this:</p>
<p>1) It is often mastered without the level of dynamic compression that much of modern CDs are (&quot;loudness war&quot;). This is also the primary reason HDCD and SACD sounded better than CD, not because of increased bit-depth or sampling frequency.</p>
<p>2) And, what some prefer with LP sound is actually the distortion characteristics of the medium and playback, that produce that &quot;warm, analogue&quot; sound. In addition to the measurements and specs, this has also been proven in blind-tests. People who consistently recognize and prefer LP sound vs CD in blind-testing, are not able to do so at all when comparing LP to CD-R recorded from LP source. CDs are fully able to reproduce LP sound, as they are able to reproduce sound as good as we can hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because the point can be made, vinyl is, or can be, clearer than any kind of compressed audio recording, if you have an original press, no defects, then the quality of the audio you hear is entirely dependent on your equipment. If you spend enough money it's the closest you'll get to hearing it in the recording booth. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Triggered. Users of unlocked, non carrier branded devices on at&amp;t are barred from VoLTE even when the phone supports it, like late model Nexus and Pixel devices. Unless it's an iPhone. Then you can have unlocked VoLTE. Boils my blood, I'm so mad about it. </p></div>		</li>
