			<div class="markdown"><p>Its desensitization. The humming of a xenon lamp for instance gets processed as a higher cortical function. So you process it and understand where the humming is coming from after time the hair cells that process the sound stop transmitting the sound (possibly a protective effort to save energy [ATP] that is required to power the hair cells - total speculation by me here).  Tinnitus is not a transmitted sound it's an inherent dysfunction within the hair cell of the inner ear.  And won't be desensitized or maybe it does once the hair cell becomes energetically exhausted (absolute refractory period).  </p>
<p>Btw I'm simply a 4th year medical student posed to start my Residency in Emergency Medicine. My explanation is me theory crafting based on my medical knowledge of Anatomy and Neuroscience. So, I didn't do any research on this just thought about it and formulated my hypothesis. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is misleading. Acoustic trauma usually leads to the complete loss of hair cells in the region where the trauma occurred. It's thought that the tinnitus in these cases is caused by plastic changes in the brain that result from the lack of input from missing hair cells, not from metabolic changes in those hair cells.</p></div>		</li>
