			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't use sugar anymore either but they use an analog. They could easily make cola flavors caffeine free without significantly affecting the flavor because most of the flavors are artificial now, but tradition asks for certain flavors, and giving the user a carbohydrate and stimulant jolt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They generally don't use sugar anymore.  It's more popular now because of the overabundance of usage of HFCS.  A lot of people think regular sugar tastes better, and I agree.  I also doubt that the artificial flavors that would replace caffeine/etc have the same &quot;punch&quot; as it does.  So they wouldn't exactly be a &quot;replacement&quot; for it.  You'd have to add some other stimulant in to truly replace caffeine, IMHO.</p></div>		</li>
