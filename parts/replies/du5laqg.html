			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that friend me?  My roommates barged in during my first hibernation with them. They thought I was dead. I would miss a week of work sometimes.<br />
I have narcolepsy in which my daytime sleepiness can get severe.. added to my delayed sleep phase disorder (never found out if that was related to narcolepsy as only one doctor mentioned it) added to my SAD that affects me during winter. It doesnt happen to me as severe as my early 20s though. My mother said I would sleep for 20-24 hours until I was 3. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Delayed Sleep Phase Insomnia is just that your circadian rhythm is borked to waking up late and going to bed late. Doesn't directly relate to narcolepsy, though it could exacerbate things if your work/school schedule doesn't let you sleep during your rhythms' sleep time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on an offshore boat, would work 3 days straight regularly doing very intense labor and catch naps every now and then. I worked for two weeks and then had a week off, during my week off I slept sometimes 90% of it. You can accumulate fatigue and try to sleep it back but not exactly healthy or entirely effective.</p></div>		</li>
