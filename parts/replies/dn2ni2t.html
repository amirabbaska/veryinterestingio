			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow i was just wondering this a few days ago.... and you're telling me it's H2S lmaoo?</p>
<p>I'm drilling holes in the Utica shale and we are H2S trained because of how deadly it is. It's like Earth's farts haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LOL!! Yeah, H2S is about half as toxic as HCN (LC50 444ppm for sulfide and about 200 ppm for cyanide). But your body is able to detect <em>tiny</em> amounts of H2S way below the lethal range (like what you find in flatulence and other everyday decay processes) so you get some warning before a truly lethal exposure.</p>
<p>I have no idea if H2S and other sulfur compounds are <em>actually</em> what cause some farts to feel spicy on the way out; it just seems plausible to me. I'd love to hear a gastroenterologist's take on the question!</p>
<p>Of course, you know as well as I do that higher amounts of H2S quickly burn out your olfactory receptors -- silent but deadly ;3</p></div>		</li>
