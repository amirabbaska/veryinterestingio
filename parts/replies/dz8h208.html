			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great idea actually, and there was once an experiment to see if it could be used to provide power to orbiting spacecraft, and the other way around, to use an electric current to push the spacecraft against the magnetic field. The materials they used failed though due to some trapped oxygen turning into a plasma and creating a short circuit condition. </p>

<p>there have been a few other experiments too:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the pushing thing hasn't failed.  A device called a Magnetorquer is used to control an orbiting object's rotation/orientation by pushing off the Earth's magnetic field.  Thus it doesn't need limited propellant, or flywheels with limits to how much angular momentum you can dump into them.</p>
<p>A lot of systems are combo systems that use flywheels to adjust quickly, and use a magnetorquer over time to despin the wheels.</p>
<p>Haven't gotten to pushing objects <em>around</em> based off the field, but we can rotate things with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe if you send a loop of conductor to orbit the earth, passing through the magnetic field will induce a current. But since the energy for that has to come from somewhere, the loop loses kinetic energy and starts to deorbit. Maybe check the math on the Maxwell's equations for me on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic fields don't do work, and the work done to produce a current in a moving conductor is done by the conductor so you're correct. It would slow down the conductor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, however it's more of an maneuvering/efficiency tool than a power generation strategy. </p>
<p>That's because you can only make electrical energy by taking something that's currently in orbit and making it slow. (And if you go too slow, it hits the atmosphere.)</p></div>		</li>
