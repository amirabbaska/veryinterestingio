<p>Outside the extreme gravity fields of a neutron star (we'll get to that in a minute), your average neutron will beta decay with a half life of about 10 minutes, spitting out an electron and a proton</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In physics, students are often taught &quot;half-truths&quot; that allow for easier comprehension, but are sometimes incorrect in unusual circumstances. I mention this because I was taught in first year that the rate of decay was entirely independent of physical factors--that the half-life is constant even if you heat the substance up, smash it into other things, etc. </p>
<p>Obviously, this was just another half-truth taught to freshmen. But now I realize I have some large gaps in my knowledge.</p>
<ol>
<li>What <em>does</em> affect the decay rate?</li>
<li>Do neutrons in a normal atomic nucleus also decay, but over much longer periods of time? What about in a neutron star?</li>
<li>What is special about being in a nucleus that changes the rate?</li>
<li>Why does gravity change it?</li>

<p>The matrix element, and the available phase space. You can calculate the decay rate of the neutrons using <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/fermi.html" target="_blank">Fermi's golden rule</a>. The phase space factor is basically just mechanics, it's the matrix element that's actually somewhat difficult.</p>

<p>Not as far as we know.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Inside of a nucleus, it doesn't make sense to consider the stability of individual particles. What you have is a bound system of many particles. The stability of the system as a whole is determined by whether or not a more energetically favorable state exists, and whether there is a path that will take the system to that state without violating any relevant conservation law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4 - it's not that gravity changes it. It's that things get so squished together. When you've got one big nuclear soup, that's a very different thing than an atomic nucleus.</p>
<p>That particular lesson about decay rates being very insensitive: When I heard it in high school and again in college, it was presented in a way that was actually true: nothing <em>they could do to it</em> could affect the decay rates to any extent <em>they could notice</em> - nothing chemical, nothing thermal, nothing with electricity or magnetism, and nothing mechanical.</p>
<p>If you were to do sufficiently extreme electromagnetic or mechanical stuff, you could produce a noticeable effect. And if you do nuclear stuff, you can definitely produce an effect. And if you had infinite precision, yeah, you could detect ridiculously tiny effects from what they were able to do to it even then. But what they could do back then would have very weak effects. Like, my over/under (subjective 50% chance that they could do more than this) on how much they could change a 1000 year half-life, only with what they were doing to it then, is 1 millisecond.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture" target="_blank">Electron capture</a> can't happen if you remove all electrons from the vicinity. You can do that by heating it up a <em>lot</em> in some contrived setup at low density.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Electron capture is the primary decay mode for isotopes with a relative superabundance of protons in the nucleus, but with insufficient energy difference between the isotope and its prospective daughter (the isobar with one less positive charge) for the nuclide to decay by emitting a positron. Electron capture is always an alternative decay mode for radioactive isotopes that do have sufficient energy to decay by positron emission. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you get a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging" target="_blank">frame-dragging</a> effect where the spacetime around the star begins to rotate with the star itself. This is similar the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergosphere" target="_blank">ergoregion</a> of a Kerr black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your definition of direct observation. The neutron stars we can reliably detect their rotation rates of are all pulsars, and thus we can calculate their rotation speeds (and their surface rotation velocity) from how often we can detect the pulses within a given time period. The neutron star itself throws out quite a bit of high-energy radiation, and our orbital telescopes can detect that. </p>
<p>Now, if we were up close to it, then yeah, I would expect the relativistic effects of both the neutron star's mass and its extremely high rotation speed would combine and interact in strange ways. Frame-dragging, while not as extreme as what one would see around a rotating black hole, would definitely be present due to the star's mass. Whether it would be amplified by the rotation or not is something someone far smarter than I am would have to figure out.</p>
<p>If you really want some fun with high speed rotating neutron stars, you should see what happens when one slows down enough for its crust to undergo a starquake. Magnetar SGR 1806-20 released a monstrously powerful gamma-ray burst which was detected in 2004 from such a quake. Said burst was so strong it released more energy in a tenth of a second than what our sun would release in the next 150,000 years.</p></div>		</li>
