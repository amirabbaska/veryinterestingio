			<div class="markdown"><p>The hippocampal ones, yeah. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the olfactory bulb can legitimately make new neurons, but let me source that so I'm not spreading misinformation. </p>
<p>Edit: it looks like the hippocampal region recruits undifferentiated neurons and can actually move them. </p>

<p>&quot;an elegant paper appeared a few years ago (Bhardwaj et al. 2006) providing almost definite proof that, contrary to other cell types in the brain parenchyma, no new cortical neurons are generated after the perinatal period. Taking advantage of the integration of C-14 generated by nuclear bomb tests and by analyzing neocortical tissue of patients who received bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), the study provides compelling evidence that there is no biologically significant neocortical neurogenesis in adult humans.&quot;</p>
<p>Basically, I think it is saying that the new neurons found in the previous studies were present since birth, but actually move to new regions. </p>
<p>Apparently this is all still highly contested and the things I've recently learned in my classes are not proven fact, but the consensus of the experts writing my textbooks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I am only in my last year of undergrad so we haven't even talked about that subregion. I'm looking into its location and function now for more exposure on the topic. </p></div>		</li>
