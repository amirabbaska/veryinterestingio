<p>E = mc^2 is just a part of the full equation from special relativity, the full equation takes into account momentum as well:</p>
<p>E = √(p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nonsense, it's the same thing. has nothing to do with negative energy or anything like that.</p>
<p>it just says that the (minkowski) length of a 4-momentum (E/c,px,py,pz) equals mc. E is the time-component of the 4-momentum vector. the minkowski length of a 4 vector x is sqrt((x0)²-(x1)²-(x2)²-(x3)²). no +-, just as you have no +- with the length of a euklidean vector, sqrt(x²+y²+z²)</p>
<p>wether you write r² = x²+y²+z² or r = sqrt(x²+y²+z²) is the same thing.</p>
<p>whether you write E² = p² c² + m² c^4 or mc = sqrt((E/c)² - p²) is the same thing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. That's called the rest mass energy. That shortened form for example is useful for converting between mass loss in a nuclear reaction and energy released.</p>

<p>Photons cannot have rest mass or else quantum mechanics would fall apart through collapse of gauge invariance. The reason photons can have energy per particle without mass is because they obtain relativistic mass which is not mass in the way you are thinking about it. Their E is actually =pc , their momentum x speed of light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very strongly in the camp that advocates completely eliminating the term &quot;relativistic mass&quot; from our vocabulary.  I feel it is misleading and confusing for beginners, without offering any real advantages.  To quote the abstract of <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/77/5/10.1119/1.3056168" target="_blank">this paper</a> on the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of relativistic mass, which increases with velocity, is not compatible with the standard language of relativity theory and impedes the understanding and learning of the theory by beginners. The same difficulty occurs with the term rest mass.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact is that &quot;mass&quot; is a useful and intuitive concept that defines an intrinsic property of matter, whereas &quot;relativistic mass&quot; isn't mass in any sense, and is velocity-dependent.  It was only referred to as &quot;relativistic mass&quot; because momentum in Special Relativity for a non-massless particle can be written as<br />
p = \gamma * m * v<br />
and people started calling \gamma*m &quot;relativistic mass&quot; so they could still write<br />
p = m' * v<br />
In practice that equation is less useful because it hides an implicit v in m' <em>and</em> has an explicit v.</p>
<p>It is so much easier and clearer to talk about the concept when you don't muddy it up with &quot;relativistic mass&quot;.  Photons have no mass of any kind.  E^2 =m^(2)c^4 + p^(2)c^(2), so photons, by having energy and no mass, have momentum p = E/c.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity" target="_blank">the wikipedia page on Mass in Relativity</a> says: (not my doing, I promise)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... it has been argued that [the concept of Relativistic Mass] is wrong as the fundamentals of the theory relate to space–time. There is disagreement over whether the concept is pedagogically useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pinging OP /u/InterstellarGlue in case he finds this useful.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I believe that talking about relativistic mass misleads people into thinking something is fundamental and interesting when it is not, really.  It hides velocity dependence and invites errors in understanding.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To an extent.  However you're not going to see the Higgs boson until you're deep down the QFT rabbit hole.  A primary focus of objecting to &quot;relativistic mass&quot; was on how it interferes with beginners learning and trying to understand relativity, which remains equally accurate.  Anyone doing QFT doesn't (at least shouldn't!!) have to be concerned about how understandable their representation of elementary Special Relativity is.  So if it was true that the concept re-entered the picture, that wouldn't make it any less of a disservice to those learning SR.</p>
<p>I'm also not even entirely convinced that it is <em>more</em> meaningful to refer to &quot;relativistic mass&quot; even in light of the Higgs boson.  (I wouldn't claim to have intense familiarity with deep-rabbit-hole-QFT so correct me if I'm mistaken in what I'm about to say)  So mass isn't an intrinsic quantity itself, but rather a consequence of the constituent particles intrinsic coupling to the Higgs field, that doesn't imply that \gamma * m is a more meaningful elementary quantity than m, and I mean that in a more profound way than the \pi vs \tau argument.  <em><em>^^\tau ^^ftw</em></em>  Example:</p>
<p>Relativistic momentum (in 1 dimension for this little block) p = \gamma * m <em> v.  And the Lorentz factor \gamma ≡ (1-(v/c)^(2))^(-1/2).  If you wanted to know how much changing your velocity would affect your momentum (in other words, dp/dv).  You'd get:<br />
p = \gamma * m * v<br />
dp/dv = (\gamma)^3 \</em> m.<br />
Okay, that makes sense and clearly follows.</p>
<p>What if you used &quot;relativistic mass&quot; <em>m'</em> = \gamma * m?  You'd get:<br />
p = <em>m'</em> * v<br />
dp/dv = (\gamma)^2 * <em>m'</em></p>
<p>Even worse, once you move to three dimensions your problems explode, and if you try using &quot;relativistic mass&quot; in order to naively make the equation for momentum look like its nonrelativistic counterpart, you find other substitutions become necessary.  In the case of classical acceleration, <strong>a</strong> = <strong>F</strong>/m, the &quot;mass&quot; that you need to substitute in will either be the <em>longitudinal mass</em><br />
m<em><em>L</em></em> ≡ (\gamma)^3 * m<br />
or the <em>transverse mass</em><br />
m<em><em>T</em></em> ≡ (\gamma) * m<br />
depending on whether you're accelerating parallel or orthogonal to the direction of motion.  I think in this case it becomes perfectly clear that trying to conceptualize the <em>mass</em> as what's changing and forcing relativistic expressions to superficially resemble their classical counterparts is the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  The photons follow the curvature of space-time, which is curved by gravity (the old bowling ball on a sheet analogy).  </p>
<p>What makes this more confusing about photons having zero mass is that they CAN impart momentum (P=M<em>V for classical objects).  Their momentum is given by the equation p = h</em>k, where 'h' is the reduced Planck Constant, and k is its wave vector (related to its wavelength).  Sorry I don't have the equations sketched out nicely, I'm new to this reddit thing, but not to particle physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a different formulation. If you start with the quantum model of a massless spin-2 particle, the classical limit will give you the exact same equations as Einstein's geometric model. You can find some older general relativity textbooks which take this approach by Feynman and Weinberg; Weinberg actually calls the geometric formulation a coincidence. However, the quantum model breaks down at high energies, so even though quantum gravity probably looks like massless spin-2 particles at low energies (which then gives us classical GR as it should), we're still looking for a correct description which holds everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's the million dollar question right there. The whole goal of quantum gravity is to find a way to reconcile general relativity and quantum mechanics and get a renormalizable result (i.e. One that isn't riddled with nonsensical inifinities). The usual methods of Quantum Mechanics don't cut it, that's why things like String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity are appealing, because they offer a potential unification of the two. </p></div>		</li>
