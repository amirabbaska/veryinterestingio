</blockquote>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Simply put, massless particles <em>must</em> travel at the speed of light in a universe that obeys Einstein's equations, and there is no massive 'gravity particle.' The hypothetical 'graviton' which would be a sort of 'particle of gravity' in the same sense that a photon is a particle of electromagnetism would be massless, and therefore have to travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. </p>
<p>I've added another paragraph to the end of my post about causality and information in general relativity, so perhaps that might help with your understanding too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a question that bothers me too and I am glad that The_Dead_Sea has raised it.</p>
<p>Light waves have this special place in our understanding, where the wavefunction that gives the probability of a photon being discovered is exactly the same in amplitude as an electromagnetic wave that we can create or measure using in some cases standard classical electronics.</p>
<p>The speed of the EM wave was discovered by James Maxwell to be the same as the speed of light, starting only from an understanding of electromagnetic induction.</p>
<p>This is the anomaly to me, all other wavefunctions of other particles seem to be an abstract or imaginary thing, except for EM waves, where we seem to fully understand the nature of the wave. Or is the relationship between the intensity of the electric field and the amplitude of a photon's wavefunction just a coincidence,?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imperceptible. The force of the earth's gravity on you has you accelerated at:</p>
<pre><code> g_earth = G * M_earth / R_earth ^2 = 9.8 m/s^2</code></pre>
<p>using the mass and radii of the earth to find surface gravity. </p>
<p>Compared to the force of the sun's gravity on you is </p>
<pre><code>g_sun = G * M_sun / d_sun^2 = 0.00593173286 m/s^2</code></pre>
<p>Using the mass of the sun and the distance of the sun (d_sun). That number is basically imperceptible, something like 1,000x less than acceleration due to earth's gravity. Let me offer an illustration of this: </p>
<p>EDIT: I've removed the discussion of the force on a person during the day and night. /u/blorg pointed out my bullshit to me, and I am grateful for <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2nukm0/which_is_faster_gravity_or_light/cmh5yx8" target="_blank">his comment below</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This would actually make you weigh a little less. A 180 lb person (80 kg in SI) would only weigh 0.1 lbs different (50 grams). But have you ever noticed this difference? Of course not, because it's tiny.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>50g out of 80kg is a very significant difference. I don't think that can be right. That's 1/1,600.</p>
<p>In any case the moon has more influence than the sun does. <a href="http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/questions/question/2288/" target="_blank">This answer</a> suggests that the influence due strictly to gravity of the moon and sun would be more like 10-15mg, but that there could be a difference of up to 6g due to differences in air pressure between night and day. 10-15mg is more like 1/8,000,000 - 1/5,333,333 change presuming our 80kg human. </p>
<p>Also have a look here for a measurement of the variation in <em>g</em>:</p>
<p><a href="http://books.google.lk/books?id=vrNIj4re3-wC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=zumberge+rinker+faller+tidal+variation+in+g&source=bl&ots=ZmpKfdcaye&sig=Q7egyAdzRp6FBZU13bB1eenRG4A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=F2x7VObKDYKauQSe54LICA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=zumberge%20rinker%20faller%20tidal%20variation%20in%20g&f=false" target="_blank">http://books.google.lk/books?id=vrNIj4re3-wC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=zumberge+rinker+faller+tidal+variation+in+g&source=bl&ots=ZmpKfdcaye&sig=Q7egyAdzRp6FBZU13bB1eenRG4A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=F2x7VObKDYKauQSe54LICA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=zumberge%20rinker%20faller%20tidal%20variation%20in%20g&f=false</a></p>
<p>Standard value of g: 9.8m/s^2. The variation shown there seems to be only a little greater than 2Âµm/s^2, which is also more in the ballpark of the answer above (1/5,000,000 change.) </p>
<p>I'm no physicist so feel free to correct me, but 50g out of 80kg just sounds like much too large a change. I think you are missing something. Is the fact that a person standing on the earth is already (with the earth itself) in free fall around the sun relevant? From a quick Google some people answering this question seem to think so; I freely confess I don't understand it all well enough to say.</p>
<p>But you wouldn't have to get into extremely sensitive scientific measurements for 1/1,600 to start making a difference, that could make a difference in the commercial world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't perceive gravity waves. We wouldn't feel the kick at all.</p>
<p>You can feel a car accelerating because the surface you're sitting on pushes into your body, which pushes your inner ear forwards, which causes the liquid inside to slosh around and tickle some nerves, which becomes the sensation of acceleration. But gravity pulls on your inner ear directly, along with the rest of your body, so your insides move in sync with your outsides. You can't feel gravitational acceleration.</p>
<p>Sure, right now you probably think you're feeling gravity pulling you down, but what you're actually feeling is the ground pushing you up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If they were energetic enough, you would certainly notice them. The real reason is that they are imperceptible is that we aren't anywhere close to any energetic source of gravitational waves, like merging black holes. If a highly energetic gravitational wave came through, you might be able to notice optical distortions for a brief time.</p>
<p>If we were close to a source that could do this, like merging black holes, there is definitely stuff going on that would kill you before the gravitational wave had a chance to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People would panic, but the lights would stay on for a while. All the coal and nuclear plants would continue to burn, but shipments of new fuel would become increasingly difficult. Rolling blackouts would start in the first few days as snow accumulates, blocking train tracks carrying coal. </p>
<p>People would stock up on canned food, bottled water, and gas in the first few days. Temperatures start to drop all over the world without the heat from the sun, and winter comes early. Everywhere. The now rampant looting, rioting, and general havoc starts to slow down as the snow keeps people in doors. As water lines freeze and the gas lines go dead, the food runs out, as the last vestiges of humanity huddle in the last few buildings that have yet to be burned for warmth. Eventually, these people die too leaving the last survivors in their VIPs bunkers left over from the Cold War. They'll survive off generator power and military discipline for a time, until both of those run out. Years go by and the ice caps will have expanded to consume the entire surface of the planet. The earth is just a ball of ice, the oceans frozen over, humanity extinct. </p>
<p>But there's good news. Life could survive at the hydro thermal vents for a few billion more years, living off energy and heat that makes its way up and out of the core of the earth. As the last of the radioactive isotopes in the core decay, it stops producing heat, eventually growing cold over the eons, until finally even the sponges that clung to life at the ocean floor come to find the same silence that consumed humanity a billion years before... so I guess I was lying when I told you there was good news about a paragraph ago.</p>
<p>The earth's orbit, on the other hand, will continue going around the center of the galaxy for pretty much ever. The moon will probably stick around, but the other planets have long since been cast off on their own orbits, never to be seen again. The odds of a flyby with another star is next to nothing, but if the earth did get close, it already has more than enough kinetic energy to escape, and will not become captured. This sort of 'rogue flyby' is actually a possible mechanism for disrupting orbits in other solar systems, potentially stripping those systems of their planets, and sending them hurtling out into the cold void like our own earth. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure but my guess is we'd either join the orbit around the black hole at the centre of our galaxy or if Jupiter's gravitational pull were stronger we could become Jupiter's newest moon. Either way, we wouldn't have much time to figure it out because we'd become a giant ball of ice if the sun disappeared. </p></div>		</li>
