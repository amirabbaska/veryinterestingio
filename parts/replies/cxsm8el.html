			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget unbiased information forums. The dark Web has hits on journalism where one can find out inside information from anonymous users. There's a lot of CP and drugs, hack for hire, etc. But there are some places that ban CP and promote discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of haters down below but it's definitely interesting. People who want facts will take the time to find the safe havens of anonymity and free speech at it's truest form on the dark web, and to me not just anyone is going to take the time to do that. I recommend it but I use a VPN and tor browser's anonymity set up. But YouTube has a lot of guys messing around on Tor and some useful info. Even if you don't see any interesting forums you'll be amazed at the types of listing people put for services. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>anyone that downloads tor can access these &quot;dark web&quot; sites. the hidden wiki (uncensored if you want child porn) is easily found by a search on the default search engine, duckduckgo. there's also &quot;tor&quot; specific search engines.</p>
<p>or even easier if you're just looking for drugs you can head to <a href="https://dnstats.net/" target="_blank">https://dnstats.net/</a> and get the URL's for use in tor there. </p>
<p>anyone can register and view the sites. the &quot;dark web&quot; isn't as hard  to access and scary as people like to make it seem (unless you're scared by /r/nosleep stories and illegal activities) </p>
<p>the deep web isn't much different from the regular web these days thanks to sites like wikileaks. there's nothing interesting to be found on there unless you're looking for child porn or buying drugs, both of  which are really fucking hard to avoid if you go randomly surfing looking for interesting shit. </p>
<p>I'd love to see statistics on registered active .onion domains and what their sites consist of </p>
<p>I'm willing to bet there's less than 1k currently active .onion websites, with the majority of them being child porn image boards</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can gain access through Tor browser. There is a forum there that is CP free and heavily modified. Lots of info there. It takes some searching but there are useful info there. </p>
<p>Edit: also yes I do have a login with password on this site and you have to ask mods to be approved for commenting with a description of why you're there etc.  They are not afraid to say no</p>
<p>Edit edit: the information exchange.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tor was not created to avoid oppressive governments, although it is plenty effective for doing so. Tor was built to protect U.S. intelligence operations and it was developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab. You may ask, &quot;well than why did they provide it to the public? For free no less?&quot;. Tor is really only useful if there are a sufficient number of users to mask you. If only intelligence agencies used Tor then it wouldn't be great for them because then you know that if you can decipher or trace a single communication then that communication will be valuable. Making it available to the public masks the U.S. intelligence operations communications.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not officially confirmed, but many suspect one of the reasons Tor was open-sourced was because of the potential value in allowing dissidents in oppressive regimes to work -- the US has a history of encouraging such things for its own purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5:</p>
<p>Internet: Many computers are connected together worldwide and can communicate with each other. The Internet can be used for different services which use different protocols (like different human languages).</p>
<p>Web: One of these services, also known as WWW. You can access it with a browser (like Firefox) which communicates with a web server (like Apache) via http or https.</p>
<p>E-mail is another service. There are web based clients, of course, but the actual e-mail traffic happens with mail servers which use smtp (and similar protocols).</p>
<p>Yo may say that your online stored mails are part of the deep web, because they are accessible with your webmail solution (but not for the public), but I won't say that mail traffic is part of the web.</p>
<p>Nowadays it's not that easy anymore because many services do have web interfaces and therefore are accessible in the web.</p></div>		</li>
