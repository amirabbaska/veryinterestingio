			<div class="markdown"><p>to elaborate for those who may be curios about the battery: There is a lithium cell called an 18650, if youve heard of it , its probably because of vaping, but these batteries are also used in other place. Portable phone chargers are just 2-8 of these, most laptop batteries are 6 of them, and the tesla battery is just 5000-8000 of them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not actually much higher than you'd see in other places.  Hard acceleration is still only around a C/2 discharge rate.</p>
<p>It's more that if you have one battery and it gets warm, it'll cool to the surrounding air.  Putting thousands of them in a compact volume means that cooling becomes a bit trickier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I didn't realize Tesla used 18650 cells. As far as I'm aware most electric cars use prismatic or 26700 cells as they have better volumetric energy density, but I guess that is offset with improved cooling ability and pricing economy of 18650 cells over less common formats.</p>
<p>Also, most portable phone chargers use pouch cells. I don't think I've seen many portable chargers that are large enough for an 18650 cell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That form factor is about 30% more efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>portable chargers generally use 18650s, ive salvage cells from some where the board stopped working. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Lipstick-Sized-Generation-Batteries/dp/B005X1Y7I2" target="_blank">Every single one of these &quot;lipstick sized portable chargers has a single 18650 inside it, you can see by its shape&quot;</a> If you go into the reviews on this one, a guy did a tear down showing the board + 18650 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Anker-Candy-Bar-High-Speed-Technology/dp/B06XS9RMWS/ref=pd_sbs_107_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B06XS9RMWS&amp;pd_rd_r=WYC8N6E7JWPWDWZA6ZAD&amp;pd_rd_w=yl0KQ&amp;pd_rd_wg=AJBtD&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=WYC8N6E7JWPWDWZA6ZAD" target="_blank">this one has 2 18650s inside of it</a> You can tell because its double the capacity and just double the width, theres 2 18650s side by side. Also you can see it in the 5th picture which is a &quot;teardown&quot;</p>
<p>I could go on with larger and larger ones, but it basically boils down to ; any portable charger thats 67-80mm thick has 18650s inside of it, the only difference is how many. Anything thinner is lipo instead . </p>
<p>also </p>

<p>The big ones use them.  I have ones that are 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 mAh, and they all have these batteries in them.  The thin ones with less charging capacity do have something else though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fighting fires and disabling the batteries is still new even to Tesla. They’ve had very little experience so far. A few months ago a Tesla caught fire in the Bay Area after a high speed wreck, and even days later the batteries were catching fire in the NTSB warehouse where the wreckage was being stored during the investigation.  They are still learning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. And cutting the power is standard procedure in an electrified fire. From what I recall, any fire in which Electricity is a factor is Class C regardless of the composition of everything else, which means no water whatsoever should be used. Special agenta only. When the power is removed it is downgraded to whatever the remaining primary fuel source is and fought accordingly with the nessesary agents. Generally speaking, only class A fires (wood and other common combustibles) are fought safely with water whereas other classes have specialized agents. </p></div>		</li>
