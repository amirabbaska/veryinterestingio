<p>When energy is imparted into the atom, the electrons express this gain in energy by incrementing into the next higher orbital state. This is, to mine and our collective best understanding, discreet. It's either in this state or the next, I don't think it physically transitions across that space. I'm a little sketchy in that understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These energy states are waves that are spread out around the atom, and overlap. The full state of the electron at any time is a weighted sum of these waves, like how a string vibrates in combinations of its harmonics. So while it's transitioning it is in a combination of both states, and gradually shifts from being mostly in one state to mostly in the other state. </p>
<p>The difference in frequency of these harmonics produces a beat frequency effect that makes the harmonics interfere constructively on one side of the atom and destructively on the other side, and then the opposite side, and the total wave kind of sloshes back and forth around the nucleus in a repeating motion. And when a charged object moves back and forth, it can emit or absorb light waves, and the beat frequency is the frequency of the light. </p></div>		</li>
