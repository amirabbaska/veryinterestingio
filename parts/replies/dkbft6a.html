			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the term &quot;hot tapping&quot; actually originates in the oil and gas industry when they do a literal tap done under high pressure in what would be considered a &quot;hot scenario&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_tapping?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_tapping?wprov=sfla1</a></p>
<p>They actually weld connections onto a natural gas line (which in itself is pretty amazing considering the kind of pressures involved). This video below is how they do it complete with silly music. For a branch connection just replace the valve at the end with a tee connection. </p>
<p>So with hot tapping, you only will do it in the natural gas industry in the case where you have to maintain continuous service. This is especially important when you are supplying to a customer such as a local power plant to a small town. Because cutting the lights off to a bunch of people in a town is a great way to get your neighbors to hate you.</p>

<p>For anyone who is wondering, the hot refers to the possibility of fire or explosion. Procedures followed like above mean that this possibility is essentially zero, but in most cases they treat it like there could be a fire or explosion and have people ready to respond. This kind of work involves significantly more paperwork and cost and is thus only done when there isnt any other choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure entirely. I just know they require less maintenance because they're so much more durable than PVC, cement, etc. Harder to add laterals (pipes from properties), but they last longer. An PVC pipe gone under average use will most likely be replaced in &lt;15 years.  </p>
<p>Brick mains have been there for almost 100 years so far. I'll post some screenshots of some of them when I'm at work tomorrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What what happens if something with the water main fails? I assume there are several fail-safes built into the process, but I'm curious what the procedure is if you burst a hole into the side and water comes spewing out. How would that be stopped? </p>
<p>Very informative post thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It happens sometimes.  If you pay attention you might notice tons of little 8&quot; lids on the surface of the street. Those are valve box lids on top of valve boxes, which you can stick a big key down to shut off water supply to a certain section of the neighborhood via gate valves that have little 2&quot; operation nuts on top of them. There's shitloads of them under the street for redundancy and to expedite resolving issues in the main. For example when someone knocks a fire hydrant out, that's how they turn it off - there's always a gate valve right next to hydrants as a backup.  </p>
<p>If an excavator or someone manages to strike a main, they or the city just backtrack up from where the pressure comes from and start closing gate valves until it stops. They hopefully have the resources to quickly replace the pipe/fittings, then they open the valves back up. Cities usually store a certain amount of reserve pipe and fittings for this exact situation. If they don't have the right stuff they end up calling waterworks distributors like the one I work at, in total desperation, and will pay practically anything for the pipe/fittings in the middle of the night </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sewer and water guy here as well.  Have seen pipes made of wood in several old parts of the city I work in.  Also when connecting a new water line in the process can vary.  If you tore down an old house and built a new one on the existing lot they would likely just tie in a new water line at the curb stop.  This is basically a connection point that joins the city end of the water supply to the homeowners end.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are huge valves every half-mile or so, and at every street intersection. You probably never noticed them. The caps on top of the ground are metal and about 6&quot; round. We have a long tool that goes down in the hole and turns a square nut to shut off the water. We isolate the leak by turning off valves upstream and downstream. Then we dig up the main. If the break is circular, we can use a &quot;emergency repair clamp&quot; which is a metal sheet with a rubber flap inside. We clean around the crack really well and put the repair clamp on. It tightens using long bolts. We tighten the bolts down and torque them to 80ft.lbs. then turn the water back on. A fire hydrant is opened nearby and the water is flushed for a while. We test the water to make sure it has a good chlorine residual reading, and open the last valve on, restoring service. </p>
<p>If the pipe cracked lengthwise, we have to cut out the cracked section and replace it with a new piece of pipe. The new pipe is cut to the exact length of the missing section, and its fastened in place using large repair couplings. The repair couplings slide over the pipe and have rubber baskets in each end. There are long bolts running around the outside. When we tighten the bolts, it squeezes the rubber gaskets against the pipe and the repair is made. Long cracks are rare. The break is usual just a circular crack around the diameter of the pipe.</p>
<p>Depending on the length of time the water is off, or the extent of the repairs, we may have to send out &quot;boil-water&quot; notices to residents in the area. This is required by law. It just lets people know the water line lost pressure and the water could have been contaminated. I've been in the business for 8 years, and we've only had to send out boil-water notices twice that I can remember. </p></div>		</li>
