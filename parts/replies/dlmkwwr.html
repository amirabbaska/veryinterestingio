			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add here that modern CMOS image sensors can have 5 or 7 transistors per pixel! So for your 13 Megapixel smartphone camera, that's up to 91 million transistors and that's just the pixels. Can you imagine dragging 91 million vacuum tubes around?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, though the details of how to use them are beyond my knowledge. In the olden days they had ones that were meant to be somewhat like the more complicated vacuum tubes. The modern interest seems to be about fitting more logic into an area of integrated circuit without having to make the individual parts smaller. <del>Check the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigate_device" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> for details on one type.</del></p>
<p>*Edit: The wiki article probably isn't what you want, since it's mostly concerned with ways to make the traditional function work better on really small devices by connecting the control input in several places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! That really cool technology where the vibrations that make up sound are recorded as undulations in a spiral groove on a spinning disk, to be picked up later with a needle and amplified for playback. It was the simplest influential example I could think of. If you can find one of the really old cheap ones the circuitry is often very simple, just a transistor or two and a bunch of passives, IIRC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  I don't think any 5 yo would know a record player and to be honest I can't think of much that would have a discreet transistor in it now anyways, they usually of course have IC's. </p></div>		</li>
