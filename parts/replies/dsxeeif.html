			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify: if a business (bank in this case) writes off 100k, they don't pay 100k less in taxes, they record 100k less in income, and therefore profits. If their profits are taxed at 35%, they pay 35k less in taxes, and eat the other 65k.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also so much miscommunication about tax write-offs in general. My mom was always so big about maximizing deductions for her business which is great, but she'd make it sound like those deductions were a 1:1 ratio of dollars back into your pocket. No... smh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why should they get to write it off in their taxes?  They took a risk hoping to make more money through interest, and it didn't pay off.  If they can write off losses in their taxes, then that takes away the whole risk and gives the banks guaranteed profit.</p></div>		</li>
