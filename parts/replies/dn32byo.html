			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting point. In my reply to u/red_bob, that was one of the ideas, and it wouldn't surprise me in the least if the immune system were involved in Peto's paradox. Peto's paradox is exactly what you suggest. Building a larger body requires many more cell divisions, and at each division there is a chance of mutation. So one would expect, both because there are more cells and more divisions (and larger organisms generally live much longer than smaller ones), that larger animals would have higher cancer rates. But they don't seem to (and in fact they may be lower). </p>
<p>As for more severe autoimmune disorders in larger organisms, that's a cool idea. The autoimmune diseases appears to be associated with the balance between two branches of the helper cells--one that mediates inflammation (roughly speaking) and one that mediates attacks on infected and cancer cells. So if that balance is maintained even with greater ability to attack cancer cells, maybe autoimmunity would be a problem. I'm completely speculating here, though, so please take that with an enormous grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>
