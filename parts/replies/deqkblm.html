The way I see it, FDR and Bernie are both liberals and progressives, and Hillary isn't a liberal at all--she's a <em>neo</em>liberal. There's actually very little distinction between liberals and progressives, but a world of difference between liberals and neoliberals. But I think these days it boils down to real populism, fake populism and elitism, not liberalism vs. conservatism.</p></div>		</li>
