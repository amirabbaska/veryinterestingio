			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy knows. The hydrostatic pressure from the water increases your blood pressure which in turn inhibits the release of Anti Diuretic Hormone into your blood. Less ADH means more urine output so you would become dehydrated faster if you were submerged in water.</p>
<p>Edit: Question-&quot;Is this why swimming makes you feel like you have to urinate?&quot; Answer-It is part of the reason. This is a phenomenon called immersion diuresis which has two factors: 1) hydrostatic pressure of water directly raises blood pressure causing ADH inhibition and 2) cold water will cause vasoconstriction which increases blood pressure and thus indirectly inhibits ADH. Also, I have read that there is a psychological piece to it as well. Something about being in water, thinking about water makes you have to urinate. I don't know the science behind that piece of it <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_diuresis#Immersion_diuresis" target="_blank">but there is a great article which explains the other two factors in detail.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inhibition of ADH is also why you pee so much when you drink alcohol.  Less Anti Diuretic Hormone is produced when alcohol is present, and therefore, your kidneys are under the assumption that they need to dump water from the body.  </p>
<p>I love the pituitary gland.  So much going on in such a tiny space.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On that note, is there an explanation for 'breaking the seal', that is when drinking the time it takes to have to pee decrease after the first piss? Is it just in our heads? Or does peeing tell the kidneys to go on and give the bladder more it can take it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trying to find a source on this, and this was the best I could find.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10751106" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10751106</a>  It seems to say that immersion in water dramatically increases urine production despite the fact that it actually <em>lowers</em> blood pressure.  </p>
<p>edit:  Well, that seems if you are in feet first.  It increases blood pressure if you are head first.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3631667" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3631667</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The anus is very good at absorbing things put into it,  Suppositories exist for this very reason. When you need to bypass the kidneys, and liver, and need medicine fast, that's when you would be given a suppository. If you mean specifically if as the OP suggested in his scenario, I doubt you could pull your anus open far enough to do the trick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on the temperature: if it were hot and the person needed to sweat to cool down, the one in the dry would probably last longer, if not, the one in the humid conditions would lose less water through breathing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that a person in a humid environment (assuming warm enough to be room temperature) would probably keep sweating slightly more because his sweat would take longer to evaporate from the skin thus not allowing the body to cool properly as needed.</p>
<p>Therefore the more you sweat the faster you lose water and probably dehydrate quicker.</p>
<p>This is just an &quot;educated&quot; guess on my part though and I'm in no way qualified to answer this. Could be way off.</p></div>		</li>
