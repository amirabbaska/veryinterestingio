			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever had any kind of sleep study performed? I was basically the same way. I could sleep pretty much indefinitely if it was allowed and I have a really hard time waking up.</p>
<p>Turns out I'm narcoleptic. We decided to figure out what was going on after I slept 26 hours in a car on a road trip, woke up and ate dinner, then went back to sleep for 8 more hours.</p>
<p>Some narcoleptic people don't experience sleep paralysis or the cataplexy. I'm included in something like 5% of diagnosed individuals only get the sleep problems without many of the other symptoms and your story sounds pretty similar to mine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've met one other narcoleptic since I've been diagnosed and she has the range of symptoms. The one she's most envious of me for not having is the cataplexy. There's still a chance of it developing since I'm young enough that the condition could &quot;progress&quot; and I could develop more of the typical symptoms. Hoping that's not the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No I never looked into it.  As years have gone on, my ability to sleep as sound has lessened.  At some point I began to wake more easily after we had children.  I assumed the paternal instinct was the cause.  I still sleep really deep and long left alone.  I rather enjoy it and I am still lazy as all heck so it works.  I have no issues staying awake once awake.  I operate easily on as little as 4 hours of sleep as well.  Kinda weird..  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still reads kind of like narcolepsy. It grants this gift(curse) of a lack of circadian rhythm. I had a coworker who traveled internationally and domestically sometimes back to back and had issues sleeping due to the time zone shift and extensive flights and drives. He was very jealous of this. Unfortunately, this lends to interspersed schedule shifts where I sometimes switch to thirds on weekends or fall asleep right when I get home from work and wake up at 3 am and just go to work because I've got nothing better to do. </p>
<p>Even while medicated to avoid the regular daytime tiredness I sometimes slip since I am always tired and lose track of time. I can operate on minimal sleep as well because of that consistent exhaustion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 1% of the population sleeps 12-14 hours regularly. Sometimes it’s caused by sleep apnea which should be treated and causes restless sleeping so you need more, sometimes a growth hormone deficiency or low testosterone which you can test for and maybe convince a doctor to fix and sometimes the brain just doesn’t work right. Doctors try something called modafinil to treat it in the last case and it can be a life changer. I have a combination of low T (self treated) and the need for stimulants (self treated), I went from sleeping 12-14 hours a day capable of basically sleeping days away which has a range of health consequences, to 7-8 being rejuvenating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there anything to be said about the after effects of mono? I had it 15 years ago and I can still sleep A LOT. I also still have what I'd call psychological effects of it - I get anxious if I get too tired or think I won't be able to take a nap I have planned. I think it comes from my mono going undiagnosed for a year. I got used to sleeping whenever I could and it never left me. I love to sleep but it also bums me out when I spend so much of my weekend in bed.</p></div>		</li>
