			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a time (90's I think) when Mazda would ship B-series trucks to the US without the beds on them.  They would ship the beds separately and had a facility in California where the beds were attached.  Therefore it was &quot;Assembled in USA from Japanese parts&quot; and not subject to the full import tax.</p></div>		</li>
