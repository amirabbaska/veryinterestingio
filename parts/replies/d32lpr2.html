			<div class="markdown"><p>That means metal is volatile too? I can smell the metal (I have to be close enough tho).
Or am I smelling something else that comes woth the metal?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Looks like when your skin comes in contact with metal it produces volatile compounds that we perceive as that metallic smell. We can perceive these compounds in very small amounts, so that is probably where the smell is coming from, not the metal itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe they can make a device to measure the volatility around an object similar to the &quot;radioactive decay&quot; smoke detectors that trip off after a certain threshold of particles in the air reach the ppm specified.    </p>
<p>Although, I can't really see the demand that would drive this innovation...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can measure things like how volatile an aromatic (in the smell sense of the word, rather than chemical one) compound is. working out things like the vapor pressure (calling a substance volatile is just a way of saying that it tends to vaporize or sublimate, for liquids and solids respectively, fairly easily). </p>
<p>But your chemoreceptors sensitivity to certain compounds might be different, or one smell might evoke a much stronger signal  than another-- Meaning smaller doses of one smell can 'smell' much stronger than another! The subject is a complex one. </p></div>		</li>
