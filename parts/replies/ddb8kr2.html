			<div class="markdown"><p>To give you a better understanding of what I'm asking, let me use the recent example where a Federal Judge stayed the EO on immigration but border patrol kept enforcing it anyway. If the exec + legis branches appoint and confirm judges who will rule in their favor in 'skirmishes' like this, would their power run amok? </p>
<p>I suppose that answers my question though - the answer is nothing can stop a partisan perversion of law except for voters on the next election day if they are pissed off enough about it. </p></div>		</li>

If the Republicans obtain enough seats in 2018 to enact constitutional changes unopposed it's because the American people voted in those people and decided this is what they want. Power cannot &quot;run amok&quot; because every branch of government has limits on what it can and cannot do. Your &quot;run amok&quot; is simply the population voting in enough of one party that 2nd party opposition is fruitless. This is how a democratic republic is supposed to function.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not really democracy anymore</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, these days with things like voter suppression, and lobbying for legislation from special interest groups that have a LOT of money (and no cap on how much wealth can be promised), I'd say the vast majority of people are out of the loop. There are too many representatives who get elected by the people, but whose campaigns were financed by large corporations. This carries the notion that these corporations can expect the representative to favor passing laws that benefit the company, over the people who actually voted for the representative. If the representative does not support the corporations that funded his/her campaign, they run the risk of losing funding in the next election cycle. This is why Corporations or Corporate money shouldn't be allowed to fund any <em>public</em> campaigns in any way, shape, or form. If the owner of a company wants to help fund a candidate, they have to do so with their own money, and should only be allowed to donate up to a certain amount. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you should also realize that the very concept of people electing legislators that will push for legislation you disagree with is the entire purpose of Democracy. </p>
<p>I understand that you're upset by the actions of many people in D.C., but what you call &quot;perverse partisan politics&quot; is how Democracy is actually supposed to work. Politicians are elected by people (hopefully) because of the actions they promise to take, and in an ideal society it is their moral obligation to follow through on those promises once they are elected. </p>
<p>You can't hate Republican legislators for pushing their agenda any more than you can hate Democrat legislators for doing them same if they were in power. In a real Democracy, the people you disagree with get to have their way sometimes too, no matter how much you might hate them for it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's no longer a partisan perversion of law if one party has such massive support for said perversion that they were able to dominate all three branches. That just <em>is</em> the will of the people, so to speak.</p></div>		</li>
