			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, in practice you need at least twice the energy of the particle you are trying to create. Enough for the particle itself as well as its anti-particle. This allows for the particle to be created while maintaining conservation laws. I could be mistaken about this though, not an expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're creating the particle through a pair production process (annihilation in reverse), then this is correct. It is possible though to, say, have a particle radiate off a W- boson, which has a mass of ~80 GeV, through weak decay processes without the corresponding antiparticle W+ boson. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that makes sense, thanks. So generally, the method of creation of the particle would depend on the particle in question. Are there any general restrictions about creation processes for different types of fundamental particles (quarks, leptons, bosons, etc.)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the speed of light is rather the speed of anything without mass; its value isn't special to light as it turns out, but our naming convention is historical. It's just an upper speed limit on physical information.</p>
<p>To answer your question, one very simple reason it has to be this way is dimensional analysis. Energy has units of Joules, or kg m^2 /s^2. If we want a relationship putting masses at rest as an energy we need some coefficient that would have units m^2 /s^2, and it would need to be something universal. Note that the usual formula for kinetic energy, mv^2 /2, already has the right kind of &quot;coefficient.&quot; So it suggests maybe whatever coefficient we need for a mass at rest would be some square of a velocity, and that velocity needs to be something universal. Only one choice really emerges -- the speed of light in vacuum.</p>
<p>There's a much more careful derivation of the coefficient that I believe I saw in a class, but I don't remember it unfortunately. But if we agree from experiments that for relativistic particles the momentum of a particle gives energy p*c, and E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2, then our choice of m's coefficient will correctly give us, at low non relativistic speeds, a kinetic energy of mv^2 /2 again, so that's a sign we can be confident in our informed guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer to this lies in understanding that the speed of light isn't &quot;let's measure how fast a photon goes&quot; but rather &quot;a photon goes that fast because it's the limit&quot;</p>
<p>Mass and energy are related, and c is the fastest that something with zero mass can travel. Since a photon has no mass, it travels at c. So the c in e=mc^2 is about that relationship between mass and energy. Light only goes that fast <em>because</em> the relationship between mass and energy limits it there. </p>
<p>Think of it this way - it's not &quot;all the signs on a highway say 55mph because that's how fast the cars go&quot;; the cars go that fast because that's what the sign says. </p>
<p>Hopefully someone can fill in more around why c is in the relationship...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it possible to predict which particle you would make when putting in that energy? For example, could you control the process to create an electron or an up quark?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a process only has one way it can proceed, then you can predict what will happen with complete certainty.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the reaction that proceeds is left to probabilities. Fermi's Golden Rule can give you the rate at which certain processes will likely occur if you're performing the same type of experiment many times, given that you can calculate the amplitude for the process to happen (i.e., the square of the sum of all Feynman diagrams contributing to the process). </p>
<p>What you can do once you know all possible outcomes that, say, a quark-quark collision could produce, is calculate the &quot;branching ratio&quot; of each potential outcome, which is the rate of some particular process happening divided by the sum of the rates of all the processes involved; that is, it can give you the probability that if you know you'll produce something, you'll produce the thing you're looking for in particular.</p>
<p>For example, take a W- boson, which can decay either leptonically, meaning into an electron + antineutrino (forgetting for now about the mu and tau particles), or it can decay into an up quark and a down antiquark (again forgetting about the other possible quarks). If I write out all Feynman diagrams that could produce each case, sum and square all the diagrams (getting the &quot;amplitude&quot; of the process) and multiply by other relevant factors (&quot;phase space&quot; factors, which are not trivial), then I have calculated the rate at which W -&gt; e- &amp; neutrino or W -&gt; u &amp; anti-d can happen. Then summing these rates gives me the total rate at which the W will decay, so the rate of, say, u &amp; anti-d production divided by the total W decay rate will tell me the percentage of decays that turn into u &amp; anti-d quarks.</p>
<p>I hope I've gotten the details right, as I was not a phenomenal student during my QFT classes, but at the least I'm pretty sure that the schematic idea I've outlined is correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorta. You can use different particle collisions and different speeds and add spin to the particles. But you're just affecting the probability of your desired particle being formed. It still might take 1000 attempts before it appears</p></div>		</li>
