<p>the carrier is like a bouncer at a club. they could let you through, but they wont unless you paid or have a contract and an according sim card. you dont NEED the sim card to make a call or get internet. but in our current system, the carriers stop you from using calls/internet without one. the hardware required to make calls/get internet is already in the phone. the sim card is just the pay card to access that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a little bit more detailed than that.</p>
<p>SIM cards aren't pay cards, they're identification and authentication devices. SIM cards contain a full blown microprocessor with an embedded, non-retrievable encryption key that is used to uniquely identify the device and the mobile service provider to whom the SIM provides authentication. Without a SIM card, a phone cannot encrypt its communications with a base tower nor can the identity or authenticity of a mobile device be confirmed.</p>

<p>now the 911 call will just skip all that and directly connect to the services. afaik every carrier has to agree to let 911 calls through from anyone without charging or authentication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the doings of the mobile carriers but rather the doings of the FCC. All mobile base stations must be able to accept and route 911 calls from all radio compatible cellular devices in their radius, support for this is built into all mobile standards. They must do this even if the device cannot be authenticated or cannot encrypt its communications. Furthermore, mobile devices are required to expose GPS information to the 911 operator if available, and mobile carriers are required to be able to attempt to triangulate using their own base stations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>911 calls are distinct. The basetower routes them to a call center determined based on the tower's geographical location. It should not be possible to make unauthenticated emergency calls to non emergency numbers.</p>
<p>To be perfectly clear, I'll elaborate on two points.</p>
<p>1.) Most phones permit either any number to be dialed in an emergency, or a variety of recognised emergency numbers such as 911, 112, and 999. This is due to the fact that the emergency number varies geographically and the phone should not presume either its own location or the local emergency number.</p>
<p>2.) Enhanced 911 services are standard components of all modern (and many dated) mobile communication standards. However, it is incumbent upon national radio telecommunication regulators to actually require that telecommunication providers provide the service to all handsets regardless of service level or authenticity. The FCC requires this in the USA and the CRTC requires it in Canada, however not all countries have enacted these requirements. In many countries, mobile service providers are free to require authentication in order to route emergency calls, or even require active service in order to route emergency calls.</p></div>		</li>
