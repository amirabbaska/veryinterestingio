			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a small young generation is a cause of the problem, but that doesn't mean having a bigger generation is the solution. It would indeed not make sense to enforce that. Alternatives are studied, and a lot comes down to reducing the cost the elder generation requires. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the lady can't grow forever - we're already straining our available resources. It seems shortsighted to only think in time periods of a generation or two.</p>
<p>It seems that that analysis thinks that a high GDP is the ultimate good, regardless of individual levels of happiness. </p></div>		</li>
