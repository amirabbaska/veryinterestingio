<p>So a week or so ago my wife was convinced that some of the steak she had bought and put in the freezer were in there long enough to get freezer burn, so she was going to defrost them and cook it for the dogs.  I saw it and wanted me some steak. so I decided to season it and hammer it a bit with a tenderizer. We were low on some  spices so i mixed up some butter,  fresh ground black pepper,  red pepper flakes, garlic (just picked from my garden) , salt and raw sugar and smashed it into the steaks. Then i just seared and cooked like normal (with my meat thermometer because I like my cooking to resemble a mad science experiment).</p>
<p>It was in-fucking-credible. The sweet, salty, spicy and browned meat umami only allowed us to communicate in grunts and muffled mouth filled moans until it was gone. If someone had been watching us eat they would have thought we  were in some weird game show that involved sex toys under the table wile we were eating. Apparently it fulfilled all of her pregnant cravings too. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was completely off the cuff and I have zero idea what ratios I used. Which is far too common of an occurrence in my &quot;we have almost nothing in the house, so let me make something out of what's left &quot; masterpieces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I Do that too, I call it autopilot cooking. If you just stand in your kitchen and begin to pull things with the meal in mind you'll pull the same things. I make spiced maple pork chops, I don't &quot;remember&quot; everything that goes in it but when staring at my spices everything that sounds good and is a cohesive flavor I grab. Tastes near identical every time. If you grab cook regularly, might work for you too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to a 5 y.o., which is the point of this sub. The best you can explain is that sugar is made of smaller stuff and when heated the arrangement of that stuff changes (like taking apart and rebiulding Legos) and just like your Legos when you rebiuld it it looks different. Malliard is different from caramelization is different from burning, but that idea of heat rerodering stuff is all that matters </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. There’s a difference between “it’s the same process as sugar” and “it’s similar to the process of caramelization”. The first one is straight up wrong. The second one is wrong, but less so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a paper on the Maillard Reaction in school, it requires the presence of a protein and is a lower temperature reaction. I believe the sugar browning is due to caramelization.</p>
<p>Edit:
I can't read as I apparently overlooked the last sentence where he mentioned meat which is probably what you were referring to. Not deleting comment though as it provides additional info on the original question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, no. This reaction is from the pyrolysis of sugar. The Maillard reaction is a separate thing. There's a third food-browning chemical reaction called enzymatic browning that is responsible for apples and avocados turning brown when you leave them out. </p></div>		</li>
