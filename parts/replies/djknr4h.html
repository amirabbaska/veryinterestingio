			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna go ahead and hijack this to say that if you do some quick research into the field of psychoacoustics you'll find some really neat stuff. I have one favorite thing that I use regularly while mixing songs. Let's say you take the main vocals and put a slight delay (so slight you can't even tell) on the left side while keeping the right normal, it will trick your brain into thinking it's coming from the right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is called &quot;Time Alignment&quot;. I use it to setup sound stages. You can get really high end audio receivers that you can configure the delay by the millisecond to give your room a really effective sweet spot. Great for home cinema.
It's ultra effective in car audio, as you can use it to make the car sound like it's a large room. Right now in my car setup I have it configured so that all the band's are playing on the hood and the left and right channels are outside of the doors. It's sorcery I tell you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this app called viper4android on my phone, which does the same thing (amongst other things) as what you discribed what happens in your car.</p>
<p>It takes some time to set up and tweak, but when it's all set up it is as if you step into another dimension when you close your eyes. It feels like instruments have physical place insid your head, you can pinpoint the exact locations of where the notes will hit. It makes playing air drums so much more believable!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stero effects are kind of old hat at this point. It's not necessary to have all 5 or 7 speakers perfectly aligned on the sweet spot for analog or older music recorded/mastered with a 2.1 stereo in mind. </p>
<p>Even decent modern AV systems will have a mic you place where you want the sweet spot. Uses a series of test tones to determine how much to output to each speaker. Or you can adjust them yourself by setting the distance of each speaker from the sweet spot. </p>
<p>Curious, why would you be adjusting the delay on a single speaker? I'm guessing perhaps it has to do with it being an scrap l actual &quot;sound stage&quot; rather than your living room stereo? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not so much an illusion as it is an accurate emulation of how the sound would arrive at your ears if it really was originating from your right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The craziest thing about the Shepard Tone, I've found, is that if I stop paying attention, the effect goes away. I can hear that the sound isn't going any faster, but the second I start to focus, it &quot;speeds up&quot; again. </p></div>		</li>
