			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the species of tree. Some can continue growing from the stump, but some die. This is something people have historically (and pre-historically) done on purpose, to efficiently harvest trees for firewood and building materials. The resulting growth isn't exactly a new tree, but it does keep the tree in a juvenile state and so they don't ever die of old age. There are stumps that are almost twenty feet across, that seem to have been managed this way for centuries.</p>
<p>To answer the original question, yes, plants do get old and die of old age. It varies by species, though. The oldest living known plants are trees of a few different species (mostly including a sort of pine, yew, sequoia) with the oldest about 5000 years. (There are <em>much</em> older <em>colonies</em> of identical clone plants, some of which are still connected... but that's kind of a different thing.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give some real world examples of your question in action look to the quaking aspen. Basically as the roots of one tree spreads out new trees spring from the same root system that are connected to each other and genetically identical. This is called a &quot;clonal colony&quot; (not exclusive to quaking aspens).  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree</a>) is the largest known example of such a colony of quaking aspen. The plant occupies 43 hectares (106 acres) and is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000,000 kilograms (6,600 short tons),making it the heaviest known organism.The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bamboo will naturally blossom then die every once in a while (40-80 years). The whole forest of bamboo will do this together at once.</p>
<p>So bamboo is really the best example of limited life span plant</p>
