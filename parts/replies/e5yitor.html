			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, asbestos. The buildings were built before the regulations we have today on buiding material.</p>
<p>Asbestos is essentially a type of rock that layers similar to fiberglass. Long pointy sticks of rock parallel to one another and compressed is how it looks in its natural state, and unharmful. </p>
<p>Break it up and it creates some pretty decent insulation and building materials like false cealings and linoleum. </p>
<p>However, breath in these broken pieces? And you are basically stabbing your lungs a billion times from the inside and making tiny incisions that eventually turn into cancer AKA Mesothelioma, which I am pretty sure was the most common form of cancer these men and women had.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Asbestos is such a shame. It's one of the most amazing building materials we've discovered/made. Yet causes cancer. There's no safe limit to asbestos fibers. Make sure to properly dispose of it if you have an older house or things</p></div>		</li>

<p>All the common/public areas would've been abated years ago. But there are plenty of inaccessible areas that would still have it.</p></div>		</li>
