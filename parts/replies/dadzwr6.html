			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what I was going to ask about.</p>
<p>I always wondered if it were possible to somehow embed whatever signal triggered that station change into a song, so that whenever a radio station played it, everyone's radios would tune in and you;d get loads of extra royalties ( somehow)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha! I get the feeling that listeners might disable that option fairly quickly ;-)</p>
<p>And as for royalties, your &quot;(somehow)&quot; already knows it doesn't work that way, but damn good hacking effort!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the way you dont earn royalties from airplay per se.</p>
<p>radio stations pay blanket licenses to the PROs in order to use their music. The PROs then pay songwriters and their publishers.</p>
<p>Artists receive nothing for airplay unless they wrote the song. and its not per play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It's closer to how the audio is sent alongside the video in a tv broadcast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the story of how color was crammed into tv broadcast is cool, and slightly related. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the audio for analog TV is quite different. It is an FM signal, while the video is AM. It is 4.5 Mhz above the visual carrier. Many TV transmitters had separate visual and aural amplifiers and they were only combined to get them into a common antenna. Some FM radios could receive the sound from CH6 TV stations because it was just below the FM band. </p>
<p>The RDS signal is a subcarrier added to the baseband audio before modulation. You couldn't demodulate the RDS signal without first demodulating the FM signal. </p></div>		</li>

<p>AM radio stations are also allocated a frequency range...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because any sort of modulation requires bandwidth. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation#Spectrum" target="_blank">See this.</a></p></div>		</li>
