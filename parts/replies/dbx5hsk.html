However, this toxin is present in pufferfish, which is the reason chefs must have special licensure to be taught to prefer pufferfish without killing the customers. </p>
<p>Rhododendrons do contain grayanotoxins, also called rhodotoxin, within their nectar and flowers, which can kill some grazing mammals (per Wikipedia). A gall bladder's function is primarily to store and release bile into the small intestine, from the liver, to aid in fat digestion. Because it serves as more of a storage sac than anything, people can live without their gall bladders. Not sure how this would be physiologically relevant to the toxicity of this plant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know is the actual mechanism, but that seems incredibly speculative. It's fully possible that the toxicity is due to a metabolite that deer do not produce, or that deer more efficiently metabolize the toxin so it does not reach toxic levels, or that that ion channel is of a different form in deer, or does not exist in deer. So until you can give reason beyond your bullshit &quot;it is cause it do&quot; explanation, I'm crying bullshitm</p></div>		</li>
