			<div class="markdown"><p>What would be the effects of chewing all your food but never swallowing. Just chewing it into a mush and then spitting it out?</p>
<p>Edit: Googled it, apparently it's quite a common eating disorder and can cause problems with your teeth and stomach from acid being released in prep to break down food and sugars which then don't come. I don't fully understand the teeth/cavities point from my quick Google, but there you go.</p>
<p>Also apparently it tends to lead to weight gain rather than loss? Possibly your body storing more fat or something, again, just what I got from a quick Google.</p></div>		</li>
