			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Trial and error until there was enough data to start drawing some hypothesis, then testing those and scientific method took over. </p>
<p>2) Yes but you have liters of blood, few ml of liquid does absolutely nothing for thinning blood. You can think in direct ratios; how much blood is there and how much liquid is being pumped in. That liquid will also not stay in blood stream, it will end up somewhere else in your body. Your body will also respond and produce more red blood cells when needed. edit: as reminded, a lot of IV fluids are meant to stay in bloodstream. And the most of the blood is plasma, not red cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2: not necessarily true. Very often the goal of iv fluids are to go into the blood.</p>
<p>Less than half of your blood volume is comprised of red blood cells that carry oxygen. More than half is plasma, which is mostly water. If you're dehydrated, you need more water in your blood. If you've lost a lot of blood from trauma, you need more volume of blood, so we give a lot of water quickly (and solve the blood cell problem later, or let you recover naturally)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>okay that makes sense, very small amount of fluid vs a lot of blood (unless you've lost a lot.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and as another user reminded, a lot of IV fluids are about modifying the fluids in your bloodstream, adding water deliberately. And that most of the blood is plasma anyway, not red cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it definitely thins the blood, which can actually be really bad for some situations.  </p>
<p>A recent study showed patients who received a ton of saline after losing a ton of blood showed poorer outcomes vs. patients who received just enough saline to keep their blood pressure high enough to perfuse their brain.  The theory is that the blood was so thin, it was unable to clot properly.  It was a bit of a shock to my field, as many paramedics reflexively slam fluid into actively bleeding patients.  To think that what we did actually harmed the patients is hard to hear.</p>
<p>I'll link the study if anyone cares, and when I have more time.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id expect there's bias in the study too.</p>
<p>Patients who need a buttload of saline are probably getting that much because their blood pressure won't stay up, confounding the results.</p>
<p>It may be less of a cause and effect relationship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ICU nurse here would love to read it. We can pull that fluid off later if need be, but your boluses and keeping that map up may have saved those kidneys. What you do out there is awesome and saves lives.  Working on estimates of weights and blood loss with no A line to really keep the pressure in check, all you can do is bolus and keep that heart going on the way to the ER.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly when you say it like that it makes perfect sense, you're diluting something thick with something more thin. thankyou for the answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It mostly goes in through your stomach wall.  </p>
<p>As long as whatever you drink is more dilute than your blood, it will wind up in your blood.  Your kidneys maintain the composition of your blood using energy regardless of what you throw into it, within limits.</p></div>		</li>
