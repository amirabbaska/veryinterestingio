			<div class="markdown"><p>The drugs will be similar, but not typically the same. With surgical anesthesia you utilize very powerful drugs with a very short half life. You want the patient to be unconscious during the procedure, but able to regain consciousness quickly when the procedure is over. </p>
<p>Medically induced comas are for longer time periods, so the drugs will usually be ones with longer half lives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Propofol has an incredibly short half life, ranging anywhere from 5-20 minutes, and we use it for sedation for ventilated patients all the time. Constant drips of it are great for maintenance because it can not only be used to turn off people's memory receptors, but can also be used to manage higher blood pressures due to it being a vascular suppressant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically in the old days no, in modern terms sort of...</p>
<p>We used to use morphine and a drug called midazolam to sedate people. These have long durations of action and can accumulate. We used to do (and are still technically supppsed to) &quot;sedation holds&quot; on people so that accumulation wouldn't get too much and fully stop someone breathing/hang around for ages when we want them off. We still use these older drugs from time to time but only in certain cases.</p>
<p>Nowadays we use propofol (AKA Michael Jackson juice) and drugs like remifentanil/alfentanil/fentanyl (in order of decreasing time to offset). We don't really need to do sedation holds as much nowadays because these drugs are wonderfully titratable to find that &quot;sweet spot&quot;. These newer drugs are also used in what is known as TIVA or (total intravenous anaesthetic). Basically we give more than we do for ITU sedation. You can do any operation on this. </p>
<p>The other &quot;standard&quot; anaesthetic maintenance technique is to use these drugs (propofol and fentanyl) to get you off to sleep and then use volatile anaesthetics (sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;gasses&quot;) to keep you that way. This is rare on ITU but can be in certain diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, this isn’t right...</p>
<p>In terms of the original ELI5:</p>
<p>Your brain is like a delicate machine, which needs a lot of things to be <em>just right</em> for it to work properly. </p>
<p>It needs things like oxygen, sugar, salts &amp; minerals. It needs to be the right temperature. There shouldn’t be any drugs interfering with it.</p>
<p>If any of these things, or others, are wrong, then the brain won’t work properly, like a machine can malfunction. </p>
<p>One way it can malfunction is the bits that let you consciously think and feel might turn off. This would be a coma.</p>
<p>Edit: in terms of the questions about a ‘medically-induced coma’:</p>
<p>Sometimes, we might need to make patients unconscious on purpose. </p>
<p>This is common if patients need an operation, because it might be unpleasant for them to be awake during it, and because we need them to keep very still. This is a general anaesthetic. </p>
<p>Other times, someone might be so poorly that we need to make them unconscious. This is common if their treatment is unpleasant, like being on a breathing machine. It is also common if their brain isn’t working properly at the time, and they are very aggressive or agitated, and we again need them to keep very still. </p>
<p>Finally, sometimes if the brain is very damaged, we can put patients to sleep to help protect it - the brain uses less oxygen and other fuels when asleep, so it is less likely to be damaged if levels of these are low.</p>
<p>There are lots of medicines we can use to put people to sleep. They generally work by preventing signals from travelling in the brain normally, like turning off the WiFi connection to your computer. We can put people completely to sleep (a general anaesthetic), or just make them very sleepy (sedation).</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>Edit 2: thanks for the gold (I think that’s what the symbol means on Apollo..)!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. It’s worth recognising that consciousness isn’t an on/off or black/white thing - it’s more a matter of degrees. </p>
<p>If a patient were deeply unconscious, either due to a coma or a general anaesthetic, then they would usually be unable to remember anything.</p>
<p>As a patient becomes more alert, their ability to remember things is more unpredictable. Lots of patients on ICU are kept more lightly sedated than patients having an operation. Because of this, they may well remember parts of their experience - either consciously, or subconsciously. The latter bit can be a real problem, with many patients reporting nightmares or PTSD after they have recovered and left ICU.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I woke up from a coma while I was still on the respirator. I was really hazy from the massive head trauma I had experienced, but the thing I still remember more than anything was how weird the tube snaked down my throat felt. It didn't hurt, it just felt like every inch of my throat was screaming out for me to cough, but I couldn't. It was no bueno.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I woke up after my surgery and remember being intubated a little, but mostly i remember trying to touch my face because they had it all taped up to hold the tube in place and had some over my eyes or something and they immediately pulled my hands away and tied them down to the bed which was honestly more traumatizing </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a helicopter rescue training course. One of the things I learned, when they hang people in the stretcher below the helicopter, they put them in essentially a body bag so they don't struggle and fall out. Also, it's not uncommon that the patients are still unconscious when they initially  get put into the stretcher. </p>
<p>So imagine falling down a mountain, then waking up in a black bag swinging around hundreds of feet in the air. Apparently they call it the screamer suit, because EVERYONE screams</p></div>		</li>
