			<div class="markdown"><p>When I worked nights I had a terrible, terrible time with my sleep schedule.</p>
<p>Sometimes I needed to reverse course and be a daytime person for a bit.  I tried sleep pills, I tried just going to bed but nothing worked as well as staying awake 24 - 36 hours and sleeping 8.</p>
<p>I called it the thermonuclear approach to the problem because everything about it was unpleasent but it unquestionably woke.</p>
<p>After the 2nd time of doing this I had to put some rules in place.<br />
One of the rules was no emails.  Another one was that I was not allowed to leave the house.  I strongly discouraged myself from interacting with anyone during these endevours.</p>
<p>I couldn't trust myself.  There just came a point where I was so tired that I would go a little crazy and ideas and actions that would have been bad, bad ideas normally seemed like the thing to do.</p>
<p>My personal experiences strongly back up /u/Sungillee33 statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because emotional regulation is a very high level cognitive ability, and those are the first to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Another outcome of my little experiments is my absolute inability to understand how having healthcare workers on the job for 24 hours + could possibly be considered a good idea.</p>
<p>I make ZERO good decisions at 24 hours.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly, its sortof counterintuitive, but there are less mistakes made with patient care with these longer shifts. When a patient is transferred from one doctor to another, there are details that are lost in the transition that result in mistakes in patient care. So the theory is that if you minimize the patient transfers, you minimize patient mistakes. And one way of minimizing patient transfers is with longer doctor shifts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite a few studies have shown that is blatantly untrue. When you are within 10-18 hours, there seem to be an acceptable level of mistakes. However, once you go over ~12 hours, the amount of mistakes do increase significantly. And while having continuity does help with reduced mistakes, the more significant difference is in patient satisfaction, when doctors &quot;knew&quot; their patiens better because they were the sole providers. That also brings up the question of patients that come in at the ends of shifts. This is a loss in continuity, but also puts them in a place of decreased levels of care because the providers have already been on shift for 16+ hours.</p>
<p>When work shifts are increased from 8 hours to 12 hours, no extra tiredness is reported, until you get over ~16 hours, when the prevalence of exhaustion and mistakes falls off a cliff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;the effect of sleep deprivation on a task that involves tracking has been shown to be equivalent to the effect of alcohol intoxication; in one study, performance of such a task after 24 hours of sustained wakefulness was equivalent to the performance with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 percent&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;accident rates increase during overtime hours (Kogi, 1991; Schuster, 1985), with rates rising after 9 hours, doubling after 12 consecutive hours (Hanecke et al., 1998), and tripling by 16 consecutive hours of work (Akerstedt, 1994)&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine works nights also. I find that there are 3 keys: </p>
<p>-making the bedroom excessively dark (we have floor-to-ceiling blackout curtains)</p>
<p>-having a fan or other low noise to help drown out incidental daytime sounds</p>
<p>-keeping the room nice and cool. This is especially important in the summer.</p>
<p>Basically, do anything you can to make it the ideal sleeping environment. Some guys have to give up and move into the basement where it is darker, cooler, and quieter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melatonin pills taken an hour or two before bed will help replace the melatonin that his body won't be producing itself. Most companies sell really high dose pills, but I think anything over 1.5mg is a waste. I just buy larger doses and break the pills in half because it's cheaper that way. The bedroom should have the windows completely blacked out, and any windows facing the bedroom door should be close to blacked out. A lot of light can get in under the door. Cheap paper blackout blinds can be bought, but they're kind of ugly. If you buy cloth blackout curtains, test them at the store with a flashlight against the white side to make sure they work well enough. You want the bedroom to be completely dark for sleeping. White noise like a fan can help cut down on the issue of sound from outside the house being disruptive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really true that emotions are in the domain of ‘high cognitive abilities’? I’d imagine emotions are part of a more ‘primal’ system we share with most animals, and that ‘reason’ i.e. would be the distinguishing factor in terms of high cognitivity.</p>
<p>EDIT: My god, the answer has been given 4 hours ago but I keep getting the same response on this message. Doesn’t everybody see the comments below?</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Please stop explaining in slightly varying ways that its about regulation and different cognitive levels, I can’t take it anymore!! I know now, please, just make it stop, I’m sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans have many different emotions, that are at different levels of cognitive ability. For example, fear is generally known to be the simplest emotion. It’s controlled entirely by one very evolutionarily ancient part of the brain, the amygdala. Almost every animal with a brain has one of these, and they all feel fear. This is why fear is not affected by being tired (e.g. if you’re driving after an all nighter, and you have a near collision, you’ll still feel scared). </p>
<p>After that, the ranking of emotions gets rather nebulous. Loosely speaking, happiness is fairly simple, as it’s just an activation of dopamine/serotonin reward systems (again, fairly well conserved among many different species). Sadness exists in other animals, but not as many, since it’s a little more complex. Generally, sadness requires some kind of understanding that things are not as they should be, or could be a different way, which not many non humans can grasp. Things like jealousy, hatred, pride... these are probably exclusive to humans, as they require a fairly high level understanding of <em>other</em> people’s emotions as well as our own. </p>
<p>This is a very interesting topic to me, so another general point: often people assume that intelligence correlated directly with emotional ability in animals. This isn’t exactly true. The purpose of emotion, from an evolutionary POV, is to allow for social bonds to form between animals, and allow for a sort of shorthand communication in groups. Essentially, if I show that I’m sad to someone in my pack, there is a chance that he or she will help me. If I feel and then show submissiveness, a stronger member of the pack might decide not to kick me out or kill me. For solitary animals, these feelings would only be a hindrance, so it’s likely that they don’t really have emotions in the sense that we understand them. </p>
<p>Octopuses, for example, are very intelligent animals and can solve complicated puzzles, devise complex hunting strategies, and even learn by pure observation. However, they’re solitary animals and don’t show any evidence of having emotions. On the other hand, you have dogs, who are not particularly intelligent as far as similar mammals go, but are practically geniuses in an emotional sense. Their strong pack bond with the most emotionally advanced animal (us) has made them very good at picking up on subtle emotional cues and understanding what to do in those cases. If your dog sees you’re angry, he will either slink away (if you’re alone) or get ready to fight (if he sees what you’re angry at). If you’re sad, many dogs will come cuddle with you and bring you their toys in an attempt to cheer you up. And any dog owner knows that dogs very likely feel sad or angry themselves from time to time (and if they don’t, they do a convincing enough approximation that it doesn’t really matter)</p>
<p>And if anybody is still reading, this all comes with a caveat. Humans’ unique ability to think about what could have been, to anticipate the future, to imagine all manner of horrors and wonders... all implies that we probably feel emotions differently from most animals. For example, consider an antelope that narrowly escapes a lion attack. When the lion pounces, it definitely feels a sudden rush of fear, prompting it to run for its life. As soon as the danger is passed, the fear mostly subsided. A human doesn’t just feel fear from the lion, though. A human can distinctly picture the pain of sharp claws tearing your flesh and a crushing pair of jaws closing around your neck. We fear that pain. We can imagine our mother crying because her baby got eaten by a lion, and we fear that as well. And long after the lion is gone, we can wake up screaming at night because our imagination just won’t leave us alone. Basically, our very fertile imagination probably means that our feeling of emotion is enhanced compared to other animals</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You stopped at mention of one of the most advanced and complex (and recent) emotions, guilt.   It's only possible (or useful) in the most highly social species, and it's unclear whether it exists in other animals.  Other higher primates perhaps.<br />
Dogs have often been said to feel guilty but studies have shown that this is really just an appearance of guilt, or just our interpretation of their behavior as &quot;guilty&quot;.  What they're really doing is executing a response that they intuitively know will reduce our anger (because as you've noted, they're geniuses at reading human emotions).  They don't feel guilt in the same way we do, they're just doing a pantomime of it that they've learned will get an empathetic response from us, and it works.  That's doesn't mean they're <em>not</em> guilty, that would suggest they're capable of feeling guilt but don't.  They probably would feel guilty for doing something wrong if they could, but they most likely can't so they can't really be blamed.  They don't really have a concept of &quot;wrong&quot;, they just operate by what will or won't make others respond more positively to them.  What they really want is to trigger a warm feeling from us.</p>
<p>Shame is yet another layer, the last commonly accepted complex emotion.  It's similar to guilt but not necessarily the same thing.  Guilt means you know you've done something wrong.  Shame is an awareness of your guilt.  It's a subtle difference and for all intents and purposes usually means the same thing.
If dogs aren't capable of guilt they're certainly not capable of shame.</p>
<p>EDIT: tying back to the OP, as the comment I've responded to has correctly noted, since complex emotions like guilt and shame require a relatively advanced mental calculus, we're more likely to behave in irresponsible ways because our brains don't have the energy to fully think through the potential guilt angle.   Tired brains seek immediate simple pleasure or immediate simple pain avoidance with less thought to consequences.</p></div>		</li>

Emotions are actually strongly linked to the intrinsic predictive activity in the brain, which is constantly making sense of sensory input in light of what is meaningful for the human subject based on prior experience and goal-related opportunities for action. The idea that emerges from this is that 'fear' is not one experience, but a human concept that we use to describe a lot of different instances of experience. Emotions routinely make use of the human conceptual system, which makes the separation between &quot;emotion&quot; and &quot;cognition&quot; (<a href="http://www.affective-science.org/pubs/2011/gross-barrett-emotion-review-2011.pdf" target="_blank">and even emotion and emotion regulation</a>) blurry indeed. </p>
<p>Not trying to refute what you said, since it's a really cogent retelling of the neuroscientific story about emotions that is commonly taught in college. But the cutting-edge science currently underway is steering things in a different direction (at least for human neuroscience). And it seems like you might be genuinely interested in this stuff.</p></div>		</li>
