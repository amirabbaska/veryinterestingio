<p>All of what you said is correct except throw in daily (or even more common) meetings or conference calls where managers or area managers lavish praise on those who are doing those dishonest activities.  It goes like this...</p>
<p>Area Manager on conference call: Look at Tom over there at such-and-such branch... he opened 10 credit cards yesterday... he is soooo fabulous.  Tell us Tom, what are you doing to be so successful?</p>
<p>Tom:  Well, Melanie, I just blah blah blah bullshit.</p>
<p>Me (with those phone muted or saying to myself):  I know what Tom is doing (see your explanation)... I guess if I want to be good at this job I have to open accounts for customers without telling them or lie on their applications.</p>
<p>Every fucking day.  What a terrible existence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even more of a horrible existence when half of the people who come in realize you're a shill and resist the sales process and the other half think you're an unbiased financial advisor just there to help them out.  Either way it feels like shit.</p>
<p>They call it a &quot;sales culture,&quot; but what it amounts to is a company that demands and rewards people who &quot;game&quot; the system then severely punishes the employees who resist the bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This all makes my last experience with Wells Fargo make sense. Years before, I had opened an opportunity account there. I worked hard at not screwing it up to get it to a full fledged account with more access. My husband and I got married and we were going to add him onto my Wells Fargo account. They ran his credit and told him it wasn't good enough to put him on mine, but he could open his own opportunity account. The whole plan was to have one account together. I ended up closing my account and I was put on his at a credit union, which ended up being a better decision anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a team l with a 'stars' reward system. Turned out if you did the puzzle in the newsletter you could win the £50 gift card every 4 weeks as it had an insane stars value due to nobody doing it. Other people caught on and that's was the end of free gift cards :( </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the banking industry either. Having worked in insurance, it's the same miserable existence in a shady industry.  Sales probably won't kill you but it can make you wish you were dead if you're not cut out for it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard about the similar things happening at cellular phone stores. Had a friend who would basicly pad their sales numbers by giving away services. Made him look good but actually cost the company money. And if the desired numbers weren't being hit the bosses would call and harass the employee on a daily basis....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Used to work in cellular. It's worse than that. Those things that they &quot;give&quot; away come at a price. Like, you come in to buy a phone. Then your sales guys says that he has great news. You can have a free tablet with your phone purchase. That sounds sweet, right? There is a catch though, and that is you have a $10 a month access fee for that tablet. Honest reps will tell you about that, and in that case only 1 in 20 or so people will take it. Dishonest reps would say nothing and 1 in 3 customers would take it. There would be times when spiffs on that tablet could pay up to $45 to that rep. Needless to say there were a lot of shady reps. Once the customer finds out they normally come back screaming, and normally at one of the honest reps that didn't do that sort of thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for a lawn care company where an employee would set up fake accounts to get huge comissions. He actually sold a lot of real jobs too, but I was the guy who actually did those jobs so it was annoying to go out to a house that was foreclosed on or abandoned and have to do a job when you knew the company wasn't going to get paid. I started noting those accounts &quot;must get confirmation&quot; before any jobs could get done. I'd go out to a house sometimes and there would be four invoices on the door from three or four months back. It was a waste; nobody clearly lived in those houses or cared how it looked, so why would whoever owned it care if there were weeds?</p>
<p>I don't know what actually happened in the end because he still worked there when I quit to go back to school, but I'm curious if he ever got fired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of reminds me of when I used to work at Toys-R-Us, at least tangentially.  See, they wanted us cashiers to try and get as many people to sign up for the store credit card as possible, with weekly quotas and all that shit.  There were many, <em>many</em> problems with this.</p>
<p>First, there are only so many customers in a given area, and it's a safe bet that not all of them will want Toys-R-Us credit cards—either because they don't shop there frequently, they don't shop there <em>at all</em>, they already have one, or they seriously are not interested.  And I'm somehow supposed to get eleven people to sign up every day?  It's just not possible.</p>
<p>Adding to the issue was that I have to stop and explain the card, then stay stopped and sign them up, while also maintaining a fast flow of customers.  It was ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad (retail manager of 18 years now, and a former toys r us store manager) explained unreachable goals to me like this: </p>
<p>They set the numbers that high because most people will work harder to make their numbers and feel bad for not making them and resolve to work harder next time. In the event that you do hit your numbers you get that sense of achievement that makes you want to do it more. </p>
<p>Until of course you start to see it for what it is (bullshit unreachable quotas) at which point the quick turnover rates of retail employees start to make a lot of sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a call center for a company I'd rather not name.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable how many people call in saying &quot;What's this on my account? I didn't ask for this feature.&quot; or, &quot;They didn't tell me x, y or z at the time of purchase.&quot;</p>
<p>It's unreal. And these people who have to reach these quotas, it's great for them! They can lie and add whatever they want without having to face nearly any consequence. Then, the customers call in furious to me and it is 100% my fault. </p>
<p>I don't make nearly as much money as them and I'm the one trying to do my best to do honest work. It's a crazy system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a data analyst, we live for this stuff.</p>
<p>A data analyst can detect that stuff is fake, IF they have real-world knowledge of how this works.</p>
<p>That is why I advocate working on the front lines.  Seeing what customers do.  Seeing the real, human factors that lead to the data we are seeing.</p>
<p>Wells could have done that part better.  The data was there, because the government reported on it and Wells settled.  So the data was there.  Wells did not detect what was going on fast enough.</p>
<p>Or, you could say they intended to do this from high levels.  But that doesn't make a lot of sense.  Basically, this was probably a failure of situational awareness.  Executives probably did not know.  SHOULD have known.  And at the end of the day, they are accountable for it.  At big companies, failure of situational awareness happens fairly often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I replied elsewhere but that is what makes this hard to believe in terms of how long it went on. Anyone looking at some trending comparisons of avg revenue/account would have noticed oddities.</p>
