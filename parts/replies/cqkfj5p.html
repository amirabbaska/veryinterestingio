<p>Turkey don't recognize the genocide because when the Republic of Turkey was formed after the war </p>

<p>A fact that gets weird when they tried to cash in on the insurance policies of all the people they killed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In July 2004, after the California State Legislature passed the Armenian Genocide Insurance Act, descendants of Armenian Genocide victims settled a case for about 2,400 life insurance policies from New York Life written on Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire. Around 1918, the Turkish government attempted to recover payments for the people it had killed, with the argument that there were no identifiable heirs to the policy holders. The settlement provided $20 million, of which $11 million was for heirs of the Genocide victims. </p>

<p>This response is technically wrong. Turkey believes it's not labelled genocide because there was no central, government ordered intent of genocide, which partly defines genocide in the first place. This is the contentious issue, not whether the republic of Turkey is responsible for the Ottoman Empires action</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of evidence towards it being a civil war, having started before WWI with the Dashnaksutun (Դաշնակցություն) massacres of Turks and Kurds, ending with the population displacement of all Eastern Armenians in WWI.</p>
<p>This, of course, is irrelevant of it being a genocide or not. Just trying to debunk misconceptions.</p>
<p>All the multi-ethnic violence and massacres prior to 1915 lead up to the events we're discussing today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going to ELI5 as best I can, but this is a pretty basic summary of a pretty big and complex issue.</p>
<p>The Armenians (like the Greeks) were a minority Christian population within the Muslim Ottoman empire. While the law granted them certain rights, like the right to worship, it also made them second class citizens. While the Greeks managed to separate themselves from the empire, the Armenians did not. There were repeated pushes for reforms in the late 1800s and early 1900s, to try and gain proper rights for the Armenians, but various political leanings and a lack of public approval meant it never actually happened.</p>
<p>The Balkan wars badly hurt the Ottoman empire, and flooded areas with Armenian populations with Muslim refugees. There were several large Armenian populations near the battlefront between Russia and the Ottoman empire, and the Minister of War blamed a particularly horrible loss on the fact that the Armenians had sided with the Russians.</p>
<p>While this was true (some Armenians sided with the Russians), they absolutely didn't lose because of it, but instead because he, like so many others, was unprepared for Russian winters in the mountains.</p>
<p>From there, the Massacre started - first by drafting, and then everything else C-O-N mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So another ELI5 question, why did the republic of Turkey claim to be the continuation of the Ottoman Empire? Was it a way of trying to maintain dignity and save face? The Treaty of Versailles pretty much dissolved the empire did it not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, the Ottoman Empire had been fairly tolerant of Christians, but during the early 20th century, there was a lot of unrest that led to the overthrow (more or less; the government technically remained the same, but became a constitutional, rather than absolute, monarchy) of the old regime by the liberal Young Turks, who eventually lost power to a nationalist faction that initiated the genocide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turkish person genuinely interested in the subject here:</p>
<p>We are not taught of these events in school deeply and so most people don't really know the truth. I remember during high school my history teacher being upset. In fact, any teacher that talked about this would avoid getting in to detail, and they knew it was plain unfair especially to my ethnic Armenian class mates. </p>
<p>Back to subject, we had learned that Wilson's points (particularly number 12 I suppose) is the biggest factor for the government of the time to take the terrible decision of forcing to march millions of Armenians out of today's eastern Turkey. The reason was to avoid having a majority population of Armenian people in the area and there turning in to Armenia after the WWI. How true is this? </p>
<p>To all my Armenian friends, I am really sorry for our loss. I hope the truth can spread faster and hopefully someday it will force my government to stop being a bunch of ignorant dumbshits. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to preface this by saying that attempting to answer the 'why' question is a complicated endeavor because there is a fear of justifying the atrocity or rationalizing it. With that being said, to my understanding the Ottoman Empire was in decline since the 1500s. Russia continually posed a threat to the empire as seen in the Balkans during the 1600s through the 1800s. The empire was being whittled away at by foreign actors aiding minorities within the Ottoman empire to seek independence. The Russians opened relations with the Armenians to aid them on the border during their advance in WWI. So, in return, the Ottomans replied by ethnic cleansing the area in dispute of all the Armenians to remove the threat from the empire's territorial integrity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if the reason was Armenians siding with russians then why were the other non-muslims like assyrians, greeks and yazidis being killed too. that is a lame excuse I think that the turkish government uses to justify the killing which doesn't stand even the slightest criticism.</p>
<p>It is like Hitler accusing Jews for their defeats in WWI or that the jews had control over the economy and stuff.  Of course the government needed somehow to demonize and dehumanize Armenians in the eyes of those who would be committing the act. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that their decline began that early. Their biggest victory in Constantinople was in 1453. I don't think they really began the descent until the mid 18th century.</p></div>		</li>
