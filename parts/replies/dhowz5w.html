			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you mean by connected. Other than a small nerve and reflex, they don't really share much in the way of direct connection. The canal is distinctly divided from middle ear and rest of throat by the ear drum. </p>
<p>But if you're just looking to connect the word ear with nose and throat, that's much easier as middle ear as a connection to the throat from the Eustachian tube. The nose also more obviously connects to the throat through the nostrils to the nasopharynx. </p>
<p>But lastly, the territory that some specialties cover is often times not only due to anatomy, but also to common diseases that tend to effect all those systems (nephrologist treating with what would typically be thought of as heart meds), as well as somewhat arbitrary tradition from older times (there is often some turf wars between neurosurgery and orthopedics as well as between urology and gynecology). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ENT doctors suddenly make more sense to me.  I always thought the ear in it was a little out of place, but I assumed there was probably some connection.  I assumed it was holes in your head or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Your eardrum separates your <del>inner</del> middle ear from the outside world, so in order to equilibrate the pressure changes you experience (important for good sound transmission), there is a duct between the inner ear and your pharynx.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve" target="_blank">vagus nerve</a> also supplies parasympathetic fibres to the heart. In medical school I was told it was possible to stop someone's heart by pouring ice-cold water into their ear. Don't try that at home, but has OP tried measuring their pulse while applying the Q-tip?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, what would that indicate?  I'll try it later, but would it be higher than normal (or lower) for some reason?</p>
<p>I mean, cleaning my ears gives me what i call an eargasm.  That feeling of when you want to shake your leg like a dog having his belly scratched. Ohhhhhhyeeeeaaaaahh!</p>
<p>So I could see my pulse possibly being higher.</p></div>		</li>
