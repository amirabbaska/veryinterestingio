			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, the males taking better care of bluer eggs could <em>literally</em> be a &quot;chicken and the egg&quot; question. If bluer eggs are more likely to hatch, then it would be advantageous to protect those better, which may lead to birds which naturally lay bluer eggs, which get protected better...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the UV protection, I think I've read it posited that they light colors evolved over white so they could absorb a little sunlight to keep the egg warm while the parents are out hunting. Dark colors would likely absorb too much sunlight and potentially cook the egg. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not in this case.  The eggs aren't poisonous and I don't know of any bright blue poisonous things in N. America for them to be mimicking.  </p></div>		</li>
