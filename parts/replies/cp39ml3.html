			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern day operating systems have built in accessibility software. Microsoft Windows has Narrator, and Mac OS X has it's own equivalent. Typically, blind people would use this to navigate around their computer as it verbally tells them what their cursor is highlighting at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a variety of ways. Some people use screen readers, some people use Braille monitors (sort of).</p>
<p>I typed my response in the same way you would; but with a reader announcing to me what I'm typing to avoid mistakes. There are also a few browser extensions that help simplify a lot of web pages. You get used to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work as a front end developer and care about accessibility on the web. I use voiceover/chromevox alot but I really want to get in touch with people who actually use assistive technology to try out the things I build.</p>
<p>Do you know if there is any subbreddit for people who use assistive technology of any kind where I can ask for help?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird question: do you write in Braille? Is that a thing? Or would you use a regular alphabet and if so how?</p>
<p>I'm completely clueless on this topic, I apologize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a computer, no; you can just use a keyboard.</p>
<p>On paper? Yes. You can use this horrible stylus thing combined with a grate-like contraption to poke Braille into a page. It's also possible to use a Braille typewriter, but carrying one of those sucks.</p>
<p>They also have Brailler printers now that you can hook up to a laptop; very useful.</p>
<p>Generally i would say computers are where it's at. I wouldn't really want to have to use the stylus and grate method often.</p></div>		</li>
