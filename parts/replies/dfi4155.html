			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  The ability to prevent spoofed caller ID is easily done and can be implemented with filtering software.  Also, every call in logged for billing purposes and its would be a simple sql query to find out what originating switch is generated thousands of calls an hour.</p>
<p>They don't do it because each call placed means REVENUE for the telco.  Unless you remove the ability to make money on those millions of calls they telco's will never put a real effort into stopping them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents number got spoofed a few years back. We got hounded by return calls for 2 days asking why we were calling them. Some people were understanding as they had been spam called by similar numbers in past weeks. Others weren't so understanding and thought it was our fault...</p></div>		</li>
