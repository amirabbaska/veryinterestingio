			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever spun in place? If you bring your arms into your body, your rotation speed increases. All the particles of matter that make up a planet have some momentum, and as gravity pulls it together it gives the entire object a spin. (Most of the planets spin the same way because I assume the matter was already orbiting around the star, as the star forms before the planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forget that you're in space. All be it a particularly dense volume of space but space nonetheless... Every direction you go is just nothingness when the density decreases again. We're just on our little spinning ball thinking we're great but hey, you can't point in a direction that doesn't lead to nothingness! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's due to how they form. Planets don't just pop out of supernovae, they're created by the resulting elements that are spewed out after the fact, in a planetary nebula. Gravity brings a bunch of these elements together, and due to gravity not being equal everywhere in the proto planet, different parts attract stronger than others, and it all starts to spin (this is called acretion IIRC), before collapsing in on itself into a planet. Because space is, obviously, a vacuum, it's extremely difficult for the new planet to lose its spin (on earth, spinning things stop spinning because of friction mainly, which requires a body to give energy to), so it just keeps going. That's not to say that it won't stop eventually; light from a stat will, extremely, extremely slightly change the planets spin (enough that it's almost completely negligible, of course), and other bodies coming near it can also affect it. Whenever we use the Earth, or any other body, to propel a spaceship farther out from the Sun, that bodies gets slowed down ever so slightly (again, negligible, but measurable). And the moon is also steadily slowing down the Earth, and has been for millions of years.</p></div>		</li>
