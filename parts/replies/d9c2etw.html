			<div class="markdown"><p>I am bilingual English(Native)/Chinese(fluent) and learning Japanese. Do you have any theories on this and learning other languages? I started off translating English to Japanese in my head when I first started learning. Now, sentences emerge more naturally initially as Japanese or sometimes even Chinese, which feels more natural. I know that as we become more fluent in a learned language, the less we rely on translating it from a more familiar language.</p>
<p>I also have a friend who spoke only Chinese and had a pretty good grasp of English (conversational) and she moved to Japan. After living there for 10 odd years, she forgot all her English more or less. Now when she (tires to) speaks English, she now speaks like a Japanese native with all their idiosyncrasies, even though she speaks Chinese fine still.</p>
<p>What the deal? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Use it or lose it? It may have helped her to learn Japanese through English, as this would the neuronal pathways in her mind associated with English to the ones forming for Japanese. The brain will prune away pathways which we don't use. However, if the English were closely intertwined with the Japanese, perhaps fewer of the English connections would die off? I'm only guessing. I'm not an expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay I am very confused by some of the coments in relation to my self.  Like I have a inner voice that is well I guess an internal monologue voice I actually talk to my head and talks back.  Like full on conversations constantly through the day or while reading the news or watching tv.  And I can also visualize things easily from my past and create things easily.  But I talk in my head with the other internal voice not out loud. But it's well I'm. Me and the voice is s different viewpoint I guess, doesn't everyone have this same internal process and if not how do they make discussions... Or get tips and shit when talking etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im guessing this is just many parts of the brain interacting.</p>
<p>You have an idea. You think about sharing or formulating this idea, and speech brain prepares a framework for your idea. You dont speak it but it still gets build because thinking happens ultra fast. Like you cant talk if formulating an idea or answer takes a minute. So every idea you focus on gets prepared into something resembling a sentence. </p>
<p>Now, speech brain just generated an idea or sentence structure, and even tho it isnt ''used'' by your mouth the rest of the brain still get to spot the existence of this idea you just built. Analytical brain checks that idea and starts to ponder on it. It doesnt matter that you said that, or in fact didnt say that. The moment the speech structure is created the speech recongnion will spot it and send it to be analyzed like anything else you'd hear. So you ponder on that idea and react to it. </p>
<p>Then it loops. Because reacting to this idea will prompt a new speech structure lightning fast, in case you need to speak it. Which you ''hear'' thus analyze thus react to. This is how you ''talk'' to yourself. </p>
<p>If your brain is busy or on autopilot, then it may opt to forego that specific approach for somethimg more conceptual. Like thinking in numbers or sounds or ideas or a 3d image of something.  If you drive and see a dude coming at you, then your brain is not reallu focusing on makig a valid statement thats syntaxically correct, it just wants to receive data from your senses and react to them instantly without speech brain getting in the way and sucking processing power. Because your brain cant actuaply multitask much, it just switch between all tasks super fast and lose efficiency doing so. This is also why you arent always talking to yourself, it only happens when you focus kn it and nothing else gets in the way or is more important.</p>
<p>When I play music i visualise concepts and note locations but i dont have time to ''talk to myself'' because hiting the notes take less time than generating a speec structure and reacting to it. Same for when you make split decisions in a game. Afterward, you can take time to formulate an idea and react to it, and debate it with yourself. Because we think at lightning speed, but tslking to ourselves takes a bit longer since you need to wait for the speech structure to ''play out'' before the brain can hear it and react to it. </p>
<p>This is why you cant interupt your own inner monologue because you know what you are going to say. Because you dont. Its being generated while the rest of the is on standby, waiting to react to the new speech strucure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, if it's loud enough it breaks the barrier between thought and speech and it's almost like I was whispering my thoughts.</p></div>		</li>
