			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one thing that a lot of people dont appreciate enough is that we are making 11nm transistors with 193nm light. That is like making trying to make a watch gear using a sledge hammer. Except in this case the gear is smaller than light itself. Its amazing that it works. Even more amazing when you see the SEM images and see how ugly it all looks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's with DUV technology. EUV light source technology is beginning to take over in the industry and produces 14nm light. Intel and Samsung are among the companies who have already adopted and are working on R&amp;D with these machines. With a DUV system you have to kinda cheat things and do multiple passes (run the same wafer 5 to 10 times) to get smaller lithography. EUV will allow a 10nm chipset to be made in 1-2 passes reducing manufacturing time and energy costs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's if they ever get it working on a production line. They are getting closer but it's been a tremendous expense (more than usual) to develop this technology.</p>
<p>The next generation of chips won't be cheap for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the big boys have put a lot of money into it, but there are lots of issues that make it troublesome for manufacturing. EUV has been promised for several generations of transistor technology, but just has not delivered. Though, you can tell from the promises of global foundries that they are banking on EUV finally hitting primetime. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the part i don't really understand.<br />
I know that going lower in the wavelength of light means no longer having access to working prisms and mirrors because they just don't work with light of that wavelength (why?).  </p>
<p>but how on earth is it possible to make structures smaller than 1/2 or so of the wavelength of the used light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What helps is that the masks, the layer that allows the light to shine through, is made with an electron beam which is much more resolution than the wavelength of light. Plus there are various tricks like double patterning that allow you to get better resolution from the light. So you could imagine trying to paint something in detail with a paint roller, it is super hard, but if you had really fine control over protecting parts with the painters mask, you can kinda make it work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in etching for AMD when I graduated high school. We used concentrated HF acid. Safety gear consisted of a thick rubber apron, two layers of thick rubber gloves that went to your elbows, and a face shield. </p>
<p>My station also consisted of covering wafers with an aluminum compound and measuring the thickness. I can confirm that a speck of dust was damaging and a single eyelash could destroy an entire wafer of a hundred CPUs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget the years of debugging individual components, slightly altering the recipes, debugging again, altering recipes, debugging, altering until you finally get a working chip. It can also take weeks to get a wafer from bare silicon to a few functional layers, so changes are tedious and drawn out.</p></div>		</li>
