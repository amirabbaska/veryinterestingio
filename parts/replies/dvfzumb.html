			<div class="markdown"><p>Not totally true about the long distance runners/triathletes. Not totally wrong either. </p>
<p>The carbs the gels and such are made of absorb faster than others, which is needed as you need to convert hundreds, if not thousands, of calories from food to energy in a short time. Short time means ingest and convert to usable energy while racing. </p>
<p>Solid foods (like bread) take longer for the body to break down and absorb. Dextrose and sucrose are much faster. </p>
<p>It’s not necessarily keeping energy up, but keeping your body’s amount of usable energy at a level needed for the sport, as you run out of the really good stuff around 60-90 minutes. You can still keep goin after that, but you’re using less than ideal energy sources from your body for the sport. </p>
<p>You may have meant all that, but I wanted to add some details. </p>
<p>Source: completed many triathlons, including a few half Ironman and full Ironman distance races. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've &quot;bonked&quot; once on a bike ride after about 2 hours. It sucks. I was basically riding 2-3 minutes at a time slowly back home, sitting down to rest for 5. I wasn't really well prepared although I did have lots of water, Gatorade, and ate some fruit bars throughout the ride.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonks suck. They’re totally possible even with proper nutrition, however, nutrition and hydration helps prevent them. </p>
<p>These are similar to cramps - can’t totally prevent them. Look at professional Ironman athletes and or cyclists. Happens often despite them training and practicing the sport and distance and intensity often. </p></div>		</li>
