<p>Also probably why the drinking-we can't smell it when even making out with someone who is drinking. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the body. Different things at play have different effects, and some people excrete different amounts of things through the skin.</p>
<p>For example, I have a genetic cholesterol disorder. When not properly medicated, my cholesterol levels are well over 500, and diet has zero effect.  Now, whenever my cholesterol is anything above 150 total, if I have too much refined sugar like a soda or excessive candy, my lipid excretion goes up like crazy. I won't be able to wear contacts because they get lipid deposits right away, and my shirts get yellowed and ruined. It has a smell that I know and hate,though my wife says it isn't noticeable. My hands and skin get oily right away, and it stop after a few hours.</p>
<p>But when my cholesterol production is controlled like now, I can drink a soda and my skin stays  fine, I can wear contacts, no bad smell, etc.</p>
<p>That's a super long explanation just to say that as much as we know about the body, there's always something different going on we might not think of, including processes that change what we excrete. Thus some people smell like alcohol, while some can get plastered and still only have smell on their breath.</p>
<p>Edit to add: I have no evidence but I'm curious if women would tend to have the alcohol smell on their skin more than men, due to the difference in their capillary system and their skin. </p></div>		</li>
