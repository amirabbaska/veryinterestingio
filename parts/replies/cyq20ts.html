<p>Moiré, or that 'fly-screen' effect, is more pronounced in a 4K to HD conversion and must be carefully managed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you know why that is? Is it just that in HD you get moiré in areas where you didn't have any in the 4k, and no moiré in areas where you did have moiré? Or is HD more moiré sensitive? Cause if I understand moiré right, it's just a repetition of two patterns, and I don't see how a larger pattern (HD) could be inherently more sensitive to moiré than a smaller pattern (4k). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert, but my understanding is moiré is caused by line binning, which is where the sensor can do more pixels than you're recording, and the camera just dumps the lines it's not recording. As a result, your sensor starts resembling a fly-screen rather than a neat grid.</p>
<p>Same when you dub 4K down to HD. Do it properly, and you get a nice image. Do it through line binning, and once again your HD image is like it's been through a fly-screen. And if your original 4K image already had a bit of line binning, then the effect becomes more pronounced.</p></div>		</li>
