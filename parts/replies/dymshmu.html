<p>It's not possible to answer this question.</p>
<p>Basically, you're asking &quot;if we ignore the laws of physics (because they're preventing faster than 'C' travel), what do the laws of physics say would happen in this situation?&quot;, i.e. the question doesn't make sense. </p>
<p>Why can't anything travel faster than 'C'? Because the equations (which have been thoroughly tested, time and time again) show that it would require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object to 'C'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really a caveat; nothing in that case is traveling faster than c. It's just that enough space is being created in a large enough volume that two points that are separated by enough distance appear to be receding from one another faster than c. No particle(s) is/are actually moving faster than c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>how</em> is it that they happen to travel at the <strong>same</strong> speed though? is it because they're the product of a (for e.g.) more fundamental &quot;force&quot;? or perhaps one is the product of the other? or...?</p></div>		</li>
