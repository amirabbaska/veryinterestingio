			<div class="markdown"><p>US hospital worker here.  I'm not familiar with technical definitions, but the generally-accepted newer standards are that bloody materials only go to the biohazard bin if they're completely soaked through with blood.  If something's just mildly bloody it goes in the regular trash.</p>
<p>Edit:  Obviously the change in disposal <em>is not</em> due how potentially infectious the blood is; it's the same blood either way.  I believe it has more to do with how easy it is to be exposed to it.  A piece of gauze that that is at saturation capacity is much more likely to sling a drop of blood if mishandled vs a one that has 100&#37; absorbed the blood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was really confused for a bit about why our bicycle workout calendar had options for how much you're bleeding. Then I realised you're probably talking about another type of cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do this too. My rule of thumb is if I'd throw it away willy-nilly in my home trash, it can go in regular trash. If it looks like the neighbors would ask questions, it goes in biohazard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just started at a large chain restaurant and while vomit and poop get their own special deal, blood is still considered a biohazard, just not as hard to deal with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excuse me, sir? Can you repeat the specials?</p>
<p>Not a problem, madam. Tonight we have
what we are calling Omble Chevalier:
Arctic Char, Summer Squash, Olive Bagna Cauda, served over Vomit and Farro. $24. The Vomit can be substituted with Poop if you prefer. </p>
<p>Sounds wonderful. Question... is Blood still considered a biohazard. </p>
<p>Indeed madam. Just not as hard to deal with. </p>
<p>Fantastic. I will try the special with Vomit. </p>
<p>Excellent choice. And for the gentleman?</p></div>		</li>
