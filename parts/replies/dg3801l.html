			<div class="markdown"><p>I really don't know how it works for most people.  But having been in the military for 20 years, I can't sleep beyond 7:00am.  No matter what time I go to sleep the night before, I am always awake before then.  When it is a work/school day, I look at the clock the night before and remind myself of what time I need to be up.  9 times out of 10, I am awake 15 minutes before that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a student and when I'm at school, my sleep schedule is fucked because I don't have a regular time I get myself up every morning and some nights I need/want to stay up later than others. I've always slept better over the summer when I have a regular 7:00am job to go to instead of class</p></div>		</li>
