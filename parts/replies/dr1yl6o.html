			<div class="markdown"><p>I work near the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Lab, and they use Hg as the target metal. It spallates similarly to W, but since it's liquid, they can circulate the Hg through the target to dissipate heat and get more continuous neutron beams.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the old days we all used to have particle accelerators. They were called cathode ray tubes. Of course, they have to be a bit bigger to make neutrons but they are small enough to fit inside a nuclear weapon as they form part of the trigger. </p>
<p>Being weapon related, small generators are normally very secret but <a href="https://newatlas.com/sandia-neutristor-neutron-generator-chip/23856/" target="_blank">here</a> is a nice little article on the technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutron scientists typically need a lot of neutrons in order to get experiments done quickly with a large signal-to-noise ratio. So we need a lot of beam at a much higher energy than you can get to with a cathode ray tube. The European Spallation Source, which is currently under construction, uses a 1km long linear accelerator to achieve the energy required for the best optimised neutron production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. I used an extreme version for illustration but there were other desktop varieties for smaller experiments. Not that cheap and you still need the big accelerators for larger projects.</p></div>		</li>
