I thought it was more along the lines of, &quot;Hey, we're breaking shit, let's see if we can Ctrl+Z this whole thing before we're 100 percent fucked.&quot; But, rather, it's more along the lines of, &quot;Okay this is totally normal, but we're throwing gas on the fire here. How do we put this into slow motion for as long as possible?&quot;</p>
<p>The way a lot of sources talk, it sounds like climate change is entirely the fault of people. What they don't mention is that things changing is a normal thing for the planet to go through and would happen no matter what we're doing, but that people and their consumption of resources/burning of fuels is making it happen <em>faster</em> than if it were happening naturally. I didn't realize this either until I made this topic and people explained stuff to me.</p></div>		</li>
