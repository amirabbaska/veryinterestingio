<p>Let's be sure to account for environmental factors like getting punched in the face by professional face-punchers for a living, and the possibility that faces will react to facepunching with similar effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It hardly makes a difference in the long run. It'll spike testosterone for a short while before it falls back to regular levels and if you exercise at high intensity for too long (Which isn't far off from when your testosterone peaks) it'll plummet.</p>
<p>And no, only weight lifting actually improves testosterone for a short while. Anything that's remotely like endurance will lower testosterone levels. So combat sports with the continuous activity will not spike testosterone levels, it will lower them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then why do some ethnicities men don't have hair loos regularly? E. g. American Indians were said to not lose their hear, and on top of that, they supposedly have especially thick hair. Surely this is not because hormone levels differ so significantly between different populations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follicle sensitivity, thresholding and androgen levels differ a fair bit between individuals. Some men get beards at 12, some lose their hair at 20, some never do. There is no reason not to imagine that there are sub-populations of humans with different average responses for these features.</p>
<p>I couldn't comment on American Indians with out seeing some definitive research in this area. Appearance stereotypes may just be stereotypes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is from <a href="https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs3827760" target="_blank">a mutation in the EDAR (ectodysplasin A receptor) gene</a> that is extremely common in East Asians and Native Americans that causes the thick and straight hair you are speaking of.  It also causes them to have <a href="https://fcmdsc.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/tooth-blog-1.jpg?w=500" target="_blank">shovel shaped incisors</a>.  </p>
<p>The commonality is variable throughout the populations, with 65.4% of Japanese and 87.4% of Northern Han Chinese being homozyogus for the variant.</p>
<p>It is entirely absent from ancestral and most modern populations, including sub-Saharan Africans and the vast majority of Europeansâ€”with the outlier there being the Finnish people, where 11.1% of the population was found to be a carrier for the variant (heterozygous).  </p>
