			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, this is the same reason that Teslas &quot;creep&quot; when you let off the brake. Even though, as an electric car, it doesn't mechanically need to creep when you let off the brake, it's what people expect cars to do. There was actually a period of a couple years where they didn't, but they pushed an update out to all cars because people demanded it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sure hope so, because as someone who has driven manuals all their life it would be annoying having to get used to your car moving forward when you let off the brake instead of it staying still or rolling in the direction of the incline you're on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because people are used to it. Also, manual transmission cars will do it too, if you leave it in first gear, and come off the clutch. You can burn the shit out of the clutch by leaving it in idle and letting it build up speed on its own, or accelerate normally but let off the gas as soon as you're past the stall speed. The car will continue very slowly, the speed of the engine at idle in first gear. It's just a lot harder to do than an automatic. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Why? Call it driver-seat comfort food; gears are simply more satisfying, and they more closely correspond to the sounds and sensations of vehicle speed and acceleration that we're used to.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same for everything else. Some people expect it and want it because they're used to it and may associate it with being &quot;right&quot; or quality.</p>
<p>Some cars pipe engine noises INTO the cabin, while others try to reduce as much noise as possible.</p>
<p>People prefer 24 fps in movies, over 60 fps, even though 60 is &quot;technically&quot; better &quot;quality&quot;. It's so smooth that people associate it with soap operas, which is poor quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm this.  When I see high framerate TVs at costco, it bothers me how &quot;fake&quot; movies look.  Even though it looks more realistic.  </p>
<p>Ironically, I'm a masterracer; just not for movies I guess</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, I had a similar experience for a different reason last night. </p>
<p>I am rewatching all of Star Wars on blueray. Apparently it's been remastered (again).</p>
<p>I can see all the shoddy paint markings on the uniforms and sets. It really breaks the illusion of space-age metal that I grew up seeing. Darth Vader's original Ep. IV helmet looks like an amateur-hour reproduction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people look for fun in a car. Others look for as much luxury as possible.</p>
<p>When you design a car, you make decisions depending on who you want to sell the car to.</p>
<p>In this case, Honda is trying to be everything to everyone. So if you favor quiet, just don't smash the gas pedal. Otherwise, smash it and you get the fun zoom zoom noises.</p>
<p>Honda also set up the suspension to be somewhat sporty, but not so sporty that it jiggles your bones. Just take a drive in a non-Sport trim Subaru Impreza and compare it with the Civic's ride. The Subaru is far, far, FAR more floaty and comfortable..., because Subaru made that decision. They decided to do it another way, by giving an entirely separate trim a sportier ride.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So they engineered a transmission to be extra efficient by having continuous gear ratios, then they artificially lowered the efficiency so people wouldn't be annoyed? If you're going to hate the CVT and make it pretend to be a traditional transmission, why even get a CVT in the first place? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's cheaper and lighter. It's actually less efficient, even with continuous ratios (belt &lt; toothed gears).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not true, the CVT has substantially better efficiency at low engine speeds. It's only at the higher engine speeds where transmission losses become more apparent, thus it's utilized more often in efficient cars. A standard transmission has far more moving mass and is therefore subjected to inertial losses.</p></div>		</li>
