			<div class="markdown"><p>So people (patrons) just have their credit card or bank account linked to the website and it charges them automatically every month? Also, what kind of &quot;special stuff&quot; would these patrons get in return? Youtube is free so why pay when you can just watch for free?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some people use it like a tip jar.  Just like, &quot;Hey I like what you're doing.  I'd like to see more of it. I can contribute $5 a month.&quot;  </p>
<p>If creators can get enough people to pledge, they often times quit their jobs to focus solely on the things they're creating.  That means more content for the supporters.  Win-win. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's the idea!</p>
<p>Patreon does support &quot;reward tiers&quot;. For instance, people who pledge at my $2 tier get their name in the credits of my games, and people at the $10 tier get early access to new builds.</p>
<p>But with that said, a lot of people use patreon because they're just trying to support the content creator. Not all patreon members offer reward tiers. I'm not entirely sure what rewards a Youtuber might offer, but it could include the ability to vote on polls (&quot;What game should I LP next?), access to a private discord, or stuff like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It kinda depends on the content being created. There are plenty of indie game devs on Patreon who give out builds of the game's they're developing to the Patreon supporters they have as a means of thanking the people who donated, and as a means to allow those who made donations to tell them how they feel about the game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response. Question: Do you ever feel held back by your patreon obligations? Obviously the more you do for your donors, the higher your work load.  Do you feel that it's sustainable to continue catering to your donors while leaving room for creative growth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually my favorite part of this gig: I do exactly what I want, 100% of the time. This is what I used to do in my spare time for fun; patreon just lets me have a predictable stream of income for doing it.</p></div>		</li>
