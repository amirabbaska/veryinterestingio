			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting that women not only evolved wider 'hips' (and subcutaneous fat in that region), but have evolved a different elbow shape so their forearm angles away from that region. It's called the &quot;carrying angle&quot;, and is significantly greater in women than men. </p></div>		</li>

<p>RESULTS:
The mean carrying angle of male on the left limb was 7.0359째 and the female was 7.8030째 and the mean carrying angle of male on the right limb was 4.5509째 and the female was 4.9545째. We observed the greater carrying angle in non-dominant limb than the dominant limbs. There was significant positive correlation between height of students and carrying angle left (r =0.0866, p= 0.048&lt;0.05), negative correlation between height and carrying angle right (r= -0.082, p= 0.058 &gt;0.05).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always get people commenting that my arms look like they bend odd and i show them that when i put my arms by my side it's impossible for them to hang straight. They bend just slightly at my waist so my elbow sits more in my waist and my arm passes my hip. I just assumed i was a freak!</p></div>		</li>
