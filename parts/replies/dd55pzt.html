<p>Scientific thinking is literally asking a question, and seeking to answer it with facts, and drawing conclusions from the evidence. Whether you're trying to conduct a poll (need a representative sample for it to be even close to viable, and you need a large enough sample size), or looking up reliable data to analyze how a policy has affected something like the air or water quality, all of it can be helped by scientific thinking. You need to be able to critically look at data and facts and understand the cause and effect. </p>
<p>Carl Sagan said that &quot;science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.&quot; </p>
<p>That applies here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fully agree. As someone who works in government, specifically criminal justice (PhD), there is not enough of this way of thinking--though it is starting to become more and more prevalent. It still has a ways to go, though. Particularly because it is a social science. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you mind elaborating on the type of thinking you normally witness. I've realized I live in a bubble since most of my friends are science majors. I'm still trying to get over the idea that people's first instinct is to find some type of scientific or well researched evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Social scientists are scientists. It's sometimes more difficult because your data are often more difficult to collect or harder to analyze, and your variables nearly impossible to control. </p></div>		</li>
