			<div class="markdown"><p>True, the variability in those factors should be spread among the experimental groups and therefore decrease the likelihood of observing an effect if there is one.  But their sample size was pretty impressive, so it's unlikely that accounts for the null effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it belongs in every science thread anywhere: Correlation is not Causation. This would be a near impossible thing to study as a cause/effect question, because of the sheer number of variables and how hard it is to have any sort of controls.</p>
<p>Speculation: Either way one would expect people who read more Fiction to have more Empathy. Teasing apart which came first, or which caused the other, or if the two are <em>both</em> the results of other factors, or if they're actually completely unconnected would be maddening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both studies I linked were experimental, so assessing causation. Both found no correlation when using an experimental model, meaning it is highly unlikely that there is a causative link from &quot;reading fiction&quot; to &quot;higher empathy.&quot; </p>
<p>It's very easy to claim &quot;correlation is not causation,&quot; but we have methods to expand on correlation to test causal arguments, and both of these studies do so.  You are right that observational studies are limited in determining causation; that's what experiments are for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this belongs as a reply to every pedant who thinks they're breaking new ground with this comment: correlation does not necessarily equal causation, but it does wink suggestively in its general direction.</p>
<p>Correlation is perfectly good evidence of a casual relationship, it just doesn't prove anything.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, correlation does not mean it's not causation.
As in, if there is causation then there is correlation. </p></div>		</li>
