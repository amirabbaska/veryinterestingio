			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of things can. Sudden altitude changes, being in a plane as it pressurizes, or even weather systems moving through.</p>
<p>Your ears can equalize the pressure on their own, but in day-to-day life the pressure differences are rather small so you never really notice them. When the pressure outside your ears changes rapidly, your ears can't react fast enough. Eventually they pop which is just a very sudden equalization. It can also happen the other way. If you have a cold, the ducts in your ears (which are physically linked to your sinuses and therefore your snotty nose) can get clogged up which means your ears can't do anything to equalize the pressure to the outside world. It also can <del>increase</del> decrease the pressure inside your ears too much which causes negative pressure inside. If your sinuses very suddenly drain (like after you've taken a decongestant) you might get the very same equalization &quot;pop&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say I manually pop my ears by plugging my nose and blowing. Everything gets immediately louder and then gradual becomes normal. Is that loudness that occurs supposed to be what I should be hearing? Or is it an overreaction to the sudden change in pressure and then it equalizes over time? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of your inner ear as a Pringle can and the outside pressure changes are like taking that unopened pringles can onto a plane.  It bulges the soft top right?  Thatâ€™s your ear drum.  Swallowing opens a temoporary hole in the can and equalizes the pressure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. I would also point out that a distinct effect is that the lower frequencies come back after popping, for the same reason. Just like stretched rubber band emits a higher note than a relaxed one, the eardrum when stretched does not conduct low frequencies well.</p></div>		</li>
