<p>wat... muscle knots are definitely a thing.  </p>
<p>Things do not need to be directly observable to prove that they exist, i.e., black holes, muscle knots, gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We dont have enough evidence to support they exist my ELi5 was simply we dont know, nor do we even know if they are an actual thing so we do not nor can we even begin to speculate on what causes them. The NIHI believes muscle overuse is the prime cause, and they go on to say there isnt enough evidence to fully support this as definitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you and I both drop a coin from the same place, we both observe gravity similarly, so we can measure that and come to similar conclusions.</p>
<p>However, if we both have some discomfort in the same place on our bodies that feel like &quot;knots.&quot;  I can't conclude from that observation that they are both caused by the same thing (that lumpy thing under your skin may not be the same thing as my lumpy thing).  I also cannot assume that our discomfort is caused by the knot.  Your discomfort may be, whereas mine maybe from a different source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didnt say they dont exist, but said IF they exist. They are still in theory.</p>
<p>Here is the thing though, TrPs are not likely palpable to anyone other than the individual with them. The majority of the time someone claiming they can feel a TrP the are actually rolling across muscle bellies, tendons, or muscle borders. </p>
<p>For example, the go to place to find a knot is the trapezius. What you are actually feeling when you find something that squirms under your hand is not a knot, but it is the edge of the muscle. The trapezius has many insertions and origins, and rolls over itself on its way from the acromion all the way to the base of the skull. What is palpable is this rolling of the muscle. Its very painful to compress because its causing or could be causing damage. Not because its all a huge knot. The same pain would exist if you grabbed your bicep and squished it with equal force.</p></div>		</li>
