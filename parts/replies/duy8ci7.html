			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah most people breathe our 21% O2 content air and maintained a blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98-100%. Increasing the oxygen content of what you’re breathing won’t improve that any further obviously. </p>
<p>Of course this changes in people with respiratory diseases like pneumonia or COPD or people who are actively engaging in vigorous exercise </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never thought of it, but if you put a pulse-ox on an athlete, would his O2 level drop as he began to feel out of breath?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Oxygen saturation remains normal in healthy population regardless of the physical exertion. It's the internal respiration (gas exchange between the tissue and the blood) that plateaus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And just to tack on, your body basically extracts more oxygen when exercising. It automatically does this when your body temp rises, or the environment of your cells becomes acidic (when you are building up lactic acid for example), among other situations. </p>
<p>The end result is your venous blood has a bit lower oxygen content but your oxygen saturation remains constant at or near 100%. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If he has normal functioning lungs, then no. Also, breathing is usually not the limiting factor in exercise, it's the heart blood output. As such, blood oxygenation by the lungs remains optimal even with very intense exercises.</p>
<p>If the saturation drops during an exercise, it means the lungs are affected.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about free divers who hyperventalate before attempting a deep dive? This seems to have a very real and noticable effect. What is happening if their blood is already at 100% oxygen saturation just from breathing normally?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hyperventilation blows off CO2, which is typically what controls our breathing rate... we don’t really breathe faster and harder when working out because we need oxygen, it’s because of a buildup of CO2/carbonic acid in the bloodstream. </p>
<p>Hyperventilating reduces CO2 concentration below normal, allowing you to hold your breath for longer (again... you don’t exactly need more O2 for a while... that’s why CPR is moving towards chest compressions only).</p>
<p>On the flip side, hyperventilation can absolutely be a bad thing if too much CO2 is blown off, resulting in low CO2 concentration aka “hypocapia” which causes symptoms like tingling/numbness of the extremities and lips and eventually unconsciousness. This happens a lot when people have anxiety/panic attacks and the introductions of these new symptoms tends to mans it worse so that they think something is truly wrong with them medically. It’s also why having them breathe into a bag helps - they are rebreathing some of their CO2 to prevent hypocapnia</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you're healthy and not currently engaged in aerobic activity and existing in  normal air pressure then 100% oxygen won't feel too different.</p>
<p>However that's not the full story. There are two ways of thinking about breathing in an high oxygen environment:</p>
<p>Normobaric: Normal atmospheric pressure (at sea level).</p>
<p>Hyperbaric: Higher pressures.</p>
<p>In a normobaric environment breathing 100% oxygen for several days without any breaks will result in some degree of pulmonary injury, likely the result of a higher concentration of oxygen free radicals. (Oxidative stress to alveolar cells.)</p>
<p>In a hyperbaric setting breathing 100% oxygen is considered toxic over time. Short term effects include disorientation, vision issues and seizures. Death is certain between 1.3 and 1.5 atmospheres when breathing 100% oxygen. There are other physiological changes including reduced heart rate/other circulatory related issues.</p>
<p>I'm sure someone with much more knowledge about this will chime in on any errors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll chime in. 1.3 to 1.5 atmospheres, or PP02 (partial pressure of Oxygen) does not immediately cause death. The actual value is much much higher, and it differs between various people. </p>
<p>The biggest problem is seizures that occur. These can occur usually anywhere above 1.6, or 1.4 for long periods. The big thing to keep in mind here, is that it's not usually immediate, and everyone has different tolerances. Some people can survive 2.0 or above  for several minutes/hours and be perfectly fine.</p>
<p>So why are the seizures such a problem? I mean, it's not death, you can recover and move on, right? Well the most common time people breathe high oxygen percentages under hyperbaric conditions is when scuba diving. No, not the normal recreational diving on coral reefs at some resort, but diving that requires different gas mixes, or decompression. So. You've had a seizure. Your mouthpiece/regulator falls out. You drown. It was indirectly caused by the toxicity of Oxygen, but the oxygen itself didn't cause death, and neither did the seizures.</p>
<p>For efficent decompression, a setpoint of 1.6 to 1.4 somewhere is actually used pretty often. It take long exposures of these levels to have high risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically nothing unless your saturation levels are below 98%. Maybe a little bit of cold air when you breathe in with nasal prongs but otherwise there isn’t a difference. People who have a O2 sat below 98% will notice that it clears your head and lets you have sharper thoughts. </p>
<p>Fun fact, breathing 100% O2 is also really handy if you have a hangover, although an IV with normal saline is much better for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, this sub. The top answer fails completely to answer the question asked and is rambling and poorly composed.</p>
<p>This sub is depressing.</p>
<p>Edit: here is the answer</p>
<p>If you are healthy already, you will not notice the oxygen in the room if it was magically increased to 80-90%. It would not be any easier to breathe. Your body is already fully saturated with O2 as it is, it can't get any higher.</p>
<p>Obviously, people with lung problems like COPD or lung infection would feel a lot better as they were probably not fully saturated with oxygen to begin with. However, it's actually dangerous to give people with COPD (emphysema) too much oxygen for too long. It can depress their drive to breathe and case CO2 to build up in them which can be very dangerous. This won't happen in a normal healthy person.</p>
<p>If the new atmosphere was pumped in with dry/cold oxygen, you'd notice that but not the oxygen itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't true, you can suffer hyperoxia with too much oxygen for too long. The major symptoms are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity" target="_blank">CNS toxicity, pulmonary toxicity (sometimes burns), vision problems, and vomiting. </a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blood is saturated. That's what 100% SpO2 means. If you fill the lungs with oxygen you are removing the nitrogen and therefore creating a reservoir of oxygen that the blood can pick up as needed but the blood doesn't get any more saturated. 100% saturation is the limit regardless. A normal person is already at 99 or 100% just on room air.</p></div>		</li>
