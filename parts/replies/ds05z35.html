			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this except I'm lower class and don't understand half of what you just said regarding skiing and stuff, but the class system definitely does exist and it annoys me when middle class people try to pretend it doesn't just because they don't personally notice. There is a lot of classism that goes on in the UK that goes unreported purely because I think the working class just doesn't realize it's a problem or they don't notice it's happening.</p>
<p>I was brought up in a single-parent household in the UK, my mum was born here but her parents were both from Hungary and she was taken off them and put into care at a very young age. As a result we've always been too poor for the middle class but never really fit into the working class. If you live on a council estate, your support network and friends only come from your family, but we never had anything like that so we kind of ended up excluded. We basically got treated like immigrants even though we're white british.</p>
<p>It's a controversial thing to say, but I don't like the working class. There's too much bigotry, too much willful ignorance and of course too much crime and other stuff you get from living in a poor area. I don't like the middle class much either, but I'd rather deal with people who are annoying than people who are violent and dangerous. It does annoy me a little bit that people excuse a lot of bad working class behaviour on money. I'm very defensive of the working class, but the people in our street had Sky TV, annual holidays to Spain and new trainers constantly while we literally went cold and hungry because we couldn't make ends meet, yet we didn't act like animals.</p>
<p>I have a decent job now and can afford to pay rent, shop at Waitrose, go on multiple holidays and not have minor unexpected expenses ruin my life - it's an amazing feeling. On the flipside, I don't save any money and spend a lot on drugs (I'm not an addict though). There's no escaping some parts of British class life though; no matter how far away you run - if you meet another Brit in another country you'll always subconciously judge them and try and slot them into a social class - what paper they read, what kinds of school they went to, what supermarket they visit and even what kind of biscuits they eat, it's a curse and I hate it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of the people who think they're Middle Class are Working Class.  That's been the big lie of the last four or five decades.  That's why they're in denial about it.  Because if you're, say, a teacher or an accountant you might think you're Middle Class -- and your job may require the education -- but you're just another wage slave.</p>
<p>The previous comment includes this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The major fork in society is found at true middle-class, where those who can afford it send their children to private schools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's about it...</p>
<p>Private schooling costs more than most people who think they're Middle Class earn.  The class system is just as real as when Cleese and the two Ronnies did <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4QuSZ2Vvj4" target="_blank">this</a></strong> sketch, except Corbett knew his place and most of the working class think they're middle class now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this in a way however it's more to do with how roles have changed. Just because you work behind a desk instead of in a field, factory or down a mine doesn't make you middle class. It's more to do with wealth, education and whether you employ others that make you middle class in my eyes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That didn't used to be the case.</p>
<p>I grew up in the '80s-90s, and private schooling was doable - if difficult - for middle class people like you describe.  It inevitably meant sacrifices, though.  You'd live in a smaller house than the other kids at school, it wouldn't be in such a nice area and you wouldn't go on such exotic holidays or things like the school ski trip.</p>
<p>That isn't the case today.  School fees have gone up in line with inflation but salaries haven't in over ten years.  A lot of families are looking at a future where they can't put their kids through the same schools they went to because there simply isn't enough money coming in in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My mother's British but we live in the US; we were at a pub and the owner came over to talk with us and after greetings the first thing the owner said to my mom was &quot;Oh, aren't you posh&quot; to which my mother replied &quot;And you're common as muck&quot; based solely off their accents. They had a good laugh but I'm sitting there thinking &quot;Did my mom just call this woman a hick?&quot; Very weird conversations my mother has with other British people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love the comment about biscuits. To me (as an ex-brit now australian) that is very British.
Could you please give some examples of which biscuits suggest which social class? Haha. I'd love to hear what you and others think.
And where do chocolate digestives fit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say custard creams and ginger nuts are working class. Jammie Dodgers and choc-chip cookies are probably a bit more socially mobile but would never touch the lips of the upper classes; Hobnobs probably fall into that category as well. They've got their own adverts (fancy!), but they don't take themselves seriously enough to come across as a quality biscuit.</p>
<p>Pink wafers are pretty expensive comparatively but there's still not much to them so I'd say they're striving to be middle class but not quite there. NICE biscuits - now there's a social barometer, if you go to someone's house and they have these and pronounce them 'Nice' (As in, 'that's nice') then your car has probably already had its wheels nicked. If they pronounce them 'Neice' then they're nouveau riche because real posh people would never eat them in the first place.</p>
<p>Digestives are true neutral ground; rich or poor everyone likes Digestives. If you were somehow stuck in a room with the Queen and a pack of digestives you'd both look at each other and nod with that mutual &quot;Nice one&quot; look in your eyes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I felt sure that for whatever length you went on to write there was no risk of me being disappointed. Spoiler alert: I was not disappointed. Well written. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I too was captivated. Excellent writing and, might I add that acknowledging both the hard work and sacrifice of your ancestors as well as the privilege it bought you in the same breath as it were, is refreshingly honest. </p></div>		</li>
