			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a little more detail here: Back before TrueType, computers used so-called Postscript Type 3 fonts to render things on screen, and the Type 1 fonts were only used when printing something on a Postscript printer. Type 3 fonts were simple bitmaps, and looked like they were made from legos when scaled up on screen. It was by the time Apple and MS had finished TrueType and the first OS versions with it were about to ship that the first version of Adobe Type Manager, which allowed the rendering of Postscript Type 1 fonts on computer screens (only on Macs at first), was released. If Apple and MS had not pushed the issue, Adobe would have been content to sit back and collect license fees for overpriced Postscript printers while everyone else were stuck with bitmapped fonts on screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not true to say Type 3 were used only for screen use and Type 1 for printing. They could both be used onscreen and for printing. Adobe kept Type 1 fonts for themselves and only let people make Type 3 fonts. But Type 3 used more memory and didn't support hinting, so they looked like crap onscreen. However, they could contain actual PostScript commands and so could produce much more fancy fonts (like fonts with fills). There was one Type 3 font, Beowulf, that replaced characters on the fly with distressed variants, to give a more handset appearance. So, if you typed &quot;Here&quot;, the two &quot;e&quot;s would each be different.</p></div>		</li>
