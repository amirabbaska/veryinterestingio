<p>So 72.4 billion over 6 years, or 12 billion per year in credits and payments. The number I posted in the original question was an average over the past century, but I really can't get 'under the hood' about it as you've done here. </p>
<p>While I see the connection, it's kind of a stretch to say that the 500 million to the highway trust fund benefits the fossil fuel industry. Regardless, that only changes the six year total to 71.9b</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wrote this a few years ago, so it doesn't touch any of the years of the Obama admin.</p>
<p>Credit for Production of Nonconventional Fuels is probably significantly more. Maybe by as much as ten times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This list is totally disingenuous and does nothing to illuminate the conversation or any conversation.  This is absolutely an attempt to sway an ongoing and reasonable conversation by taking advantage of the fact the the average person won't look into tax laws.</p>
<p>The idea that the strategic petroleum reserve is a subsidy is absolutely a sham.  You are basically saying that because the U.S. government buys oil so that they can keep the economy going and fight wars then they are subsidising oil.  If you look at all of the major armed conflicts over the last 110 years, oil scarcity played a major role (for example WW1, WW2, and oil embargoes after U.S. support for Israel during the cold war).  This amounts to saying, &quot;Oh no! The army uses gasoline and diesel for tanks and airplanes! They want to make sure we have enough oil to fight a long war! They must be shills for the oil companies!&quot;  By that definition, you are subsidizing oil companies whenever you travel.  My response to you sir is: I can't believe that we are letting shills for oil companies comment on this thread!  You should be banned!</p>
<p>As we stated earlier, the largest incentive to oil companies is a foreign tax credit that all U.S. companies get and it is not an oil subsidy.  The second largest incentive is a result of the U.S. attempt to fight the OPEC cartel in the 1980s, and directly results in lower heating costs for U.S. citizens.  The third largest incentive allows oil companies to deduct expenses like all other companies, but do so slightly more rapidly because of the capital intensive nature of the industry.  It is disingenuous to say that all expense deductions by oil companies on tax forms are a form of subsidy.  Get real, if you eliminate this &quot;subsidy&quot; the deduction just takes place a bit slower.  The fourth largest incentive is depletion, which is something that all industries that use land can qualify for, and something we discussed below.  By hiding the actual purpose and application of each tax law, you are hiding the truth and preventing reasonable debate on this issue.</p>
<p>Also, I find it shocking that you think highways shouldn't exist or that coal miners with black lung should be left to die.  I don't see how these things are subsidies to oil companies, and their inclusion in your list suggests that you are trying to mislead people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In what way is it disingenuous? It's a fact based neutral description of all the government subsides for the fossil fuel industry.</p>
<p>They get a number of advantageous tax laws that favor them over any other businesses.  That is a subsidy as their industry is treated differently from other similarly situated industries.</p>
<p>It's undeniable.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It is a subsidy, especially when the US government takes royalty payments in-kind from leases given on Federal land. The US is basically being paid with its own oil. As Trump would say, that's a 'terrible deal'. You may argue that it is a strategic necessity, but it is also a clear subsidy for fossil fuels over longer-term efforts to turn our economy away from dependence on fossil fuels from foreign sources by say subsidizing nuclear and renewable power.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's the point, they get special tax advantages over other capital intensive industries based only on the fact that they produce fossil fuels. That's a subsidy.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not what I said. It simply stated that both represent a subsidy for fossil fuels, which both programs are.  We are building highways, over other possibilities, like high speed or light rail systems. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You said,  &quot;They get a number of advantageous tax laws that favor them over any other businesses. That is a subsidy as their industry is treated differently from other similarly situated industries.  It's undeniable.&quot;</p>
<p>I responded with an explanation showing how tax laws for oil companies are exactly the same or very comparable to tax breaks that other companies get.  Moreover, I take issue with your abilities as an accountant.  If someone can earn a dollar today or a dollar in a year, the difference in value to those two propositions is not one dollar (100% of the value), but instead is the value of a dollar discounted into the future.  If we use inflation as an indicator of discount rate, then the discount rate for a dollar over one year is about a penny or three (1-3%).  Lying because you are intentionally failing at accounting is still lying (with a couple of extra steps) and valuing a tax break incorrectly because you discount the future by 100% is bad math.  </p>
<p>You can't make the argument that someone is receiving special treatment, and then stick your head in the sand when you are confronted with evidence to the contrary and not be disingenuous.  Removing information from its appropriate context is disingenuous.</p>
<p>Explaining that oil companies are not treated significantly differently than other companies does not mean that we shouldn't invest in other energy resources.  It is important to have a real debate about energy policy.  No one benefits from repeating misinformation or propaganda.</p></div>		</li>
