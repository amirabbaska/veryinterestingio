<p>You're ignoring thermal cycling.</p>
<p>I don't know how much effect this actually has on an incandescent bulb, but it's reasonable to assume that it has some.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that the electricity is already cycling at 60 Hz and it's doubtful that human actuation of a mechanical switch could match that, thermal cycling is unlikely to be a particularly significant factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I mean is that an incandescent bulb that is &quot;on&quot; may have the electricity cycling that fast, but its temperature remains constant. (Thousands of degrees for the filament; hundreds of degrees for the bulb.)</p>
<p>If you switch a bulb on and off over the course of seconds, you're having the components have thermal variations of hundreds (the bulb) to thousands (the filament) of degrees.  Those temperature variations are likely to have effects on the components of the bulb.  For example, thermal expansion ratios of glass and metals differ, which means that the joint between the glass bulb and the sleeve will move.  If that movement happens a lot, if you're switching it on and off, as opposed to once, if you turn it on and leave it on, it stands to reason that that's more wear-and-tear on the bulb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you keep the switch mostly in the middle and quickly flip it halfway up and halfway down repeatedly, it makes this crackling noise. Is that sound coming from the spark you mention?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the bulb. Light bulbs in homes are fine, but if you get into technical equipment and bulbs used for imaging in labs then you can get into trouble.</p></div>		</li>
