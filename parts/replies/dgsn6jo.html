			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a friend in 2012 who started crying at the DMV when she couldn't pay her $700 in registration fees (she had just spent $200 on an old clunker at an auction, I believe California charges more for old, inefficient vehicles). My friend said the DMV lady typed away at her computer, and reduced her registration down to $150.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They won't even tell you how they come up with the amount. Some say it's based on the worth of your vehicle, others say it's the year/model. All I know is my wife's registration was $365 and mine was almost $750 and I drive a pickup truck that's 5 YEARS OLDER than her car. </p></div>		</li>
