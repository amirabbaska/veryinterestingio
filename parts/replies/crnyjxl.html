			<div class="markdown"><p>Strangely enough, they're known as both one- and two-way mirrors. I personally agree that &quot;two way&quot; makes little sense the way they're meant to be used. They are truly &quot;two way&quot; when both sides are lit, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I see it, it's called one-way because you can see through it one way. A regular mirror would be &quot;zero-way&quot;, though that's a nonsense term of course.  </p>
<p>As the sibling commenter said, perhaps &quot;one-way glass&quot; would be a better term.</p></div>		</li>
