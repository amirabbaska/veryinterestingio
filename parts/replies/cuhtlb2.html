			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Indian born in Hindu family. But, I am not much of a religious person.  </p>
<p>Cows in India are sacred in the sense like they are a respected part of your family. They are not worshiped like a god. It's a misconception. Traditionally, India had been an Agriculture and Cow husbandry country. Millions of people's livelihood is depended on Cow. So, they consider cow as a breadwinner for their house. So, they consider cow as part of their family. </p>
<p>Also, India had traditionally been a vegetarian country. So, the sole source of Protein for Indians were cow's milk. As Cow's milk has nearly all essential nutrients such proteins, vitamins, fats, etc. people would consider it elixir in older times. So, that is also another reason why cow was given such importance in India. </p>
<p>So, to answer your question, yes drinking milk is allowed, it's the major source for millions of vegetarians in India for protein. </p>
<p>They is no restriction like you can't touch cow. People just respect cows. And they just prohibit killing a lactating cow, because it is doing a service to mankind by donating it's  precious milk. So, we should not disrespect them by killing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In New Zealand, the aim is rapid cooling as soon as the milk leaves the cow.  Each farm has a refrigerated vat. There are food safety standards to be met about how fast it needs to get down to temperature and at what temperature it needs to be maintained.  There are also food safety standards about cleaning the machines and about documenting the cleaning procedures and about what milk is allowed to go in the vat (eg no colostrum milk).  A refrigerated tanker comes and picks up the milk daily.  The tanker driver draws samples of the milk and conducts tests, including on temperature, before allowing the milk to go into the tanker.  Other samples are taken for independent testing.  Farmers get big penalties if they fail tests.  That's just the start of the process before it has even been pasteurised.  Every part of the process from farm to consumer is all about keeping the chill in and the bugs out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Literally 75% of the food goods in India are unfit for consumption at a minimum.</p>
<p>I was in India for 2 months for work and I spent a week in New Delhi for my work break.</p>
<p>Anyways, people told me not to eat fruits and vegetables and meat unless it was from a 5 star hotel.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Farmers grow these fruits and vegetables and livestock right next to horribly polluted canals and rivers which are chock full of industrial effluent, human feces, animal feces...just talking about it makes me almost vomit.</p>
<p>Not a place you can walk by in India without smelling shit, actually, the oilfield I worked in- despite the occasional natural gas vapors, was probably the cleanest place in all of India...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha.. fellow Indian milk industry colleague checking in.. good job on sharing a well laid out explanation.. </p>
<p>albeit this might be buried under a ton of comments, i'd very much like an opportunity to give my 20 paisa (i'll try to be funnier)..</p>
<p>In olden times, before the concept of money, people who had the largest number of cows were considered rich.. this is because of a few reason. Apart from cow being considered holy, the person who had cows had access to two important life necessities - food (milk and related products) and fuel (cow dung was converted into fuel in early days - bio-fuel!).. hence in Indian mythology as well you will hear stories about how when a King is happy with a subject, he gifts them cows.. </p>
<p>buffalo milk (although consumed in major quantities in India today - i doubt its just 10%), was never considered equal to cow's milk.. you see even from a religious pov, while cows were associated with purity and gods, buffalo was associated with filth and Yamraj (god of death).. </p>
<p>after the first white revolution, when the milk industry started getting organized, players like Amul set up the co-operative model of milk collection.. they would collect milk from individual farmers with 3-5 cows and transport it to the plant for processing.. initially the farmers would be paid money on the quantity of milk - this lead to a lot of farmers mixing water with the milk (more money yo!).. so then the companies started paying on the basis of quantity AND quality - which was 2 prone - fat content in the milk and SNF (solid non fat) in the milk - more the fat, more the money.. this lead to farmers mixing cow's milk with buffalo milk because it has huge fat content (8% or more).. </p>
<p>these two issues have lead to widespread adulteration in the Indian milk industry..</p>
<p>i could continue to ramble about the industry, but that might be off topic and of little interest.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting to read. Can you suggest which one is better out of the two: mother dairy and amul. I've a hard time trusting motherdiary as a lot of milk is bought from UP, and we all know how things work in UP. I currently take Amul TetraPack. What's your opinion on it. The OP says its UHT so I am very pleased to know i am getting the right product in terms of process involved!</p></div>		</li>
