			<div class="markdown"><p>Only color CRTs though, by imparting a magnetic charge to the metal shadow mask inside which was used to separate the red, green, and blue pixels. Monochrome or B&amp;W CRTs didn't have a shadow mask, so a magnet would just temporarily deform the image but have no lasting effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can move the magnet around and re aim it sometimes. I was bitching to my friend about my TV going out. He told me if I got a proper TV stand, instead of using my speaker box, the bar would go away. I played with it a while, making the bar move up and down before moving the speakers away from the TV. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A crystal is a substance where the molecules line up in a certain way, rather than just haphazardly. A solid is a substance where the molecules don't like to move in relationship to each other, whereas liquid's molecules are happy to move past each other.</p>
<p>As an analogy, imagine some crowds of people.  A crowd inside a packed bar is like a typical liquid.  They're all facing different directions, but they can move past each other.  That's like a liquid.</p>
<p>Now imagine that all the people in that bar linked arms together wherever they stood.  They still have the same lack of orientation relative to each other, but now they can't move.  This is like a non-crystalline (amorphous) solid.</p>
<p>Now imagine a group of people standing in rows and columns. Each of those people grabs the person to their front and to their left.  They're all facing the same direction, they have a distinct relationship to each other, and they can't move in relation to each other.  This is like a crystalline solid.</p>
<p>Now think about <a href="https://youtu.be/c0VRGz_yW-0?t=2m8s" target="_blank">a marching band, performing at halftime in a football game</a>. All the people in the band maintain a very strict relationship to each other, but they walk past each other with ease.  This is like a liquid crystal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excuse my edits:</p>
<p>And adding to your remark:</p>
<p>Even better coupled with the marching band analogy and with a marching band block formation, much like an LCD, there is a section for varying frequencies of instruments.</p>
<p>The big brass horns are typically in the back of a block while the lighter instruments are more in the front. Typical LCD arrangements are of red, green, and blue in that order for each pixel representing different instruments of play.</p>
<p>With the way formations arrange, you get different performances! This is based on the conductor at hand too!</p>
<p>Of course, the colors do not mix in an LCD, as they all provide a range with respect to the pixel for the ratio to a viewer's eyes. The respective red, green, and blue filter the white backlight to mix the light per pixel they sit in in illumination.</p>
<p>Now this is where and why people are talking about OLEDs, because each pixel is acting as both a very low powered energy driven light source of the three color pixels themselves, rather than acting as a set of blinds to a back white light (two power sources to be concerned with and physical layers to fit in the back light illumination and the LCD array in front). Organic Light Emitting Diodes are to the point of refinement that it is a very thin layer allowing for more compact devices, or more room for other things besides two lighting layers of manipulation.</p>
<p>I like to think some of the Organic LED concepts are inspired by nature, especially since people studied bioluminescence and think &quot;why not&quot; in an acceptable manner for technology refinement.</p>
<p>And gig'em for referencing the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A crystal is any solid material in which the matter's atoms are arranged in an ordered and repeating structure.</p>
<p>Any solid material which is not crystalline in nature is amorphous.</p>
<p>What most people think of as &quot;crystals&quot; are in fact minerals that form a crystalline structure under certain conditions.</p>
<p>For example, diamond is one of many crystalline structures formed by elemental carbon. Quartz is one of several crystalline structure of Silicon Dioxide. Magnetite and Hematite are common crystalline iron ores; when impurities are removed they are quite pretty.</p>
<p>Refined metal billets fresh out of the furnace are crystalline in nature. Various metalworking techniques including forging, rolling, milling, heat treating, case hardening, and tempering are used to carefully manipulate and deform the metallic structure in order to obtain desired material properties.</p>
<p>Most glass products are completely amorphous. Soda-lime-silica glass is about 75% Silicon Dioxide by composition, the same molecule that forms Quartz, but the inclusion of other compounds and moderation of temperature and pressure prevent soda-lime-silica glass from forming a crystal structure.</p>
<p>Crystal glassware is a curious misnomer because it is not a crystal at all. Crystal glassware simply uses lead rather than calcium (don't worry, it's safe) which results in a high refractive index characteristic of many actual crystals.</p>
<p>Liquid crystals are liquids that form an ordered structure either naturally or in response to an electric field. In an LCD display a liquid crystal is contained within a cell that sits between two glass panels. Attached to each glass panel is an electrode. The electrodes are energised to create an electric field which passes through the liquid crystal (note that the crystals are not conductive), the application of the electric field causes the liquid crystal to change its structure and either allow light through or prevent light from passing through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just 1 fix: the electric field causes the liquid crystal to change the polarisation state of the light passing through it, they aren't doing any blocking themselves. That comes from the linear polarisers before and after LCs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For black levels, OLED is simply unmatched.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure LG's TVs implement it differently than Samsung's OLED phone screens, but you still get those <em>black</em> blacks.</p>
<p>In a dark room, especially with brightly colored images on a dark background, it is very noticeable.</p>
<p>That being said, I'll make sure OLED tech is up to snuff before I make the jump to an OLED TV.  OLED phone screens had some big downsides in the first couple of years.</p></div>		</li>
