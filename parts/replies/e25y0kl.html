			<div class="markdown"><p>Do the bowels or other organs move in after a hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy? What about just a partial hysterectomy? If so, is there a concern with a partial hysterectomy that other organs will cause the ovaries to shift around, perhaps resulting in torsion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Partial&quot; just means removing the uterus without the cervix. Removing the tubes and ovaries is not technically part of a hysterectomy. And no, there's generally not a concern for torsion or movement. The ovaries are attached the the sidewalls of the pelvis. And generally the bowels just fill in the space after the uterus comes out.</p></div>		</li>
