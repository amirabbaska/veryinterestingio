<p>So if 'we' would've made a different system other sounds would be &quot;off-key&quot;? Wow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another cool tidbit about tempermant, chords don't sound in tune in equal tempermant, and the third and fifth need to be adjusted to sound in tune for different chord qualities (major/minor/diminished/etc) </p>
<p>There's an app I use called &quot;Tonal Energy&quot; as a musician for tuning. It has a cool feature where you can tune based on equal or just tempermant. </p>
<p>If you sustain a C major chord (C-E-G) in the tone generator you can adjust the tempermant to just or based around C major (Just tempermant), where the third (E) is lowered and the fifth (G) is raised. It sounds more in tune that way to our ears than it does perfectly spaced out in equal tempermant because that's how our ears have learned to hear chords (every chord has different tendencies to sound &quot;correct&quot;). </p>
<p>Here's a full list:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, sort of.  The black keys on a piano form a pentatonic scale (which is common in many kinds of music).  If the melody resolves on an F#/Gb, it is a major penatonic; if it resolves on an Eb/D#, it is a minor pentatonic.  In both of these cases, the B natural and F natural fit into the scale just fine.  Beyond that, there are other ways of extracting a pentatonic scale from the traditional major/minor scales (adding the F natural and C natural to the black keys gives you the Db/C# major scale or the Bb/A# minor scale, and adding the B natural and E natural gives you the B major scale or the Ab/G# minor scale).  And considering that there are many scales/modes aside from the traditional major/minor, you could add just about any white key to the &quot;black-key pentatonic&quot; and have it sound good, depending on how you approach the melody and underlying harmony.  (Granted, notes like G natural, A natural, or D natural will create a chromatic run, but a series of chromatic intervals isn't unheard of - for example, the &quot;blues scale&quot; typically features a flat 5th, which creates a chromatic run between the 4-b5-5 of the scale.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that bears mentioning is that notes aren't equidistant when we're talking the actual sound frequencies. Theirs is a difference of equal ratio, not true distance. An octave from a determined note is precisely double frequency, and the difference from the first note to a third in the scale is roughly half of the difference between the notes an octave above.</p></div>		</li>
