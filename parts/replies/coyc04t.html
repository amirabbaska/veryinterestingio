			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there will be changes, before this net neutrality issues, ISP like Comcast and Verizon where asking content providers for a fee to allowd high speed access inside their networks, before they came up with this fees to the content providers, everything was fine, once they saw that they could make money from charging the content providers things started to slow down, to force them to pay those fee, you probably did not notice, but other did, Netflix was one of the providers affected by it, their services became very poor on ISP like comcast an verizon until they started to pay this passes or fees, some of the online gaming culture was affected by it as well. People that only use the net for info search, emails, abd simple thinks like that, did not notice it, because this task do not requires very high bandwith. The consumer that was paying high speed access to the net, was only getting the high speed on things like emails, web browsing, facebook, but once they tried to use hulu or any other streaming service, the quality of connection to that content was decreased even tho that consumer was paying premium to access that service, because the ISP was not getting a fee from the content provider, as soon as the provider started to pay the fee, the speed was up.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Comcast didn't charge Netflix for more bandwidth, they prolonged a dispute with a third party who transmitted data from Netflix to Comcast, with the (alleged) goal of forcing Netflix to peer with them directly instead of using a third party. By most expert estimates this action actually saved Netflix money, but they leveraged the public's general hatred of Comcast to argue that they shouldn't have to pay anything at all for their bandwidth.</p>
<p>That type of behavior won't change under this new regulation and there's really no reason it should - the government would set a dangerous precedent by becoming an interested third party in an entire industry's private business contract disputes, even if the companies involved are engaging in disputes as a means to an end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, Comcast could up their prices for Netflix, and charge them more money than they do now /  charge them for the extra bandwidth they use. What they can't do is create their own &quot;Comflix&quot; streaming service and let users get full speed with their service while throttling speeds of Netflix to 1/100 of what they are now, so the constant buffering makes it unusable and everyone has to switch to Comflix and forces Netflix out of business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Netflix and some other companies were already getting charged extra. I suppose now those &quot;agreements&quot; aka extortions have to be ended.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what I'm confused about. If the Internet has always been neutral, why did we need to pass ~a thing~ for it to stay that way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two previous regulations that ensured net neutrality were struck down in the past 5 years, and the general opinion of the courts was that in order to implement this level of regulation, the FCC would need powers that they only have over Title II classified services.</p></div>		</li>
