			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was probably 11 or 12 years old I used to take piano lessons at this lady's house a few blocks from ours. I got dropped off about 20 mins early one week and was waiting for the teacher to finish up w/ the student before me, and was sitting in the living room around the corner from where the piano was, and there was a bowl of peppermints sitting on the table (those round red and white kind swirly kind you get at restaurants). I took a mint and not long after I put it in my mouth I must have swallowed too hard by accident or something because the mint got vacuum sucked down my throat and into my esophagus, where it got stuck about six inches down there and stayed put.</p>
<p>Holy FUCK did that hurt. The pain was so intense that I was literally thrashing around like a fish trying to dislodge it -- on the couch, on the floor...and it was working its way down at a fucking glacial pace. Luckily the couch wasn't visible from where the teacher and other student were still playing around the corner, and I just kept thinking I NEEDED to get this thing unstuck before they finished and saw me, thought I was choking or having a seizure and called an ambulance. I even wondered for a moment if I actually did need to go to the hospital, even though I knew it would dissolve eventually, but that's honestly how bad it hurt.</p>
<p>I finally got it down 2 minutes before they finished, then I had to go in there like it had never happened, even though i was half traumatized</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man. I've always been that &quot;pathetic hard man&quot;. After reading this thread, I'm definitely going to try and change. I take huge Lialda pills, 4 at a time, for Crohns, not to mention multivitamins, iron, and vitamin C supplements, which are large, sticky, and chalky. Gonna go get a glass of water right now, actually. </p>
<p>Edit: This sounded braggy after re-reading it. I meant it as a realization of how bad I was treating my throat than trying to impress anybody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its only bad if it gets stuck and you dont drink water soon afterwards. Risky but not necessarily bad if they dont get stuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bro. Its the worst pain when you dont even expect it to be stuck there, and you eat or gulp some water and all of a sudden your entire throat is on fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This used to happen to me at least 50% of the time when I took birth control pills. The pills are so small, light weight, and porous. I don't know, there's just something about them that makes them stick to the mucosa in my throat. Even once you're able to block out the stuck feeling, the feeling of it dissolving right there is really horrible, like you're administering a hormone cocktail directly to your throat. I think it contributed to the nausea I always felt right after taking it. </p>
<p>I ❤️ vasectomies. </p></div>		</li>
