			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like a leaky microwave. Microwaves operate at a frequency very close to wifi frequencies (~2.4GHz). Most don't have that trouble, but some do.. usually older ones with damaged radiation shielding. You should probably return the one you have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my microwave is brand new - purchased last x-mas.. and it does the same thing with my wifi signal also, however it only affects my raspberry pi 3.. i always assumed its because the Pi uses low power wifi?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much all microwaves have this issue. Returning it is a waste of time, new microwaves pretty much all skimp on the shielding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this problem in my house and the explanation I was told is that the microwave does “leak” a little bit of radio waves. But keep in mind a little bit is relative. So a 1% leak on a 1200 watt microwave is 12 Watts. By comparison the total rated consumption of my current router is 36 watts and most of that probably isn’t going to the antenna. So for example in my house the microwave is downstairs and around a corner, WiFi doesn’t go through walls well so you assume the signal is somewhat attenuated. By the time it gets to the microwave area that leak I mentioned is “louder” than the WiFi and drowns it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maximum WiFi power is 1 watt, and most routers don't actually go that high. 100mW wouldn't be uncommon. So yes, 12W will easily drown that out.</p></div>		</li>
