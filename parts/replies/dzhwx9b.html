That being said, a diagnosis can be useful in more ways than just “to get help”. Many adults talk about how a diagnosis allowed them to reinterpret many aspects of their lives, improve their self-understanding and self-image, connect to a community of people who may share important life experiences with them, and so on. And then of course a diagnosis is key to being able to get legal protections through the Americans with Disabilities Act and to help ensure one gets appropriate accommodations. We have a lot more details about adult diagnosis on our AASPIRE Healthcare Toolkit. Here is some information targeted to adults considering getting a diagnosis: <a href="https://autismandhealth.org/?a=pt&amp;p=detail&amp;t=pt_aut&amp;theme=ltlc&amp;size=small&amp;s=aut_dx" target="_blank"><a href="https://autismandhealth.org/?a=pt&p=detail&t=pt\_aut&theme=ltlc&size=small&s=aut\_dx" target="_blank">https://autismandhealth.org/?a=pt&p=detail&t=pt\_aut&theme=ltlc&size=small&s=aut\_dx</a></a> .
