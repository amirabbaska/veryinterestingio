<p>a rough estimate of depth. </p>

<p>Catching flies and avoiding tree branches at 40mph seems like it needs more than a rough estimate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds often have a very narrow cone of stereoscopic vision straight ahead that they use when flying, but it's not as useful for scanning their surroundings and keeping an eye out for dangers.</p>
<p>Edit: more predatory birds tend to have a wider cone of stereoscopic vision, because they are more often focusing on one thing (prey) rater than the environment (predators)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're conflating two things. The comment is about how these animals estimate depth when stationary. If the animal is already moving quickly then obviously it can rely on the parallax due to that relative motion, and doesn't need to make twitching motions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going off of the other reply you got try this:
Close one eye and throw something in the air and try to catch it. Tough to do. Do the same thing but once it's in the air move your head to the side while watching the thing you threw. You gain some sense of depth and it becomes easier to catch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having too many eyes would be a vulnerability, I suspect, given how sensitive the eyes are in many species including humans. If we had an eye on the back of our heads, imagine how much caution we'd have to exercise to not get dust in it.</p>
<p>The other thing is sensory input. Our perspectives would be almost completely rewritten, and our brains would have to be re-wired to compensate for the additional processing power or our ability to see would have to be reduced (definitely not a benefit for a species that evolved as nomadic hunters).</p>
<p>Evolution is not a matter of picking out the best of the best traits. It's more a game of figuring out what works for the organism's survival and then running with it so that the organism is able to reproduce. This is why animals are imperfect yet able to thrive in their own niches in the ecosystem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because something sounds superior doesn't mean it is feasible to actually get there. </p>
<p>The structures have to originate from somewhere. In the case of spiders, their eyes just probably split into multiple. You'd have to do that AND get them to migrate to the back/sides of the head, while not having the optic nerves screw up the amazingly efficient brain layout that allows them to work in the first place</p>
<p>And even if you do have specimens that are having the baby-step mutations to achieve this... along the ENTIRE way these have to find mates. Good luck trying to get laid as the first one with a few extra (possibly non-functional) eyeballs on your face!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>from what I heard, optic nerves actually connect to the back of the head, that's where vision processing is supposed to be. So adding a pair of extra eyes there seems like a no-brainer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest problem is, that Vision is by far the most complex task that a brain has to do, and in most mammals a significant part of the brain will actually be dedicated to it. So trying to increase the vision radius would result in more brain volume which require more energy. This significant increase in energy consumption is not worth the higher vision degree.</p></div>		</li>
