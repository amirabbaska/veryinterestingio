			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed if I'm laying on one side, the eye closest to the bed/floor/pillow sees the red/warm tint and the eye in the air sees blue/cool tint. I assumed it was the result of blood pooling affecting the color temp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This likely has more to do with the quality of light hitting each of your eyes. Rooms are lit from above, so your higher eye is getting more direct light, while the bottom eye is getting more scattered light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so, and here's why.  If I sit upright after laying on one side, the side that was down stays red/warm for a while. </p></div>		</li>
