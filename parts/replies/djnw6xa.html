			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey man, I know it's a bit late but I just thought of something. From what you wrote, the 4.0l v8 is more efficient than the 4.0l v6 at producing power. However, is there no benefits to using the v6, besides it being cheaper to produce?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to cost of manufacture, packaging is a big concern for some vehicles.  A v6 might be more suitable because it can be made lighter, or would allow the engine to sit further back in the engine bay.  Less cylinders is much easier to service too, less of everything that wears out means less cost for the consumer.</p>
<p>A lot of what drives decisions for most cars is simply finding an <em>adequate</em> solution.  For your average family car, a V8 is horribly overkill.  Australia is a good example of it, we've been making V8 family sedans for years and years and years.  Its a part of the culture...but the realities of motoring here have been sinking in.  Our petrol isnt that cheap and a big power, thirsty V8 just doesnt appeal to mum and dad who just need to move the kids around.  They dont need tyre shredding, power slide smoking performance, they want good economy, smooth, quiet and cheap to run.  Once upon a time, Holden Commodores and Ford Falcons ruled the roost, but now the japs are all over it, I4's and V6's that sip away and have enough performance to keep the average punter happy.  Ford ended production of the falcon last year, holden ended the commodore this year.  </p>
<p>Once upon a time, having a V8 engine was a source of pride.  Ive had conversations with people who own camrys who dont even know how many cylinders it has.  They boast now about getting 6L/100km on the highway, 20 000km service intervals.  Those sorts of people are the volume buyers, theyre the sort of people who, if they were happy with their last honda, are likely to buy another honda.  Why force this person to buy a V8 when its really not what they want.  Save the manufacturing costs, lower the pricetag on cars in a super competitive segment of the market and sell shitloads of cars.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ford falcons, it was interesting to note the better selling performance model in the lineup was the turbo 6.  It was a pretty great motor, plenty of power and people were able to get big numbers out of it without any troubles at all.  What made it nice was that it was pumping out V8 power, but at straight 6 weight.  The V8 version of that car was a bit of a lead tipped arrow, whereas the 6 was pretty well balanced.  One day, when the fuel starts getting super expensive in the US, turbo 4's and 6's are going to be the way of the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I have a Kia Picanto and I can't imagine owning a gigantic Mustang or something with a v8 Engine, so I guess I'm the kind of person you're talking about... It would be awesome, but I'm only 19 years old so it'll take a while before I can afford anything big. </p>
<p>In fact, I think I would consider getting a model 3 Tesla over a similarly priced gasoline car at this point. Fuel prices seem to be going up and up, as well as car prices at least in Denmark.  Distances aren't nearly as great in Denmark as they are in the US, Australia etc., and a charge on the small model 3 is generally over 300km so it's unlikely that you will have to charge during a trip. </p>
<p>I think the reason I asked the question is because I just like dreaming about these massive cars, since I drive a lunchbox myself. I might own a v6 or v8 one day but it will be mostly vanity, so I want to be able to afford it. </p>
<p>Edit* my Kia is an i3 1.0l :'( Gets me to and from work though. It's a lovely car, for me because I'm just a student really. Big cars are pretty rare in Denmark, again because of registration fees. I might move to Germany one day, for several reasons including being able to have a bigger car for the same money as in Denmark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer, not sure why it is so far down.  HP is a function of the surface area of the piston cylinders.  More, smaller pistons equals more horsepower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey bro, I saw it if that makes it a little better. And thanks for actually explaining it to me in an easy to understand way - the other, incredibly detailed and well written answers helped with answering everything at once, but yours focuses on performance. And again, your answer is one of the few where I actually understand it all...</p>
<p>Edit* I guess the other answers got higher upvotes because they also mention stuff like cost efficiency, lower vibrations, engine weight and complexity, and then a ton of stuff that makes absolutely no sense to me but I guess does to the upvoters.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Um, no it is not.</p>
<p>It's a function of the ability to fill the volume of the combustion chamber effectively in a given time window.  This is why things like direct injection help HP so much as they enable better combustion at higher revvs (shorter combustion window).  Smaller pistons help this as well as they make for a smaller combustion chamber that is easier to fill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, its a function of effective cylinder pressure, piston surface area, stroke and crank speed.  Increase any one of those four, without upsetting the others, and youll make more power.</p></div>		</li>
