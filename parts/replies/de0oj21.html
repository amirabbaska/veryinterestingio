<p>Can I ask you a question if you don't mind?</p>
<p>I've always been thinking how do Pure Mathematicians come up with all these conjectures? </p>
<p>I mean, do you guys like, gather up everyone or something then say, &quot;Okay, let's come up with very crazy questions that seems like correct but may be not so we can prove or disprove it!&quot;? </p>
<p>Or do the conjectures come spontaneously, randomly from mathematicians around the world? Like as you say, people had problems trying to calculate/measure/predict something, asked mathematicians, then while they're trying to solve it, they come up with lots of conjectures that they need to prove, and then that's how you get all those crazy hypothesis and questions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question!</p>
<p>Some conjectures and questions do arise sort of by accident, or by playing around.  A guy by the name of Stanislaw Ulam was doodling one day-- just drawing the counting numbers in a spiral-- and he noticed that the prime numbers had something that looked a LOT like a pattern.  Basically, they tend to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral" target="_blank">occur along diagonal lines in the drawing</a>.  It's kind of a cool thing, but... why the hell should it be true?!  That's the sort of question that will drive a mathematician <em>nuts</em>.</p>
<p>And there has been research into that question, which leads to another way that research questions and conjectures arise: folks asking questions related to an already-known (or even already-answered) question.  Mathematicians are famous for trying to understand very general problems by looking at versions of the problem that are simpler or more restricted, and thus (hopefully) easier to study.</p>
<p>For instance, Fermat's Last Theorem said that you can't find positive integers a, b, and c such that a^n  + b^n  = c^n  if n is greater than 2.  That turned out to be a CRAZY difficult thing to prove (Fermat claimed to have proved it, but... then he died, and he was likely mistaken, but nobody knew what his purported proof was, and the eventual proof relied on WAY more complex math than Fermat ever saw).  So people worked on smaller versions of the problem.  A woman named Sophie German (who has a FASCINATING story, by the way) looked at just a few of the possible values for n.  She proved that Fermat's Last Theorem, restricted to a certain class of primes, holds true.  She didn't prove it for <em>all</em> n, but she proved it for some.</p>
<p>Another thing that mathematicians will do is <em>generalize</em> problems.  So now let's say that you want to generalize Fermat's Last Theorem a bit.  We now know the answer to Fermat's question.  But what if we looked at a^n  + b^n  + c^n  = d^n  ?  Can you find solutions to that for any n?  Can we always find solutions to a^n  + b^n  = c^m , where m and n are different?</p>
<p>(Fermat's Last Theorem, by the way, fell out of Fermat playing around with Pythagorean triples, which have been studied since the development of the Pythagorean theorem!  So there's a series of questions that connects Pythagoras, who lived around 500 BC, to Andrew Wiles, who proved Fermat's Last Theorem in the early 1990s.  This process of narrowing and generalizing problems and questions can create millennia-spanning quilts of beautiful questions!)</p>
<p>It also happens that sometimes, a mathematician is just sort of... trying to look at the world mathematically, or to solve a practical problem.  Newton was trying to model the behavior of planetary orbits, and he wound up developing integral calculus so he had the right tool to describe their movement.  That new tool, calculus, turned out to be super effective for describing a lot of things, and the process of generalizing and restricting it has led to fields like real analysis and complex analysis and topology and differential equations and others.  Each of those fields wound up presenting questions of their own, and suddenly they were off and running!</p>
<p>It's a little more complicated than just that, of course.  But I hope it's at least useful as a partial explanation/answer.  Your question ties in with a lot of mathematical history and the philosophy of mathematics, which are both fascinating areas of study in their own right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just out of curiosity, how do professional mathematicians fund their work? While the questions you mentioned were interesting, what organizations or entities decide that finding the answer to those questions is worth the financial cost to hire and support those mathematicians? I ask this because as a biologist, in order to receive grants or contract work my skills and knowledge have to serve a purpose to the financial supporter (e.g. Environmental impact assessments for energy companies). I guess my overall question is how are the solutions you find applicable to real world issues/problems?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but the conjecture he mentioned I would bet came about by finding a pattern somewhere. There's a lot of creativity in math, so you just have to try things sometimes, often while trying to solve another problem. An easy question you might start with is, &quot;Can any integer be reduced to one?&quot; Dividing by two repeatedly is a good starting point, but obviously odd numbers break down. Well then, for odd numbers, add one. This works because you're guaranteed to at worst alternate odds and evens and you're decreasing more than you ever increase, so you're good. Well, then you can ask, does this generalize? Adding <em>n + 1</em> doesn't work, since that gives you an odd number, so you can wonder about <em>2n + 1</em> (Collatz's conjecture) or even for any <em>in + 1</em> where <em>i</em> is even. All it takes is running a few examples to see that Collatz's conjecture <em>seems</em> true, but it's much harder to prove.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: This is not the official story on how this particular one came up, but an example of how math works to show how any idea can turn into a conjecture like the example provided.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find that your response is highly similar to my own, in spirit at least if not in detail. See if you can find it in this thread. </p>
<p>Pure mathematics and philosophy also appear to have much in common: people having a poor, crude understanding of what the field involves, many &quot;open&quot; questions whose answers simply invite countless more questions, a reliance on logic, and a kind of advancement made through figuring out what doesn't work rather than what does! (In philosophy, this is called the &quot;dialectic&quot; method. Through back and forth reasoning, we figure out at least what solutions we can rule out, even if we never actually figure the solution out itself.) In the end, abstract conceptual advancement must proceed at its own rate, often built up by elimination rather than &quot;discovery&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>probably a dumb question and not even related to OP's question but..how do you even manage to remember and apply everything you learn at school with a 100% success rate? From my understanding you need simpler things to do more complex things and most things are interlinked to each but if let's say,you can't do a certain part of calculations does that mean you can't resolve every problem you get until a certain point or I'm missing something?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't.  I have three pencils in my pocket, and two BIG erasers.  Some of the most common jokes you'll hear in math departments are about professors screwing up their arithmetic.  Nobody has anything even <em>close</em> to a 100% success rate.  That's why mathematicians so desperately need good peer review.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>...yes and no.</p>
<p>As an example: I like to study number theory.  Number theory is crazy cool in that you can get started from a minimal background.  If you can do long division, multiplication, and basic exponentiation-- basically, a sixth grade math education-- I can actually show you some really interesting, fun results.  But number theory is usually taught as an upper-level college course, after calculus and sometimes even real analysis.</p>
<p>Do you need to know calculus to do basic number theory?  Well, it might come in handy in a few contexts, but-- no.  Lots of people have found interesting and new results in number theory <em>without</em> knowing calculus.  So obviously it isn't <em>required</em>.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can have super-advanced knowledge in a particular field-- analytic and algebraic topologies of locally Euclidean metrizations of infinitely differentiable Riemannian manifolds, let's say-- but be perfectly stumped by a basic question in an unrelated field like combinatorics.</p>
<p>So I guess I feel like the term &quot;more complex&quot; feels a little... imprecise?  It's like saying you need to know how to drive a stick shift before you can tap dance, because tap dancing is inarguably the more complex task.   It's clearly true that you don't need to know how to drive stick before you can tap dance, but you should definitely have learned to walk.  And knowing how to tap dance could, conceivably, be useful in learning to drive stick (&quot;foot off the clutch!&quot;), but it's more important that you know <em>how to drive</em>.</p>
<p>Most mathematicians build their requisite knowledge as they delve into the fields they decide to research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but if let's say,you can't do a certain part of calculations does that mean you can't resolve every problem you get until a certain point or I'm missing something?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, if there's a specific task I don't know how to do, I have colleagues, software, books, and Google to help me out.  If I don't remember how to factor a cubic, Google will.  If I am likely to screw up some algebra, I can double-check with Mathematica.  If I'm fuzzy on how you're supposed to map between lattices and tori, I can pull out my reference on the subject.  And when my paper is all done, I can hand it to my infinitely more knowledgeable colleagues to look over and red line all of my dumb mistakes.</p>
<p>I'll also point out that &quot;calculations&quot; are not a huge part of many mathematicians' work.  Most of us spending time looking for patterns, then trying to explore and eventually even explain those patterns.  I gave the example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral" target="_blank">Ulam spiral</a> in another comment-- there's not much <em>calculation</em> to be done there, and what calculation there is can be done by a computer.  But there's plenty of thinking and exploration to do.  Once you have an idea that might explain the patterns you see, there may be calculations to do-- but in the meantime, you're spending a lot of time trying to connect two seemingly disparate ideas, looking for an underlying principle that sits beneath <em>both</em> of them.</p>
<p>I hope that helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you for the insight! and also now I get why since hundred of years ago the maths community grew up so much,it's all thanks to the work of many people together. One discovers A while another one discovers B and together they find about the existence of C. </p>
<p>I'm still in 11th grade but I would like to ask how did you proceed after you finished school,did you go to college and already started to do complex things or you talked again from the basics? I'm kinda interested because I'm trying to become a mechanical designer but I saw from my uncle that he has to do a lot of geometry and maths to come to the final product and all I am good is maths,geometry is a bit hard and I just want to be sure </p></div>		</li>
