			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this.  The reason for a 90% top marginal rate isn't fundraising for the government, but to put a &quot;maximum wage&quot; into effect, beyond which it makes no sense for a person to accumulate further income.  Money that would otherwise go to the coffers of the top takers goes instead to things like business expansion, research, and wage increases.  The stagnating incomes of the middle class in the developed world are a direct result of the elimination of those high top marginal rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suppose we implement a 90% bracket like this. This would hurt high earners extremely bad. However someone like Warren Buffet would benefit hugely because he's sitting on a massive pile of wealth. No one would be able to reach his power. Do you think that's a good idea? </p></div>		</li>

<p>In what way?</p>

<p>And he'll now be paying the same rate on his earnings as well.</p>

<p>No one is able to reach his power anyways.  And how would taxing people reduce their ability to create an expansive business?  </p>
<p>Think about it.  How would taxing someone like Bezos damage Amazon's ability to continue to grow?  It wouldn't.  That's how people build massive wealth, they build a business, not hoard cash. (incase you're unaware, the tax rates we're talking about are for people.  Also, you don't pay taxes on the increase in value of your stocks until you sell them.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^ Very important point. When you hear about a company like Apple having 100B in a savings account somewhere, that's money that's essentially been taken out of the economy that isn't helping anyone. I don't mean to pick on Apple here--they're just a known example of something a ton of wealthy individuals &amp; corporations are doing: <em>hoarding cash.</em> If there was a &quot;maximum wage,&quot; as described above, that money would get spent/reinvested and improve the whole economy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, it's better if that money doesn't get &quot;invested.&quot;  Many of the activities we call investing have a way of working to the detriment of the rest of us.  How many people do you know who've had houses they were looking to buy snapped out from under them by a cash-paying billionaire?  How many of us forego raises because the shareholders demand another cut of the pie?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>The amount of money flowing through Wall Street has exploded over the last 30 years with the advent of digital trading. Unfortunately, much of that money isn't used to make real investments in companies, only to short change the next investor, also known as high frequency trading. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are from the states and old enough you may remember when G.W. gave everyone a tax rebate. It's not talked about much these days because it destroys any argument about trickle down vs. trickle up economics. </p>
<p>&quot;The Bush stimulus program totaled about 1% of GDP. Advocates of the bill said that was large enough to impact the $14 trillion economy. Most economists agreed that tax rebates would immediately lift consumer spending. That's especially true if rebates are targeted for low-income families who were more likely to spend it than save it.</p>
<p>For example, the 2001 rebate checks increased total consumption by 0.8% in the quarter that the checks were received and 0.6% in the subsequent quarter.</p>
<p>The business tax relief gave companies an incentive to expand that year. That typically would have been used to create new jobs.</p>
<p>According to estimates by Economy.com, each rebate dollar spent generated $1.19 in additional GDP. Reductions in tax rates produced only 59 cents additional GDP per dollar spent. (Source: IHT, Bush calls for $145 billion stimulus package for economy, January 18, 2008)&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Since businesses are taxed on profits and not expenses, when the tax rate is high it makes more sense for businesses to expand and build new stuff with the money they make before it can get taxed.</p></div>		</li>
