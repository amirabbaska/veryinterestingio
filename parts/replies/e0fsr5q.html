			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so does that seriously mean that, if in the US you go to the supermarket or the butchers and buy, like, a schnitzel or a filet or a pork chop or whatever (sorry, I have no idea what most cuts of meat are called in English!) - it's not fresh, but has already been cured in salt?   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.</p>
<p>Sometimes certain cuts of pork are cured (e.g., bacon, ham), sometimes they're brined or marinated (e.g., sime tenderloins or pork chops), but usually it's fresh. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well stuff like bacon yes. But no chops don't come pre cured. I think OP is confusing Ham and Bacon with Pork</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not normally. Sometimes. It happens in other countries too. Sometimes raw cuts are brined. Most pork chops and loin steaks aren't brined or otherwise cured.</p>
<p>You can tell by the label. If salt, water, and maybe sugar and other things are listed, it means they're brined. If it's not listed then they're not. Most raw pork sold is not salted (other than salami and such that's aged but not cooked).</p></div>		</li>
