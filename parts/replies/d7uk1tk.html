			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fantastic ELI5 response. I will expand, slightly, to maybe help differentiate between the SSD and HDD and illustrate the limited read/write lifespan of the SSD.</p>
<p>In your example, the HDD and SSD are both pieces of paper. I think it might be advantageous to think of the SSD as being a piece of paper, and the HDD as a dry-erase board - since there is a difference in the number of times each one can be written to and read from. </p>
<p>With paper, every time you erase something that you previously wrote, the paper wears out just a tiny bit. You can only write on one line and erase it so many times before that line has been completely worn out and you can no longer write there. As mentioned above, this is part of why there are extra lines at the end - they can be used as replacements for those that wore out.</p>
<p>With the dry-erase board (HDD), the surface is not worn down when you erase. You can write and erase basically an unlimited number of times, so you don't need replacement space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>haha! I had something similar to this with the erasing and the smudging, but decided that was just too much in the short amount of time I had to comment. I'll just link yours at the end of mine. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. SSDs have a limited number of read/writes but technology has gotten to a point where if you used both the same amount, the hard drive will fail mechanically long before you use up the number of read/writes. Plus as stated above, SSDs set aside an area to reallocate defective or failing spots in the drive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The SSD makes up for it by being more durable and a whole lot faster. Most people wouldn't even run into the read/write problem, simply because they'd have upgraded their computer before it begins to affect them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation! I have a question though, why do SSDs have a limited number of writes? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard drives are always multiples of 128? Really?</p>
<p>I'm sure you can have smaller hard drives.</p>
<p>Also I don't think I've heard of a hard drive of size 768GB before. It's always a power of 2 in my experience.</p></div>		</li>
