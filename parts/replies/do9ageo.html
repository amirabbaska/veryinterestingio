			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand. I think the frame removal is really the thing that makes it that much more dramatic. It's almost clicky, or jittery, and by doing so, increases my anxiousness while watching it. This increases the overall feel of the pace of the shot, and it's almost like they filmed it in slow motion, as a dance sequence, then sped it up, and removed frames. This would give it this great pulse and pace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure we're talking about <em>shutter speed</em>, which is related to (but not the same as) frame rate.</p>
<p>In a film camera, the film strip has to be physically advanced between exposures of the frames. While the film is moving, a device called the shutter blocks light from falling on the film to prevent the whole frame becoming a gigantic motion blur.</p>
<p>If a movie is shot at 24fps, each frame lasts for about 0.04 seconds. The shutter and film-advance mechanisms can't operate instantaneously, so photography only takes place for a fraction of that 0.04 seconds. The shutter can be adjusted to allow the exposure to be longer or shorter. Digital movie camera sensors have a similar principle wherein they alternate between gathering light and offloading data.</p>
<p>Since the exposure time is not instantaneous, moving objects in the camera's view will become <em>motion-blurred</em>. The longer the shutter is open, the more apparent the blur becomes. While this makes motion appear smoother to our eyes when played back, it has the obvious downside of reducing visible detail.</p>
<p>In fast-paced action scenes, the shutter speed is often set to a short interval which keeps each individual frame relatively crisp and helps to keep the on-screen action legible. This is turned &quot;up to eleven&quot; for stylistic effect in the church fight, in part to represent the effects of the mind-control chips.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they also filmed the battle scenes in Gladiator like this. I thought I read something along this line that they shot at a higher frame rate and then dropped every other frame, removing motion blur and making movements look more crisp or stroboscopic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you watch closely in terms of putting you in the perspective of Harry not only do you see threats as he sees them. The camera goes low as he does, moves up when he does, this really helps with the feeling of assassination with the kingman agent as his entire perception is being simulated with camera position and movement.</p>
<p>Also a tid bit there a few camera tricks as the whole scene feels like a one shot but takes the advantages of one shot and multiple takes cleverly. When the camera pans quickly changing view that can be two shots stitched together within the blur of movement.</p>
<p>There a really awesome video about it which someone posted below, well worth the watch.</p></div>		</li>
