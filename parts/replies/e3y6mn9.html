			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;heavier drops&quot; are just large drops. All rain has the same density. You need either collision-coalesence to achieve this or melted rimed ice. This is why &quot;heavier&quot; rain is found in squall lines/supercells or warm rain convection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Droplets form in the atmosphere when rising air cools to the dew point and starts forming droplets or ice crystals which start forming clouds. When droplets grow heavy enough, they fall and we get rain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though this statement is true, the important bit is your first paragraph. Rain doesn't end up as a droplet just because it started as one. If you started with water in any other shape (say, a bucket) and tossed it off a high enough building, it would mostly be in droplet form by the time it reaches the ground.</p>
<p>When surface tension is at an equilibrium with drag forces, the drop will stop splitting into smaller drops and settle into a round shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, I threw that in there to say that there isn't a process that would form sheets and hosefulls anyway.</p>
<p>A bucket full wouldn't have to travel very far to end up as droplets of about a 3mm maximum diameter. USGS has a <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/raindropshape.html" target="_blank">good explanation</a> to what happens to droplets with air resistance thrown in. Basically, air resistance tries to make 3+ mm droplets into donuts and at 4.5 mm they pop like bubbles into smaller droplets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically it's not a round shape as it falls. It's shaped more like a drop sitting on a flat surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe in a vacuum. If they are falling with any significant speed there's air resistance. Its not a tear drop, but I wouldn't call it a sphere. If its big enough and goes fast enough it gets so concave that it splits into multiple drops. It would keep doing that until the air resistance isnt enough. </p></div>		</li>
