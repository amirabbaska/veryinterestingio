			<div class="markdown"><p>Stupid question, but is there any evidence that the forms of dementia that we commonly associate with 'aging' are a natural consequence of aging, even with humans?</p>
<p>Certainly it could be the case (might even have been proven) but just naively it seems like it didn't &quot;become an issue&quot; until everyone started living so long, which primarily occurred after the advent of medicine (and to a certain extent the industrial revolution). Not sure how exactly you &quot;clean your sample&quot; to control for the possibility of environmental factors like heavy metals (lead, mercury, etc...) or even conceivably prion diseases (post hospitals).</p>
<p>Written history only goes back so far but even if you go back to the beginning you're seeing them taking things known to cause dementia as a form of medicine. Cinnabar (asia) for sure but even sodium nitrate (egypt) has been linked strongly with issues like these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to take issue with the idea of separating disease from 'natural consequences of ageing.'</p>
<p>Cancer is the most obvious example, since the typical mechanism (compounding mutations to DNA which collectively promote growth while preventing inhibitory processes from taking effect) is largely a 'natural consequence of ageing' - the longer you live the more oxidising agents and cosmic rays will zap your genes and the more likely you are to develop cancer. This doesn't preclude other causes, such as CMV and the other oncoviruses, but even if it did it still remains a distinction without a point.</p>
<p>The fact that something happens naturally as we age (e.g loss of cilia in the cochlea, loss of taste buds, degeneration of the cornea, loss of skin elasticity) is not in and of itself a useful fact, our interest is in <em>why</em> it happens as we age, and what we can do to prevent or reverse it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you watched anything from Aubrey De Grey or the SENS institute?  I'm curious if you'd agree or disagree with the idea of age accumulated damage as the primary cause behind a lot of these diseases and a focus on regenerative medicine (essentially supplementing the body's natural repairing mechanisms that deteriorate as you age) as a solution to many of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you really say that cancer is a consequence of aging when not everyone gets it? It seems more like simple statistics; the longer you live, the more cellular reproductions, all of which have a chance to go wrong.</p>
<p>It feels a bit like saying that getting hit by a bus is a consequence of aging, since the longer you live, the more opportunity you have to get hit by a bus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a stupid question at all.  I don't think there's a simple answer though.</p>
<p>As the other answer here mentions, it's possible that dementia would be more common in other species if their risks of predation, malnutrition, and disease were reduced the way some human populations' have been.  In that sense, some forms of dementia might be a &quot;natural&quot; result of aging.</p>
<p>There are also some reasons why it might be advantageous for brain plasticity to change over time--although this isn't the same as impairment caused by dementia.  Later in the life of many species, it may make the most sense to stop taking in so much new information, because you may have all the knowledge and memories you need to survive in your environment; ie, if it's not broken, don't fix it.  Maybe some aspects of undesirable age-related cognitive changes are this natural &quot;crystallization&quot; process being carried too far.</p>
<p>There are also some hypotheses related to neurodegenerative diseases (like Huntington's, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) that suggest humans may be particularly predisposed to these diseases, because of the ways our brain molecular machinery and cellular structures have evolved.  Maybe a brain that is more flexible and more capable of storing and using certain types of information is also more fragile/more vulnerable to protein plaque-related disorders.</p>
<p>I don't know enough about medical history to address your final points, though.  Given the quality of medical care in the times you are referring to, I'm not sure if we know that dementia wasn't previously common.  This review (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X98001282" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X98001282</a>) seems to suggest it has been around for a long time.  Given the poor understanding of medical cause and effect that previously existed (and still exists, tbh), I'm not sure you can take people consuming dementia-causing substances as proof that dementia wasn't an issue--many historical &quot;treatments&quot; were as bad as, worse than, or directly exacerbating to the diseases they were targeted toward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's worth pointing out that senior dogs often develop dementia.  I don't think it's possible to know if this is a result of living longer lives, or of living in a domestic environment, but it is an interesting comparison to other, wild species.
