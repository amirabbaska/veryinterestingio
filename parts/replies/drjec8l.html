			<div class="markdown"><p>Every thing you said is on point. My 5 year gets noise bleeds at school once in a while. The humidity level is ridiculously low when the heat is on. The best stuff I have found to use is a carpet and textile surfactant called Folex. They carry it at Lowes, Home Depot and iirc Target as well. It is about $6 for 36oz; don't need to use much so it lasts long time.</p></div>		</li>
