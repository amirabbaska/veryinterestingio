			<div class="markdown"><p>People have been trying to implement this for a while now. As far as I know, there has not been too much progress on it for humans.</p>
<p>As an aside, telomerase is also the reason why you will hear people saying that lobsters/crabs are &quot;functionally immortal&quot;, as most of their cells have telomerases that extend their cellular lifespan. However, they still die of &quot;age&quot;, as their shell molting process requires more and more energy the larger they get. At some point, they will not be able to eat enough to have enough energy to successfully complete this, and will then die mid-molt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAS, but yes. You can use telomerase to &quot;extend&quot; the life of human cells. Telomerase works so well, in fact, it also causes the cells affected to grow and multiply extremely quickly and unpredictably, mutating into a thing called 'cancer'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are some animals that don't show this kind of decay as the age. This is called having <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible_senescence" target="_blank">negligible senescence</a></p>
<p>There was a woman in the 50s who's cancer cells also didn't show this sort of aging. In fact, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Lacks" target="_blank">her cells are still being used in research all over the world,</a> more than 60 years after her death. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not exactly ELI5 but my understanding is that it's because the sex cells in humans are what is known as haploid, meaning they have half the chromosomes as an embryo/zygote/fetus/human</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that sperm/egg cells come from precursor cells which are not haploid. After the precursor cells divide through meiosis (process of turning into egg/sperm) they stop dividing and will only live long enough to either merge with their counterpart or simply die.</p>
<p>The relevant part of this is the precursor cells in men do divide through mitosis, creating more precursors. Which is why men can produce sperm throughout their lives. The one in women do not, which is why they go through menopause. In this situation I don't know what role telemerase plays in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the germ cells which are the precursor to gametes are more associated with telomerase than the haploid gametes. However the most fascinating thing i find, when it comes to human reproduction, is the knowledge that a female has all of the eggs she will ever have when she is born (sort of) and yet a male is able to make indefinite amounts of sperm. It's just another interesting anatomical/physiological/biological contrast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So could I take some telomerase to live longer?  Would that increase longevity, or just lead to aggressive cancers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it wouldn't necessarily be akin to taking a 'supplement' in the sense that if you take your 'telomerase pill' every day you will live indefinitely. </p>
<p>Also, the enzyme itself is more closely associated with specific cell lines rather than every cell in the body.</p>
<p>Thirdly, telomerase has no bearing upon the actual replication mechanisms within the cell which have been shown to degrade over time. </p>
<p>Therefore, and I apologize for the long winded remarks, even if there was a way to induce telomerase throughout every cell in the body it would unfortunately only ensure future cell division without guarantee that future cell progeny would be free of defect, ultimately giving rise to aggressive cancers.</p>
<p>However! There are theories that if you could trick the cell into having longer telomeres at onset (i.e: during fetal development) there is a chance you could significantly increase lifespan.  Couple that with potential gene therapy and advances in the field of nanotech and there is the plausibility one could extend the human lifespan far beyond the current limitation of 80-100 years. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you view it, life is finite. It's not guaranteed and we all pass on. Thus I encourage everyone to cherish every day, stop to look at the horizon. Smell the roses, gaze up at the night sky and bask in it's magnificence. Then realize, as far as we know we are the only ones in the known universe who have the illustrious privilege of being the silent observers of it's infinite mystique and beauty. Take pride in that gift, and use the time you have here well. </p></div>		</li>
