			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-purposive systems are often more easily discussed as if they were purposive. We say, for example, that a computer is solving a problem in order to get the answer, rather than that its electrical circuits are being switched on and off in a pattern which a programmer deduced would get an answer. It's just a lot easier to talk about things that don't have purposes as if they did. The fact that the OP used the word purpose is not generally indicative of a belief in his part that evolution is purpose-based. It's just easier to talk about that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but the computer is built with that purpose in mind, whereas evolution seems random. So for the computer such language doesn't subtract from the message one tries to convey, but in light of evolution it leads to others precisely missing the point: current consensus is that it is random—precisely <em>not</em> with purpose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Computers are just one example; there are many that involve no purpose at all. We say that objects behave &quot;in order to&quot; get to lower energy states. We say that water flows over an osmotic gradient &quot;in order to&quot; even out the presence of liquid. Science is full of purpose metaphors in places where no purpose exists, and it doesn't seem to distract from the meaning there, no?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, that also misses the point. Natural selection is by definition the nonrandom survival and reproduction of individuals and their genes. Mutation is random; evolution is very much <em>not</em> random. EDIT: instead of saying &quot;evolution is random&quot; it's better to say &quot;evolution lacks foresight.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Veha's objection is even a little ironic, since you could argue that any legitimate &quot;purposive-system&quot; ultimately derives its purpose from evolution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're right, I think you're looking at only the word purpose and not the context of the question, which makes fine scientific sense.</p>
<p>I interpreted the OP's use of the word purpose to suggest that there was an evolutionary pressure that made the different blood types be a preserved mutation. For example, the Duffy mutation discussed in a different comment, which is proposed to be preserved because it infers an advantage against malaria. One might refer to its purpose is because it provides some defense against malaria. </p>
<p>Not purpose in the &quot;Designed with a purpose in mind&quot; sense, but purpose as in &quot;this is what it does that is advantageous and so it is a mutation that sticks around&quot; sense.</p>
<p>A random mutation with no &quot;purpose&quot; would not be preserved. Yes, it's anthropomorphism, but in line with other scientific-based anthropomorphisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Human beings and animals in general are very adaptive. People born and raised at very high altitudes aren’t genetically predisposed to need less oxygen. Why couldn’t some forms of evolution just be adaptations that became genetic?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This question has been asked before in academic context, and it's simply current consensus that genetic mutations are random, and not based on some feedback from the environment. To put it more plainly: there's no evidence that blacksmiths' sons have a genetic predisposition to become more muscular than non-blacksmiths' sons.</p></div>		</li>
