			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had anxiety for the past 5 years and I'm 21 now...I had my first panic attack when I was a junior in high school. The class was going around where everyone would say their name and something about themselves (which I normally would have had no problem with) and as I was waiting my turn, all of a sudden I started getting tunnel vision, my entire body went numb especially my face and mouth. To this day that was the scariest thing to happen to me considering I was just in high school and I never experienced anxiety before. I felt like I was dying. I had this insane sensation that I was sinking into the ground as if I was walking through really thick mud. I went to the hospital and they ruled it as anxiety, I've been to therapists and other specialty doctors and they all diagnosed me with anxiety. I ended up taking online classes for the rest of junior year because even the thought of school  brought up these physical sensations for me and I would feel like I'm sinking...5 years later I'm doing a lot better I'm on medication that gets rid of a lot of it and I'm able to live my life normally, but I still have physical symptoms like feeling like I'm not getting a big enough breath, like my breathing is normal but I feel like I'm being constricted. My heart races and then slows down tremendously and feels like it's beating twice as hard as it should be, and every once in a while if I'm around a lot of people and the attention is directed toward me I start to feel numb...I'm getting better everyday but so much better than 5 years ago. The scariest thing about it is I never know when it's going to happen and it all developed a random day in class. To everyone going through anxiety like me just remember it's all anxiety and if you think it's not your just going to make it worse for yourself you can do it guys!!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mind if I ask what medication you found that worked well? I have gone through a lot of them and found that most target depression more and haven't worked as well for my anxiety. I know that some antidepressants can work well for anxiety but none that I have tried have seemed to. The only thing that has worked well are benzos which aren't great to take long term. Your experience sounds similar to what I went through during the beginning of college, so hoping you have some insight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but Xanax was a real game changer for me.  Long term use is definitely an issue so you really want to avoid building up a tolerance by using it very sparingly.  I found that pre-emptively taking a small dose in advance of an anxiety causing situation works wonders by stopping the anxiety developing in the first place and needs far less mg than you need to put down an attack once it's underway (which you can always do anyway if the small dose doesn't prevent the anxiety from bubbling up).  That combined with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to help get more control over how your thought processes develop really turned things round for me over a six month period.  The CBT was really important because once the anxiety attacks started I found the fear of another attack was my new biggest cause of anxiety, so breaking that loop was really important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to confirm what /u/milquest said, i too use Xanax the exact same way - small doses ( 0.25-0.50mg) about 30-45 min prior to my anxiety/panic causing issues which is public speaking.  Also, another medication I take is a beta blocker.  It's for high blood pressure or fast heart rates.  The beta blocker I take is atenolol at 25mg per day which is a modest dose.  At one time I tried Zoloft and Paxil for a number of years and found it's zombie like effects intolerable not to mention they were ineffective for my problem.  The beta blocker has been a god send.  I still have to cope my extreme nervousness before public speaking, but at least don't feel like my body has taken complete control away from me.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have generalized anxiety disorder which means I get anxious all the time for no reason (yay me!). It came out of nowhere as I was a pretty easy going and relaxed person until shortly after my 23rd birthday. I now take Cipralex, which has worked well so far with no side effects. I still have days with high anxiety, but it hasn't been as worse as it was. Ativan is a wonder drug for me but I only take it if I'm having extreme anxiety, or about to do something that could cause panic (flying, interview, etc.). Good luck finding something that works</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This happened to me, just a few weeks ago. I didn't know what was happening, which just escalated the situation further. My hands started clamping up, it was like there were steel rods going through each of my fingers and I couldn't bend them and they were all numb. I felt that awful constricting feeling creeping up my chest towards my throat, and my eyes began rolling into the back of my head, and I legit thought that was it, I was gonna die. Someone called an ambulance, and they showed up right at the height of it, then wheeled me out on a stretcher (which was the most embarassing thing ever, and added to the stress of the whole situation). </p>
<p>But yeah, when I got to the hospital, they said it was just a panic attack. They said I hyperventilated so much that it threw my carbon dioxide levels out, making my blood too acidic, causing all those muscle spasms/seizures. It was awful. Wouldn't recommend. :( </p>
<p>And yeah, apparently you can &quot;fix&quot; this whole spiral by focusing on your slowing down your breathing. So didn't I feel stupid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot to mention the most important thing : cortisol. Cortisol in laymans terms is the stress hormone.

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. I study cortisol at a university and it is very hard wired in a diurnal cycle to the individual. Your best way to try and control cortisol levels is to monitor and control stress in your everyday life, cortisol is cool and very interesting to study but there are many factors that control every individuals cortisol response to different stimuli. Some people have very good cortisol (appropriate) response, and some people have worse responses that lead to health and wellness problems down the line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the main problem with that is you would have to be getting constant blood draws to measure your cortisol levels and staying at a hospital 24/7 would not successfully help you treat your anxiety.</p>
<p>You don't necessarily need to medicate. I would talk to a physician about anxiety disorders as they can be serious and debilitating. Ask him/her about alternatives to medication such as Yoga, which has been proven clinically to decrease the amount of dips and spikes in cortisol levels and generally decrease the overall amount of cortisol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal:</p>
<p>I have rage when I have anxiety attacks. The only 3 things that help are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Affection from my wife (Sex, comfort, physical contact)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Burying myself in my music.</p>
</li>
<li>Working out heavy. (Heavy bag, ground escape, weight lifting, riding hard on my mountain bike)</li>
</ol>
<p>I have paradoxical reactions to many meds, so I decided I would study how veterans deal with PTSD without meds. With help from my doctor, and my brother's nutritionist, I have changed my eating habits and added physical activity to my daily schedule. I have not had a a debilitating anxiety attack since. </p>
<p>I was diagnosed with PTSD years ago, which is what led me to study what combat veterans did. I am not a vet myself, so thought I was just having panic attacks like normal. I avoided going to any kind of doctor about it because I thought it meant I was weak. I have a history of being abused, among other things, and that can also cause severe PTSD. Something I never considered. </p>
<p>I share this only because I have also noted that my hair, skin and nails are all in better shape. No more break outs of hives with the anxiety. No more rancid sweat. Most important, I maintain logic when the attacks do occur. I can think my way through them and do my routine. </p>
<p>EDIT: clarified about having anxiety attacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So can you use this this response to explain one of my &quot;somewhat recent&quot; panic attacks? It has never made sense to me. I was in a meeting at work, that was basically training. I had been drinking the night before, but it was significantly less than i normally drink... due to knowing i had to go to a meeting the next day where i would have to, you know, pay attention and learn things. About 2 hours into the meeting I had a panic attack. I had never had one before (though i had gotten close, but during situations where i was in a large amount of stress... women problems, mostly). I had to ask the teacher to stop the class and told him i may need to go to the hospital. Some 3 or 4 minutes later i was completely fine. I hadn't really ate anything the whole day... it was maybe 10 0 clock and i hadn't ate anything, and i had drank a cup of coffee, and while i realize that is not the healthiest routine, it is something i had been doing for years, before, and since, with no repercussions. I cant understand why my body freaked out, in a low stress environment, for apparently no reason. Also, while i do drink more than any sane human should, it is very common for me to not drink for days, or even weeks and i suffer no withdrawals. So while i think the amount i drink is unhealthy, i find it hard to pinpoint  it on withdrawal symptoms. Can your body just randomly say fuck you, for no really logical reason? Am i maybe misjudging my stress levels?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Panic attack pathophysiology is complex and triggers can vary with the individual. It has to do with incorrect activation of the wrong stimulatory neural pathways in your brain. If this happens more than once, you should definitely see your physician. Panic attacks can increase in severity over time!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was likely the culmination of lots of small variables. Whilst you may suffer no withdrawals normally, the combination of nothing to eat + coffee (poor stomach) may have excacerbated symptoms. Combined with stress (even small amounts), a lack of fresh air (being in an office), any health problems (fitness, or fighting of a sickness, sleeping problems) etc etc.  </p>
<p>It all adds up. </p></div>		</li>
