<p>The 2'hydroxyl on the ribose increases the chance of self attack, however, adding to the transient breakdown of RNA. We want this though, to regulate translation. Lastly, the mRNA has the introns cut out and the exons spliced together. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. The main point is this: DNA is really stable, RNA is relatively unstable/reactive. So how they're used in the cell is reflected by this key difference. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because DNA is stable, it makes a great medium for storage of genetic info. It's like a hard-drive, or a reference book. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RNA is more reactive and will break-down spontaneously, so it is not a great storage medium, but it is an excellent tool for transferring info or for chemical reactions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most abundant form of RNA is ribosomal (rRNA), which is used to produce all the proteins in your body. The other common RNA is messenger RNA (mRNA), which you detailed in your post and is commonly understood to be the short-term transfer medium for genetic info. </p>
</li>
<li>There are a bunch of other forms of RNA, (tRNA, miRNA, piRNA, ribozymes etc.) which are possible because RNA is reactive and very adaptable. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! And nice additions. But yeah, stability is the main thing I wanted to explain because DNA is awesome to work with. Leave it out at room temperature for a week and it's still good. RNA is a pain in the ass and should go die in a hole somehwere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking your post for another question:</p>
<p>Can you (or anyone else) give an example of the next step in this process? When the RNA arrives to where it needs to go, where is it, what is using its info, and what is that builder going to do? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. So when the message arrives, it goes to this factory floor to a paper mache lego maker. Part of this machine is thick paper, other parts are lego. The message then goes into the bottom part of the paper mache machine, and calls a cardboard box. It calls a specific lego piece. Then it goes into making a lego chain. The top of the paper mache machine comes down, and starts feeding the message through to call pieces. </p>
<p>Three letters is a word from the message. Each word calls a lego piece specific to the word. Eventually the message gets to its end, and no lego piece is called anymore. The paper mache machine opens up and releases the lego chain, which then goes amd gets rearranged into different shapes by a lego blob. Now we have a lego machine to do whatever it is doing.</p></div>		</li>
