			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I work in an industry where a really strong year might mean ~1000 units. The only automation we have is welding. Every thing else is 100% hand assembled. And we're not talking bespoke luxury items here, just boring industrial equipment.</p>
<p>Now it helps that a &quot;cheap&quot; unit is $200k, so we've got pretty good profit margin, but it'd still take many years to pay off the initial capital investment to automate the assembly line. Not to mention there would probably need to be a ton of redesign to make the product robot-friendly.</p></div>		</li>
