			<div class="markdown"><p>That does not help with the problem of more and more rivers becomming a series of lakes instead. The <a href="http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/fish-cannon/" target="_blank">99 percent invisible podcast</a> did an episode on the problems. It does also talk about the salmon cannon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great many don't. The Columbia for instance, is a very large drainage basin, and about half of it has been lost as spawning grounds for salmon and steelhead due to dams. Dozens of sockeye and chinook runs have become extinct, and most of what remain are hatchery-raised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem is that, even with the current step system (and the salmon cannon that's being integrated slowly) the damn have turn what was a river in effectively a series of lakes, without the continuous fast water flow to sweep baby salmon into the ocean, the populations are seriously dropping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I strogbly doubt that fish end up in the turbines, those fuckers are spinning at a very high velocity and are made to run on water. Introducing solid objects into them could break machinery worth tens of millions of dollars. Turbine inlets are supposed to be blocked.</p></div>		</li>
