			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another reason, Linux isn't an operating system. It's a kernel for an operating system. Linux itself only handles things like &quot;here's how to use a network, this is what a process is&quot; etc. It doesn't have its own desktop, command line, or a way to start itself.</p>
<p>So people make tools for Linux. A project called GNU made a lot of the core tools and this combination of GNU and Linux with other open-source projects is compiled by developers into a Linux distribution, and each distribution has its own default software and way of doing things.</p>
<p>Google avoided GNU wherever possible and so Android is significantly different from most other distributions of Linux, and as a result you can't run most Linux programs on Android.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  However, there are a lot of aspects to this.  A more complete answer might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Linux is an implementation of POSIX (plus extras): it's a STANDARDISED operating system, that many programs work with (unlike windows that only windows programs work with... more or less).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>POSIX and the unix family in general have a culture of orthogonal applications and libraries: i.e., small, individual tools, that are independent, simple, and powerful, but yet they can be link together in STANDARDISED (more or less) ways, to perform more complex tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unix/POSIX basically HAD to be like this, because it evolved as the standard for getting real work done: science, engineering, and more, even as Windows was a toy operating system, for lowly PCs that were maybe used in small accountancy practices and mom &amp; pop stores, at best.  UNIX was, and in many ways still is, the workhorse of SERIOUS computing.  It's the pickup truck, to Windows' Ford Focus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The X Window System also shares that philosophy: it's designed to be networked (you could connect to another computer over the internet, run a program on that computer's processor, and have it draw on your screen, for example, long before things like Windows' Remote Desktop).  It was also designed to support multiple monitors, and could do things like video walls pretty early.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenGL originates with Unix as well, and again has a flexible, extensible, standardised API for rendering not just on one system (like Windows), but across many platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, because POSIX is a standard across multiple computers, there were basically always multiple &quot;desktop&quot; choices: from MGR to OpenLook to CDE and NeXTSTEP.  CDE (Common Desktop Environment) was one of the first that really looked like a modern desktop.  This was commercial though, and probably not available for Linux/BSD users, so those users made a clone instead: KDE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KDE was basically the first attempt at a modern desktop for Linux/BSD, but was not fully free software, due to use of the Qt Libraries.  That led to some protests, and GNOME was developed instead, using the GTK library instead of Qt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the above used the same underlying desktop protocol, though: X11.  So rather than being an incompatible mess, it again, all works together, giving you more choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, to make them all work NICELY together, and also to accomodate people moving to Linux/BSD from Windows, OS X, Amiga, and other systems, AND to accomodate Linux/BSD users who were jealous of new features in other systems as they appeared, a lot of customisability in terms of looks and power vs. appearance/behaviour was added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More customisation still, less appearance oriented, and more functionality oriented, is provided for that diverse user base: from the original academics, science, engineering, old-school hackers, and military users, to the new wave of web coders and ISP types who came to Linux later, to the even more recent wave of users who grew up on Windows, Mac, or Playstation, and wanted something pretty to play their MP3s and stream video while they browse the web on their HiDPI monitors in their leather gaming chairs.</p>
</li>
<li>Free Software and Open Source both enabled all of the above, and accelerated it.  Many of the above customisations happened more easily since the code was openly available and customisable.  Others happened precisely because it IS Free Software / Open Source: those movements are also influenced by unix, and feed off it's concept of customisability and cross-platform code that will compile anywhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also, however, feed back into those concepts, and encourage code to be ported to other systems; programs and skins and other features to be made available on Linux that were originally available only on BSD, or skins or package managers that were made for one distro to be ported to another distro, etc.</p>
<p>Long story short: Linux is unix: a quite standardised, commoditised operating system.  Its customisable in exactly the same way that PCs, as a standard, commoditised computer hardware platform, are customisable.</p>
<p>Unlike a Mac, or a Playstation, PCs can be built from scratch, customised as you like, because it's all standardised, and independent of any single company.  This makes PCs not only flexible and powerful, but incredibly good value for the price you pay in parts.  It also develops as a hardware platform much more quickly than rival systems like Desktop Macs, due to the constant innovation and competition from many companies around the world.  Where macs have stayed remotely competitive, it's mainly because they started using PC parts more often.  Same goes for games consoles.</p>
<p>Linux is, essentially, the PC of operating systems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Take a peak, some of those setups are as easy as installing one thing and clicking a switch in some Settings window, others involve hours of work, but Apple or MS can't offer this level of customizability:</p>

<p>Think of it like cakes.  Buy a Linux cake and you get the cake, and the ingredient list.  At any point you can easily take that recipe, tweak it to your heart's content, and make another cake.  Buy an MS or Apple cake, and you just get a finished cake. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now listen here, sonny... Back in my day.... Uphill both ways, I tell you...</p>
<p>Honestly that's how it all started, you'd need to download the source for everything and compile it yourself. The first distributions' &quot;package manager&quot; was just a series of scripts that unzipped source code, compiled it, and installed it. And we were happy to have <em>that</em>!</p>
<p>This meme is rehashing a joke that's 20+ years old at this point. Since the advent of binary distributions, package managers, repositories, etc, this joke no longer makes sense unless you're some weird gentoo/LFS freak.</p></div>		</li>
