			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the time dilation in that film was silly, 7 years per hour or something like that? That would mean everything in the sky would have been <em>8760</em> (hours in a year) x 7 times brighter than normal.</p>
<p>EDIT: not 2000 hours, no idea why I wrote that! ( Thanks u/jareds )</p></div>		</li>

<p>So it really wouldnt be that much of a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think (physics isn't my thing, but I went to school for a STEM field and used to read all of the big pop-sci books about it) the idea is that if a black hole is massive enough that a craft could theoretically avoid spaghettification, time dilation would increase to the point that the black hole would evaporate before the craft hit the <del>event horizon</del> singularity.</p>
<p>I don't think (but, I also don't know) that you'd see the universe &quot;die&quot;, I think it's more that you'd basically find yourself floating in a universe that's mostly dead, with the vast majority of mass having been converted to photons by whatever means.</p>
<p>[edit] Event horizon != singularity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These conclusions come from people using Schwarzchild coordinates incorrectly but they are not thought to describe accurate conditions infalling into a black hole. Using a different coordinate system, you lose the competing infinities thing. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskalâ€“Szekeres_coordinates" target="_blank">Kruskal-Szekeres</a> coordinates completely describe the spacetime manifold across the event horizon of a maximally extended Schwarzchild geometry and you can easily see that only a small subsection of the universe behind you is in your past light cone as its traversed, so you aren't going to be seeing the universe flash before your eyes. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't make much sense to me. After all many things manage to be swallowed by a black hole before the death of the universe and no time dilatation would make them actually last longer from the point of an outside observer. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a consequence of the curvature of spacetime since we cannot generally have globally inertial coordinates, but rather only locally inertial coordinates</p>

<p>Got everything up to this point, what are inertial coordinates?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, an inertial frame of reference is an area of flat spacetime.<br />
All of spacetime is curved, of course, but the curving isn't too sharp, so in the space immediately around you, you can just pretend spacetime is flat. It's the same as how you can pretend the earth is flat without your calculations going awry in most cases. It's only when you zoom out and make calculations on a large scale that you need to take into consideration the curvature of the earth's surface.  </p>
<p>In the same way, it's only when you make calculations on a large scale that you need to take the curvature of spacetime into consideration. When we use a model with flat spacetime, the space is called an inertial reference frame. Newton's equations apply here. Time proceeds the same everywhere in the reference frame. Inertial coordinates are just the coordinates in this reference frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, this was an awesome explanation! Very thought provoking also. It's interesting how small changes can add up to make such a big difference on scales unfathomably larger than us. I can't believe we had the audacity to even measure such large elements.  </p></div>		</li>

<p><del>Not sure about the red shifting party but I was thinking the planet wouldn't be visible because you'd get so few photons hitting your eye at any given point it would make the planet very dim. You'd need some kind of long exposure camera to accumulate the photons to make a viewable photo.</del></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughly, if the inner planet was sitting at 1/3 of the Schwarzschild radius above the event horizon (so really close to the black hole), the wavelengths would get doubled, which means you'd only see blue things, and you'd see them red. Any closer and you basically wouldn't  see anything.</p></div>		</li>
