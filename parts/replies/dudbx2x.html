			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;On all the time&quot; is not necessarily accurate.  Many modern tubes have intermittent imaging.  You can choose how many frames per second the machine images.  The radiographer and radiologist should not be using flouro during the times they are not actively watching the screen.  </p>
<p>Also, these tubes have 'image intensifiers' that basically allow you to use fractions of the amount of radiation you would use for a diagnostic xray film.  </p>
<p>The xray film needs much more detail to rule out bony abnormalities, whereas flouro is generally during a procedure and you don't need extremely fine detail. Also, dose is inversely proportional to the kVp employed.  The higher the kVp, the less dose the tissue absorbs.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You must be xraying in a very skinny people. KUB (abdomen xray) doses are usually much higher than skull radiograph doses because the thickness of the tissue penetrated is much more important than the density, at least at densities capable of being made by biological organisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I x-ray metals and plastics. So, I really wouldn't know about human tissues. But from what I remember, your typical medical x-ray tubes has a fixed kv. I was talking about bumping up the kv for more penetration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also adjust the image processing on the other side of things, like a camera can adjust its ISO setting. A more sensitive detector/image processing setting can still use the same amount of radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yea, it's like a faster film or, I can't remember what's it's call with CR or DDA. I was only into film radiography. </p></div>		</li>
