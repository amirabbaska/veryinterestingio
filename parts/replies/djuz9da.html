			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm... I might have to give it a good look and buy some of that copper stuff you squeeze on to re-connect the circuit. Both the radio and the defroster seem to work fine on their own. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The electrical chord is usually for FM reception.  The AM antenna will be a loop or coil antenna and it will either be a loop of wire around a plastic frame or it may be inside the actual radio.</p></div>		</li>
