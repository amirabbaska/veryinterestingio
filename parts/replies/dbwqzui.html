			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.  I'd like to add one more point.</p>
<p>A lot of arguments that people casually have in philosophy come down to people arguing over the definition of a word.  This is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_dispute" target="_blank">semantic dispute</a>.  Many people don't consider this to be a &quot;real&quot; question, because there's no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; definition of a word.  For example, we could define &quot;swimming&quot; to include submarines, or we could define &quot;swimming&quot; to not include submarines.  But, really, it wouldn't matter -- it wouldn't affect what we say about the world.  We could just pick one and then consistently use that.  Submarines would <em>sail</em> instead of <em>swim</em>, and it wouldn't change anything.  We'd just use a different word everywhere.</p>
<p>This often comes up because philosophy makes people think very rigorously about the meaning of words.  And a lot of time, the definition of English words is incomplete -- a dictionary won't tell you <em>exactly</em> whether a word should be used to describe something or not.  That's because we don't <em>need</em> a precise definition -- we only make our definitions precise enough to handle the cases that we normally care about on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>So, for example -- we don't normally define exactly what a &quot;heap&quot; is.  If you put a grain of rice down, that's not a heap.  But if you put a million down, that could be called a heap of rice.  Somewhere between the two, the pile of rice became a heap.  But there's no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; place to draw a line, because we've simply never bothered to do so -- we've always worked with a fuzzy definition of &quot;heap&quot;.  And it's good enough for what we use &quot;heap&quot; for in daily English usage.</p>
<p>So the right answer to someone being asked whether it's 1001 or 1002 grains of rice that makes something a heap is &quot;That isn't defined&quot;.</p>
<p>An example of a problem in philosophy that raises a semantic dispute is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus" target="_blank">Ship of Theseus</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, while these questions can help you understand how we think about words or highlight the fact that our English definitions are vague, sometimes people start arguing about <em>which definition is right</em>.  That's a semantic dispute.  And what I'd call the appropriate response to this sort of thing is really &quot;this just isn't an interesting question&quot;.  It's not defined, and it doesn't matter that much what you choose, as long as you use the definition that you choose consistently.</p>
<p>There are also a few complications.  In law or in ethics, we use English words to define things whether or not something is <em>legal</em> or whether or not it is <em>morally-right</em>.  For example, it's not legal to &quot;murder&quot;, so the question of &quot;whether or not killing a fetus is murder&quot; isn't really just a semantic dispute, even though it looks like one, because we've already stated that murder is not okay.  If it were a semantic dispute and we decided that killing a fetus is murder, we'd need to be willing to say &quot;it's murder but that's potentially okay in this case&quot;.  That's not the case -- instead, asking whether or not killing a fetus is murder is asking &quot;what should our legal rule on this be?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point. It reminds me of discussions about the concept of &quot;life&quot;. I also liked the problem of the Ship of Theseus. Except for a few cells, aren't we like the Ship? We define things based on characteristics that mean something to us, and often make the error of presuming they have an intrinsic meaning.</p></div>		</li>
