			<div class="markdown"><p>Econ grad here. I think you explained this perfectly. To continue your thought, I think Trump understands that broad up swings and bull markets are universally good, because the workforce, from local to national, will somewhat answer the call for new hires, but I'm concerned that such blanket tax policy is slightly overbearing and will result in some aread/industries being hurt or disadvantaged as badly as others are helped or encouraged. Then again, we are a nation of nearly 350 million people, and that alone guarantees that any policy will have a negative effect somewhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This theory would hold but with the impending threat of automation. Its a disaster. With a projected 6% loss of employment to automation by 2020, that figure will only rise if companies have to pay more for labour. But i'm not one for bleak scenarios without solutions. Trump needs to move towards basic income and public owned renewable energy Utilities. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Part of the problem with globalization is that certain areas tend to get hit extremely hard. In the U.S.'s case, one big example is manufacturing (because it's cheaper labor). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This argument is a pet peeve of mine, because it's (partially/mostly) wrong. Or at least incomplete. </p>
<p>Factory production is actually way up in the US - <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/265cd8fb02fb44a69cf0eaa2063e11d9/mexico-taking-us-factory-jobs-blame-robots-instead" target="_blank">since 1979, &quot;<strong>American factory production</strong>, minus raw materials and some other costs, <strong>more than doubled</strong> over the same span to $1.91 trillion last year&quot;</a> (emphasis mine).</p>
<p>The problem isn't that our manufacturing is down. As a whole, it's not (yes, some sectors suck more than others). The problem is that, due to robotics and automation, we need WAY less warm bodies to generate that level of production. </p>
<p>Yes, trade does make a difference. Companies should try to keep as many Americans employed as possible, the economy doesn't benefit from people with no disposable income. But it's a smaller part of the problem than just simple technological advancement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, oops. I should've specified employment, as that's what i was referring to. I was referring to employment not productivity, but i should've been more clear.</p>
<p>You're also mostly right on the technology front, although i will mention you have to be a tad careful with the exact numbers, because they tend to get somewhat skewed by computer equipment. (see:<a href="https://growthecon.com/blog/Manufacturing/" target="_blank">https://growthecon.com/blog/Manufacturing/</a> as well as the two Justin Fox articles it references for a good discussion on it). It doesn't change your overall point at all, but it's worth keeping in mind, numbers wise.</p>
<p>I do have one (minor) quibble- while technology is definitely going to be the major factor (and is currently the major factor), globalization wasn't negligible. China in particular had a huge shock as papers by Autor and Dorn have been showing recently. So people aren't completely wrong to be blaming globalization, although at this rate, technology is quickly making the point moot.</p>
<p>Technology is definitely a huge factor that i omitted though, for simplicity. It needs to be kept in mind for a full discussion</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>I suppose for completeness' sake on the technology front that perception matters a lot, as well. It's not just manufacturing- we see similar complains in energy generation (ie, coal), despite there not really being a connection to open trade. Immigration has always been an easy scapegoat, and probably always will be. At best, it'll likely be another decade or two before the effect of technology really sinks into the public conciousness/conversation(although elites are already aware of the effect)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in tech. I estimate that if there were desire to do so, it would be possible to replace around 95% of all employed persons in the US, with automated processes in maybe... 10 years. Basically all of the technologies exist today. Dr's, Drivers, Pilots, Soldiers (police) </p>
<p>In the vast majority of cases, it would likely be economically beneficial for service providers / producers do it in the long run.
This problem is so immensely under apreciated by the public. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but people will want other humans in certain positions. And who is reliable when an automated plane crashes, or an automated car? Killing 2, 3, a thousand people? Robots in factories operate in a certain circle that humans aren't allowed to be in while they are on, because robots don't know what they are doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I'm making the point that &quot;all the jobs are being shipped overseas&quot; is only a portion of the problem. The people that say that ALSO like to say &quot;we don't manufacture anything anymore&quot;. Also not true. </p>
<p>They are absolutely related, in the context of the conversation.</p></div>		</li>
