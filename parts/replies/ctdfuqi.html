			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like that really.  There's not just one fingerprint database.  There are many for different reasons.  I used to work for a government plant pathology lab and had to get fingerprinted. The USDA has my fingerprints in their database. If I was arrested the police would already have a set of fingerprints available to use even though I had never been arrested and fingerprinted before (only if they knew where to go to find those prints.) They run fingerprints against many available databases to find what they are looking for. You don't have to be a criminal to have been entered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your fingerprints in the USDA database are not searchable by federal, state, or local authorities. A judge may issue a warrant for the USDA to release them to law enforcement.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to convey is that when police find  prints on a crime scene, the police do not run these through fingerprint databases collected for security purposes by private or government organizations.</p></div>		</li>
