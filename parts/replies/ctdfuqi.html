			<div class="markdown"><p>This, I actually do something similar for a similar kids day held at a university. They usually have police come in to print but when the lines get long enough, I am pretty much qualified to do prints.</p>
<p>We also usually hand out sterile qtips to adults. They come in paper packages and basically tell parents when they get home wear gloves, open the package, swab the inside of the kids cheek, put back in package but leave it in the air for a few hours to dry (mold destroys dna) and then put it in a plastic bag for safe keeping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question: why not just make a database? Seems like there are only upsides to it. </p>
<p>I've always wondered why the government doesn't just tag everyone young so that if there is a crime, they have a decent idea of who did it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like that really.  There's not just one fingerprint database.  There are many for different reasons.  I used to work for a government plant pathology lab and had to get fingerprinted. The USDA has my fingerprints in their database. If I was arrested the police would already have a set of fingerprints available to use even though I had never been arrested and fingerprinted before (only if they knew where to go to find those prints.) They run fingerprints against many available databases to find what they are looking for. You don't have to be a criminal to have been entered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your fingerprints in the USDA database are not searchable by federal, state, or local authorities. A judge may issue a warrant for the USDA to release them to law enforcement.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to convey is that when police find  prints on a crime scene, the police do not run these through fingerprint databases collected for security purposes by private or government organizations.</p></div>		</li>
