<p>The Secretaries of Defense and State are likely to know almost as much information as the President, but they don't get lifetime protection. </p>

<p>I'd never thought of that. Is that not a vulnerability to national security?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The former POTUS is not a threat to national security. Someone could go get Obama right now and while the death would be tragic it wouldn't cause any serious problems. Lifetime protection is there just because they don't want the presidency to be an automatic death sentence for whoever takes the job. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on: being POTUS doesn't automatically grant you the right to know every bit of classified information. Chances are likely Obama wasn't informed about the existence of stealth helicopters until they began planning the raid on Osama bin Laden. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a different aspect of national security that is more symbolic than about any actual information. The danger to former presidents is that they are 1) extremely prominent targets, far more so than former Secretaries, and 2) the consequences to the national image if anything did happen to them. A former president isn't just another casualty, and as a hostage the last concern would be the intel he knew. It would be the enormous leverage that they could exert over the country, because no nation can accept threats to legitimate (if former) Heads of State. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The information becomes exponentially less compromising over time. Anyone knowing anything is a vulnerability, and the gov just tries to manage it by going through a rigorous clearance process. Just think, sure the president knows a lot, but so do analysts in intelligence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone know quite as many things though? It seems they would only know a subset, so if they get caught and reveal all they know, it's less of a hit than if the president spills all his beans</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The President is at the top of the tower looking down. He can see the most, but very little in any significant details. Every floor below him are people who see less of the big picture, but of what they do see, they see at greater details. A President can know a lot, but there are countless other people who will know a lot more details about certain a given topic than he ever would.</p></div>		</li>
