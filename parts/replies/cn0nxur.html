			<p>You realize if one actually bought all those things, the bill wouldn't even be that high compared to keeping a car on the road?<br><br>Hmm. Let's see. I do have an internet bill (80$). No cell phone or bill, no cable TV (netflix), no Ipad, 20$ shoes and some clothes I have owned since high school.<br><br>Ya.. I am sure that $5000 dollars on all the &quot;gizmos&quot; you mention still won't buy me a nice vehicle or even close to a house.... But we do spend our money differently. Like expensive gas, food, housing clothes, schooling. It all goes to that. My parents on the other hand spend tons of money on those things you mention, and have a house, and car.<br><br>I must be lazy or some shit. I went to school for IT, and same as my mother. Too bad when I talk to her about computers, she doesn't know what a GPU is. Her schooling wore off 20 years ago.</p>		</li>

			<p>lol I have none of that. All I have is the internet bill, and my car is the most expensive thing to my name. A valued $2k beater that probably isn't worth half that because it keeps breaking down. woah I scored big there.</p>		</li>
