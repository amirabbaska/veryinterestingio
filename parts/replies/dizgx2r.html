			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually they don't find everyone, and the machines are prety high tech these days. They often have extremely detailed records in the machine of all plays, in order to prevent cheating, record results, and audit issues like this. Older or less electronic machines you just sort of figure it out best you can. Also the gaming commision can review it and decides if it is reasonable or not, and has a lot of power if they don't think the casino is following the rules. Also, if you lost on the machine, and think it was broken but they won't pay you, you can sue them for your losses. Then the court will decide. </p>
<p>Its like anything else that happens where something goes south. The evidence is collected, people look at the law and follow as best they can, then if they disagree or one person is being shady then they sue and the courst decide as best they can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't see anything that says the casino is obligated to look up other people and give them their money back, <em>regardless of when the initial malfunction occurred</em>.</p>
<p>From what I see, the casino is basically saying, &quot;Yeah, that was an aberration, just a one-off error, so we're voiding it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gaming comission is very political and really just sides with the casino in most cases. Where they have major issues is when dealers make mistakes, legal or illegal. I was friends briefly with one who pulled a bj dealer off the floor for some misdeal</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a modern casino (pretty much all of them worldwide) each slot machine is connected back to a slot data server via Ethernet or serial communications. </p>
<p>Any time something happens on that machine (handle pull, cash in, cash out, jackpot, card in, card out) the machine sends the meters, patron id from the player's loyalty card, and other information relevant to the moment to be recorded on the slot servers. If the machine cannot communicate it will lock up and refuse to go any further. </p>
<p>Additionally, any exceptions that occur are sent to the slot server and recorded. These include hundreds of different tilt codes and other messages. </p>
<p>All of this data can be reviewed to see when and why a machine was behaving a certain way and when it started. </p>
<p>The cash in/cash out/jackpot paid meters are also used to validate that the monies pulled and physically counted by the count teams matches what the machine thinks it took in and paid out.  </p>
<p>The level of detail is pretty astonishing but the casino wants its money, patrons want their money, and the state wants their cut in taxes. No one wants to be cheated or to cheat anyone else out of what is rightfully theirs. So we take great pains to make sure it is as correct as we can possibly make it. </p>

<p>I'm pretty sure casinos are perfectly happy to cheat people out of money, provided they don't get caught.</p></div>		</li>
