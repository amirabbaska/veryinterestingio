			<div class="markdown"><p>It is an important point about quantum gravity that it is possible for wildly different things to happen from the point of view of different observers. It can be shown that this is necessary if you want to preserve unitarity of quantum mechanics, aka conservation of probability.</p>
<p>If you assume unitarity is sacred, then you need to accept that for some observers there is a black hole interior ending in a singularity, while for other there is none and spacetime ends at the horizon.</p>
<p>Since this is a quantum gravity thing, everyone should agree on what happens in the region where classical gravity applies, which is from ~ a planck length above the horizon to out to infinity, so almost all of the outside. But anything inside can have very different interpretations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess this is where I was going with the question.  If the original matter and antimatter were present and combined in a collision, would the result be photons, and would the black hole hold together the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The black hole holds together the same no matter what it was formed from or fed, as from the singularity up to the event horizon, the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light, and there's simply nowhere else for anything to go but the center. </p>
<p>If you're interested, there's what's known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_%28astrophysics%29" target="_blank">Kugelblitz</a>, or a theoretical black hole formed from enough light focused into the exact same point such that it's energy-dense enough to collapse into one. There are complicating factors, however, one of which being that the temperature of the point at which the light would occupy would be so hot that our current understanding of physics breaks down.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia link I provided is rather short, but there are a bunch of YouTube videos available on the subject that go into much more detail.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The black hole is black because even light (photons) cannot escape it.  Essentially the speed of light is below the escape velocity of the black hole, so photons are also pulled into the singularity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may get buried but if in theory we were able to achieve faster than light travel (or if it existed) would someone be able to travel in and out of a black hole (notwithstanding gravitational pressures)  has the escape velocity been measured or does it vary based on size etc of the black hole? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That still wouldn't explain why antimatter tended to form black holes more than regular matter. Either way, it's still an apparent matter/anti-matter asymmetry in the early universe.</p></div>		</li>
