Instead we have partial answer at the top since he used sources to prove one part of it; it is ok to use sources of course but it can make the person seem like they have authority when the fact they tell will leave the wrong impression. Now a lot of people think it doesn't matter at all, when it SURE does when removing actual dirt and grime; we don't usually wash our hand for anti-bacterial purposes but to clean actual physical dirt. The top answer (atm) is good info for a surgeon. </p></div>		</li>
