			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds pretty severe, so little tips and tricks that internet people can offer are unlikely to be substantial and you should see an actual professional.</p>
<p>What is your environment like? Is a lot of sunlight able to hit you? It's a lot easier on our bodies if we can wake up with the sun. If no sunlight can enter your room (and you keep it temperature controlled), it's easy to oversleep, as your body regulates your sleep with temperature and sunlight. Conversely this is why it can feel like agony to wake up early for normal people even if they get 8 hours because they're waking up when it's dark and cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's another thing - I use a bedsheet right up until October, then a 4.5 tog duvet through the Winter. I've actually just moved back to a bed sheet as it's gotten warm enough. My window is open 24/7 in a small room, and the fan is on from March &gt; October, and intermittent during Winter. I am a hot mofo (sizzle sizzle babeh).</p>
<p>But that is most likely due to drug abuse for...all my years ha. I took <em>all</em> of the coke and MDMA from ages of 16 &gt; 26, I noticed the hotness when I was around 20 or so, and it has stuck.</p>
<p>My room is typically 10-15c</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is a biological problem, but a behavioral one. what I suspect is happening is that you associate late pm with a time where you can relax, play video games, watch tv, as opposed to day light time during which you should be working, cleaning, going on errands. so your brains tricks you into prolonging the &quot;fun&quot; part of your day (by staying up late) while shortening the tedious part of your day (by getting up late).</p>
<p>the answer is to find something to occupy your day with. with your sleeping schedule, I presume you don't study or work full time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a solid theory but I don't have a life lol. I'm half a cripple and work on the computer, my days are all the same no matter the time of it.</p>
<p>Also lazy...so fucking <em>lazy</em>. I swear I'd be a puddle if my body allowed it. Apathy is a cruel mistress</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a medical professional, but I have the same exact problem as you and a medical professional told me that my melatonin process is reversed. Now, the medical professional who told me this never did any tests, and was a GP not a specialist, but she had also been my doctor for my entire life at that point (I was 19 and she was my pediatrician, it was right before I got an &quot;adult&quot; doctor). FWIW, it seems that there are people who are physiologically nocturnal - not &quot;night owls,&quot; or people who just like being up at night, but people whose bodies send out sleep/wake hormones at the wrong signals. My body produces melatonin when the sun comes up, instead of when the sun goes down. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, there's no real fix. I take about 5 mg of over the counter melatonin every night before I go to bed (around 10 or 11), and it's made it so that I can at least be functional on a day schedule. My body still wants to sleep during the day, and I don't think I'll ever feel as rested or good as I do when I stick to a night schedule, but like I said, it does at least help. I've been taking melatonin every night for about four years now, and as long as I leave myself a solid 9 hours to sleep, I can get up in the morning and feel functional and okay throughout the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well god damn, while relieving, that is pretty fucking annoying. Don't get me wrong, I love sleeping during the day, I love how much I get done during the night, and since I moved back with my parents (missus died, too poor to live alone), the peace and quiet is awesome, but I was really hoping it wasn't a permanent thing. Ah well, at least now I know, thanks bud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry about your loss. That's a tough blow. Glad to hear you're doing okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I felt pretty much exactly the same way. It sucks that this will never go away, but at least now I know. And there's something that helps a bit for if/when you need to go back to a day schedule. You're welcome, fellow nocturnal!</p></div>		</li>
