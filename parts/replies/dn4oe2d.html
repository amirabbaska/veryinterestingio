			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, even if all 9 of these were solved, we would still die of aging. The issue of cholesterol buildup in arteries doesn't get solved, so heart attack would still be there. The issue that glomeruli in the kidneys undergo sclerosis wouldn't get solved, so end stage renal disease would be a looming concern. Fat and collagen replacement of the liver would still be around, so cirrhosis with portal hypertension would still occur. Neurons would keep producing waste at a rate that glia can't keep up with, leading to eventual dementia and cognitive decline.  </p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>God</strong>:  “Planned obsolescence at its finest.  Gotta clean out the old apes who are too set in their ways so younger ones less attached to the old ways can enact progress that ancient immortals would resist.  Do you really want General Lee publicizing his thoughts on the Civil Rights Act of 1964?  The needs of the species outweigh the needs of the individuals. <strong>Aging isn't a bug, it's a feature.</strong>”</p>
<p>Fixing aging would require fixing so many other problems.  Humans would need to be rational enough to shed bad traditions and prejudices.  And cancer would need to be cured (<a href="http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/guide/prostate-cancer-risk-factors" target="_blank">more than 80% of men over the age of 80 have prostate cancer cells in their prostate.</a>)  God opted for the less comprehensive but much simpler solution:  <a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/hard_reboot_2x.png" target="_blank">Do a hard-reboot every few decades.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer, I'd say. Adding onto your last point, there is actually a lot of evolutionary pressure through epigenetics that is starting to be explored recently. It's thought that a lot of the methylation and acylation may also be positively selecting genes related to longer lives. As you probably know, methylation or acylation of specific amino acid residues on histone tails leads to altered chromatin states. I actually find it quite neat. There have actually been some papers published showcasing that these epigenetic effects can actually generate non-mutational resistance by upregulating key survival genes that may be inhibited by the chemical. If I find the paper I'll post it. </p></div>		</li>
