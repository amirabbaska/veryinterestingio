<p>From 100 feet away, it would take a .556 round 0.0003125 seconds to cover that distance</p>

<p>The 0.3ms are actually off by a factor of 100. The bullet travels at around 990m/s and you fire it from 30m away, so the time it takes to travel that distance is 30m*s/990m = 1/33s or 30ms</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>5.56mm NATO not .556 just FYI. I agree with your assessment, it is scary to think how it can be over so quickly, although also reassuring as feeling a bomb blast kill you is less appealing than having the lights go out instantly.</p></div>		</li>
