			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean that a young albacore is also low in mercury? I always thought that fish like grouper, which are also high in mercury, are high in mercury regardless of age (though the bigger the fish, the more mercury). Since the Mercury levels are due to the fish eating other fish, am I wrong? Would very young grouper actually be low in mercury, since it didn't have much of an opportunity to chomp on big fish? Or is it some sort of hereditary aspect as well? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_in_fish" target="_blank">Wikipedia </a> breaks it down pretty thoroughly.  You're part way there with thinking younger and smaller equals less mercury.  Fish in general aren't able to get rid of mercury very will, but absorb it efficiently so the bigger the fish the higher up the food chain the more they get from eating smaller fish, and then the longer they live the more they accumulate.  The food chain part of the equation is referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomagnification" target="_blank">biomagnification</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting part of an article for others to read...</p>
<p>There are myriad issues with eating these types of fish. “Human bodies cannot digest their oil, which is toxic wax ester and leads to keriorrhea,” explains Kousaka, referring to a very less-than-pleasant side effect. (Indeed, there is a distinct waxy texture to escolar.) Just how risky is it to consume these fish? “The Japanese government considers them toxic…. It is prohibited to sell or serve these ‘white tunas.’ It is that dangerous!” exclaims the chef. He adds that he personally would never purchase any fish marked “white tuna.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, serving oilfish, butterfish and escolar is not banned in the U.S. Lower-end sushi places “tend to use falsely named fish to save cost,” says chef Masaki Saito of top-notch omakase-only establishment Sushi Ginza Onodera. Labeling escolar as “white tuna to mislead consumers is not exactly uncommon,” Saito adds.</p>
<p>Chef Kousaka adds that he believes the mislabeling of fish at sushi restaurants in the U.S. is “huge.”</p>
<p>Still need convincing that you should stay away from any fish labeled “white tuna”? Feel free to Google the term “keriorrhea.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US albacore can and very much is marketed to the public as white tuna.  Specifically there is a <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=161.190" target="_blank">US Code of Federal Regulation 161.190</a> addressing this:</p>
<pre><code>(4) Canned tuna, in any of the forms of pack specified in paragraph (a) 
(3) of this section, falls within one of the following color designations, measured by visual comparison 
     with matte surface neutral reflectance standards corresponding to the specified Munsell units of 
     value, determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section.

(i) White. This color designation is limited to the species Thunnus alalunga (albacore), and is not darker 
     than Munsell value 6.3.

(ii) Light. This color designation includes any tuna not darker than Munsell value 5.3.

(iii) Dark. This color designation includes all tuna darker than Munsell value 5.3.</code></pre></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true.  White tuna does refer to albacore.  Wikipedia for a basic source.  Also, wikipedia states that escolar is sometimes fraudulently sold as &quot;white tuna&quot;.  But when normal people say white tuna, they are referring to albacore.</p></div>		</li>
