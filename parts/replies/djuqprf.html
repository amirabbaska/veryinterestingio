			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather than trying to explain it theoretically, let me use the example that helped me grasp the weirdness of special relativity.</p>
<p>There is a particle called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon" target="_blank">muon</a>. It is <em>almost</em> identical to an electron, except that it is a little heavier (okay, around 200 times heavier, but electrons have such little mass that muons are still <em>reeeally</em> small). It is also extremely unstable, and will decay into an electron (and some neutrinos) very quickly, in around 2x10^-6 seconds.</p>
<p>Because they have such a short lifetime, you don't see them in nature very often. One place we do see them, however, is in the upper atmosphere. High energy protons from the sun crash into atomic nuclei up there and (through a roundabout process) make muons. Since they decay so quickly, however, there shouldn't be enough time for them to make it all the way down to the ground for us to detect them. Even if they traveled near the speed of light (which they do), the longest surviving muons would only make it a kilometer or so before decaying.</p>
<p>Here's the strange part: we can totally detect those muons down here on the ground. How is this possible? Relativity.</p>
<p>Without getting into the math, here is what happens. The muon is moving very quickly relative to us, so we will experience time and space differently. The one thing we will agree with the muon on is the relative speed between us, i.e. the speed at which the muon is flying towards the ground.</p>
<p>What we see is a muon that is traveling very quickly through space, but rather slowly in time, allowing it to live longer than we might otherwise expect.</p>
<p>Here is where it gets really cool. We and the muon both agree about the speed it is coming towards us. We have to. There is nothing more special about either us or the muon that means that one of us measures the <em>relative</em> speed between us as different. &quot;But the muon is traveling slower through time, so it should think its going faster, right?&quot; That was my first guess, too. The muon experiences no <em>time dilation</em>, but rather <em>length contraction</em>. The muon sees the distance from the upper atmosphere to the ground as far shorter than it actually is; the whole world is shrunk along the direction of the muon's motion. It sees normal time passing and a velocity less than the speed of light, but is <em>also</em> sees less distance that it has to cover!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are kind of two questions here, so let me break them down:</p>
<p>1) Why does our universe have a speed limit?</p>
<p>2) Why does light travel at that speed limit?</p>
<p>The answer to Question 1 is: we don't know why our universe has a speed limit. It just does.</p>
<p>The answer to Question 2 is: light is massless. Anything with mass travels slower than the universal speed limit, and anything without mass can <em>only</em> travel at the universal speed limit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not strictly correct. In a vacuum, yes, but photons travel slower than c in other mediums.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if it's a silly question, but wouldn't a different medium affect the speed of light? In a vacuum, light travels at 3.0x10^8 m/s (I think) but it's slower in air, and even slower in water, which causes refraction. Or is it just that because light is travelling through a denser medium, time is slowed to accommodate for the perceived different speed? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed is not different. It is c. In non-vacuum environment, light may bounce off and not have a straight path, therefore it may seem as if it travels slower. But actually, it is travelling at c, with it's path being non-linear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a silly question - we use 'the speed of light' as shorthand for a concept that's not fundamentally about light at all.</p>
<p>Rather, 'c' is the maximum speed that information can propagate in the universe. It's true that, in a vacuum, photons travel at this speed (as do any other massless particles). But it's not that the universe is based on the properties of light itself. It's just that light gets to the speed limit.</p></div>		</li>
