			<div class="markdown"><p>If you do it your whole life you will have and easier time. They stretch and exercise those mussels daily. Additionally there is much more sitting on the floor in general. This leads towards older folk who are better at doing it. Also, there is almost always a western toilet somewhere nearby in Japan, especially in cities and towns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to live in Korea and I can tell you the biggest factor may be obesity rates.  If you're 90 years old and weigh 220 pounds squatting is going to be impossible.  If you only weigh 110 pounds it will be much easier.</p>
<p>In the US the obesity rate for adults is around 40&#37;.  In Korea it's like 4&#37; and Japan is 3.5&#37;.  This makes a huge difference.  Beyond that is just practice, plus a lot of squat toilets have grab bars you can use to steady yourself.  Also, there are a lot of western toilets in use now, but I'm sure that wasn't always the case.</p></div>		</li>
