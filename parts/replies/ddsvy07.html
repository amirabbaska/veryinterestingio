			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, what I am saying is why are we going back and saying these people were very smart? I just feel like we should be way more advanced and say yes they were smart but we know exactly how they did it and the materials they used, not like hey how did they do this.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you see a 2 year old doing calc-I work, you're impressed, even if you're far ahead. Because you're not a 2 year old. You're impressed that, given the conditions, they are able to complete such a task.</p>
<p>We stand on the shoulders of giants. What we can do is all based on the work of our predecessors. We are no smarter than the ancient peoplesâ€”biologically, it must be so. Remember, knowledge is not intelligence. There is no evidence that modern people are any smarter than ancient people, and there's no reason either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's more like seeing a high school student figure out a calculus problem without using calculus as we know it.  Sure we know how to do it pretty easily, but it's really impressive to see someone pull it off without using the tools we thought were necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that the methods they used to make these things were the culmination of generations of experimentation by entire cultures.  Sure it's simpler than what we use today, but its also completely different.  We'd basically be trying to reinvent the technology they used from scratch (albeit with the advantage of a far deeper understanding of physics) and honestly nobody is putting that much time and resources into figuring it out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't know exactly how they did it though, I'm pretty sure he know ways it could be done with the technology of the corresponding age for each wonder (no, Alien technology was not needed to build the pyramids!), but we can't tell for sure if they did it differently!</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I.e if we ask this, it's no longer to figure out a possible way, it's to prove that the possible theoretical method he have figured out was indeed used. For example by finding traces of the required tools or stones if they needed to be moved in a certain way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course everything is in theory of how they did it because a lot of time we don't have observable recorded facts. That's what it is, speculation but we are probably right. The only things we usually don't know is the built foundations for some of the European cathedrals and we don't know (not because we are naive) but because we can't go ripping into the ground and destroying what's below. They have guessed that the cathedrals have foundations of large pylons going hundreds of feet into the ground. Probably right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pretty sure our current buildings are way more advanced that the most basic stable geometrical shape. Our goal also isn't to make our buildings last 1000 years as we plan to be able to destroy them and rebuild when the technology makes the old building obsolete.</p></div>		</li>
