			<div class="markdown"><p>I was surprised that the heads can be positioned so accurately on a track without position feedback. I think it's a little more complicated than that. Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feedback of the drive electronics is accomplished by means of special segments of the disk dedicated to servo feedback. These are either complete concentric circles (in the case of dedicated servo technology), or segments interspersed with real data (in the case of embedded servo technology). The servo feedback optimizes the signal to noise ratio of the GMR sensors by adjusting the voice-coil of the actuated arm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess that the received signal strength can indicate how good the tracking of the heads is, and if needed, the disk can go read so dedicated calibration patterns to zero out any error it has. It still seems pretty amazing that they can whip the heads around so fast and have them stop on the right track.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the older way of doing it. Go far back enough and they used optical tracking.</p>
<p>Our 10 MB drives in the mid-80s had a circular metal disk with black and white stripes paired with an optical sensor. It wasn't sealed and could get dirty. Sadly, we cleaned them out with cheap Halon fire extinguishers. Between things like that and the amount of hairspray we used, we did a number on the Ozone layer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember 120Mbyte 3.5&quot; &quot;floppy&quot; discs in the early 90s that had optical tracks for the alignment. You could see the optical markings on the disk by sliding open the little door. They were sooooo slooooow, but a technical marvel. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It simply needs to know what voltage is being applied to know where the head will be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not how they work. They read codes off the tracks to determine what track they are on and to remain centered. It is a closed-loop servo. </p></div>		</li>
