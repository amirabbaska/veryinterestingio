			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation.  Just wanted to add 2 things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>that this phenomenon also concerns the material on which you're sitting.  A chair is almost always much softer than a toilet seat.  In a chair, you sort of sink in and distribute your weight even more.  Plus the material is compliant to your body.   On the other hand, a toilet seat is rigid and doesn't comply, thus sitting on one can cause a temporary decrease in nerve conduction to the legs.</p>
</li>
<li>The <em>location</em> of the majority of your weight has an effect.  If you sit on your tailbone on a hard floor for a long time, your legs won't go numb, but a toilet seat skips the sacrum &amp; coccyx and puts pressure onto the outer part of your buttocks.  The particular area where your bum rests on a toilet seat is the exact location that the sciatic nerve exits the pelvis and makes its way down the back of the leg.  You've probably noticed that the top of your thighs never gets numb on the toilet.  That's because the nerve supply that area doesn't come out the back of your pelvis.</li>
