			<div class="markdown"><p>Impurities do not &quot;cause&quot; a hangover. Ethanol is converted in the body to a toxic compound called acetaldehyde, then to acetic acid. When too much alcohol is consumed, the body experiences a buildup of acetaldehyde in the race to metabolize it despite more consumption of its metabolic precursor. </p>

<p>Had to be anal on the science of the matter; can't let misinformation spread unhindered. Although impurities may contribute to the effects (such as sugars and whatnot) in whiskey, it's surely not the main cause. The main cause is ethanol's inherent toxicity! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not sugars, it's congeners.  The few studies done suggest that &quot;less pure&quot; (alcoholic beverages which are not clear liquor) cause more severe hangovers.  Here's one that was easy to find on Google:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Science is great. I believe you. </p>
<p>But I also believe in experience, and trust me when I tell you, I've experienced the difference between a whiskey &amp; stout hangover, and a vodka &amp; gin hangover. </p>
<p>The difference is well known amongst regular drinkers, regardless of my lack of scientific citations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all really interesting. Personally, I get the absolute worst hangovers from beer (with the exception of a few fairly expensive beers). Wine gives me a (really bad) headache hangover. Gin and vodka make me feel sick to my stomach the next day. Whiskey makes me slightly light-headed the next day. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Impurities have an effect on hangovers, but not much of one. The alcohol itself is first converted into acetaldehyde, then into acetic acid. Hangovers occur when your body is not able able to process the acetaldehyde fast enough and it builds up causing damage as it is toxic. So volume of alcohol is the primary issue for a hangover, not impurities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've done the full Bourbon Trail twice and take occasional day trips to other bourbon distilleries. Distilling the whiskey twice is the minimum and 3 or more times is not uncommon. Brown liquors gain their color from the barrels they are aged in. Bourbon's &quot;impurities&quot; are the sugars it absorbs from the charred oak it is aged in and has nothing to do with the hangover. The hangover is caused by toxic metabolites alcohol is broken down into by the body.</p></div>		</li>
