			<div class="markdown"><p>These counters are left out for days on end. Sometimes a whole week. I've never known a traffic jam to last more than a couple hours.</p>
<p>So all the cars will still drive over it and be counted. Even if it's slower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they’re wondering how it’ll know if the traffic all happens in a short time frame or is spread out. While it wouldn’t matter for repairs, if a road is crazy during rush hour, they might need to add another lane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all you would notice low speeds. Second, no engineer should trust the data blindly. You need to know something about traffic in the area. City traffic engineers spend their careers dealing with traffic in their jurisdiction, so they are usually crazy knowledgeable about how the road functions</p></div>		</li>
