			<div class="markdown"><p>No, these are not embryonic stem cells in that they are not totipotent and cannot differentiate into any cell type of the body. But they are very useful when needing to do research on blood or specific genetic disorders. </p>
<p>EDIT: I'm just going to type this out here for help:</p>
<p>Totipotent: Embryonic stem cells. They can turn into any cell type of the body AND the placental/trophoblast cells. </p>
<p>Pluripotent: They can turn into any cell from the 3 germ layers, but not placental cells: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ectoderm: examples neural/brain and skin. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>endoderm: examples include your digestive tract and lungs. </p>
</li>
<li>mesoderm: examples include the heart, blood, bone, muscle and <em>almost</em> everything else I haven't mentioned with the other two germ layers. 5-6 days after fertilization, you are this little ball of cells called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastocyst" target="_blank">blastocyst</a> and the 3 germ layers begin to arise from this point with the mesodermal layer forming last.</li>
</ul>
<p>Multipotent: These cells can differentiate into multiple cell types WITHIN its own germ layer. A blood cell cannot be turned into a skin cell, for example. This does not mean it can do ANY cell within the germ layer, but it's a good starting point. Blood cells are a great example of being multipotent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As other answers have said, these aren't pluripotent, but rather multipotent. However, if you're looking for alternatives to embryonic stem cells, you should look at <a href="http://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/pages/basics10.aspx" target="_blank">induced pluripotent stem cells</a>. More research is needed, but they're already doing some cool things <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/japanese-woman-is-first-recipient-of-next-generation-stem-cells-1.15915" target="_blank">like implanting redifferentiated iPS cells into a retina to hopefully restore sight</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is because of the small amount of volume it has. The number of stem cells in cord blood, I believe, is less than what would be needed for a successful adult stem cell transplant. If the child had cancer and needed a stem cell transplant -- awesome. If a sibling did -- awesome. If you wanted to donate the cells, a child would probably get it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: The placenta is part mom, part cells that aren't -quite- from the embryo.</p>
<p>The placenta also contains cells that are genetically the mother's.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=53497" target="_blank">http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=53497</a></p>
<p>Also, the extra-embryonic tissues are from cells set aside very early on in development.  They have the same DNA as the embryo but will have never been a part of anything that looks like a baby.  Put another way, the cells that go to make the placenta and cord didn't come from your abdomen or legs or any recognizable part of you that you could point to.  They split when you were in the ball of cells phase.  The cells that go on to form the embryo proper are pluripotent (the embryonic stem cells in orange) and the extraembryonic portion is I think not pluripotent.</p>

<p>Theres some experiments you can do with tetraploid cells, that is, cells which have four sets of each chromosome instead of two like normal.  Those tetraploid cells can make the placenta, but can't make an embryo.  If you mix tetraploid and normal diploid cells, the diploid cells make a healthy embryo while the tetrqploid cells make the placenta (and umbillical cord I think), and that all works.  So the placenta CAN be genetically distinct from the embryo no troubles.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraploid_complementation_assay" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraploid_complementation_assay</a></p>
<p>The point here is that calling the placenta &quot;the embryo's cells&quot; is hiding some interesting complexity.  They don't come from cells that are truly the embryo.</p></div>		</li>
