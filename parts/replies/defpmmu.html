			<div class="markdown"><p>You touched on this, but just to clarify - it's not just the flat steppe, it's the collision of the winds coming across that steppe with the warm and humid air currents coming up from the Gulf of Mexico. That's why Russia, which also has an enormous flat steppe, doesn't have a lot of tornadoes - it doesn't have those humid currents from the south.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great Lakes here, we get tornadoes because we have very warm and humid summers, and being so close to Canada we have the Arctic air coming from the north. The flatlands really allow tornadoes to track for a long period of time without resistance. It does allow the two air masses to collide, but it's not as beneficial to the formation of tornadoes as the longevity of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm from OH, I know there are occasional tornadoes there and even more the further west you go, but nothing like tornado alley.</p>
<p>Edit: plus I was only correcting the &quot;steppe&quot; part. I feel like in other parts of the country people tend to think of the Midwest as a giant Nebraska.</p></div>		</li>
