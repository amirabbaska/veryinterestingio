			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the UK, Spain is made up of several countries. If you follow football, you'll probably be vaguely familiar with them. The biggest ones (aside from the dominant one, centred on Madrid) are Catalonia, centred on Barcelona, and the Basque country, centred on Bilbao. </p>
<p>Like Scotland, there is considerable appetite in Catalonia for independence. Spain does not want that. One of the things holding Catalonia back is that if it became independent, it might not be part of the EU, which offers huge benefits to deprived areas.</p>
<p>If a precedent is set which says that newly-formed countries within EU members retain EU status, then Catalonia will have less to fear in independence. Consequently, Spain will probably veto Scotland as an EU member to stop Catalonia getting ideas. Any new member has to be agreed upon by every country, so that would be that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, Spain's constitution does not allow parts of the country to secede - that's why the Catalonia referendum result was meaningless - but they've said that as long as Scotland was to secede democratically and with the cooperation of the UK, then they wouldn't veto Scotland's EU membership.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer.</p>
<p>One point that one might add is that the UK leaving the EU might be at least a small gamechanger since it would not make Scotland rejoining the EU a precedent of a part country leaving an EU country and being allowed to rejoin.<br />
I mean I guess Spain would still be against it, but who knows in this strange time. Maybe there is peer pressure to punish the UK by helping an independent Scotland.  </p>
<p>Even while it is a sad day to me it surely is an interesting time right now.</p></div>		</li>
