<p>Had an article about continental drift.  I remember looking the pictures and a globe and thinking that was very interesting and that it appeared obvious.</p>
<p>Or the 1st grade equivalent of those thoughts.</p>
<p>Basically, I accepted it as known fact.</p>
<p>It was many, many years before I realized that Weekly Reader was reporting cutting edge science to first graders.</p>
<p>Also,
Dear Weekly Reader,</p>
<p>I love you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL - I had never heard of the Weekly Reader! Sounds like a great read; I certainly would have picked it up if we had had it in my parts in those years!</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing it to my attention!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, within bounds of available data and age constraints. The main quibble there is with the age of ocean floor - these are young rocks, the oldest remaining ocean floor we've currently got is a mere 225 million years old, which is a side effect of Plate tectonics in that oceanic plates are preferentially destroyed. Pangea broke up 65 million years ago, but the previous supercontinent is Rodinia, which assembled a billion years ago, and broke up in earnest around 600 million years ago. So we've got no ocean floor from that period on which we could use the matching coastlines / symmetrical magnetic polarity bands and age of ocean floor methods. So it still works and it's the same rationale, but the basic data is pretty all paleopoles and paleo-wander paths.</p>
