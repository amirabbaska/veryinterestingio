			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it has nothing to do with blood supply. The sciatic nerve, which runs through your buttocks gets compressed leading to the tingling sensation. It just so happens that where we sit on the toilet seat is an area where the sciatic nerve isn't covered by muscle, making it susceptible to compression. And as you said, the smaller surface area makes the pressure on the nerve much greater leading to a higher probability of tingling on the toilet seat compared to regular chairs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it's not just a tingling, but your entire foot goes completely numb and you can't even move it, is that also the nerve? Or is that lack of bloodflow?</p>
<p>(yea, I take really long shits. Also, I tend to lean on my thighs so reduced bloodflow is possible in my case) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.... Its funny when I see massively incorrect explanations getting the most upvotes.</p>
<p>To add to isanyoneunique's on-point explanation, the reason it has nothing to do with blood supply is that the main blood vessels supplying your legs, the femoral arteries, are on the anterior (front) side of the thigh - and then later curve around the posterior (back) side of the legs as they approach the knees.</p>
<p>Also, when you sit down on a flat surface, the ischial tuberosities of your os coxa (part of your pelvis) comes in contact with that surface and props you up.  Because these ischial tuberosities are centrally located, when you sit on a toilet seat they don't come in contact with anything - and as a result you end up compressing the sciatic nerve.</p></div>		</li>
