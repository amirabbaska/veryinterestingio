			<div class="markdown"><p>I too moved from the south, to the north and intentionally changed my accent. I did it because the people I worked with had a difficult time understanding me. Thing is I only changed it enough to make myself easier to understand. But like OP stated, when I get a few drinks in me, my accent automatically comes back. When I talk to friends and family from home, I speak normally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this and had only moved from the country to a small town. The stereotype still existed. I live in Appalachia.</p></div>		</li>
