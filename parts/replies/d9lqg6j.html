			<div class="markdown"><p>This. This is the correct answer. </p>
<p>Noting that (outside the US) a dis-order typically does not require treatment unless it also causes dis-ease. That is, you might be in the 95th percentile for being &quot;quite thirsty, a lot of the time. Which might be &quot;not normal or the usual majority level of thirst&quot;. But if there's no underlying condition and quenching your thirst does not impede your life that much, there is -- by very definition -- no disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The only reason it's not generally thought of this way is because of politics. It's the same reason they're not &quot;retarded&quot;, they're &quot;special&quot;. I don't have any problem with making exceptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's all about the negative connotations of &quot;disorder&quot;. Yes, gay people do have a mental disorder, but this shouldn't be a bad thing because mental disorders aren't always bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't it have to be disruptive in order to be a disorder, though? I mean, <em>red hair</em> is also caused by an abnormal mutation, but it's not commonly referred to as a disorder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you're calling it a <em>mental</em> disorder than you can argue it's an abnormal effect of the mind. As for red hair, well, that's just an physical mutation as you said.</p></div>		</li>
