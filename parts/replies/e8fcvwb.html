			<div class="markdown"><p>The most wide spread resource considered for propellent is water. If you can break down H2O you have hydrogen (very flammable) and oxygen (needed to burn). Luckily Mars has a lot of water! Mostly as ice. The challenge is to mine and process it efficiently. Depending where you are on Mars, solar and nuclear are usually the most common options, but maybe future development of hydrogen cells and other innovations may help with the power problem. </p>

<p>Mining Uranium locally might be a challenge, since the best deposits on Earth happen on the continents and Mars doesn't seem to have that level of crustal processing to concentrate the Uranium into high grade ores. Solar also has the issue of being about have the density per square meter as Earth. So many options, with challenges for each that will take some work to solve. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the human cycle, we go someplace new with so much resources that they seem endless, we develop the industrial scale use of them, then they are gone... </p>
<p>Hopefully we are getting smart enough to break that. Some resources on Mars are recyclable. We can build from regolith and basalt and then reuse them over and over. </p>
<p>On Mars, my biggest concern is ice. Mars has a lot, but it is still finite. If we start industrial scale mining to turn it into rocket fuel it might not last nearly as long as we want. </p>
<p>I can only see two solutions, the first is to stop growing, which is not satisfying to my sense of exploration, the second is to use the resources we have to go find more. That is not the most eco-friendly mindset, but it does support avoiding waste and the only route I can see toward sustained growth. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not particularly. The colonization being talked about seriously is something along the lines of the permanent Antarctic research stations. Population in the hundreds, maybe the thousands. That just isn't enough people to be a problem. In a theoretical future of large-scale human habitation of Mars, the technology required to do that would also make mining resources from asteroids quite doable. The resources available from asteroids are effectively unlimited--by the time we'd have to think about depleting those, human civilization would be unrecognizably advanced so we have no real idea what issues would exist.</p></div>		</li>
