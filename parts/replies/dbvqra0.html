			<div class="markdown"><p>You can calculate this easily. c = (k*p/rho)^1/2</p>
<p>Where c is speed of sound(you wanted 100mph which is about 44m/s), k is a constant (for air and ideal gases is 1.4) p is pressure (101kPa, atmospheric pressure) and rho is density. Turns out you need a densisty of about 70kg/m^3 which is about 70x times heavier than usual.</p></div>		</li>
