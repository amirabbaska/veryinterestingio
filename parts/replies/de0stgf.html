			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand upon this, I clean up people's computers for my university and the quickest things you can do to speed up your computer is to disable all of your start up programs, disable your non-Microsoft services, uninstall all unnecessary programs, and run CCleaner to clean up junk you didn't realize you have. I get paid to do this when literally anyone could do it in a few minutes, it's silly. :P This is if you don't feel confident fully formatting your computer (as many non-tech people aren't).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^ Yeah except they moved startup programs to Task Manager now REEEEEEEE. I think you can disable them with CCleaner though, I just don't do it that way because I like to disable them, restart, then run CCleaner.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Most people don't know/care about what is installed on their computer.</p>
<p>Do a brand new install of the operating system. Should run pretty close to new again.</p></div>		</li>
