			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking a &quot;picture&quot; involves bouncing a photon (or any other particle) off of the electron in question. The direction and energy with which the photon for bounced off (as detected) tells you where and how fast the electron (inside the atom) was going.</p>
<p>Unfortunately if you want any precision with position, you need to use a photon with a high energy (therefore small wavelength that isn't spread out over a uselessly large space) which, on interaction, will give the electron enough energy that it will leave the atom.</p>
<p>You can't have an Atom with an electron missing.... That's called an ion. Therefore you've &quot;destroyed&quot; the Atom.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An ion is still an atom. The atom has not been &quot;destroyed&quot; in any meaningful sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking a picture means measuring its position in any way and then visualizing that position on a two-dimensional graph. This is a thought experiment, I think it confuses the issue to presume physical effects of a particular supposed physical means of taking the picture rather than simply considering inevitable quantum-mechnical effects of the fact that it's been observed at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a fundamental property of quantum mechanics. You can't know the position and momentum of the electron at the same time. Measuring the position (which is what it means to take a picture in this case) means that you will have to destroy any information that might exist concerning the electron's momentum. That means, among other things, that it can't remain in the same orbital, because if it did, you would know its momentum to a quite narrow range.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>If it moved to another orbital and you knew which one, it would present the same problem, though. The electron could in principle remain in its original orbital, but you have no way of knowing whether or not it did, hence the &quot;uncertainty.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It seems that you're linking the uncertainty between position and momentum (Heisenburg uncertainty) with measurement (observer principle), but AFAIK the two have nothing to with each other.</p>
<p>Uncertainty is because of something much more intrinsic of waves, that position and momentum are fourier transformations of each other.</p>
<p>Could be wrong.</p></div>		</li>
