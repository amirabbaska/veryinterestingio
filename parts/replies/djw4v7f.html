			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally use an Solid State Drive (SSD) in my gaming rig and I have quite fast load times, generally only a few seconds at most. I recently started playing Playerunknown's Battlegrounds, originally installing it on my hard drive, where it took up to a about 40 or 50 seconds to load me into a game. I copied it over to my SSD and now it takes me about 5 seconds. At this point, it isn't enough of a bother to go faster, that being said, you can go faster.</p>
<p>Not all SSDs are created equal. Some are faster than others, the fastest currently being the Samsung 950 Pro. So SSD choice does matter for example. </p>
<p>There is also a system known as RAID, which allows you to use multiple of the same storage devices to speed up load times, this involves splitting the data across both of these storage devices and having one fetch one half of the data needed and the other fetch the other half, meaning both drives work together for faster access.</p>
<p>But honestly, there are diminishing returns after just getting a mid range SSD. I don't mind waiting one or two more seconds. </p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the word loading comes from the fact that data is loaded from the hard drive into RAM, similarly how you would load boxes from your house to your car.</p>
<p>If you think this is complicated, this is the simple stuff in computing. Computers are so complex that I consider it magic that it actually works. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, what’s the big difference between a sata ssd vs a pcie one? Something I don’t quite understand is that a Samsung 960 evo m.2 is $610 for a 1TB model (which has read/write of 3.2 Gbps and 1.4Gbps respectively) whereas an intel 750 series 800gb is $800 from the same place only offering a read/ write of 2.1Gbps and 800Mbps respectively. What does the intel one offer that the Samsung one doesn’t? Is that Samsung ssd literally just plug and play? Like can I just put it into a pcie slot under the gpu and start using it? I’m looking to buy the 512gb 960, so what’s the process of installing one? Sorry if this is a lot, thanks :).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Loved this phrase! hahahaha</p>
<p>I'm a computer engineering student, so I'm slowly growing a better understanding of how computers work. And it's basically layer upon layer of the most convoluted logic the mankind can understand. It's very, very scary, but it also amazes me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll also add that anyone who plays pre-release games (especially the ones that are in alpha stage of development) will likely see a huge boost from putting said game on an SSD. The reason is that in Alpha stage, developers are adding features and knocking down major bugs, and haven't even begun to focus on speed optimization.</p>
<p>There was an alpha game I was really into that would always take 5-10 minutes to load off of my hard drive. I installed my first SSD and moved the game over to that drive, and load time was chopped down to 30 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SSDs are about as fast as you can get without doing something semi insane.<br />
The following are some semi-insane ways to speed up load time that are used for commercial/industrial purposes. All of them a pricey, potentially risky and you probably won't need the speed.   </p>
<h1>RAID</h1>
<p>What's faster than 1 SSD?<br />
Two SSDs!<br />
RAID 0 splits up your data onto two disk, meaning your computer can read both disk at the same time.<br />
It's crazy because if one of those disks breaks the data on the other disk is essentially worthless.<br />
Alternatively RAID 1 (mirroring), you put the same thing on both drives, thus halving the storage space.<br />
<a href="http://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-combine-multiple-hard-drives-in-raid-0-using-windows-10s-storage-spaces-feature" target="_blank">You can do that with two SSD of the same type and windows10</a><br />
Don't</p>
<h1>PCIe SSD.</h1>
<p>Your hard disk is connected to your computer by a cable, usually a SATA cable.<br />
If your SSD is fast enough, the cable becomes the limiting factor. Fortunately your computer might have a spare PCIe slot, you usually plug stuff like graphics cards in there. They are designed to transfer huge amounts of data.<br />
You will not need that speed  </p>
<h1>RAM Disk</h1>
<p>You're transferring stuff from your SSD to RAM because RAM is faster.<br />
So why not just store the whole thing in RAM?<br />
Buy a few extra RAM sticks together and store stuff on it.<br />
Thing is if it ever loses power the data on it is irrevocably lost, this is good if Federal agents are breaching your front door and you need for your computer to be a blank slate, not so good if you want to store information and not have to worry about a 4 day long black out wiping your PC.<br />
Still blindingly fast if risky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;[...] federal agents are breaching your front door and you need for your computer to be a blank slate [...]&quot;</p>
<p>Actually, i wouldnt rely on a ram disk if i was hunted by federal agents. the problem with ram here is that data still persists for a few seconds, even after you cut power, and as recent cases show (dont have a link, sorry) those few seconds are enough time to freeze the ram with liquid nitrogen thus preserving the state for much longer.</p>
<p>but thats not really usable for persistent storage.</p>
<hr />
<p>the biggest drawback you mentioned is for a ram disk you dedicate some gigabytes of your ram to make up some file structure, but the program still needs to load the stuff, so it takes up twice as much storage in ram. a way better option than yours is to actually just buy the ram and maybe adjust system settings, because the system actually doesnt remove stuff from the ram unless the space is needed for different things. chances are high the stuff is still in ram when you need to load it again, and then you dont have to copy it from ram to ram, but can just access it. operating system magic.</p>
<p>aside from all that, there is another flaw with all the answers here. see my own comment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Storage ELI5:</p>
<p>There are generally 3 main types of data storage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent storage (Hard drives, SSDs)</li>
<li>Volatile storage (RAM)</li>
<li>On-chip Cache</li>
</ul>
<p>Each is faster than the previous.  Permanent storage is large and cheap, but relatively slow.  It's used for storing the OS, all the programs you use and your data.</p>
<p>RAM is much faster and is used to hold the bulk of the programs and data that are currently in use.  This may sometimes be read in/out from permanent storage using a process called swapping as the memory fills up - this means if a program hasn't been used for a while, but is still in RAM, some of its memory can be freed up to an extent to give priority to other programs.</p>
<p>Cache is ultra fast memory and is integrated into the CPU itself.  It is expensive and much much smaller in capacity than the other two types of storage.  As the name suggests it caches the most recently used memory content so that the processor can access it very quickly (programs and data have a habit of repeating the same things over and over, so this can help increase speed a lot).</p>
<p><em>It could be argued that we're now seeing a 4th category, cloud storage with virtually limitless capacity, but very slow access at the speed of an internet connection.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for mentioning cache, but I would really avoid classifying cloud storage on its own. This may make people forget that cloud storage is just you storing your information someone's server somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Computers had main memory (RAM) before they had disk drives. RAM was not invented to address shortcomings of disk drives, as seems to be implied here. However, many early computers had non-volatile memory which didn't reset when powered off like modern DRAM does.</p>
<p>I will also add that the main activity during &quot;loading&quot; is more likely to load textures and meshes into video memory (VRAM) and not main memory. The video processor (GPU) absolutely needs everything to be loaded in (video) memory because it doesn't even have direct access to the disk like the main processor (CPU) has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer. Loading everything needed into RAM takes virtually no time compared to loading vertex buffers and especially textures into VRAM. A single 1024x1024 texture is roughly 1 million pixels, each of which consists of anywhere between 1 and 4 bytes (usually). A million bytes is called 1MB, so a 1024x1024 texture is already 1MB at least, likely closer to 3-4 MB. A character mesh nowadays has multiple textures for various coloring and lighting purposes, so your main character can easily be 10MB to load into VRAM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, computers have a hierarchy of memory. </p>
<p>Non-volatile memory can stores data for long periods of time without needing electricity. This type of storage is cheap and robust, but slow.  NVM includes hard disk drives, solid state drives (SSDs, memory cards, USB sticks), optical media (CD/DVD/BD), tape drives, and floppy disks.</p>
<p>Random Access Memory is a type of volatile memory. It stores the files and programs the computer is currently using. RAM is fast, allowing the processor to quickly grab what it needs. It's disadvantages are cost and volatility. It costs substantially more than NVM plus it looses all its stored data as soon as the system is turned off. </p>
<p>Processor cache is faster still memory stored directly on the CPU or GPU die. When you're processor is working on a series of code, it transfers it from the RAM to the cache so it's right there when it needs it. Cache is very fast but very expensive, so processors typically only have a small amount. Think of it as like memorizing a phone number, versus putting it in your phone's contacts (RAM), versus writing it in some book (HDD). If you memorize small amounts of information, you can recall it quicker than having to look it up. That's how cache kinda works.</p>
<p>Lastly we have processor registers. These are very small amounts of ultra fast memory that reside directly inside the processor itself. This is where the CPU/GPU holds the raw code its currently working on. </p>
<p>So when you load a game, the CPU asks the hard drive to load the program into RAM. When the CPU starts running the code, it asks the RAM to transfer the block of data it needs to work on into cache. From the cache, the CPU takes the line of code it currently needs, transfers it to the registers, and executes it.</p>
