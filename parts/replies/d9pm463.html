			<p>Oh man when I was 17 I was addicted to Tylenol 4s, like bad. I was so constipated that I had developed some form of toxic shock, Toxicity? Anyway last ditch effort before surgery was an enema that felt like motor oil and these laxatives that looked like tic tacs, I was thinking what the fuck are these gonna do? The nurse brought the portable bed pan with <em>handles</em> on it. I was already embarrassed, but this was awful... my guts started to make noises that would scare puppies and small children. Then it came, of course the sound was incredibly bad, about a minute long shart of death, <em>several</em> times. The worst part was the smell, I guess the back up started to turn septic in me, people in other rooms thought the sewer backed up. I've never experienced such relief, it was incredibly painful, like a 7lbs piece of granite stuck in your guts.</p>		</li>

			<p>Oxy shits are evil, when they actually decide to allow themselves to happen... I too am prescribed, and take them daily.  Every once in a great while, if I haven't gone in like a week, I down a bottle of Magnesium Citrate.  It works wonders, and while it will for sure clean out Ye Olde Pipes, it isn't exactly a violent situation, just ummm urgent. </p>		</li>

			<p>I should add that stimulant laxative aren't recommended for a long term remedy. They should only be used in case of a momentary bouts of constipation. The intestine quickly get used to these irritating agents if you use them regularly. It can get to a point where the intestinal muscles won't work without them. Dietary fiber is a much safer alternative. You can use them for years and it can also lower your cholesterol level (which is a good thing).</p>		</li>

			<p>Then there are fleet enemas, known in many circles as &quot;the excorcist&quot; they draw fluid into your bowels and trigger the same mechanism as above, except they draw in water not just from surrounding tissues but from everything within a two kilometre circle. The result is like a hydrogen bomb hitting a Florida swamp.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Magnesium citrate liquid laxative causes a freaking bomb. I was given it after my liver transplant and had ileus for 9 days. That means I didn't pass any stool or gas that whole time. I was in agony. 45 minutes after being given the mag citrate, I felt the need to go and I hobbled (can only move so quick when you're bloated to the size of a heavily pregnant woman and full of 47 staples) to the bathroom and basically destroyed it. Left my undies in the trash and pulled the nurse cord and asked her to call housekeeping. She was very understanding and helped me get back to the waiting room for my CT, where I learned of my newly acquired allergy when I was injected with omnipaq CT dye and if iodine. Went into anaphylactic shock. That was a fun evening. <br><br>Luckily I'm 7 years post now and doing well. Just got married actually 2 weeks ago. Yay! </p>		</li>

			<p>There are stool softeners as well. (sodium ducosate) source: only type that helped me with chronic constipation </p>		</li>

			<p>The key component being sodium. Softeners are just a smaller dose of an osmotic laxative. They soften stool by drawing water into the colon.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why wouldn't the salt just go into your body as opposed to pulling water out of it?</p>		</li>

			<p>Docusate sodium is an inactive ingredient (here in the US, anyway) in Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold Medicine.  I learned this the hard way when I coughed so hard I sharted my pants.</p>		</li>
