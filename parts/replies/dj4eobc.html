			<div class="markdown"><p>Or 858. Also, if you have an 858 phone number, quit posting your goddamned business line on billboards in the 619 without your fucking area code. I'm tired of saying &quot;No, Sue isn't here. You meant to dial 858, and also tell her to go fuck right off the Coronado bridge.&quot;</p>

<p>Only once those numbers started to run out in the 1990s the new all digital system was put into place and we could have area codes like 757 242 434 540 etc.</p>

<p>Interesting, totally not true but interesting.  Source: I had a 540 area code as a child in the early 80s.  Everyone that lives in the neighborhood I grew up in had a 540 area code, and many of them bought their houses in the 60s and have never had their phone number changed.</p>
<p>I don't know if much of the rest of your post is accurate or not, but your timeline is definitely way off for area codes with a second digit other than 1 or 0.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_540" target="_blank">It was established July 15, 1995 as a split from area code 703. It was then itself split on September 1, 2001 to create area code 276.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, San Diego was 714 (as was most of SoCal south of LA), but much earlier (1947), all of SoCal was 213 (now LA's area code). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_619" target="_blank">619 wasn't created until 1982.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_codes_657_and_714" target="_blank">714 was created in 1951.</a></p></div>		</li>
