			<div class="markdown"><p>When NC-17 became a thing I, as a horror movie fan who was sick of seeing movies with extreme graphic violence get an X rating, got excited thinking that we'd finally get some good graphic NC-17 horror films, except that the same thing happened.  Most theaters won't show NC-17 these days which is why the more extreme movies are released &quot;unrated.&quot;   </p>
<p>It's worth noting that more extreme violence has gotten more acceptable, so it's not really an issue anymore.  The stuff they showed on AMC's &quot;Ash vs. Evil Dead&quot; would have easily gotten an X rating in the late 80s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true except there was no XX period.  Some jerk wad went straight to XXX so no one could claim their porno was less that the XXX pornos.  Youâ€™d look like a schmuck with that weak shit.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were definitely XX movies and they even tried XXXX movies but I think the zeitgeist landed on XXX being the proper amount of X.</p>
