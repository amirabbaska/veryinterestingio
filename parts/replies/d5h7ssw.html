			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to butt in here but I'm reading a book about this now! They once sent a probe into the atmosphere to see what happens and here's what was found. First of all the probe was crushed and destroyed before reaching anything tangible. And that's because it never could. On Jupiter there is a phenomenon not found anywhere on earth. Here in earth all of our states of matter are separate but with clearly defined borders. You can see where the ocean ends and the atmosphere starts much like how you can see the edges of ice cubes floating in a glass of water. On Jupiter's though there is no border. Everything blends. The further you travel the thicker the density gets and the pressure until eventually the gas just sort of phases into liquid steadily with depth. And keep traveling in that liquid and it becomes solid at a pace rather than all at once. Instead of bumping into a wall you'll find yourself in the wall! It's very hard to imagine because you've never seen anything like this before. There is no definitive borders between states of matter on the planet. Everything is just blurred together sort of.</p>
<p>edit: I pulled up the section from the textbook I was reading. I may have understood it wrong but here it is verbatim.</p>
<p>Just as astronomers can build mathematical models of the interiors of stars, they can use the equations that describe gravity, energy, and the compressibility of matter to build mathematical models of the interior of Jupiter. These models reveal that the interior of the planet is mostly liquid hydrogen containing small amounts of heavier elements. The pressure and temperature are higher than the critical point for hydrogen, and that means there is no difference between gaseous hydrogen and liquid hydrogen. If you parachuted into Jupiter, you would fall through the gaseous atmosphere and notice the density of the surrounding fluid gradually increasing until you were in a liquid, but you would never splash into a liquid surface. Roughly a quarter of the way to the center, the pressure is high enough to force the hydrogen to change into liquid metallic hydrogen, which is a very good electrical conductor. Because liquid metallic hydrogen has been very diffi cult to create and study in the laboratory so far, its properties are poorly understood. That is the reason why the models are uncertain about the depth
of the transition from normal to metallic liquid hydrogen. The models are also uncertain about the presence of a heavy element core in Jupiter. Th e planet contains about 30 Earth masses of elements heavier than helium, but much of that may be suspended in the convectively stirred liquid hydrogen. Measurements by orbiting spacecraft indicate that no more than 10 Earth masses are included in a heavy element core. Some astronomy books refer to this as a rocky core, but, if it exists, it cannot be anything like the rock you know on Earth. The center of Jupiter is five or six times hotter than the surface of the sun and is prevented from exploding into vapor only by the  tremendous pressure. If there is a core, it is “rocky” only in the sense that it contains heavy elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a great comment I once read by /u/wazoheat in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/12eggw/seeing_as_how_jupiter_is_a_gas_giant_what_would/c6ulszb" target="_blank">this</a> thread: which discussed what would happen, if you had an indestructable space suit and just started descending onto/into Jupiter:</p>
<hr />
<p>Well, if you weren't wearing a space suit, no matter where you started you would die almost instantly because there is essentially no oxygen at any level of Jupiter's atmosphere.</p>
<p>But let's say you do have a space suit. What do you mean by &quot;step foot on it&quot;? Jupiter is, as you noted in your question, a gas giant, meaning it's made of gas. There is no solid surface. And just like Earth's atmosphere, the gas doesn't really have a &quot;top&quot;, it just gets thinner and thinner as you get further and further from the planet, until at some point it is indistinguishable from interplanetary space (which, you may be interested to know, is not a true vacuum.</p>
<p>But let's say you just get dropped from some height way outside of Jupiter's visible atmosphere. Once you got within about 200,000 miles (about 300,000 km) of the planet's surface, you'd die fairly quickly from radiation poisoning.</p>
<p>But let's say your space suit has radiation-resisting superpowers. Well due to Jupiter's extreme mass, you'd quickly accelerate through the tenuous upper atmosphere at about 2.6 g, and burn up just like a meteor flying through Earth's upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>But let's say we dropped you in the middle of Jupiter's upper atmosphere, where the pressure were just about the same as Earth's surface pressure (1 bar). Now we're getting somewhere. You'd be falling, but since you're already in the thicker part of the atmosphere, your terminal velocity will be fairly low (taking Jupiter's higher gravity and the atmosphere's lower density into account (it is mostly hydrogen, so its density is about 10 times less than Earth's even though the pressure is similar), your terminal velocity would be about 3200 km/h (2000 mph)). This is probably slow enough that frictional heating and heating from supersonic compression would not burn you up.</p>
<p>But hell, for shits and giggles, and in the name of keeping you alive as long as possible, let's give you a parachute, a little smaller than the one given to the Galileo probe, so that you fall at about the same velocity initially (~100 m/s, or about 360 km/h, 220 mph). Now we're cooking. Not literally though, because the temperature at this level is fairly comfortable: The temperature is just about 0 C (32 F), so you'd actually be pretty comfy.</p>
<p>So okay, now you're in your radiation-proof spacesuit, with your handy parachute, falling through the atmosphere just at the top of the clouds. These clouds are made of ammonia, but let's just assume your spacesuit and parachute are okay with that. You'd actually be okay for quite a while; maybe a little bored, but hey, you're on motherfucking Jupiter.</p>
<p>After about 5 minutes, you've fallen to the 2-bar level (about twice the average surface pressure on Earth). You are now falling through different clouds, made of ammonium hydrosulfide and ammonium sulfide. They don't look much different than regular clouds, but they do have a brownish tint that gets browner the deeper you go. Some people may find this surprising, but you won't feel many ill effects, even as the pressure increases rapidly. The bends are only seen with rapid decompression; the only ill effects from rapid compression are if the compression is too rapid to allow your body cavities (such as inner ear, sinuses, etc) to equalize. So as long as your ears are clear of wax, you should be fine.</p>
<p>About 10 minutes later, you have reached the 4 bar pressure level, which is about 4 times the average atmospheric pressure at sea level, or about the pressure you'd experience under 30 meters (100 feet) of water. The temperature has actually gotten quite cold, and is now around -40 C (-40 F). But assuming all the capabilities your spacesuit already had, I'm sure it wouldn't be too much to ask for a small heater. You are now passing through clouds of water ice, just like you might see at high altitudes on Earth, but it is getting very dark. You are also being whisked along horizontally by winds reaching 200 m/s (450 mph, 720 km/h), but you barely notice as they are not very turbulent.</p>
<p>15 more minutes go by, and you are now at a pressure of 10 bar, or 10 times normal sea-level atmospheric pressure. At bit before this level you should have changed the mixture of air you are breathing; if you breathed normal air at a pressure of 10 bar or more, you would suffer from acute oxygen toxicity, which can be quickly fatal (oxygen is actually toxic at much lower pressures, but it would take much longer than our quick decent through jupiter). At the same time, you can suffer from nitrogen narcosis, which has similar symptoms to inhaling nitrous oxide initially, but can quickly progress to severe symptoms like coma or death. So as you dive deeper your magic space suit also changes the mixture of air you are breathing, so that the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen remain the same as you are used to breathing, with the rest filled with helium or neon, which are the only known gasses which don't exhibit a toxic effect at high pressures. But provided this is all taken care of, you are actually quite comfortable, as the temperature has risen back up to about 23 C (73 F).</p>
<p>Another 25 minutes pass, and you are starting to realize you're in trouble. You are in complete darkness now, and the temperature has been steadily increasing as you go further down: now over 100 C (212 F) and still rising fast. Your spacesuit's systems are starting to fail. Within a few minutes, the temperature is over 200 C (392 F), and you don't have much longer to survive. Not wanting to endure a miserable, burning death, you take your conveniently placed cyanide capsule and end your interplanetary adventure.</p>
<p>But your body keeps falling.</p>
<p>Down into interior regions where we have little ideas of the exact composition. Pressure and density are increasing drastically, slowing your descent to a crawl. The atmosphere of mostly hydrogen is actually a liquid now, and is now several thousand degrees, but with essentially no oxygen around your body turns into a charcoal-like substance. Your parachute cuts away, but your spacesuit remains intact because it is convenient to the story, and your compressed, dead chunk of bodily substance slowly sinks, beyond 1,000 bar, beyond 10,000 bar...</p>
<p>Until finally, at an insanely crushing pressure of 2,000,000 bar (and a temperature of 5,000 K, about the temperature of the surface of the sun!), you stop sinking. Because your super-spacesuit is conveniently still intact, your body is still mostly water, which is essentially incompressible, even at these incredible pressures. As such, at this level, where the density is about 1 g/cm3 or about 1000 kg/m3 (this is approximately the density of water) you and the surrounding atmosphere are the same density, so you will no longer sink! So there your carbonated corpse floats, for all eternity, until the heat death of the universe.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phenomenon you're referring to is called a supercritical fluid. It happens when you heat a fluid at a high pressure. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJjcTpRzXpM" target="_blank">Here's a video</a> showing it with carbon dioxide. Note how the liquid in the bottom doesn't boil as the temperature is raised - it sort of just blurs into the gas phase. Science is cool!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not knowledgeable on planets, but I'm learning materials science, so maybe some phase diagrams may be helpful.</p>
<p>Here's a typical <a href="http://imgur.com/NLr8fJw" target="_blank">textbook diagram for water</a>.   </p>
<p>If you follow the dotted line horizontally at 1 atm Pressure, you see the behavior we're used to for water.  You'll see a transition from ice to water to vapor with increasing temperature.   The dark lines on the diagram indicate clear transitions between different phases (melting, evaporation and sublimation).  You'll notice at high temperatures and high pressure beyond the &quot;critical point&quot; there is no longer a clear transition between the water and gas phases (imagine a really steamy sauna).   This <a href="http://imgur.com/7JAwFhl" target="_blank">similar diagram</a> indicates that region as a supercritical fluid.</p>
<p>There seem to be a lot of different phase diagrams out there for Helium, which can appear complex.  <a href="http://imgur.com/LpjfQaJ" target="_blank">This is one of the simplest diagrams</a> I could find attempting to explain what's going on with Jupiter (Note that the Temperature and Pressure axis are switched from the previous diagrams).   If you follow the red curve from the left to the right you go from the low pressure outer atmosphere towards the higher pressure and high temperature center of the planet.   You can see the curve for Jupiter passes above a critical point for H2 gas and H2 liquid, so there will be a smooth transition.  Eventually it crosses over a phase transition into the liquid metal H+ phase.   Due to the high temperature, we never cross into the solid region, but it does appear we eventually pass a critical point separating the liquid H+ and solid H+ regions.</p>
<p>It's kind of neat to compare to the lower temperature curves for Saturn, Neptune and Uranus, which cross over the H2 liquid and gas phase transition line.  Presumably these planets have an &quot;atmosphere&quot; of gaseous H2 and then a more well defined liquid core.   Of course no planet is made up purely of one element, so these models will only get us so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its like how we have layers of air --&gt; water --&gt; earth. Except on Jupiter they all blend into a continuous curve of increasing density. At some point the spacecraft would be equally dense as the gas outside of it and it would stop &quot;sinking&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
