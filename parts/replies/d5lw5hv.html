<p>Why not just cubes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem it is trying to solve is partitioning the space into compartments of a given volume with the lowest surface area between cells.</p>
<p>This has lower surface area between cells for the given volume than cubes does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same can be asked of 2D: why not just squares?  As others have pointed out, minimizing circumference (or surface area for 3D) is part of the packing efficiency.  The &quot;hexagonal&quot; answer for 2D doesn't necessarily refer to the shapes of the individual components; it refers to their arrangement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before answering this, we need to clear up the confusion created by OP's incomplete question.</p>
<p><em>&quot;The Most Efficient Way to Store Something in Two Dimensions&quot;</em>  doesn't mean anything on its own. If you had square shaped tiles, you would just stack them next to each others and call it a day. However, we're not simply trying to maximize the area used (or volume), we also want to minimize the energy of this particular arrangement.</p>
<p>The second thing you need to know is that most forces in physics (fundamental and mechanical force) are central in nature (spherical symmetry). Things will expand equally in every directions (or converge toward a center). For example, if you drop bee wax, it will spread around in a circle. It won't make an hexagonal alcove on its own. </p>
<p>Hexagon (or 3d equivalent) only appears when you have many expanding elements in a confined space. For example, a single balloon in a box would end up taking the shape of the box. Two balloons would share the whole space, but they will also compete against each other.  Three balloon...you get the point.</p>
<p>Essentially, each individual balloon will expand as a sphere until they have to compete for space. At that point, the arrangement and shape they will take is going to be the one that use the least energy. </p>
<p>I will spare you the mathematics, but if you 're struggling with the concept of &quot;least energy used&quot;, try to stretch a  balloon into a square, an hexagon, or a circle. The circle won't require any stretching (default shape), the hexagon a little more, and the square a lot more,  The further away you're from the circle (equilibrium) the more energy you will use to stretch it.   What is important to understand here is that every deformations (different shape and volume) will have have a different energy cost. </p>
<p>Now that the base are covered, the system can be simplified to two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Expanding to unused space lower the system energy (ie: higher volume per item means less internal pressure)</p>
</li>
<li>Deformation (by compression or expansion) that take you away from the point of equilibrium cost increasingly more energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mathematical solution to this problem are hexagons (or the shape OP was asking about in 3d). If everything remained in a circle/sphere, there would be wasted space in between objects that could be used to reduce the pressure. If everything  took the shape of a square/cube, it would take way more energy to deform each object individually.  Hexagon however stack pretty damn well, and require very little energy compared to a square. That's why the optimum is somewhere in between the square and the circle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the solution that minimizes surface area between cells.  It isn't perfectly clear that is what OP is asking for, though as he doesn't explain what he means by &quot;most efficient&quot;. He might be asking about packing density, in which case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-packing_of_equal_spheres#FCC_and_HCP_Lattices" target="_blank">this</a> might give a better answer. </p></div>		</li>
