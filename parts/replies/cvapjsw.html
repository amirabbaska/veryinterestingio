<p>When the large distribution companies tried to buy the generic drugs, the brand drug companies came back and said if you buy these two or three generic drugs, then we'll cancel our contracts with you for all the other drugs you sell from our brand.</p>

<p>Obviously this should be illegal.   Why the heck do we allow so many flaws in our economic system to go unfixed??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats because generic brand companies essentially buy in after all the money has been spent to develop and bring the drug to market. If I spent $600 million developing a drug and someone swooped in trying to steal my profit, I'd threaten the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't swoop in and steal your profit. The patent expires. The patent existed to give you exclusive rights and help ensure you broke even on your investment,as well as give you a head start on competition that you deserved by inventing the product. It's disappointing that someone would condone bully capitalism based on a patent system designed to fairly reward inventors and investors </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes roughly $600 million to make a drug, generic drug makers wait for the patent to expire and then usually try to undercut the market so that they make money and undercut the people who invented the drugs. </p>
<p>As for this dude who upped the pill cost 5000%, thats an entirely different scenario than I was referring too.</p></div>		</li>
