			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the only way they can de-escalate is to bite the bullet like the UK did for Scotland and give them their referendum.</p>
<p>If the referendum was held and came back in favour of remaining, then that would put the issue to bed for a good while and also make it very politically hurtful for any Catalonian government wanting to try to hold another referendum (just as hints of a second referendum seem to have hurt the SNP in Scotland last election).</p>
<p>Trying to wrestle power away from a democratically elected local government and trying to stop the vote is just going to make people hate central government even more. At worst, they end up having a referendum anyway and they end up voting to leave because of what Spain has done, and at worst things start turning violent and we end up with Northern Ireland style troubles and much blood will be spilt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it worked out so great for the UK?</p>
<p>If you establish the precedent of a referendum for independence then it'll happen again and again and again until the separatists get the result they want and then there will NEVER be a referendum to reunify.</p>
<p>And it'll happen in Galicia, Basque and Andaluc√≠a aswell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it DID work out well for the UK, because Scotland is still part of the UK.
Scotland hasn't called another referendum yet and there doesn't seem to be enough appetite for it.</p>
<p>I mean what makes you think it didn't? This Brexit shite is more or less an entirely different affair.</p>

<p>No, it will happen again and again if there are enough democratically elected separatists in government to make it happen, and so it should. That's self-determination.</p>
<p>The UK's challenge now is to operate in a manner that ensures that people will always vote no to any independence referendum and that they won't elect SNP voters in the first place.</p>
<p>This is what Spain needs to do. Have a vote. If the vote comes back &quot;yes&quot; then Spain fucked up and has to live with the consequences. If the vote comes back &quot;no&quot; then Spain has already fucked up by letting it get to the point where a Catalonian government could ever want to call a referendum and so they have to work to fix it.
That's the way it should be.</p>
<p>Any nation of the UK (or anywhere tbh) should have the right to call an independance referendum if we elect local governments who campaign on that platform.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Countries do join into unions. I mean look at the EU. It's devoted to the idea of ever closer union.
Look at the US.</p>
<p>Countries do split apart and countries can unite when that's what their people and/or government want.</p>
<p>Sure, Catalonia would probably never return its sovereignty to the folks in Madrid, but the EU has been showing how many independently sovereign states can work together to act as a whole and be powerful anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tha's pretty much correct but to add some context, Galicia is another region with their own language, culture and history that also suffered from the discatorship, but they have no money. Interestingly enough, every single time I hear about a region claiming to be independent, is because they are the richest region and they don't want to contribute to the rest. And for that reason I dont buy any historiic and cultural claims. They just want more money, which is ironic since they try really hard to appear as left, intellectual and super advanced</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there was a period of independence in the early 20th century where the CNT and others grouped together to create an anarcho-collectivist territory </p></div>		</li>
