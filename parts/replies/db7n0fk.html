			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that's correct.  You're assuming that the range of both devices depends only on its transmitting power, but the sensitivity of the <em>receivers</em> matters too.</p>
<p>Since the tower doesn't have to be mobile, I'd imagine it can have both high-power transmitters and bulky ultra-sensitive receivers and amplifiers.  It doesn't have to be symmetric: you can put all the large electronics on the side that doesn't move, and keep the mobile unit small, simple, and low-power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't the cell phone's uplink use a lower baudrate than the cell tower's downlink? Sorta like how residential ISPs are asymmetrical but so that the mobile devices can still download fast (b/c power comes from the wired tower) but upload is constrained but not as noticeable (so battery life is longer and range a little further).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent explanation, but what happens if you are in the radius of two or more cell towers? Which of them recieves the information you send? Both of them or just one?  If the answer is both, does the phone has to do the job of sending signals twice, using more energy?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In CDMA and W-CDMA (3G) it's possible for adjacent towers to operate on the same frequency due to their nature. Handover, when you're leaving one tower to other can use 'soft handover' where for a period you're connected to the new tower without disconnecting from the previous tower. The phone doesn't send the signal twice, just encode the signal with two different code simultaneously, then send the 'mix'. Think about listening to an ambassador speaking in her native language overlaid with English translation. Only one audio channel, yet it can be understood by either language speaker just fine, and if they compare notes later, they might even be able to deduce unclear words. Indeed in soft handover phase the loss from interference can be reduced (clearer voice, or maybe higher effective connection speed). This is also why adjacent towers can use the same frequency, you can talk just fine with your friends in crowded party if everyone else are talking in foreign languages.</p>
<p>1G, 2G &amp; 4G meanwhile use different frequencies on adjacent towers. This mean no soft handover (although in 4G the switch to the next tower is near instant enough to not drop your call or download).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally, just one. It will be the one that returns the strongest return signal and therefore polls as being closest. It's not unusual for a phone to be within range of several towers, particularly in Europe. The phone will use whichever one gives it the best return.</p>
<p>Not so normally, new technology has been developed that allows a phone to use more than one tower if it's available to it. This has benefits for things like channel bonding thus increasing bandwidth which has all sorts of uses, though it's unlikely to be offered to people down at consumer level (Probably emergency services and focused requirement users) given it would likely stretch capacity and the specific hardware requirements of the handsets.</p></div>		</li>
