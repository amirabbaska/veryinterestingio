			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to think I was good enough at walking but I flipped out <em>on the ground</em> at the water gardens &quot;active pool&quot; in Ft Worth.  (Later, several people drowned in the pool, so there was actually a deadly risk there, from falling) Most people had no problem whatsoever, happily stepping from platform to platform as I froze and had to be aided away.  Being actually unable to move was a unique experience, and not one I hope to have again.</p>
<p>The problem then becomes, not the environment, but can you trust your own body...</p></div>		</li>
