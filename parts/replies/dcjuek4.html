			<div class="markdown"><p>How could that property ever be recovered?  I live in IL and have had stocks in my name go to the state &quot;unclaimed property&quot; department, but I was able to recover them since they were in my name.  To my knowledge, gift cards don't ever have names tied to them, so it's basically just like cash.  Only difference is that it is cash that the state could never use so it seems like a lose/lose for everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I worked for a company that issued these. After a year of inactivity they were charged a fee each month for keeping the card available.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, these were reloadable but had to be inactive to be charged the fee.</p>
<p>The problem with the cards were, the poorest of people would hold on to them like they were a nest egg and would flip out finding the card had been drained after 18 months of inactivity. Also things like Gas stations where pay at the pump would reserve the majority of the card for $20 of gas. Ultimately the charges fall off but the card would have money reserved for 7-14 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would that work when gift cards can't expire? Say I buy a $10,000 gift card.  First, my name is not attached to that card so who could ever claim the lost property?  Second, how long after purchase before it is claimed as lost?  Third, what if the person who possesses the card 10 year or so after it is issued tries to use it?  Are they told that it didn't expire but it isn't on the card anymore and someone needs to claim it somehow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So much like accounts due to you that are old (receivables) that you have to write off as uncollectable you can recognize some revenue as cards age. </p>
<p>As accounts age they are less and less likely to be realized, be them monies owed to you or performance you owe out. Corporations have a policy for these accounts written, and if they have ever undergone an independent audit for any reason (which any corporation with stakeholders does, even if small, just even for investors or bank lines of credit) these policies have to be reasonable and revisited annually</p>
<p>So yes. Technically a company could say from day 1 a gift card is only 80% collectible and recognize the revenue, but it's highly unlikely since no auditor would accept a policy without an aging schedule. So I'm sure it's primarily calculated as a percentage of total balance by age. That's the industry standard.</p>
<p>And even if you DO recognize revenue at 20% off the top, if the gift card is redeemed you are having to expense the purchase with no offsetting revenue, which hurts your bottom line, and is generally something you want to avoid.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the Visa gift cards, of which I've been given a few, it is like any other banking institution. You access your account online (or call) and report that your card is missing and you request a new one. They send it in the mail, takes 5-10 days for arrival.
I assume that when a new card is sent out, the old card is deactivated. </p></div>		</li>
