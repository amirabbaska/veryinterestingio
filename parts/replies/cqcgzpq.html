			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's not that light is slow, it's incredibly fast. It's more of the fact that space is SOO vast, that even at light speed, it takes an extortionate amount of time to get anywhere. Thus the fact that we're essentially stuck here would suggest to some that there is nothing out there at all, it doesn't ACTUALLY exist because we can't get there, hence a simulated universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok I see. It's like in this space simulator game I play. I can fly in more than the speed of light towards the next star system, but it would take several days in that speed. And when I do get there, it's nothing, it didn't load. To actually travel that distance I have to &quot;hyper drive&quot;, which loads a kind of cut-scene animation. When I get to the system, it's been loaded up in a new instance, a new bubble of simulated universe. And the previous one is not live until I hyper drive/load it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that the time it takes to travel galactically is a long time is not an absolute statement though, it's only long relative to everything else we as humans can experience. If we had some different ontology that changed our perspective about what a great amount of time and a short amount of time was, we would not be saying this about lightspeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it not true, however, that time dilates for objects moving close to the speed of light? So, were we to somehow travel at the speed of light, that seemingly enormous amount of time would shrink a significant amount- would it not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The implication would be that the simulation has maxed out the available processing power, and couldn't maintain the simulation for higher values of c.</p>
<p>I'm not arguing either way; I've just mentioning that I've heard this as a factor in the simulation hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if the universe <em>was</em> a simulation, you would expect to see things that point towards it being programmed, like hard-defined values for various things, and a maximum speed. We have both of those in the fundamental constants and the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't imply the universe being simulation, but is somewhat of a precondition. If the speed of light was infinite any movement of a particle in the universe would immediately influence all other particles in the universe. That would require square the computing power of a universe in which a particle only influences a subset of particles in a given moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly my thoughts! a universe without speed limit would be also too chaotic and unstable for beings like us to exist, so it could be the multiverse hypothesis?</p>
<p>Also, imagine if you had hash tables for localized state computations, just like in the game of life you would not need to compute every single state change, you could check for patterns and look up the hash table what the next state should be for that localized area.</p>
<p>Imagine if two people from two different time frames had the exact same neural pattern for an instance, for that instance the simulation computer would not need to compute these patterns individually but could simply check what the next state of that pattern was. So in a way a part of the brain in two separate people would be the same entity from the perspective of the simulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to avoid willies ... it may be a good idea to shrink all dimensions by a scale of 1.5e-20 ... including time.</p>
<p>so 8 minutes becomes ... something like 3e-16 secs, or of the order of e-7 nanosecs</p>
<p>After all, the speed of light <em>is</em> constant, even in the shrunken-model universe :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>In this case, the universe is about 6.5ms old, or just under the amount of time that a baseball remains in contact with a bat when hit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light might seem slow, but you're forgetting a very important variable.</p>
<p>You see, we don't live for that long. Light seems 'slow' to us because we consider centuries to be very long stretches of time. A lifetime is nothing compared to a million years.</p>
<p>Picture your small lake being videotaped. Then speed that tape up by a factor of about five thousand. That is your universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The perspective from duration isn't arbitrary imho. Space and time are intertwined and we're just as infinitesimally small in both. You look at a mountain and say it's big, you live a year and say it's long. Both are negligible compared to the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wh---what? It isn't an arbitrary perspective - in relation to the original commenter, who was pointing out how slow light seemed, was also speaking from the point of view of a human, whose lifespan is approximately 80-100 years, at most. And like dv12900 had said, that is absolutely infinitesimally small comparative to one million years, let alone the age of the universe.</p></div>		</li>
