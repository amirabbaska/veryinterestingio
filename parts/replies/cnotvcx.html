			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens when you hear about people who have fallen into a lake and are dead for 4 hours then revived?  How do the cells survive without oxygen?</p>
<p>Edit: As others have noted it's not 4 hours.  The longest incident I could find was 80 minutes.  Still interesting.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Doctors induced hypothermia in this patient for 48 hours while she awaited a liver donor.  It was done to preserve her brain. 33 degrees!</p>

<p>Therapeutic cooling is used in hospitals on witnessed cardiac arrests as soon as they enter the ER, for just this reason. </p>
<p>Edited to add: four hours is a stretch, though, in my experience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the OR for a few types of cardiothoracic surgery, they sometimes use a combination of cooling and deep sedation to try and protect the brain during periods of circulatory arrest.</p>
<p>Most procedures in this area are done on cardiopulmonary bypass - blood is circulated through a heart lung machine to get oxygen while the heart is worked on, for example.</p>
<p>But in a few cases (pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for example) they will do part of the procedure on bypass and then do the most delicate parts on full circ arrest.  Usually only 20 min at a time, because the adult brain doesn't do well for longer.  </p>
<p>Interestingly in the one before / after study of the effects of this on the brain that I've seen - people did better after surgery.  Presumably due to other effects (better overall cardiopulmonary function and health?).  I was quite surprised.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What ultimately causes death in the sense that a person has crossed the line of no return?  </p>
<p>Of course, getting shot in the head would be nearly instantaneous because of trauma to the brain.  But what if you were shot in the stomach and bled out slowly?  Do you need to lose enough blood to cause lack of oxygen to the brain?  </p>
<p>Lets take it one step further and say you were shot in the heart - would that be as instantaneous as being shot in the head (heart not pumping oxygen to brain) but as ChicagoCowboy stated in his/her answer above - neurons still take minutes to die because of lack of oxygen.  Would this then mean the only true instant &quot;kill shot&quot; would be a head shot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two medical terms for death, clinical death and brain death. Clinical death is absence of pulse (heartbeat) and respiration, while brain death is a bit more difficult to define, but in essence &quot;patient&quot; is brain dead when there is no brain activity left.</p>
<p>But this are just arbitrary lines that we use in everyday practice, death in itself is a process and not an instantaneous event. For example, after cardiac arrest (clinical death), neurons in brain take 4-10 minutes to become irreversibly damaged, since they are cells that are most sensitive to lack of oxygen. </p>
<p>However different cells in body have different levels of tolerance for lack of oxygen and there have been recorded cases of bones and cartilages surviving up to 3 months after clinical death. Among less sensitive tissues are also pancreas, kidney, muscles (where individual cells are viable for a few hours, this doesn't mean that whole organs are), so really death is a long process with poorly determined start and end, outside of clinical terms.</p>
<p>And to answer to your questions, modern medicine determines line of no return as brain death, which is caused by lack of brain perfusion, even if patient has pulse and is breathing (usually on respirator). </p>
<p>If you were shot in a stomach you would slowly bleed out, which would cause your heart to stop and neurons in brain to die. When heart stops pumping blood you loose conciousness in a mater of seconds, so hear shot is pretty much instant clinical death, followed by brain death at some point later, but this would all be happening when patient is in coma, so it doesn't make much difference. </p>
<p>Shot in the head is in theory survivable, so whether it causes instant death depends on type of brain injury, but normally you would loose consciousness instantaneously, with brain and clinical death following soon, due to lack of respiration.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What causes that 'irreversible damage'? I understand that without oxygen the cell has no way to repair itself or function in any way, but why does it get damaged at all instead of just hanging out until oxygen is restored? </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Then do neurons instantly die when brain perfusion (which I just looked up and seems to refer to a pressure gradient) falls below a certain level, and it's the brain perfusion that has a time lag after cardiac arrest? Or do the neurons survive for 4-10 minutes after brain perfusion drops below a threshold?</p>
<p>Either way, is it the brain perfusion itself that's measured to &quot;call&quot; a patient? Or do they measure something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does indeed.  That is why in the Vet manuals they recomend a shot to the head with a .22.  Well, that and the fact they don't want you to miss or hit and area that doesn't cause the heart to fully bleed out instantaneous. </p></div>		</li>
