This is the figure I've heard for over 20 years. Current references to EPA reports say 2-5 times greater indoor pollution, which may reflect some recent attempts to reduce carpet chemicals in the past decade.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Guides/Home/The-Inside-Story-A-Guide-to-Indoor-Air-Quality/" target="_blank">Here's a more general article</a> from the Consumer Protection Agency.</p>
<p>WHO refers to <a href="http://www.who.int/indoorair/en/" target="_blank">up to 100-fold greater indoor air pollution</a> in the developing world, though this relates largely to crude forms of cooking stoves and heating. </p></div>		</li>
