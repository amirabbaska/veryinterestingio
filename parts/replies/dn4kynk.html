<p>Edit: haha, just realized I accidentally made this a r/shittylifeprotip. This was actually supposed to be a legitimate LPT. I didn't mean to add the word hot. </p>
<p>Just rinse it with cold water, dump the water while keeping the ice in your cup than pour in your soda. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a shitty life pro tip regardless. It in theory makes no sense, the holey areas have more surface area which should make them larger if anything after partial melting, but more importantly, the rinse is going to be so short that it shouldn't make much of a difference at all.</p>
<p>I also just tried it, and if it makes a difference, it's minor. Maybe it works better if you swish it around, but in that case the mechanical hitting along the sides of the glass is important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't tried it but this actually might work. Rinsing in hot water should leave a much smoother surface and reduce nucleation sites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also think it might be related to temperature difference too. Try pouring a cold drink into a cold glass vs a warm drink into a cold glass. Or put ice cubes into a cold drink and ice cubes into a warm drink. Ice cubes in cold drink will fizz a lot less. </p></div>		</li>
