			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly it’s mostly about getting enough DNA. The array we use only looks at dog DNA (other DNA doesn’t attach to it), so as long as you don’t accidentally swab two dogs, you should be fine as long as you get enough DNA from your dog. Try to keep it in your dog’s mouth absorbing saliva as long as you can (30 sec is best; the lower lip pouches are usually full of saliva) and consider waving a treat in front of your dog before you put the swab in to get your dog’s mouth juices flowing!</p></div>		</li>
