<p>Short-ish version: probably re-introduction of captive geese led to geese that didn't know where to migrate.  They survived, and other geese also found that migrating wasn't a requirement for survival.  Probably.  Maybe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry just something ive observed with a Starling.  A lone Starling that roosts near our Butcher shop NEVER leaves.  It breeds every year yet it seems.only it stays.  Its discovered it can eat scraps of meat from our bins or that comes off our feet as we walk between buildings or whatever.  So whilst they specialise with longer and strong beaks for worms this one feeds almost entirely from us.  </p></div>		</li>
