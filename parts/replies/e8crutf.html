			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I don't really understand the laws against suppressors.</p>
<p>If you were using a gun in a home defense situation, it is going to be deafening in closed quarters.  A suppressor isn't going to turn you into a ninja.  It just might keep you from going deaf in a situation when you need all of your senses.</p>
<p>But it's probably just indicative of how gun laws are often made by people that don't understand guns. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Could have been a metal door smacking into something? Maybe someone pranging their car? Maybe some roadworks and someone pickaxing some concrete? Something other than &quot;holy shit was that a gunshot?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're getting close though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z17UQUYzPhQ&amp;t=1161s" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z17UQUYzPhQ&t=1161s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z17UQUYzPhQ&t=1161s</a></a> (Skip to 15 minutes for demonstration)</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind the sound of a gunshot is comprised of multiple pieces. The suppressor really only takes care of one of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sound of the gases escaping, its basically a mini explosion</li>
<li>The sound of the gun parts operating, firing pin hitting primer if its a bolt operated, if its a semi-auto then you also have the slide and ejection mechanisms you're hearing</li>
<li>The sound of the bullet breaking the sound barrier</li>
</ul>
<p>So using the suppressor referenced in the video above with a sub-sonic bullet (which will keep the sound barrier from being broken) on a bolt operated weapon, gives you the quietest operation. Switching to smaller caliber bullets would also keep noise down.</p>
<p>During World War II the British had the De Lisle carbine, a silenced bolt action carbine. A lot of the inner workings were insulated so as to keep the sound of the firing pin striking the primer to an absolute minimum. Keep in mind, this was WW2 technology, so it still produced 85 dB of  noise when fired. But the concept was there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they aren't.  </p>
<p>Disclaimer:  Very avid shooter and own 9 suppressors.</p>
<p>Never, ever, EVER think a recording of a loud thing (gunshot) accurately reproduces what it sounds like.  Very few guns are &quot;hearing safe&quot; with a can and subsonic ammo.  The .300Blk in the vid is one of very few and it pays for it in ballistic performance...it's basically a .45ACP round (like a handgun) with better ballistic coefficient.  Something like an AR15 is still 135db+ with the best can you buy and that's nowhere close to hearing safe.  A 9mm is 125db.  Very much on the line.  </p>
<p>And there is no way in hell the De Lisle actually does 85db.  No.  Way.  This comes up every time a suppressor question hits Reddit.  If that could be done every suppressor manufacturer would have a copy and I'd own two.  No one has ever taken one and measured it with modern equipment the way we measure suppressors today and shown anything close to that.</p></div>		</li>
