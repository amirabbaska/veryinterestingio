			<div class="markdown"><p>Do I understand this correctly?  If we placed a beacon on the moon that blinked at a very precise rate and had an identical blinking light on earth, then it would appear to us that the moon beacon was blinking faster than the earth beacon.    Or if a radio was transmitting at a precisely known frequency was broadcasting from the moon, it would appear to be at a slightly higher frequency on earth.  Are those correct?</p>
<p>Next question:  Have we ever tried those types of experiments?  It seems to me that is something they would have tested in the moon landing days if they could make signal devices that were precise enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you understand correctly. For satellites their internal clocks must adjust for the time dilation they experience due to general relativity. I don't know if communications frequencies are also shifted.</p>
<p>The coolest experiment we've done to measure this are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B" target="_blank">Gravity Probes.</a> My favorite part about these are the near-perfect gyroscopes they used to measure the effect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Approximately the size of ping pong balls, they were perfectly round to within forty atoms (less than 10 nm). If one of these spheres were scaled to the size of the earth, the tallest mountains and deepest ocean trench would measure only 2.4 m (8 ft) high.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moon? Ha. Robert Pound and Glen Rebka (Harvard) actually managed to measure this effect in 1959 over a distance of <strong>22.5 meters</strong> (height of the staircase in the lab)! They used an incredibly fine tuned gamma ray source and detector and found out that the frequency of the gamma rays changed by a factor of about 2.5x10^-15 due to the difference in gravity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, and we didn't need to go to the Moon to do it. The Hafeleâ€“Keating experiment of 1971 used several synchronized atomic clocks. Some of the clocks were put on commercial airliners and flown around the world, others stayed on the ground. When the traveling clocks were returned, they were found to be off by an amount consistent with the predictions of general relativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>whoa, hang on a sec... Gravity slows time? i thought time was linked only to speed (relativity).... </p>
<p>1) how is gravity related to time </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2) if gravity slows time, what does that indicate about the relationship between gravity and velocity? does that also imply that time has some bearing on mass? what the heck, man!? what does this suggest about the effect gravity places on bodies, and therefore the expenditure of energy? my brain hurts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how are they related?</p>
<p>After a quick wikipedia search, this is what I understand:</p>
<p>Special Relativity proposes space-time.</p>
<p>General Relativity proposes that space-time is curved by gravity.</p>
<p>Is that correct? They seem very related, why are they different things? I know Einstein came up with them one after the other, but why is it Special or General?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Massive objects bend spacetime. This is how gravity works basically. An object, like the Sun, bends the spacetime around it. Then a planet, like the Earth, follows these curves and contours as it moves through space in its orbit. Key word is &quot;spacetime&quot;. Massive objects bend space and they also bend time, hence why gravitational time dilation occurs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, so when Einstein developed his theory of Special Relativity, he demonstrated through a thought experiment, he demonstrated that measurements of space and time would change if you were moving at a constant velocity relative to whatever you were measuring.  And it's important to note that it's not just some kind of illusory effect, but that time and space can be compressed by traveling at a very high speed.  So he showed that space and time were linked in a way that leads to us now talking about &quot;space-time&quot; as a single thing.</p>
<p>Einstein then went on to develop General Relativity, which deals with acceleration and gravity.  So not only did he go on to show how acceleration would work based on what he had demonstrated in Special Relativity, but he also demonstrated that gravity could be treated as a warping of space-time, such that being acted on by a gravitational force could be treated the same as being under constant acceleration.  So you know how when an elevator starts moving up, while it's accelerating, you feel very heavy, and then when it stops you feel very light for a couple of moments?  There's a reason for that.  Being under Earth's gravity is pretty much the same thing as being in an elevator that's constantly accelerating upward.</p>
<p>So yes, in a sense, time dilation is linked to speed, but then gravity is also weirdly a form of speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting to note that the measured times don't even have to be on different gravitational bodies. Just being a different height from the gravity source is enough. Time passes slower at your feet than it does at your head (though this difference exists it is incredibly small).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the effect is very tiny at such small heights (astronomically speaking). Changes in mortality are far more correlated with environmental, lifestyle and physiological differences on these scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is very minimal, measured in microseconds for astronauts who travel in lower gravity and higher speeds. So for somebody on a mountain, hence no speed relative to you, the difference is even smaller, although he probably spends more time on that mountain than an astronaut in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, by this people living closer to the center of the Earth would live longer. Think of it as being due to gravity acting in all directions so that more &quot;stuff&quot; means more gravity, and gravity actually not being a pulling force but rather a further distance light needs to travel (because the more gravity the more spacetime curvature and the further light's gotta go to reach &quot;one second&quot; in time). So everything ages slower the more the gravity is. </p></div>		</li>
