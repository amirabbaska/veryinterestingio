			<div class="markdown"><p>And hence the reason for effecting the hosts ability to swallow.  Virus that has been swallowed can’t effectively be passed on. </p>
<p>It’s really an “elegant” solution that works across a wide variety of species because it’s so simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! That is exactly the answer I was looking for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rabies infects neurones that control respiration and swallowing. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>How did the virus know to target these in the first place? Drinking water or other fluids can decrease the virus's ability to get transmitted, so it tries to avoid that. But how can it &quot;know&quot; this and target the right neurons?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It never needed to know.
Way back in the past as the virus evolved, strains of it infected other parts of the brain.
The strain effecting swallowing was the most successful at passing its genetic material on.
The strains that effected other areas didn’t flourish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. You have addressed a common confusion people have about evolution. It's not directed, there's no agent involved, it's just whatever's most likely to pass its genes on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it just as possible that it always infected this part of the brain, but used to have a far less successful method of delivery? Serious question, asking if we have some history of this specific viral family or you were just speculating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn't know or predict.  It's only the observation of random mutation and what accidentally works slightly better, over many generations.  Viruses have no ill will toward the creatures they infect.  They don't think at all.  They are created by chance, and get tuned through successive generations by chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's even debate over how &quot;alive&quot; a virus really is. Bacteria is definitely alive, a virus though? They're more like bits of genetic material that uses actual living cells to replicate and mutate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember getting food poisoning and was going through liquid stomach acid every 30 minutes. It was so painful and burning that I started getting anxiety about going to the toilet. I would try to hold it instead of go because it was so painful. That was after one night of going through it so the fear can develop very quickly.</p></div>		</li>
