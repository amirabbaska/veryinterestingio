			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill#Placebo_pills" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill#Placebo_pills</a><br><br>&gt;The placebo pills allow the user to take a pill every day; remaining in the daily habit even during the week without hormones. Placebo pills may contain an iron supplement,[17][18] as iron requirements increase during menstruation.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Failure to take pills during the placebo week does not impact the effectiveness of the pill, provided that daily ingestion of active pills is resumed at the end of the week.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;The withdrawal bleeding that occurs during the break from active pills was thought to be comforting, as a physical confirmation of not being pregnant.[19] The 28-day pill package also simulates the average menstrual cycle, though the hormonal events during a pill cycle are significantly different from those of a normal ovulatory menstrual cycle. The pill suppresses the normal cycle, and the withdrawal bleeding occurs while the placebo pills are taken. The withdrawal bleeding is also predictable. Unexpected breakthrough bleeding can be a possible side effect of longer term active regimens.[20]</p>		</li>

			<p>Consistency. You don't need to take the sugar pills, it is just to keep you doing it every day so you don't forget when it is time to start again. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ha my mom found my package with the sugar pills in the trash one time and said, &quot;Be careful, you should take those! That's how your brother was born.&quot; Uhh no Mom, I'm thinking my brother was born because you didn't have a grasp on how BC works.</p>		</li>

			<p>She could have meant that she never took the sugar pills, so when her cycle began again and she had to take the actual pills, she forgot, and thus your brother was born.</p>		</li>

			<p>In addition to a reminder, some brands of pill also add estrogen (but not progestin) to some of the fourth-week pills to ease the symptoms of the withdrawal bleeding. Mircette, for example.</p>		</li>

			<p>I used to be able to predict it to the half hour if I took it at the exact same time everyday. It was a glorious thing, but then I got lazy and accepted the 36ish hour window.</p>		</li>

			<p>I was the same way. I was on the pill for 12 years and very, very careful about taking it at the same time every day. I could predict my withdrawal bleed with accuracy to about an hour.</p>		</li>
