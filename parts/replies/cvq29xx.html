			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah one month I was nilly willy about the time and I got break through bleeding a week before my sugar pill week was supposed to start. So I think for some people it makes a difference. This month I was extra careful to make sure to be consistent and take it every 24-26 hours. No break through yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take mine at night and often forget because I'm tired/I fall asleep before I do it. I think my body's just like &quot;fuck you man, do whatever&quot; and my period ends up being like 3 days because it'll start a couple of days into my sugar pill week. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's lucky. I take mine at night too. I have an alarm. I stop what I'm doing and take it. Or at least take it within the hour. I also have a boyfriend who has had to &quot;suffer&quot; a withdrawal bleed that lasted nine days when I was inconsistent and take it whenever I would go to bed (be it 9 pm or 2 am).<br />
It's really not that much work to stop and just take it. I think getting a break through bleed a week earlier than expected and last 9 days is worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!  I'm really lax about when I take the pill.  I take it with lunch every day, but lunch might be at 11 or 3.  I'll try being more consistent and hopefully that will help with the annoying breakthrough bleeding.  </p>
<p>And with not being starving by lunch...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're not great about taking your pill at the same time everyday, consider skipping the placebo week, and simply take the active pills daily for 3-4 months at a time. There's no actual medical need/benefit for you to menstruate monthly, and the pill is slightly more effective when used this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't been that unlucky, there have been times I completely forgot a pill until the next day (oops) but no breakthrough bleeding. I think it does have to do with when in your cycle you miss it though - if you're close to your period it's probably easier to get some bleeding than just after your last period</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The placebo pills allow the user to take a pill every day; remaining in the daily habit even during the week without hormones. Placebo pills may contain an iron supplement,[17][18] as iron requirements increase during menstruation.</p>
<p>Failure to take pills during the placebo week does not impact the effectiveness of the pill, provided that daily ingestion of active pills is resumed at the end of the week.</p>
<p>The withdrawal bleeding that occurs during the break from active pills was thought to be comforting, as a physical confirmation of not being pregnant.[19] The 28-day pill package also simulates the average menstrual cycle, though the hormonal events during a pill cycle are significantly different from those of a normal ovulatory menstrual cycle. The pill suppresses the normal cycle, and the withdrawal bleeding occurs while the placebo pills are taken. The withdrawal bleeding is also predictable. Unexpected breakthrough bleeding can be a possible side effect of longer term active regimens.[20]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consistency. You don't need to take the sugar pills, it is just to keep you doing it every day so you don't forget when it is time to start again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha my mom found my package with the sugar pills in the trash one time and said, &quot;Be careful, you should take those! That's how your brother was born.&quot; Uhh no Mom, I'm thinking my brother was born because you didn't have a grasp on how BC works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to a reminder, some brands of pill also add estrogen (but not progestin) to some of the fourth-week pills to ease the symptoms of the withdrawal bleeding. Mircette, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was the same way. I was on the pill for 12 years and very, very careful about taking it at the same time every day. I could predict my withdrawal bleed with accuracy to about an hour.</p></div>		</li>
