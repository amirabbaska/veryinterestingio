			<div class="markdown"><p>Came looking for a reference to nutriloaf.  Isn't basically food scraps blended and pressed into a loaf? So not necessarily tasty (though possibly, depending on the scraps) but contains all the nutrients the food used would have in it's whole form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, exactly. You can actually find recipes for it online. I'm told it tastes like warmed moist sawdust. Most of my clients get it when they've proven themselves unworthy of utensils while in custody. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was an actual product with a recipe that specifically hit all of the daily nutritional necessities.  I feel like using food scraps poses the threat of not reaching those milestones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we have a few correction officers present:</p>
<p>Do prisoners ever attempt to starve themselves and if so do you care, further, if you care, what is the procedure for handling someone who doesn't want to eat and for how long?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in administrative segregation, so yes, we had a ton of offenders attempt to starve themselves, some in protest, others because they were bored and wanted a change of scenery. With some of them I'll be honest, it got monotonous (a lot like the cutters who did it for attention), but we have to care, because it's our duty to ensure their safety while in our custody. If we fail to follow procedure and someone gets hurt, it's our job on the line (the state usually fields the manslaughter charges away from single officers, but you'll never work in any corrections or government job again). Protocol was if we noticed an offender not eating more than one meal a day he was sent to a special wing that was better staffed (and by better staffed, I mean it <em>might</em> have two officers instead of one. On that wing, it was noted whether or not the offender ate each meal, among other things (it was usually staffed with two officers because one basically just did paperwork on that kind of stuff all day). Once it becomes clear he's starving himself, usually after 3 days or so (fewer if he's dehydrating as well) we notify medical. They usually just did a write up and sent them back to the observational wing until they grew sick or weak, at which point we shipped them to the state's hospital and past that I don't personally know, but assume they were sedated, tube fed and sent to psych if it was warranted. </p>
<p>Basically, it really depended on how long it took them to make themselves sick from it as to the timeline on following procedure. I've seen some that lasted several weeks, and I've also seen a diabetic go on strike that we had to send out in an ambulance just a few hours later. But unlike Gitmo (which I'm assuming is your basis for this), the state has its own fully staffed, fully functional hospital dedicated to offenders that takes care of the serious health problems.</p></div>		</li>
