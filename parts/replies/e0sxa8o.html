			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I have a question, how do Bluetooth devices give priority to each other?  Example:   I have music streaming on my headphones from my phone, leaving them on, I start my car and the Bluetooth automatically switches to the car stereo.  It seems like certain devices have priority over others.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That priority is determined by the programming of the central device, in this case it would be your phone.  The phone considers the car stereo to be a higher priority since it figures you wouldn’t be using your earbuds in the car.   And your phone can tell the difference between the two based on their Bluetooth audio profiles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The device gives way to the newest request. If you are driving with bluetooth on in your car and turn on the headphones they will take priority.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I hate this. Love Bluetooth music in the car. But I don’t want my phone call to blast on the radio, or I’m on the phone on a hot day and can’t start my car because it’ll drop the audio while the car cranks, meanwhile whoever was on hangs up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interestingly, something similar to this came up yesterday evening.</p>
<p>My SUV has an aftermarket JVC Bluetooth car stereo, but no microphone attached to it. </p>
<p>I wanted to take a hands free phone call, so I put my AirPods in, the music continued to play through the stereo, but when I placed the call the phone immediately biased towards the airpods, and when the call was over the music went straight back to the car stereo, and when I shut the car off, the music continued to play through the air pods.</p>
<p>I was blown away, thats same damned nifty programming because it made perfect logical sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forgot about that.  If I’m out working and jump in the car the headphones disconnect when I start the car.  Normally i turn them off but I forget a lot.  If a phone call comes in it  rings through the headphones even though Bluetooth switched to the car.  Usually  I’m just confused when I answer the phone and have to fumble through the choices of where I want sound when i can’t hear anyone. This is dangerous.  It does make perfect sense but my headphones are cheap noise canceling earbuds from amazon that I wouldn’t wear while driving.   I’ve since decided to not answer the phone while driving at all.   It’s difficult to do but it’s safe.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the latest device connected. Which is why when you are driving and you turn your headset on the Bluetooth switches to that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both resistance and impedance are measures of how hard it is to put an electric current/voltage into a thing, both are measured in ohms.</p>
<p>Resistance is the DC version. Impedance encompasses both AC and DC effects (resistance, inductance, capacitance).</p>
<p>Edit: DC is a constant voltage, AC varies over time (see: sine wave)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Impedance includes imaginary resistance, which comes into play for caps and inductors. When the caps and inductors charge and discharge, they pull and push 'imaginary' power. Electrical engineering makes imaginary numbers real and it's a mindfuck. </p></div>		</li>

The resistance of the circuit will change depending on the frequency of the current passing through it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your phone makes sound come out of whatever is plugged in by pushing electricity through the wire.  </p>
<p>Your headphones need to use this electricity to actually make the sound in the air, so they let as much through as possible.</p>
<p>Your car's stereo doesn't want all that power, it only wants the &quot;signal&quot; of the noise, so that it can then use its own internal power to make the sound (since your phone definitely can't drive big heavy speakers like the ones in your car), so it only pulls a tiny bit of electricity.</p>
<p>Your phone can tell the difference between headphones that greedily want all the power they can get, and a stereo that only wants to understand the signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your earbuds need power to move the tiny magnets inside of the earbuds. So your phone goes “oh, this device wants a lot of power. Probably earbuds.” But your car’s audio doesn’t want a lot of power, because it has its own powered speakers. It just needs the signal, without any added power to drive magnets. So your phone goes “oh, this device isn’t using a lot of power. It probably has its own power source.” So then it just remembers “the last time you used headphones, your volume was set to half” and “the last time you used a car stereo, your volume was maxed.” Then it sets your volume to whichever one you plug in, by going “is this using a lot of electricity, or just a little bit?”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earbuds are powered directly from the headphone jack. The energy to move the little speakers in there is supplied from the phone. Because of this, they have low impedance. “Impedance” is just a fancier word for “resistance”. If something has low resistance, then that means it allows a lot of energy to flow without much force. </p>
<p>Your car's AUX jack is different. It just wants to see the signal. It doesn't need the full power coming in. It has its own equipment to make the speakers work, and just needs the music without amplification. Because of this, it has a high impedance. Having high impedance means that the phone won't spend much energy sending the music. </p></div>		</li>
