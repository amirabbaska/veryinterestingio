			<div class="markdown"><p>We were basically involved as soon as the French withdrew after the French Indochina war ended in 1954. South Vietnam required help in the form of military Advisors. When it was clear that wasn’t going to be enough we scaled up to full scale in the early-mid 60s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong. America's involvement stretches over two decades, but the number of Americans serving didn't get huge until late 1964, when we started to get <em>directly</em> involved. By 1972 American troops were mostly home.</p>

<p>These are the dates for service members who were KIA to be added to the Vietnam Memorial. These are also the dates to qualify as a Vietnam Veteran.</p>
<p>As you can see via the DoD response troops were directly involved as early as 1955.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Truman sent the first military to Vietnam. Kennedy sent 500 to train the South Vietnamese, and by the time he died in 1963, that number had grown to 16,000. The major escalation started shortly after that under Johnson, but you are accurate in that being the period most people think of when they think of the Vietnam War.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. &quot;Out of sight, out of mind.&quot; And after the mass mobilization of WWII, Korea seemed like small potatoes, although the personnel there were ill prepared, and had to endure terrible conditions. Google
the Chosin Reservoir.  And yes, far fewer Americans were affected by Korea than were affected by RVN.  And that's why the abolition of
Universal Military Service (&quot;The Draft&quot;) has made Americans indifferent to our continuing military adventures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The draft isn't abolished. It's still on the books and we're still required to register for it to get a drivers license (selective service). </p>
<p>It hasn't been activated in a long time, but it could be activated at any time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Will never happen. For all intended purpose short of WW3 will never happen. Means we can’t keep the military industrial complex running at full speed and have all of our misadventures overseas. When sons and daughters of Wall Street or Silicon Valley die for no real political gains (if they don’t draft dodge) it’d be the 60s all over again. </p>
<p>My exchange student friends asked me how we could be at war and no one cares due the height of the Iraq war 05 to 07 and I said this is America, no one really cares for their fellow citizens until some middle eastern dude is involved. Told him tens of thousands die from preventable gun violence and no one even notices. If those same people were killed by Osama we’d be invading another country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, we cared a lot more about where and to what extent our leaders were sticking our collective dick into other countries when it could mean that any young adult male could be randomly kidnapped by the government and shipped off to that place to get shot at. For better or for worse, if we used the draft for Afghanistan we'd probably be out of there right now- same with Iraq, though the draft would also probably reduce the odds that we'd get into that mess in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point exactly - the Draft served as a brake on military adventurism, which is bleeding the USA White, and sowing immense ill will for us.  Bet the rent that Iraq and Afghanistan and other &quot;Advisory Missions&quot; would not have happened if we still had Universal Military Service. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure those numbers are accurate? Because 33,000 Americans died in the Korean War and if only 300,000 served that would mean 1 in 10 were killed in action...it has to be more than 300,000 because 1 in 10 KIA is way too high (although, year for year, Korea was far more deadly than Vietnam as 33,000 died in its 3 year conflict while 58,000 died in Vietnam, which lasted over a decade) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Combat medicine got a lot better between those wars and during Vietnam.</p>
<p>Korea had a lot of set-piece battles, e.g. battalion vs. battalion, while Vietnam had just one (as seen in the movie, &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;, with Mel Gibson).  IMDB shows 59 movies with &quot;Korean War&quot; as keywords; &quot;Vietnam War&quot; shows many more, but many of the hits have only passing references to it (e.g., &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;).</p></div>		</li>
