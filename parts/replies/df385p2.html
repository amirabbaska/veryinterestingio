			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Same as India and Pakistan. They do not have a peaceful coexistence. If two neighbors are constantly arguing, pointing fingers, and yelling at each other, it may not be war but it is certainly not peace. A cease-fire of all hostilities is simply a cessation of killing, not a promise to love thy neighbor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that in the case of India and Pakistan, they're still killing each other, just not army on army. A couple of soldiers die every year from border skirmishes, and both nations support violent groups operating in the other's country.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A non aggression pact is an agreement that two or more countries won't attack each other.  Germany and the USSR had one during WWII before Germany broke it.</p>
<p>An armistice is a cessation of hostilities after fighting has begun.</p></div>		</li>
