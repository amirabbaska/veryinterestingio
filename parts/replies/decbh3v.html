			<div class="markdown"><p>Its called sleep paralysis</p>
<p>Sleep walkers don't produce enough of the paralytic so they  move when asleep, sleep paralysis is the opposite, you are awake but still in a phase where you body is in this mode. Usually comes with hallucinations and they tend to be of the menacing variety. I have auditory and visual hallucinations and they can be terrifying. I have been dealing with it for over 15 years so they no longer scare me like they used to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I had a very scary &quot;dream&quot; right before. Felt very real. I've read up on sleep paralysis and as I was laying there trying my hardest to move I was thinking &quot;this is sleep paralysis I guess&quot; lmao. One of those things you have to experience first before you can understand it fully. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>REM behavior disorder, too. I don't recommend sharing the bed with someone suffering from it. It won't wake them up, but it'll definitely wake you up. Night after night after night... &gt;.&lt;</p></div>		</li>
