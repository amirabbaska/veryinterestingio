			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt it. The difference from the afterburn effect is pretty much negligible wether you train vigorous or lightly. The afterburn effect isn't as impactfull as so many people make it out to be, too. We are talkiging of a difference of 20 to 40 total calories burned, wich is too small of an amount to impact anybody in any way. <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/peak-performance/running-v-walking-how-many-calories-will-you-burn" target="_blank">In this article</a> they compare it with the example given in this topic, walking and running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The catch being whether or not you can continue the pace you were doing; that is, I can walk all day long but I can only run for so long before my body is exhausted unless I were a trained ultra-marathoner. </p></div>		</li>
