			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I work in I.T. tech and know exactly why, but there's just no way I could come up with an analogy like this.</p>
<p>Edit: Apologies, a lot of people are unhappy with the term I used to describe what I work as, which is fair enough as it doesn't really make total sense. The reason I worded it like that is because I work for a global business solutions company who's primary work focuses on I.T. Solutions. In this &quot;I.T.&quot; company there are many people who are not technical and work in management type roles, administration, HR, etc etc. It's very common for individuals at my place to say they work in I.T. when the actual extend of the their knowledge is switching on their laptop and opening up Excel and Outlook.</p>
<p>Since I'm so used to distinguishing between us techs and them I worded it incorrectly and should have known better, apologies. I'm actually a DBA but have worked in various positions so have a rough understanding of other aspects. Thanks all :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand upon this, OPs question is legitimate, and I want to express the fact that almost anything CAN be done with code but one needs to understand why it might not be done that way.</p>
<p>The phone could be programmed to send out packages via WiFi and Data simultaneously and simply take whichever website returns faster, in fact some devices to this, however this is not regularly practiced because it would eat up your data and phone battery if this were done constantly. It also requires specialized protocols on both ends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_TCP" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_TCP</a> is there and can be used (at least in iOS), but no one bothers, it seems. I don't think it requires specialized hardware and it shouldn't drain the battery too much if implemented properly (e.g. if additional subflows are active only when there is packet loss on a primary interface).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a mode on samsung phones (at least the S-series) for a very short time and I cant think of the name but it would use both Wifi and mobile data in tandem to have a &quot;stronger&quot; and uninterrupted sognal. I always thought it was fake and didnt really do anything and then it was removed pretty quick but it has at least been tried.</p>
<p>Nvm, it was back when I did a lot of rooting and what not with my phones and it was an XDA app.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe in the technology that you've referenced via wiki the TCP connection is sort-of &quot;coupling&quot; the two streams of data, thus treating them as clones. Meaning in this case that you can receive packets 1,3,5 from line A and 2,4,6 from line B (or any combination, or all packets on both streams). This requires special software (hardware too? probably not) from the servicing server to recognize both steams as the same connection.  </p>
<p>You are correct in saying that the phone itself does not REQUIRE specialized hardware, but in order to produce the best (desired) results you'd want to have a network chip that is capable of sending out two discrete signals.</p></div>		</li>
