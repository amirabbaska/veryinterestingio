			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as we're on the subject, do we know that males actually <em>developed</em> beards?  Maybe our male and female ancestors all had beards, and they were selected out in females (whether it be for sexual attraction or some other reason).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thinking was along these lines. The hair seems coarser in the anal area, the pubic area, on the torso(which used to have a row of nipples), and the face which would suggest at one time it had an immunilogical function, or perhaps still does in some way.</p>
<p>I'm too tired to actually think much of it through, just a guess.</p></div>		</li>
