			<div class="markdown"><p>Noise cancelling headphones do really poorly with voices. It'll cancel some/most of the constant hum of a jet engine or fan, but you'll still be able to hear the person next to you.</p>
<p>You'd probably be better off with a pack of those super cheap neon yellow/pink squishy earplugs you can buy almost anywhere (like the sporting goods section of Walmart) and a white noise app playing out of your phone nearby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the headphones. Try Bose ones for example. I wasn't able to hear my buddy standing next to me talking when noise cancellation was on. But I could perfectly hear him when it was off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most can't respond quickly enough to variation in frequency to cancel voices, unless they're fairly monotone, I suppose. They're really meant for cancelling fairly consistent sounds like plane engines and road noise, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good ones (especially Bose) do reduce the volume of voices significantly though. I find if I add some background noise, like playing sounds of raining or soft music, it blocks out everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can feel what seems like added pressure when I am wearing strong active noise cancelling headphones, and it can cause discomfort over long periods of time if you are not used to it. I assumed this was because of 'added sound' despite it destructively interfering... but that seems like its bogus. What could be resulting in that feeling of pressure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but they are just simple physical solutions. I wear such things for work in my industry. Noise-cancelling equipment can actually cancel out a sound into silence, not just quieten it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, these are decibel activated headsets they only cancel noise if it's over a certain threshold.  That way you can still hear everything around you (like talking to your fellow soldiers) but not a loud gunshot when you need to fire.</p></div>		</li>
