			<div class="markdown"><p>But do we know as to why certain frequencies cause a pleasurable feeling? take food for example, it has specific components (fat sugar...) that makes it taste good and thus makes us feel happy in return but music in non-essential for our existence, so how and why did our brains develop such processing of auditory sounds that we just happen to combine? why does a chord sound so nice to us while another no?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ultimately? No, not really. There have been many people, throughout history, who have tried to come up with an explanation for that. The ancient Greeks (particularly Pythagoras and Plato) are among the more notable ones here, and they had theories about the ratios involved in music and their relation to &quot;perfection&quot; (which in ancient philosophy is a rather subtle and dense notion), with chords/notes/intervals that are perceived as &quot;pleasant&quot; said to more strongly participate in &quot;perfection&quot;. </p>
<p>Their descriptions of the ratios were amazingly accurate, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_tuning" target="_blank">Pythagorean tuning</a> was actually the dominant system used by Western musicians for two thousand years. But their arguments related to &quot;perfection&quot; are now generally considered somewhat. . . quaint, at best. </p>
<p>Why? Well, because we now know that while <em>Western</em> cultures certainly tend to regard as pleasant chords/intervals that the ancients would have considered as being closer to the &quot;perfect,&quot; this is very much not the case of many non-Western cultures. For a while there, Western observers tended to view this as evidence of non-Western &quot;barbarity.&quot; Which is pretty damned ethnocentric if not downright racist. But if we recognize that musical beauty is even <em>partly</em> in the eye of the beholder, it becomes <em>very</em> difficult to articulate any compelling theory for <em>why</em> certain chords/intervals are &quot;beautiful&quot; and others aren't, simply because there is an appalling lack of consensus as what counts as &quot;beautiful.&quot; Any theory that explains why classical Western music is beautiful won't work for traditional Middle Eastern music, and what works for traditional Middle Eastern music won't work for east Asian music. Etc. </p>
<p>So again, we know how the brain responds when a person hears music they consider to be beautiful. But my understanding is that that response is the same no matter what a given person considers to be beautiful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what's so interesting to me - the fact that the traditional octave of tones and semitones are in fact just completely arbitrary. I know the intervals between them are based on frequency range etc. and are <em>not</em> arbitrary, but what denotes a &quot;C&quot; for example was just decided at some point by someone and then it was decided that at certain set intervals of frequency, the &quot;note&quot; changes, until it comes back to the same note again, but higher pitched. <strong>EDIT</strong> I do understand how scales use frequency etc., I just mean that someone decided how many intervals to have in between one arbitrarily designated frequency and double that frequency, when the tone is the same but higher pitched.  </p>
<p>The fact that you can hear what we'd consider microtones and dissonant, unpleasant noise, think they sound terrible and even have a <em>physical</em> response to the sound, and someone on the opposite side of the world would consider it a beautiful and harmonious sound is just amazing to me. Same with the idea of major being &quot;happy&quot; music and minor being &quot;sad&quot; music just being a completely arbitrary construct from however many centuries ago. It's so ingrained in our culture that the assumption is it's something innate and natural when in reality it's the complete opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This arrangement of twelve equal tones is called &quot;equal temperament&quot; which became popular around the time of J.S. Bach. </p>
<p>The downside of equal temperament is that all the pitches are slightly out of tune with each other, except for octaves and perfect fifths, I think. We are just &quot;used&quot; to it, as the above comment mentions.</p>
<p>The upside is that you can play in any key without retuning the instrument.</p>
<p>Listen to some &quot;mean-tone&quot; organ/harpsichord music to hear the difference. It makes modulation and dissonance very interesting for that period. </p>
<p>Actual &quot;in tune&quot; intervals are about the frequency. When something's in tune, you'll hear overtones. Octaves are the easiest to demonstrate by simply doubling the frequency. If A is 440 hz, then an octave higher is 880 hz. The twelve tones are equally distributed between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-fixed pitch instruments still use just intonation today. Brass quintets, a-capella choral groups, wind ensembles, etc. It's a part of those musicians' education to learn the difference. There's an extra ring to the major chords that you just can't get with a piano.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's quite true. For example a perfect 5th (a C and a G) have a 3:2 ratio, and a perfect 4th has a similar ratio. The increments themselves aren't arbitrary, what is is how many increments we place in a scale, or how where the root note is. If you hear traditional Indian music for example, they're not singing in traditional western scales. But it doesn't sound dissonant.</p>
<p>I can't explain major or minor chords either, but I'm not sure that that's learned either. It's really on the edge of natural reactions to things and learned behavhiors. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What I mean is if you listen to microtonal music, to an ear used to the western tradition of music, it sounds out of tune and just &quot;wrong&quot;, whereas to someone used to that kind of music it sounds perfectly fine. Maybe dissonant was the wrong word to use... Clearly I'm not doing very well at explaining what I mean!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, iirc, the pythagorean tradition sought that all things be described with natural numbers, or small ratios thereof. Now, the octave has a 2:1 ratio. No one disputes this. Since we want each note to be evenly spaced multiplicatively, we scale by the 12th root of 2, so that when you multiply that scaling factor twelve times, you are actually multiplying by 2.</p>
<p>Now, the pythagoreans would want the perfect fifth to have a ratio of 2:3 and a perfect fourth to have a ratio of 3:4. However, if you try to build up an entire scale where the perfect fifth has a ratio of 2:3, you actually run into problems, because no multiple of 3 can be comprised entirely of factors of 2. So (typically) we approximate the ratio of 2:3 and the 12th root of 2 ratio. If you do achieve this 2:3 ratio for perfect fifths, the resulting &quot;octaves&quot; aren't exactly 2:1. Check out Well Tuned Piano by Lamonte Young to get a glimpse into the world of alternate ratios between notes...</p>

<p>Well. . . actually, no, I don't think so. <em>That</em> really is just a function of acoustics, on a physical level. Sure, the fact that we call a particular note &quot;C&quot; or &quot;A&quot; is completely arbitrary. But the <em>relationship</em> between C3 and C4 is <em>not</em> arbitrary: the latter's frequency is almost exactly twice the former's. Regardless of what we happen to have named those frequencies, <em>every</em> musical tradition will recognize that those two notes--or any two notes which are multiples of the same frequency--are related to each other in the same way. So no matter what kind of scale we're using, a single instance of that scale will almost invariably describe a series of ascending tones between </p>
<p>Musical &quot;scales&quot; are <em>somewhat</em> arbitrary, in that they involve choosing how many different notes will be used between any given note and the note with double its frequency. There are any number of different ways of skinning that cat, and even ways of counting intervals. Western music really doesn't make much of quarter-tones. Middle Eastern music does. But while the choice of what notes fit on a particular scale are arbitrary, what scales <em>do</em>--tell you how to get from one note to the note with double its frequency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I understand that and as I said in my comment, I know the intervals between tones are not at all arbitrary and are based on distinct frequency intervals, but the idea of the scale starts <em>here</em> and this note is called middle C etc. was made up by someone at some point. I clearly didn't explain myself very well but I absolutely agree and understand that an &quot;octave&quot; higher is twice the frequency and not just arbitrary, and I understand the circle of fifths etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. I recommend searching on the genesis of the discipline (around the beginning of the 20th century). It's fascinating to study that point in history because european composers were so baffled with exotic music that they evolved our own western music because of it. </p>
<p>Odd thing like the whole tone scale, for instance, were widely popularized by guys like Debussy because of this exposure to foreign music, and even instrumentation-wise things became a lot more interesting when these &quot;studies of the exotic cultures&quot; came to be.</p></div>		</li>
