			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I never said the person becomes hypotensive—that only happens when the body’s normal mechanisms fail to compensate. That said everyone experiences a drop in bp when they stand, this is perfectly normal and only becomes a red flag if it exceeds 20mmhg (varies with age etc). Also the process at work isn’t just the clearing of edema. The vessels are simply dilated which increase their size and occlude airways. The drop in bp not only clears blood but as you said causes vasoconstriction which shrinks the vessels further thus opening the airways. Your points are based on physiological theory but the actual application is a bit different.</p>
