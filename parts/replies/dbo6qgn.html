			<div class="markdown"><p>So, as a guy I didn't know this until my wife's first pregnancy but where the bleeding occurs is really important. I thought it was from tearing of the vagina during childbirth, but that is relatively minor and fairly easy to stop and control. It is the bleeding inside the uterus from where the placenta was attached that there are a large number of vessels that are now open. How the bleeding is stopped is by getting the
Uterus to contract back down to a smaller size. Techniques to do this include the meanest, roughest &quot;massage&quot; I've ever seen.</p>

<p>The next step is bimanual pressure — an obstetrician or midwife puts a fist up the vagina and compresses the uterus between that and a hand on the lower abdomen. Meanwhile, blood samples are taken for an urgent crossmatch, an operating theatre is organised and various drugs given to force the uterus to contract. If that's not working, it's off to theatre for a laparotomy to look for internal tears; wrapping of the uterus to try and make it contract; full suction bottles and blood product transfusions galore ... and if necessary to save a life, a hysterectomy. This is sometimes where it goes wrong — it's tempting to leave the hysterectomy until too late, hoping to preserve the ability to have another child.</p>
<p>Pregnant women bleed like firehoses when they do bleed. We're talking splatter film levels of gore. Not to be taken lightly at all.</p></div>		</li>
