			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain why the Kaapvaal and Pilbara cratons are said to be the oldest pristine cratons, while the oldest rocks are in the Canadian shield which is considered to be from a later period? I assume the key word is &quot;pristine&quot;--like the Canadian shield got messed around with, but still contains small regions of the oldest untouched rocks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found a bit of info.</p>
<p>&quot;The oldest rock formation is, depending on the latest research, either part of the Isua Greenstone Belt, Narryer Gneiss Terrane, Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt, or the Acasta Gneiss (on the Slave craton). The difficulty in assigning the title to one particular block of gneiss is that the gneisses are all extremely deformed, and the oldest rock may be represented by only one streak of minerals in a mylonite, representing a layer of sediment or an old dike. This may be difficult to find or map; hence, the oldest dates yet resolved are as much generated by luck in sampling as by understanding the rocks themselves.</p>
<p>It is thus premature to claim that any of these rocks, or indeed that of other formations of Hadean gneisses, is the oldest formations or rocks on Earth; doubtless, new analyses will continue to change our conceptions of the structure and nature of these ancient continental fragments.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the oldest cratons on Earth include the Kaapvaal craton, the Western Gneiss Terrane of the Yilgarn craton (~2.9 – &gt;3.2 Ga), the Pilbara Craton (~3.4 Ga), and portions of the Canadian Shield (~2.4 – &gt;3.6 Ga). Parts of the poorly studied Dharwar craton in India are greater than 3.0 Ga. The oldest dated rocks of the Baltic Shield are 3.5 Ga old.&quot;</p>
<p>I believe that goes pretty in line with what you said. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your help. It does seem like the gneiss areas being the result of major deformation is the key differentiator. Extrapolating, the two previously-mentioned cratons have, I imagine, not been subject to any significant deformation over time and are thus considered &quot;pristine&quot;, and similar in structure to how they were billions of years ago. Which makes them &quot;older&quot; by a larger number of criteria than we could claim about the Canadian gneiss regions, even if the gneiss may be older if considering only a limited amount of criteria.</p></div>		</li>
