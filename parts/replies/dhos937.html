			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body needs to get rid of the toxins that are expelled through the kidneys. It is able to reclaim some of that water in the kidneys, but not all of it - a little is always needed to carry the toxins away. Thus, it's possible to be dehydrated but still making urine, and after a while your bladder will still fill up. The more dehydrated you get, the less urine you will make, gradually descending further and further into renal failure and death.</p></div>		</li>
