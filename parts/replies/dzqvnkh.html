<p>When the engineering gods at Honda deem something to be &quot;good&quot; it remains in their products for years if not decades. Just take a look at how many models use exactly the same air filters, spark plugs, and oil filters and how that might not change for two decades. It's even more true for their motorcycles. A friend of my has one of those books with parts equivalency numbers. There are significant number of components on even the newest iterations of Honda motorcycles that have been in production and use since the early 1980s. In the 80s and 90s a big chunk of the parts on the new bikes of that era had been in continuous use since the late 60s or early 70s. They just did sensible things like put disc brakes on bikes that were heavy enough to actually warrant them!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really what they should be selling. Don't waste energy developing shitty system in every car. Just build a standardize system for mounting tablet like devices. They did it with radios, but that standard shape was designed for a simple display and a few dials. We need a modern mounting system for modern touch screens.</p>
<p>But those car radio standards where integrated into the industry before modern planned obsolescence. Getting the new nav system is now a selling point of a new car. Fixer-uppers don't exist anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, 99% of the time the dash is exactly the same regardless of model.</p>
<p>Top of the line that has the infotainment system in it is the exact same as the low-end model with no frills, you can buy a separate system and install it and more than likely find apps that do the exact same things (possibly even better) than what comes with the high-end system.</p>
<p>not to mention it's usually cheaper too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a ford dealer like 5 years ago or so and everything was horribly dated. Their corporate site that technicians had to use for accessing service manuals would only run on internet explorer 6 on windows. Our scan tools had to run on Windows xp, or we had some ford scan tools that ran on Windows ce pdas.</p>
<p>However, I thought their wiring diagrams were awesome. They used svg.</p>
<p>My experience was a while ago. I hope they've finally updated some things. I wouldn't be surprised if They still had some weird website that requires some older version of internet explorer to make things still work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The inbuilt navigation in most cars does.</p>
<p>And what sucks on top of that is the outrageous prices they want for map updates. Like... $150 for an annual map update. Bitch, i could buy a brand new, upper end garmin for that price, and it would come with lifetime maps. </p></div>		</li>

Even with cards being available on eBay for a quarter of the price, it was more beneficial IMHO to buy a Garmin unit. Better software, free updates, traffic through my phone's cellular connection, etc. <em>plus</em> it moves from car to car as needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also need to be a lot more resilient than the components in your cheap $20 tablet because they're expected to work in harsher environments. The interior of your car will easily go past 50 degrees Celsius on a hot day -- my iphone mounted on a dash holder will throw a shit fit if it gets too hot whilst my shit head unit won't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might have a lot to do with the battery. Lithium batteries are very sensitive to temperature. But yeah they need to hold up and work well for the lifetime of the car which could easily be 15+ years. The touch screen on my 2005 Acura is pretty awful compared to almost any other touch screen, but it’s still perfectly reliable after 13 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the electronics.  </p>
<p>Consumer grade components tolerate much lower temperature and vibration variances than automotive chips.  That's everything from microprocessors to resistors.  </p>
<p>Building something that's rugged / vibration / shock resistant is much harder than dealing with something that you place carefully on your living room table.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most processors are good to 80-90C for extremely extended durations, the limited thermal envelope of a phone combined with the electronics being in direct sun (not under a dash board) is what will over heat it. </p>
<p>And i think phones are expected to work in harsher environments but they aren't expected to last more than 1-2 years while a car is expected to last at least 10-20 years.</p></div>		</li>
