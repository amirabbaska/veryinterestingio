			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  You can impinge nerves responsible for motor function as well as sensation.  The condition can become permanent or semi-permanent if you repeatedly compress the same nerve.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a disruption of the microcrirculation, the nerves have a blood supply from the vasa nervorum, microscopic vessels in the nerve's myelin sheath (its &quot;insulation&quot;). </p>
<p>Prolonged pressure on a limb, on an area where a relatively superficial nerve passes, leads to compression of these vessels, nerve ischemia and malfunction, producing symptoms like tingling or numbness on a sensory nerve, weakness or paralysis on a motor or both on a mixed nerve.</p>
<p>As soon as the circulation is restored the function normalizes, for very prolonged compression though, or if a person is genetically more susceptible to pressure palsy, the myelin sheath degrades and several weeks pass till the nerve is healed.</p>
<p>EDIT: common pressure/entrapment areas are the wrists for Median nerve, The elbows for Ulnar nerve, knees for Tibial etc. Common activities that cause it is bad desk/keyboard arm position, carpal tunnel syndrome, elbow trauma, bad siting position, working with bent knees ^^^giggity, prolonged cross-legs. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly an answer to your question but very similar.</p>
<p>Local anesthetics in dentistry can cause paresthesia and it can be permanent. Violent &quot;compression&quot; or &quot;dilation/distension&quot; of neurological tissue can cause anything from a segmented arc reflex to a permanent block of the neural pathways that go through the ganglius (gasser) to the trigeminal nerve (Sensory/Motor functions for the mouth and part of the eyes (Maxillary/mandibular/ophtalmic).</p>
<p>For short; What could cause permanent paresthesia? physical trauma, substance build up (For ex: the anesthetic not being properly diseminated), thermal shock, direct necrosis from ischemia , etc.</p>
<p>It's pretty horrifying to realize that almost anything can cause you permanent paralysis, it's best not to think about it and instead just be careful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fell on my face over three weeks ago. The bruising is gone, but theres a hard hematoma on my cheek. Its tingly-numb. If I run my finger across it, it feels like someone is tickling my eyeball.</p>
<p>I read that hematomas can take several weeks to resolve so I have just been putting up with it. Now I am thinking I might be causing permanent damage to my face? It all works...I can blink, smile...sort of...it still hurts...but its just that weird nervy feeling. Am I risking permanent damage? </p></div>		</li>
