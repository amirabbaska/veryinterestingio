			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right idea, but carry it a little farther.  The nut or whatever the hole is in is homogenous metal and has a both a circumference and a diameter.  The expansion is really the inflation of the material along the circumference.  If you expand a circumference of 1 and diameter of .32, by 10%, the circumference is 1.1, giving a diameter of 0.35, a variation of .03.  BUT the outside circumference of the <del>bolt</del> nut is 5, with a diameter of 1.6, then heated becomes circumference of 5.5 and diameter of 1.75, a variation of .15 in diameter.  The body of the nut does not become .12 &quot;thicker&quot;. The expansion of the body of the nut PULLS the ID away from the bolt.</p>
<p>Thought experiment  If you have a large flat circular plate with a small hole in the center and heat only the outside circumference of the plate, what happens to the ID of the hole?</p>
<p>Therefore, the hole will always expand faster than the thing filling the hole as the temperature rises.</p>
<p>Tell that to the wife.</p>

<p>Why doesn't the plate(essentially a donut) expand in all directions, thus &quot;pushing&quot; in towards the center and out away from the center simultaneously? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try and think of the donut as a load of concentric rings, to make the hole smaller you have to make the innermost ring smaller, which is the opposite of expansion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because of the relationship of circumference to diameter.  If you think of the donut as an infinite succession of donut rings, each infitesimally wide, each successively larger ring expands more than the one smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does expand in all directions, but the inner bits don't expand as fast as the whole ring does, so overall they move away from the center.</p></div>		</li>
