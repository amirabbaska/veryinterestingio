<p>Here's a link for the curious about the various roles worker bees perform. It's for children but its a great way of illustrating the idea.</p>
<p>Edit 2: A lot of people seem to be disagreeing over the use of the term &quot;freeloader.&quot; The drones serve the purpose of essentially acting as flying male reproductive organs for the hive. So they are not without a purpose.</p>
<p>However I think &quot;freeloader&quot; applies here. Let me put it in human terms. </p>
<p>Imagine if all human males were taken care of their entire life. Mostly lounging around, having food brought to them, chilling at the bar... Then having never worked a day in their life, they leave sometime in their mid forties, have sex, then die. We would certainly call that person a &quot;freeloader.&quot; </p>
<p>The term &quot;freeloader&quot; will anthropomorphize any concept in biology and in doing so distort the full complexity.      </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's useless putting this in human terms though, because a single human is not equivalent to a single bee. The point of eusociality is that you've translated the 'whole organism' from the cellular to the macro. The better analogy is that drones aren't 'lazy human males' but rather, sperm that come into maturity, are used, and die.</p>
<p>And also, can fly really far. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are technically correct. However it can be useful and/or entertaining to look at things from an anthropomorphized perspective. </p>
<p>For example I really like the book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; - the idea of a gene having the personality trait of selfishness is inherently ridiculous. However its a useful/entertaining way of viewing a complex subject matter.</p>
<p>When you anthropomorphize anything in science you are bound to cut corners and simplify something.</p></div>		</li>
