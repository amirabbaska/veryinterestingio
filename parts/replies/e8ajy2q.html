<p>Escalator needs more power, escalator takes more power. Escalator no long needs more power it takes less power. Escalator maintains. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact. When those rare instances happen when  people slip through the top part of the escalator, the escalator increases power as their body blocks it from moving faster aka adds more weight to the gears, so it increased power more and more. Resulting in a pool of muck of the body being ripped through it eventually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's brutal but an AC 3 phase synchronous motor will tear your arm off and beat you with it and not even slow down. It's tied to the rotation of the rotors in the generation plant and it's extremely hard to stop them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the motor isn't adaptating to the amount of load. It's just that current increases as load increases because that's how electricity works. </p>
<p>Think of it as a garden hose. If you plug the hole, pressure will &quot;build up&quot;. You pluging the hole is the added load, the pressure building up is the current draw increasing.</p>
<p>The analogy is skewed and it doesn't really work like that, but you get the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting! How does the motor know on its own to raise or lower the current to maintain a steady amount of torque? What's keeping the motor's current to torque in equilibrium?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't maintain a steady torque, but it does maintain a mostly steady speed. Load on the motor causes resistance on the turning of the shaft. The resistance causes the speed to drop very slightly. A small drop in shaft speed causes a large increase in current draw. Essentially, 3 phase motors are resistant to speed changes because they are always trying to keep the shaft in sync with the rotating magnetic field, and the further the shaft is pulled away from synchronous speed, the more current is drawn to pull the shaft back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC correctly their design keeps them in sync with the power generators. That's 60 Hz in North America and 50 Hz in Europe and other places. </p>
<p>Regardless, with this design the electric motors will keep going at the same speed until they fry from the overload, rather than slow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Escalators are actually the <em>safest</em> form of transportation. Fewer than 3 deaths annually in the US, almost all due to <em>falls</em>, not entrapment. (falling over the handrail is surprisingly common)</p>
<p>More people die falling down stationary stairs in a typical day. Ironically, the escalator's motion actually make it a lot <em>safer</em> for passengers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the US a faulty escalator is a huge liability, and the financial damage to the owner of one that ate a person in front of horrified onlookers...hoo boy. Hence the attention to safety and maintenance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The escalators that freak me out are the ones that are one long straight run. There’s one at LA County Museum of Art that seems about 35-foot rise. I just think it would’ve awful to fall and tumble down that. Escalator steps are hard and rough.</p></div>		</li>
