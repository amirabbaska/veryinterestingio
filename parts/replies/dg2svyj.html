			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I find it just...really odd that someone would buy an expensive plane ticket and then not show up. Unless some catastrophic emergency happens on the same day of their flight, or something.</p>
<p>All the flights I've ever been on in the past ~8 years, were underbooked if anything. Always plenty of empty seats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to do this just a few months ago. I was at a client site in Abu Dhabi. I was scheduled to leave on a certain date, but the install was taking longer than planned. So, I just called and rescheduled the flight.</p>
<p>This happens <em>all the time</em> with business travelers. Leisure travelers have to reschedule less often, and so don't experience this much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad's a pilot. He says the no-shows happen pretty often. People don't leave enough time to get to the airport, or find out they didn't understand how to get there (happened more in the pre-GPS days), or something else. Personally, he doesn't like it from a philosophical point of view, as he is a fiscal conservative, so to him it's disingenuous. But, at the same time, he say's if they do away with it people would have to be willing to pay more to fly, and as a society we've decided that the best flight is the cheapest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No shows are really common, especially on a plane that seats 300 people. Out of 300. Maybe 1 or 2 of them have recently been injured or taken ill, then you have the guy who went to the wrong airport, the guy who overslept, the lady who is now pregnant and not making the trip and didn't bother cancelling the flight as it was none refundable, the person who had to stay home to go to a funeral, the person who recently got arrested and can't leave the state, the guy who turns up at the airport and his passport is out of date.. the list is endless. Half of those I have experienced or someone in my group has.</p>
<p>On a plane of 300, it can be 10-20 people. Airlines typically overbook by at least 1-2%. I have made about 40 round trips in my life and missed 1</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically, you can thank me for airlines overbooking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's even worse is airlines like United and American won't even let you fly standby anymore without a fee.</p>
<p>I showed up 6 hours early for a flight home because I had the opposite experience as /u/Teekno where my project finished early and the customer cancelled the last day since we were technically done.</p>
<p>I asked American to put me standby on any of the <strong>4</strong> additional flights that were direct flights to the airport I was heading to (just like my flight).<br />
They told me if I didn't pay the $75 &quot;Change Fee&quot; I was not allowed to fly standby, even though tickets on any of those flights were cheaper than what I had paid originally.</p>
<p>I checked again several times before each flight left (with empty seats on every single one of them, because it was the middle of the work day for most people).<br />
Got denied every time.    </p>
<p>Then I boarded my flight at 6:30 and had to laugh as they offered people money to take a bump because they were oversold.</p>
<p>I cancelled my AA Mastercard the next day and have flown American only a few times since then, and only because my company makes me select the cheapest flights if the difference is more than 15%.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but that's cheaper than having unsold seats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're not unsold seats, they're seats that someone bought but didn't show up for. This is a pretty big difference!</p>
<p>Basically the airline would alreadyÂ be better off if passengers don't show up because the plane would weigh less and use less fuel. They're even better off overbooking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a source. But I've seen multiple times that fuel efficiency is high enough that they don't actually save money if someone doesn't fly. More people is more revenue to combat the overall cost of flying. Decreasing one person for the weight does not save money, ie they want a completely full flight. Disclaimer: on large aircraft. Smaller aircraft do not follow this rule. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the person you are replying to meant the airline is better if someone pays for the flight and doesnt show up, cause then they get their money and fuel savings. Obviously they are better off selling seats and having people come than not selling seats and flying around empty...if this wasnt true then the airline would never make money.</p>
<p>On another note, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737#Upgrade_packages" target="_blank">wikipedia article on 737's</a> claims that a 700 pound reduction in weight reduced fuel consumption by 0.5%. If you consider the average weight of a person+luggage this probably is somewhere between 2-3 people. So, 1 person not showing up probably reduces fuel consumption on the order of 0.2%.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.opshots.net/2015/04/aircraft-operating-series-aircraft-operating-expenses/" target="_blank">this</a> a 737 burns about 850 gallons per hour, which is a bit over $4100. 0.2% of this saves about $8 per hour in fuel.</p>
<p>So, as a rough estimate, I'd guess a person not showing up for a flight saves the airline about $8/hr in fuel costs (when flying on a 737). Obviously, compared to the ticket price, this is not all that much. This ignores any possible negative effects that being underweight might cause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No need for disclaimers, removing 200 pounds from any modern airliner absolutely does nothing at all to efficiency. It'd be like removing half a tenth of a pound from your car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former Operations Agent for an airline here: you'd think that less people means saving money, but you'd be wrong. Less people (which often means less bags) means a lighter plane. That screws with the weight and balance of the plane. If enough people don't show up, they have to completely redo the flight plan to either move bags, people, or in drastic cases, possibly removing excess fuel. This keeps the center of gravity stable enough for the plane to take-off and land safely. Ideally, a plane is full of passengers and bags, as this means more money went into the flight and they don't need to do unnecessary work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if the revenue passenger has been rebooked on another flight, the seat they have vacated <em>is</em> unsold.</p>
<p>But you are right, the airlines are better off overbooking, and that's why. An empty seat is just lost revenue.</p></div>		</li>
