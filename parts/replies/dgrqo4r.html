			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an oversimplification which is hotly debated in the field. Since 2015, with the creation of iPS cells, it is clear that any cell is capable of trans-differentiating. However, most human cells don't do it, or do it only to form very related cell types. We don't know why they don't do it. But we know they can.</p></div>		</li>
