			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, there are about 75 million dogs and about half of them are purebred and about half of them are mutts (there are also a smallish number of designer dogs like labradoodles and an even smaller number of dogs that are more correctly classified as “village dogs” which don’t have ancestry from any pure breeds but come from natural, free-breeding dog populations that have following people around ever since dogs first became domesticated).</p>
<p>Dog breeds vary in their level of inbreeding and within a breed, individuals dogs can be more or less inbred. It’s not uncommon for dog breeds to average inbreeding levels above 20% (same as level as a full sibling pairing) and for individuals within some breeds to have inbreeding levels of 40% or more. </p>
<p>For many diseases, it is true that purebreds are at more risk, but for other complex diseases (like cancer and hip dysplasia) it seems like mutts are just as likely to be affected as purebreds, although certain breeds are more or less affected than others and it’s hard to get good data on disease prevalence in dogs. Overall, there is some evidence that mixed breed dogs live longer on average than purebred dogs of similar size, and evidence that within a breed, inbred dogs are not as fit or long-lived. Thus inbreeding does seem to factor into genetic health in dogs to some extent, although I should also point out that occasionally mutts are also quite inbred, so getting a mutt is not guarantee (although it is certainly less likely to be inbred than a purebred).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inbreeding depression is caused when deleterious recessive variants become homozygous due to inbreeding. If a population doesn't have deleterious recessive variants, then inbreeding isn't harmful. Of course natural populations do have these variants, usually in great numbers (but low frequencies) unless an organism is selfing or has otherwise been able to purge them. It is certainly possible that Afghan hounds and Sighthounds have lower genetic loads than other breeds (maybe they had less of a founder bottleneck or maybe they've been bred foremost for health), but I'm not aware of any genetic research that has looked into this. Thanks for the suggestion!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Greyhounds are not profoundly inbred. Where did you see that? I'm curious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you’re aware, there are a few ways to get COO (country of origin) individuals into the Afghan hound population though most do not. It is a more common practice in Finland I believe than anywhere else (or at least, this is where the COO bred dogs seem to be coming from) They do have a higher genetic COI on average from what I understand due to the use of popular sires in the breed and because they experienced a huge boom in popularity in the 60s-70s and then have been steadily declining ever since. They live to an age of about 12 which isn’t too bad for their size 25-27 inches at the shoulder and about 40-70lbs, but I wouldn’t say that they have very few health problems. Salukis, a cousin to the Afghan, have an open stud book and several individuals who have pedigrees with COO individuals within the last 10 generations. I’ve got three salukis and the one with the most complete pedigree goes back completely only 12 generations — that’s not a lot for pedigree dogs. </p></div>		</li>
