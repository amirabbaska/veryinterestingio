			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite true that Apple built their OS as one integrated experience. Though of course it is an integrated experience. macOS is actually unix. At Next, Jobs hired Avie Tevanian, one of the original developers of the Mach kernel. NextStep was close to a version of BSD Unix. The current macOS kernel xnu is a direct descendant of that Mach kernel, and it remains a BSD flavor, albeit well hidden from most users.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FTFY.</p>
<p>I put up with that for a while.  Every version got a little further away from the way I wanted to work, and a little closer to a &quot;media centre&quot; style (in my view.)</p>
<p>I actually forget exactly what the last straw was, about two years ago.  Moved to KDE and it's been great, since they realise their users work in different ways.</p></div>		</li>
