			<div class="markdown"><p>From my research and the answers on askhistorians, pepper wasn't really used as a preservative - it was more expensive than salt and peperine isn't really an effective antimicrobial at the concentrations used as a spice.</p>
<p>Pepper was made popular in roman times - a roman cookbook used it in 80% of recipes. It seems to have gain popularity as a more affordable alternative to long pepper, a similar spice that was popular amongst the nobles. Other anecdotes note that Louis XIV ordered it to be used with salt in his courts in the 1600s - this may have just been his personal tastes or it may have been a desire to be &quot;more Roman&quot; which crops up time and again in European history. Current culinary traditions derive from the noble tastes of the last 400 years or so, so this is likely where the modern tradition comes from, as the parent post notes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pepper was also very very popular as part of Anglo-Saxon medicine. It was used frequently as part of remedies and as a culinary ingredients for the wealthy and aristocratic. Notably the Anglo-Saxon medical texts we have often show strong Mediterranean influence, and the number and variety of spices called for indicate a long standing trade in and use of spices - in particular pepper. It was valuable enough to be mentioned specifically in the Venerable Bede's will (735), and was used heavily in cooking until a movement in French cuisine shunned the use of exotic spices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the myth. The reality is that if you could afford pepper, you could afford meat that hasn't gone off. And people back then did understand the link between eating bad meat and getting ill. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not everywhere is close to a coast to get salt, and salt mines were just as important to getting salt as evopartive methods.  Besides evaporation is time intensive if you do it naturally, or fuel intensive to concentrate it.</p>
<p>Salt wasn't just a spice, it was currency and access to sources was worth to go to war over.  It improves the taste of food as well as preserving it as well as being essential to life.</p>
<p>It's the real world Spice Melange.</p>

<p>Having salt on the table was a sign of wealth.  You had this very expensive mineral/spice that you could show off adding to your food in front of guests.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not the way most people think. It wasn't used as such in Rome, for example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. AF. salarie = OF. salaire, It. salario, Sp., Pg. salario, ad. L. salarium, orig. money allowed to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt, hence, their pay; subst. use of neut. sing. of salarius pertaining to salt, f. sal salt.</p>
