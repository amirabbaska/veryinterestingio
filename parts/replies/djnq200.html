			<div class="markdown"><p>However, when you're in an area with high humidity, less of your sweat can evaporate, so you lose even less heat to the environment. This is why lower temperatures+high humidity can be just as/more uncomfortable (or even dangerous) as a higher-temperature &quot;dry heat.&quot;</p>
<p>For example, compare Phoenix with Houston, or a steam room to a sauna. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you mean a dry sauna (most likely of the ones I've been in were wet). </p>
<p>(Or are wet saunas also low humidity?) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even wet saunas are kind of dry, even if you throw water on the stove to create steam, because the hotter the air is, the greater its' capacity to accept water vapour is. </p>
<p>So if you took a steam room at 40C, with 100% humidity (the air is saturated with water vapour) and heated it to 90C, you'd have maybe 10% humidity, with the exact same amount of water in the air. </p>
<p>If you took a sauna in the 80-100C range anywhere close to the dew point, you'd be causing scalding on anyone who enters. </p></div>		</li>
