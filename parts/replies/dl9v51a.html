			<div class="markdown"><p>I think &quot;change&quot; is what is missing here. Having a well functioning daily routine is safe, but escaping the comfort zone and trying to change things up is what makes me feel alive. A lot of chores can be prevented, by just changing the way you live. There are people, that dont produce any trash, they buy things in their own cans, less clothes and longer time worn reduces the amount of laundry. There are many things that can be optimized, but it sometimes takes a bit to notice them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This would be a great commercial in an episode of Rick and Morty where they're watching interdimensional TV, but it would also be awesome in real life. </p></div>		</li>
