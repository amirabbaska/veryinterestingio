			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the parasite and fish species.</p>
<p>But yes, you can sometimes see degraded fish at time of catch. Lesions and discolorations are the symptoms I've seen.</p>
<p>It's not too uncommon to necessarily dispose of or release a haul because it can be assumed the whole school or aquacommunity in that area is infected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they show small nodules other times you will catch a perfect looking chromer, cut in and find it that it is unfit for saving for meat. I'm referring to Pacific Salmon specifically.</p></div>		</li>
