			<div class="markdown"><p>Not who you were asking, but I don't think the hypothalamus is implicated in Raynuads Disease. In normal thermoregulatory responses, the peripheral NS (e.g. skin, extremities) receives sensory information such as the sensations of heat/cold and relays this information back to the central nervous system (i.e. brain and spinal cord). </p>
<p>Raynauds disease is more related to issues with vasculature and/or peripheral nervous system dysfunction that results in excessive constriction of your blood vessels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm okay so do you know why Raynuads Disease is considered an autoimmune disorder? The immune system doesn't seem to be responsible for the cold response to the extremities to my knowledge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the response some sort of weighted average? Or will blood flow and other responses target specific limbs or even areas of a limb based on local skin temperature gradients? </p>
<p>Does skin temperature affect core temperature regulation and vice versa? </p></div>		</li>
