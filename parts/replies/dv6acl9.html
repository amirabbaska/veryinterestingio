			<div class="markdown"><p>Food and rent will reflect local wages. However, anything that is actively traded on the global market (like Cars, Computers, Video Games, Medicine, etc) will reflect the global cost.</p>
<p>So it's still way better to make American wages, spend 30% on rent, and be able to afford nice things than make Vietnamese wages, spend 30% on rent, and then not be able to afford life saving medicine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not a complete fit, but to generalise, anything your country makes will be equivalently priced to your average wage, so the percentage there is the same in the us. But imports from other countries cost the same price in the original country. So food is much cheaper as it's home grown, but an iphone is expensive because it's still roughly $800. The $800 will be a lot more unreasonable there than it would in the us. I hope that makes sense. This is what I learnt from living in Turkish economy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. You can make a product and ship it to the US for cheaper than paying a US worker to do it here. They are making things for a few dollars a day. Less than $10 a day in some places. If you have a person making $1 an hour and they make 1,000 of a product a day and an American worker makes $15-20 an hour making 500 of something a day(due to lunch/breaks and safety procedures). It makes financial sense to do it in another country. Those 100 jobs are now in China and not the US. Instead of having 50-100 workers you can now have 500-1000 workers and just make a huge volume of stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is it’s still better for the US economy to pay the $30 an hour assuming the quality of the product is equivalent. It’s better to pay 30$ that stays in our economy than pay 1$ that leaves our economy. It doesn’t seem like much but it creates a slow drain that over several decades becomes quite noticeable. Wealthy shareholders don’t like that though because they rather make more money NOW even if it’s worse in the long run. </p>
<p>Also the fact that shipping goods is too cheap because the cost of pollution doesn’t get factored into the price. Carbon taxes would help offset that.</p>
<p>Another thing that’s a personal pet peeve of mine...the incredibly low cost of labor allows stupid products to be sold that people otherwise likely wouldn’t buy. Who really needs a shitty plastic banana slicer??!?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Most minimum wage jobs are service jobs which don't compete with China anyway (you can't offshore a cashier). And engineers end up making more money because the designs get sold all around the world.</p>
<p>It's the factory worker that got the short end of the stick. Between automation and China, they just aren't useful anymore. Note that even Foxconn in China is embracing automation because it's gotten cheaper than Chinese labour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>American</em> shareholders and consumers are the reason. China didn't &quot;steal&quot; the jobs or force the products on Americans. It was outsourcing and buying foreign goods that tipped things. People in the US wants cheaper products.</p>
<p>Mind you, &quot;bringing the jobs back&quot; aren't an especially interesting goal either. The industry is getting more and more automated each year (meaning less and less people needed) and consumers simply aren't willing to pay the added cost. Plus the jobs aren't terribly good, and won't be paid like they were before all of this started up.</p>
<p>Also let's take the example of the smart phone. You can either build it in the far east, assemble it in the US and import almost every single component from abroad (and that's more expensive that importing an already assembled phone), or bring every single part of the manufacturing to the US. The two last ones making the phone impossible to export and the last one very very difficult. There are a lot of individual suppliers involved, and no US companies that could pick up that amount of orders. This goes for pretty much all the electronics that Foxconn/Samsung/LG/etc builds.</p>
<p>I think the whole discussion is skewed as what is important is the ratio of import/export. The US also exports <em>a lot</em> of products (physical and intangible). If we instead focused on the export part of the equation and tried expanding that we can create more, and better, jobs in the US. The success of the US in the past has come from exporting world leading goods and services.</p>
<p>Import tariffs and the likes will basically tank US exports and export deals. Nobody wants to buy American weapon systems if they can't export back to the US. These are massive and important deals between countries. BRIC and Europe would happily replace the US' exports. Plus the rest of the world would up their import tariffs from the US to where it would be too expensive to buy Made in USA, leading to a significant loss of American jobs, far more so than building phones and plastic toys could make up for.</p></div>		</li>
