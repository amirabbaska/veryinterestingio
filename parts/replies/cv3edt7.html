			<div class="markdown"><p>This is Becca:  We used an Artec handheld 3D scanner.  It looks like a handheld electric mixer without the beaters.  It creates incredible 3D images with extremely high accuracy.  We placed numbered markers around the cave.  Each time we took a scan, we included a marker in the sweep.  Back on the surface, Wits PhD student Ashley Kruger was able to stitch the scans together using the markers as reference points.<br />
Typical spatial recordation techniques we use on the surface in archaeology- total stations, for example- would not fit into the cave nor would there be enough space for them to work properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is Becca- It's true that most fossils up to now in South Africa have been found encased in a much more solid matrix or breccia.  In the Dinaledi Chamber, the sediment was compact but not solid.  The geologists describe the sediment as mix of  fine-grained sediment and unconsolidated mudstone.  (Here's the article: <a href="http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e09561" target="_blank">http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e09561</a>)  What that meant for us doing excavation was using toothpicks and paintbrushed to move sediment away from the fossils.  By toothpicks, I mean actual wooden toothpicks you'd buy at the grocery store not a fancy piece of technology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I love toothpicks because they are just the right strength. They are stronger than sediment and (most) clay, but they will break before bone does. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the amazing team of women, but use of fine wooden tools like such in archaeology is common because it allows you to move very little and very localized amounts of sediment/strata w/e it may be and wood is much easier on organic material such as bone (compared to metals).  We used chopsticks to exhume century old remains from a cemetery this year, plus the cave they were in was REALLY tiny (lol).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With respect to dating, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/09/why-dont-we-know-the-age-of-the-new-human-ancestor-homo-naledi/405148/" target="_blank">Ed Yong's (second rising star) piece in the atlantic has a rundown of the issue</a></p>
<ul>
<li>it's most likely out of range for carbon dating</li>
<li>there's little chance of finding DNA because wet and warm cave</li>
<li>electron spin resonance requires knowing the environmental radiation levels which is &quot;sort of nightmarish&quot; in that case</li>
<li>almost nothing else in the cave (a bird and some rodents)</li>
<li>cave =&gt; no ash deposits from volcano eruption =&gt; no Kâ€“Ar dating</li>
<li>bones not in breccia, surrounding flowstones may not be good indicators, team doesn't know if underlying layers have flowstones</li>
<li>paleomagnetic dating is laborious and long work</li>
</ul>
<p>So the last two and DNA are possible but DNA is very unlikely and the others are going to be long and tedious work, and may not be very reliable considering how little cross-checking will be possible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I just spent longer than I'd like to admit looking up what I thought was a dating technique I had never heard of.</p>
<p>Given how you phrased it, your opening sentence appears to refer to a technique called WRT dating.</p>
<p>Can I suggest you change that to &quot;with respect to,&quot; for those of us who are in this field, but who don't keep up with the proliferation of 3-letter abbreviations that seem to be popular these days?</p></div>		</li>
