			<div class="markdown"><p>So does gravity, buildings are already resisting force vertically, an extra vertical force isn't really different than just temporarily increasing the weight of the building, so unless it were already stressed to its breaking point by load, accelerating up and down won't be a large problem.</p>
<p>Plus, vertically, you can just put a post down to the ground to hold it up, it's extremely easy to resist vertical forces, because you are just pushing straight up and down.</p>
<p>Stand a pen on end, and push down on it (hold the bottom so it won't slide around), it will resist a large amount of force quite easily, high compressive strength means it takes a large load to break it.  Push sideways, and it just falls over, though, because there's nothing there to resist it.</p>
<p>Tape two pens together and tape them to the table to make a triangle standing up, though, and suddenly they resist a lot more force (in one lateral axis) because you've transferred the lateral force down to the table.  This is a diagonal brace, one method of resisting lateral force.  Make two diagonal braces at 90 degrees to each other, and you can resist force from any lateral angle.</p>
<p>Highrises and other very large structures start to get into more complicated dampening and vibration / harmonics considerations, as well.  You don't want the building to oscillate at the same frequency, or a sympathetic frequency, because then the earthquake will keep adding more and more energy to the building's lateral momentum (like a pendulum). But here again, in the vertical load itself is pretty easy to resist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really cool explanation.  Would the two diagonal braces at 90 degrees be able to withstand the force as easily if it came from a non braced direction.  I understand that the force will transfer but is it more suceptible to buckling?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vertical acceleration actually implies two things - a short term increase in the compression force acting on the building, and opposite-but-equal decreases. The decreases are a problem because bricks are really bad in tension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can...That's why the 6.3mag quake that occured underneath the city of Christchurch was so damaging...Not only was the force of the quake 1.8g (twice the force of gravity) but it was bouncing up and down to the point where people's feet actually lifted of the ground. </p></div>		</li>

<p>More detail:
Low rise wood buildings: structural plywood.
Specifically, over enough area, on walls in both cardinal axes.
Also, sufficient bracing and anchors to foundation and floor framing.</p>
<p>Concrete/block: reinforced shear walls, also of enough area, with enough steel, grouted solid, in both Cardinal axes. </p>
<p>Steel: Moment connections and/or frame bracing</p>
<p>High rise: mass tuned dampers, foundation rollers, lots of math and additional safety factors on horizontal load calcs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>shear walls and cross bracing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually the more correct answer in this thread.</p>
<p>Structural engineer here (it sounds like u/cardboard_heart may be an engineer as well). </p>
<p>99% of buildings don't have tuned massed dampeners. So long story short, walls are used to resist lateral movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/moZg5dCCGuI?t=2m39s" target="_blank">Structures without any sort of wall system are likely going to fail.</a></p></div>		</li>
