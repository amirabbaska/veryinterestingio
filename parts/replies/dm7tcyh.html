			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a large flood 20 years ago when I was a kid.  It was warm and the water only got waist high, so we went around moving things higher to save it.  You could feel a mild tingle.  It was stronger in some rooms.  My neighbors house was the same.  Apparently it never occured to anyone to flip the circuit breaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying only &quot;dirty&quot; water is a conductor is a bit misleading. Any water with electrolytes will conduct, that includes the fresh clean drinking water from your tap. In order for water to be an insulator it has to be next-level clean, like super pure distilled or lab grade stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt water is not a consideration for whether a hot tub is gas or electrically heated.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ions even in &quot;fresh&quot; water hot tubs - due to the sanitizers and the breakdown byproducts - that the conductivity is nearly as high as seawater. Plenty deadly should a fault occur, and current need to travel far through the water to sufficiently drain potential to ground. Additionally, the heater is not the only electrical device inline with the water system.</p>
<p>What protects the occupants of a hot tub from electrocution in the event of fault or insulation failure is GFCI protection and adequate grounding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But usually the main relay is in the basement and the brrakers are like 0.5m high up from the floor so in a flood they most likely will get tripped, or are they somewhere else in the usa?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A standard circuit breaker is not that sensitive. While dirty water is conductive enough to kill you (think hair drier in bath) it's not conductive enough to actually trip the breaker. Breakers are designed to prevent fires, not stop you from being electrocuted. That's why outlets near sinks and baths must be GFCI protected. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there is one thing that should break the circuit immediately and that is Residual-current device. Or you dont use those?</p>
<p>Once 1mA is missing in the circuit this device breaks it. It compares current in and current out, if you short it somewhere which is not outlet this current is missing in the residual-current device and it breaks the circuit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not likely, water isn't a great conductor.</p>
<p>Assuming 110V supply and a 15A breaker you'd need a load of 7 ohms to trip it.</p>
<p>Assuming the murky water has a resistivity of 1 ohm meter, the surface area of each metal contact in a power outlet is 100mm2, and a 5mm gap between contacts, that comes out at a 50 ohm load for one outlet. Even if there were 6 outlets wired to that breaker the load would be 8 ohms, still not enough to trip the breaker.</p>
<p>These are very generous values too, in practice you'd likely be miles away from tripping the breaker.</p>
<p>This is why electricity is so dangerous around water - you can drop an extension cord in a bath and electrocute yourself and it'll never trip the breaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For all intents and purposes, any electrical underground can be considered submerged at all times. It's considered a wet location by Code, and underground conduits always fill with water anyway, so they have to be blown out to pull wire through, and you know they'll fill up again. </p></div>		</li>
