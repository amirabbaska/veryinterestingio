			<div class="markdown"><p>They had no antibiotics, and couldn't kill syphilis, malaria gave you a severe fever that killed syphilis, and they could cure malaria with tonic water (this is where the drink, gin and tonic comes from).</p>
<p>So the solution to cure syphilis was to give you malaria, and once the fever gets going, give you tonic water (really a few gin and tonics). You would be cured of both diseases. Tonic water was a whole lot stronger than what we get from the store today.</p>
<p>Similar to evicting someone by lighting the house on fire and then putting it out. It works, and you know how to put the fire out, you didn't know of other methods to evict the person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If he really that evaluation, it's a progressive risk-benefit assessment for a drug. A drug is essentially anything that corrects, modifies or restores a biological function (loosely drawn from Italian/EU legislation), treating malaria inoculation as a drug the most recurring side effect was.. well, you get malaria but treat syphilis. I honestly think that's brilliant.</p></div>		</li>
