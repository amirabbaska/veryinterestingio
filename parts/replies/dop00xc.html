			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: Intel notably used to develop new CPUs in a cycle they referred to as &quot;Tick-tock&quot;. On each Tick, they would take the previous CPU design and shrink the components, so they gained speed by putting more parts on a chip. On each Tock, they would debut a new microarchitecture (making the chip smarter with a brand-new design). That way, they could continue to work on developing smaller components during the Tock cycles and a new design during the Tick cycles.</p>
<p>They've now given this up (they couldn't keep up anymore) in favor of a three-step process where Tock gets split into &quot;making a new design&quot; and &quot;tweaking the last design to perfect it&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a four-step process, at least: Process-Architecture-Optimisation-Optimisation now. So Tick-Tock-Stopgap-Stopgap until their 10nm yields stop being abysmal.</p>
<p>Intel have four different CPU &quot;architectures&quot; whose primary differences are that they're fabbed in different interations of the same 14nm node:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadwell (14nm)</li>
<li>Skylake (14nm)</li>
<li>Kaby Lake (&quot;14nm+&quot;)</li>
<li>Coffee Lake (&quot;14nm++&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: five if you count &quot;Kaby Lake Refresh&quot; on laptops.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't follow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more precise, the smaller the CPU's architecture is, the smaller each transistor is, and the more of them can fit into the same area.  It is kind of like the difference between drawing with a crayon and a mechanical pencil.</p>
<p>The less room the transistors take up, the less time and power it takes for electrical signals to travel through the CPU.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also decreases the distance between them, speeding up the communication. They are reaching some pretty hard limits doing this though.</p></div>		</li>
