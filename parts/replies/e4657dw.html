			<div class="markdown"><p>The push to switch to chip cards, which in my country was a mandatory requirement with mag strips being made non-operational 15 years ago :)</p>
<p>Its all about contactless now, which is accepted everywhere. That way they cant skim your chip.</p>
<p>You also can't get on a bus in London without a contactless debit card, cash hasn't been accepted for a few years now.</p>
<p>The CVV2 is still very much in use for online purchases but it's only step 1 of the security. You also have to enter your Mastercard/Visa verification password.</p>
<p>Two types of security which aren't great on their own, but put together are much better.</p>
<p>Additionally the chip cards can come with a rolling pin chip reader, which gives a different code with each use, which is the most secure way, and is the 3rd step verification for card use.</p></div>		</li>
