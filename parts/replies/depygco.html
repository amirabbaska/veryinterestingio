			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I hadn't heard of social liberalism before.</p>
<p>Couldn't you say that it would be possible to get to socialism through the principle of positive liberty (or something like it)? From a negative liberty standpoint, no one fights for anyone's right to own other people (slavery, outlawed through government). But it seems like there could be a split on someone's right to rent other people (wage/salary capitalism, still allowed by government). So a positive liberty stance for socialism could be: 'everyone has the right to not be forced to rent themselves out in order to live'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, precisely. In addition to what you've (correctly) said, let me just copy and paste something I wrote in another comment:</p>
<p>If you want, you can consider the historical progression and how each built upon the ideology before it (it's worth remembering that each one was considered radical in its time, regardless of how accepted they might be today!):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classical liberalism, in a time of monarchs and feudal lords, believed that the government should exist only to protect its citizens from violence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social liberalism agreed with the upholding of liberty that classical liberalism espoused, but noted that people could be constrained from fulfilling their will through subtle factors or factors beyond their control - wealth, discrimination, etc. This is summed up in that immortal satirical phrase 'rich and poor man are equally free, in that it is illegal for either to steal bread or sleep under bridges'. </p>
</li>
<li>'Socialism' agrees with social liberalism that liberty is Good, and that constraints which prevent people from fulfilling their goals also need to be addressed, but adds that the socioeconomic system of 'capitalism' (being deliberately vague due to the huge ground both terms cover) itself is a constraint which needs to be addressed.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not entirely true though. John Locke wrote about the tyranny of government and how true liberty was not being fucked with by those in power. Thats why libertarians see classic liberalism ala john locke as the starting point for their ideology. Ive not heard of &quot;negative liberty&quot; so perhaps im missing something but that seems like the opposite of liberty and closer to authoritarianism. Happy to be educated though!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You conflated renting yourself out with working at all. I think the core of an anti-capitalist view is that people selling their <em>time</em> to an employer (who gets all the benefits of the labor during that time) is the main exploitative part. So just an example, if wage/salary compensation were made illegal, maybe you could still bring in 'employees' to your business, but they are co-owners getting a share of the revenue (co-op model).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think private business would have to move to various co-op models (rather than paying employees for their time, you bring them in as co-owners). Maybe people could still earn a salary/wage working for non-profit firms or government. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if you would still call a system capitalist if profit no longer comes from paying people a fixed amount for their time and trying to get more value out of them during that time. You can certainly still have money, markets, private firms, etc. You can enact UBI if it looks like good policy, but that seems independent from this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>axis theories of political ideology are hack because ideology does not lie along a neat spectrum.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say that, I would say they are limited in their utility...their key value lies in being able to paint a quick and semi-accurate picture of a given ideology. It's especially useful with Americans because they only understand 2 of the 31 flavors (and they don't even understand those 2 properly). Like for example, if someone asked me to describe what a Libertarian is in the U.S. the Liberal/Conservative part holds up pretty well...but when you get to Progressive vs Regressive they're not really either...purely in economic terms probably regressive but otherwise not really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I think it hurts 'progress' simply because it suggests that there is some qualitative difference between state coercion and private/institutional coercion. A homeless guy doesn't give a shit if he's homeless because the state kicked him out of his house for being an Undesirable or because he can't find a job, right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, I'm not following...are you referring to Libertarianism specifically here? I always viewed it more as a laissez-faire hands off approach rather than private/institutional coercion. It's a lot more 'every man for himself' than anything we've seen in our lifetime, that's for sure and in terms of the advancement of the human race I would view that as regressive. I think you need a balance, bad luck shouldn't ruin people and render them homeless and without hope, that's a recipe for disaster. There needs to be some system to give you a chance to recover...I just don't think everyone gets infinite lives in this game which is basically how it works now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya. Your understanding of negative and positive liberty are completely wrong.</p>
<p>Short version</p>
<p>negative liberty
-concerned with what the state constrains</p>
<p>positive liberty
-concerned with what the state allows</p>
<p>The &quot;freedom to fuck people over without constraints&quot; only applies to the concept of negative liberty in the same sense that the &quot;freedom to be able to fuck people over under approved circumstances&quot; maps to the concept of positive liberty.</p>
<p>Both could be viewed as potential drawback end-results of these core understandings, but neither <em>is</em> the core understanding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you clarify something for me?  When I have heard these explained in the past, they seemed more rooted in sentence structure. </p>
<p>The example I have heard is: </p>
<p>Tom has the right NOT to be murdered (negative)</p>
<p>Therefore Joe doesn't have the right to murder Tom, (which would be a positive liberty)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Negative liberty deals with prohibitions. Positive with privileges.</p>
<p>When we're talking about positive and negative &quot;liberty,&quot; we're talking about the relationship between an individual (or sometimes group) and the state, not the social contract between two individuals (which, for me, muddies the first example).</p>
<p>Tom is not prohibited from shooting a burglar. (negative)</p>
<p>Tom is allowed to shoot a burglar. (positive)</p>
<p>These viewpoints can lead to different priorities, but they're really just a way of evaluating the relationship between the state and the body politic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how my professor explained the differences: (paraphrased)</p>
<p>Negative liberty is when you have the ability to do something if no actions are taken upon you to prevent it from happening. Example: Freedom of speech, where as long as you are not censored, you can keep saying what you want. (Note: social repercussion is not synonymous with censorship)</p>
<p>Positive liberty is when without some action happening, you are unable to do it. Example: The right to free healthcare; without the government providing you with it, you will not receive it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're entirely right, but again, I specifically mentioned that those were heuristics (mental rules of thumb), and hence do not map perfectly onto reality.</p></div>		</li>
