			<div class="markdown"><p>A key part that was left out in this explanation is the role of the keel. Yes, as mentioned, the sail acts like a wing and generates lift. However a large portion of this force acts horizontally across the beam. The keel of a sailboat uses the force of the water to push horizontally in the other direction, leaving the remaining force in the forward line. Think of squishing an apple seed, with one finger being the sail force, and the other being the keel force: the sideways forces will balance and the remaining force will cause the seed to shoot forwards!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find this is actually easier to describe with a kite and bike than with a sail and keel: it's easier to picture a bike's wheels digging into sand, than to picture the keel of a boat in water.</p>
<p>Imagine you're on a beach, on a bicycle and you have a big kite, and it's pulling you downwind. If you point the bike towards the kite, the kite pulls you along. Intuitive enough</p>
<p>Now imagine you turn the bike 45 degrees. Because of the way your bike's tyres digs into the sand, the bike resists being pulled directly down wind, so instead you're pulled along at 45 degrees from the wind direction, even though the kite is still directly down wind. A boat's keel works in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>But wait, that kite doesn't have to be exactly down wind does it? A kite can fly nearly 90 degrees from the wind. Let's say we put it 80 degrees from the wind and point the bike directly at it... we'll travel at 80 degrees, right? Straight at the kite, because it can still only pull us directly towards it.</p>
<p>And then as the final step, we just combine these two things - the kite is at 80 degrees from the wind, and the bike is an extra 45 degrees from the kite... suddenly we're moving at 125 degrees from the wind direction: we're actually riding towards the wind, because of the way we've redirect the force from the wind</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation, but it leaves out that there needs to be a foil in the water (keel, daggerboard, centerboard, leeboard etc) that converts the &quot;leeway&quot; (sideways motion of the boat) into forward motion.  This is why even catamarans need some kind of keel or daggerboard (old Hobies are the exception, in which case the hull shape itself provides the lift)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thank you for pointing this out. Without the keel, the sail will push the boat sideways. Even with the keel, you will get some sideways slip. Fun fact - a 22 foot sailboat has a six foot tall, lead or cast iron, 900 pound keel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of these are even retractable so that when the wind is behind you and you are running a spinnaker thus no longer concerned about slip, you retract the keel to minimize drag. </p>
<p>This also means that someone has to winch said 900lb keel up by hand as fast as they can... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this post. It explains the science behind it in a way that shows great knowledge in physics but glosses over the intuitive ELI5 way of explaining it which is the rudder counteracts the motion of the wind and sail into the direction you want. Difference between a layman and an expert.</p></div>		</li>
