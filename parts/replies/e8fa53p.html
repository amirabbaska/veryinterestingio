			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there is any known timeline to getting people on Mars. NASA will sometimes give out dates, but any date that would be in a different presidential administration is not realistic. SpaceX has its own numbers, but they are consistently over optimistic. The first human on Mars will happen when the technological challenges have been solved, which at current funding rates, could be in the next decade, and when the financial and political will decide that it is worth the current risks.</p>

<p>My hope is that the first landing is the first colony. The travel mechanics to Mars means that people would stay either a few weeks or a year and a half before returning. Given the cost and time to get there, the longer trip is preferred by many, especially the scientists who want to explore. To survive that long, you would need a decent size base that would make the start of a colony as long as the missions continue.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Providing the technology for that step is my dream. I am working hard on in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) with the organization <a href="https://Madeofmars.com" target="_blank">Made of Mars</a>, to learn to build from the materials on Mars. Once we learn to build locally in space, the path to sustainable growth beyond Earth becomes much cheaper and easier.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re curious about timelines, there was a recent report written by industry &amp; NASA folks: <a href="https://www.exploremars.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AM-V-Report_Design_v2.pdf" target="_blank">the AM5 report</a> </p>
<p>They broke down a couple different schemes for Mars missions: flags and footprints style, a sometimes-occupied research station (like some Antarctic research based), and a permanent settlement architecture. If you want to read up on the differences between the different mission plans, this would be a good bet. </p>
<p>As was pointed out, these things change with administrations. That said, congress passed legislation mandating human presence in the Mars System before the end of the 2030’s. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it would be. It is up to the explorers if that is a risk worth taking. </p>
