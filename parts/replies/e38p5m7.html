<p>You'll note that its primarily the females that do most of the hunting, and solitary males have a very difficult life.     The far larger and heavier males can run fast, but they can't change direction as quickly as the females in a pursuit chase, and even in ambush there's always a little bit of pursuit, and from a thermodynamic standpoint, we also know that the larger males are going to feel a lot hotter with that far greater internal volume to surface area ratio and so will need to rest more in the hottest parts of the day than the females.</p>
<p>So while it is advantageous that the males be as large and strong as possible in order to defeat other males and protect the kills from other scavengers like hyenas, it is advantageous that the females be more nimble and &quot;cheetah like&quot; in order to catch the prey in the first place.</p>
<p>So because the males and females are combining preference for larger and preference for smaller as a mix, you end up with at some point a reasonably static ideal size compromise, but with the males biased to be around 150lbs larger to fulfill biological gender roles.</p></div>		</li>
