			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it doesn’t matter at all. The loans are just accounting trickery because half of them come from the issuer of the currency (federal government) so it’s effectively printed money.</p>
<p>Treasury bonds are needed as an investment tool to reduce the need for actual cash to be changing hands. For example, apple’s cash isn’t cash but some arrangement of US bonds, german bonds, and uk bonds.</p>
<p>Now, if you don’t control the issuance of currency yourself, and your debt is in a currency you don’t control, <em>then</em> your debt matters. For example: any country that uses the Euro as its currency is effectively still on the gold standard as far as what they can individually do to deal with government debt, because they can’t set monetary policy.</p>
<p>So, countries like Greece get screwed, but the US and UK, being strong economies and controlling their own currencies that are also world reserve currencies, don’t issue any debt not in their own currency. The only conceivable way for them to go bankrupt is if the government decides not to pay, because they can’t actually run out of money.</p>
<p>Subgovernments though (states for example) still operate just like they did on the gold standard though, since they don’t control the issuance of the currency their debt is denominated in.</p></div>		</li>
