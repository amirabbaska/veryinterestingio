			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking that 100% absolute humidity would be pure water vapor, it's still going to be in a gas state of matter. Just because there's no other air around doesn't mean it immediately turns to liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mistaken, simply because &quot;100% absolute humidity&quot; is nonsensical. Absolute humidity is measured in gr. per m^3 (or some other units of mass per unit volume).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Only relative humidity is a percentage. Absolute humidity is an actual measurement of how much water is in the air. No percentages involved. It's like having a cup and saying I have one liter of water, instead of saying my cup has some percent of the maximum amount it can hold.</p></div>		</li>
