			<div class="markdown"><p>I have two-ish arguments for this.</p>
<p>A square is an easier shape to form if you have multiple ranks of infantry. In the case of circles, each concentric ring would have either tighter-packed soldiers or less soldiers in it - corralling infantry to form an evenly-spaced circle would be a nightmare without a few minutes to work it out.</p>
<p>Speaking somewhat pragmatically, the soldiers of the time would have been very well-drilled in forming and fighting in ranks, so asking them to calculate an optimal angle for a circular rank (or even a higher-sided geometric shape like a pentagon etc.) that isn't too loose or too tight in the middle of battle while shot is zooming over their head is a bit of a big ask. </p>
<p>It is simpler to form four nice, straight lines with right angles between them and let the soldiers fight as they're used to.</p>
<p>Nowadays, circles in defensive infantry formations are very much <em>de rigueur</em> as soldiers are no longer expected or trained to fight in ranks and the emphasis of combat has changed to favour shapes that don't have blind spots and have equal distribution of firepower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add to this that they used musket firing lines and a straight line will have it much easier to get a synchronized barrage of shots off because you know where it starts and ends as well as a firing signal given at either side will be seen by all men in the line, and all men will be able to shoot in the same direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A key component of the square is that it is quick to get into and out of formation. If you stay in a square formation for extended periods of time, you're asking to be slaughtered by artillery or enemy infantry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a square presents a unified front, with a dozen men wide and four men deep all able to engage a singular target.  With only single shot muskets, density of fire would be important.  </p>
<p>In a circle, you have fewer soldiers able to engage en-masse at a single target.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some, and sometimes did use circles. I think this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiltron" target="_blank">Schiltron</a> formation would qualify. I only heard about this from one of Total war games series.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Schiltron (circle formation) is a real formation, and it was used for a long period of time throughout history in many cultures in many forms.  The issues with the formation are that they are very susceptible to any form of ranged fire (pistols, cannons, rifles, mortars, and anything else), did not allow for the infantry to use ranked fire, and gave soldiers no room to reload their muzzleloading firearms.  </p>
<p>Infantry squares pretty much fixed all of these problems except for mortar shells and massed small arms fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably very hard to form 500-1000 men into a perfect circle on uneven ground, in combat, back in the day when all you could do was shout commands and jostle the men about.</p>
<p>Also, squares were supposed to be able to move (albeit slowly), which would be tough with a circle. Walking backwards or sideways is difficult enough. Walking 57 degrees to your rear left is probably not any easier.</p>
<p>And finally, it's not about what is best. Just what is good enough. Squares very, very rarely broke. And when they did, not in a way that circles would not.</p></div>		</li>
