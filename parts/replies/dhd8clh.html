			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your response. When I've seen beams in diagrams the fact that the speed can be in the realm of 10^7 or 10^8 isn't mentioned so it makes it easy for my brain to assume a speed similar to what I experience in everyday life and hence expect some kind of curvature due to gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming no initial velocity toward Earth, the distance traveled in that direction due to acceleration can be represented as 0.5at^2, where a is the acceleration and t is time in seconds.  For gravity, a~=10 m/s^2.  For the beam to drop a noticable distance, say, 10 cm (0.1 m) would take ~0.1 seconds.  Well that's not that long! </p>
<p>But how far would those electrons have traveled in that time?  Assuming an initial velocity near 10^8 m/s, that means those electrons have traveled 10,000,000 meters, or 10,000 km, or around 1/4th the circumference of the Earth.  This is why any gravitational force is nearly negligible in a laboratory experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way to think about it: over the distance of 100m (about one football field length or a very large laboratory setting), the pulse would deviate by around one ten-millionth of the width of a human hair.</p>
<p>In a word: impossible.  Even if you could measure that accurately, I don't know how you constrain an election beam to such a precise angle or account for the other stronger forces being exerted on the elections over that distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So lets say you fired an electron horizontally and at that exact moment you drop a marble from the same height. Ignoring air resistance, and assuming infinite horizontal distance for the electron to travel, it would hit the ground at the same time as the marble? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well technically, the marble has more mass than the electron, which means on an impossibly small scale, the marble's own gravitational field will simultaneously pull on the earth more than the electron's own gravitational field. And will result in the marble making contact with the earth's surface first.</p></div>		</li>
