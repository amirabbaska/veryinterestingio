			<div class="markdown"><p>Very small note. Nuclear explosions need to be super critical to go off. If the pile is critical it will run away and melt down. Both are real bad for anyone in the near vicinity, but the super critical requirement is why fission bombs need all that high explosive to compress the mass fast enough to pass through critical into super critical.</p>
<p>I'm sourcing this info from 'The Making of the Atomic Bomb' by Richard Rhodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, they have to be in a state called &quot;prompt-supercritical&quot; to go off, which is why the explosive is necessary.
Supercritical reactions are the ones that run away and melt down.
Critical reactions mean they are &quot;stable&quot; (the amount of energy they are producing doesn't change with respect to time). Otherwise you are correct.  </p>
<p>Making of the atomic bomb is a great book btw!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People sometimes freak out when you talk about reactors going supercritical, but they have to during startup or you won't get very many fission reactions to generate power. The terms make sense, but unfortunately sci-fi has confused people on the context. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So Stable = radioactive but not doing much</p>
<p>Critical = reactors during operation</p>
<p>Super critical = reactor start up and eventual meltdown</p>
<p>Prompt Super Critical = Boom.</p>
<p>Correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Critical/supercritical is based on the thermal neutrons being given off by each generation of fission that if the past and present amount of neutrons are equal (k=1) (after being moderated by boron doped water and graphite rods) you get a nice sustaining chain reaction. <a href="http://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/reactor-physics/nuclear-fission-chain-reaction/reactor-criticality/supercritical-reactor/" target="_blank">http://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/reactor-physics/nuclear-fission-chain-reaction/reactor-criticality/supercritical-reactor/</a> and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass</a> are two good descriptions of &quot;critical mass&quot;. And FYI it isnt just mass alone but the shape of the mass and how they are reflecting neutrons that makes things go boom,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's classified, but as far as the public information goes. The smallest reliable nuclear explosive we have is the fission package used in the US &quot;special atomic demolition munition&quot; and &quot;Davey crokett&quot; nuclear recoilless rifle.</p>
<p>Both however are &quot;no longer in service&quot;...</p>
<p>But they are essentially 55 - 200lb man portable briefcase nukes.</p>
<p>Both of the above devices has Wikipedia page that could be of interest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a quote in the book 'One Point Safe' from a military guy (I think, been a while since I read it) who claims he was at a demonstration of the Davy Crockett warhead when a scientist who worked on it said they could go smaller, and offered a nuclear grenade. There are no further details and I have idea how viable such a thing would be but it's amazing that someone was even willing to seriously consider it.</p>
<p>The same book also drops a terrifying snippet about the Russian version of the demo nuke - they carried out a stock check and found significantly fewer suitcase bombs in their stores than expected. Hopefully it was just a case of poor record keeping.   </p></div>		</li>
