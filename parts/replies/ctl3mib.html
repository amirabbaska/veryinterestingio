			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, as someone with the surname Smith I wonder how many people in America are actually genetically related to me if we were to trace our names back to the 1200's. Considering the exponential growth of how many great^x grandparents we have, the lines might get blurred real fast though.</p>
<p>Edit: Posted this in a comment below but I think it deserves to be here too.</p>
<p>I just did some back of the envelope math to figure out how many separate people from the 1200s (if you don't include any form of inbreeding) and it looks like my genes could be from 2048 separate people.
I took the number of years between my birth decade and 1200 ad, divided that by 70 years / generation and got 11 generations, and then plugged that into 2n where n is the number of generations, which resulted in 2048 unique sets of people who contributed to who I am today. That could be a shit ton of Smiths!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Guys I said back of the envelope math, I did it in like a minute before driving to work. Thanks for correcting me though. TIL our ancestors were a horney bunch! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly all of them. And that's independent of your surname.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As for a person with the name of Smith, as I stated before, people have throughout the past, shortened their surnames.  You could be of any version of a Smith.  It was also the most common type of work, being a smith of some kind.  Very unlikely you'll be related to any Smith you'll randomly meet in terms of direct family ties</p></div>		</li>

<p>Human's are the only species on this planet who's genes have so little variations. We're 99.8% identical. While most species can vary from 92-97%</p>

<p>This is not correct. See Figure 1 from this paper:</p>
<p><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001388" target="_blank">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001388</a></p>
<p>Humans are indeed on the low end of the spectrum, but there are certainly plenty of species which are less diverse than we are, and most species fall in the range of 0.1% to 1% diversity (i.e. 99% to 99.9% identical).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It wasn't until the the early 1200's, that England and few other European countries forced their populations to adopt last names</p>

<p>I don't know how accurately these dates are known, but etymonline dates the use of the words &quot;orange&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; only from the 1300's. So the fact that these weren't even words when surnames started to be used might have something to with why nobody has those words as surnames. </p>
<p>Red, on the other hand, I've got no idea about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any name that ends with &quot;son&quot; is most likely the result of another form of last names, common in the nordic countries, where the child would be given a second name after the father. So essentially, someone named Dickens had a son, and that became the surname for the line when they switched to the permanent last-name style. (The 'e'-&gt;'i' thing just happens sometimes over decades.)</p></div>		</li>
