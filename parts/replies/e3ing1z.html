			<div class="markdown"><p>I was able to see my results using both ancestry and 23andme and it was pretty cool. My basic makeup was relatively the same, but the percentages were wildly different, so I very much agree that it's more reliable in finding more about your background but not about the exact percent makeup </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if anyone has already mentioned this but I figured I'd share it just in case - the differences in percentages would like be due to variations in the data-sets your sample is compared to.</p>
<p>Ita like getting two different groups of 10,000 people and asking them the same questions: the overall results might be statistically similar, but the exact responses are not the same for each group. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit.  I want to add I am not trying to discredit DNA evidence only asking how easily some are saying it's a pseudoscience. </p>
<p>edit two I never meant for this to get hostile or name calling ( as seen in some replies )   I just wanted more information because I was about to get a 23 and me done because I was curious. </p>
<p>I believe my self a man of science but still being human I can jump to conclusions. In my older age. ( 34 )  I try and gather more information  before my AHHAH moment.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct, because pretty well all methods that don’t cost <em>many millions</em> of dollars to do only look at the DNA from a <em>shorthand perspective</em>: very specific parts of the DNA are examined to see where and how certain markers express themselves along the chromosome. These patterns are compared against known baselines to get a general indication of where your ancestors <em>could</em> have come from, or to compare your DNA with forensic samples or determine who your close family members are. This can be done quickly and cheaply, to the point where costs have dropped to just a few hundred dollars.</p>
<p>But even <em>if</em> every single one of your base pairs were recorded, the most that any commercial company can say is that the DNA came from either you, your identical twin, or your clone. And yet, they would probably still use the “1 in x chance” statement because statistically it <em>is</em> possible that someone else out there has the exact same DNA down to the last base pair; it is just vanishingly unlikely unless you have a twin or have been cloned.</p>
<p>And <em>only if</em> you used the very most sophisticated and expensive examinations of the DNA that are currently available, could you identify differences in how the DNA is <em>expressed</em>, and (with a large enough sample size) have a reasonably non-random chance of telling your DNA apart from that if your twin or clone. But still, that is only achievable with equipment and facilities that only exist in a small handful of high-end research laboratories; and are light-years beyond the budgets of your standard genealogy companies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ancestry DNA testing doesn't single you out as an individual, even though they certainly could, since they have your entire genome. Instead, they compare your results to their library, which comes from a mix of self-reports (many people can describe their immediate background pretty well) and independent research. So, if their algorithm finds that 8,000 people are from a close-knit ancestry group, and the researchers know that all of those people trace their heritage to Thailand, they might label that group &quot;Thai.&quot;</p>
<p>They sequence your mitochondrial DNA (which you only get from your mother), if you're male, your Y chromosome DNA (which you only get from your father) and the rest of your chromosomes to look for ancestry informative markers in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Ancestry-informative SNPs are mutations in a single nucleotide that are common to specific populations of people but not others. If you have a specific SNP that's commonly found in people of Scottish descent, you likely have some ancestor(s) from Scotland. If your 23andMe test says you're 29 percent Scottish, it's because  29 percent of the pieces of your DNA were most likely to have come from a group that 23andMe's reference library has labeled &quot;Scottish&quot;, not that you're actually 29% Scottish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't actually have your entire genome.   Ancestry picks out certain parts of your chromosomes to sequence.   Ancestry is using a 64 bit kit, and sequences less than 23andMe and FamilyTreeDNA.  It's like taking a fuzzy picture of you.</p>
<p>Ancestry is most useful in the massive amount of tests it has done.    Huge sample sizes are good for research, and it is on the magnitude of 10 to 1 in the number of people it can match you with compared to the other sites.</p>
<p>It should be the first thing done by adoptees searching for family.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. A lot to do with matching your data with reference populations. 23andMe has me at 98% South Asian (unfortunately no more precise than that) which seems accurate. The cooler part was discovering I share 5.19% of my DNA with this elderly half-Finnish lady that I never knew about. Was able to pinpoint that my great great great grandfather was her great great grandfather (via a detailed family tree an uncle provided) and also sent her photos of him as she didn't know much about her Pakistani side. No idea what that makes us; 23andMe guestimated that we're second cousins. I feel like we share a pretty high percentage of DNA for being so far removed (someone correct me if I'm wrong), but that side of <del>my</del> our family did have a history of marrying between cousins back in the days so that could be an explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finger prints are <em>not</em> unique. That idea was based on someone a long time ago guessing that they may be. People have been repeating it ever since because it's what everyone else is saying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The National Academy of Sciences issued a report a few years ago that highlighted serious flaws with forensic sciences (including fingerprints). As part of that report the NAS found that there is no real scientific evidence calculating how unique a fingerprint is - instead it is a presumption that many professionals have made because &quot;it has always been that way.&quot;
