			<div class="markdown"><p>Was there a really clear villain at the time?  In the US it seems there was quite a few notable people who were anti-semetic and who admired Hitler.  As a matter of policy, I think I remember reading that our government refused to take Jews away from Germany which could have prevented a lot of deaths.  It seems like now people like to think that the allies were fighting at least in part to save the Jews from persecution but was that really the case at the time?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're talking about why WWII is so popular as a subject in pop culture <em>now</em>, I think that the contemporary view of the war is the thing to consider. I mean, yeah, there were obviously anti-Semites in the US at the time (and there are now, too), and I wouldn't say that our motivations for going into the war were about saving the Jews from Hitler, but hind sight is a lot stronger. We know a lot of things now that we didn't know then, and public opinion has changed a lot. </p>
<p>Looking back at WWII, people see a very clear villain, even if people at the time it was happening did not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I certainly am changing the question here.  It is clear now that there was a clear villain then but I wonder how average Americans felt/what they believed at the time?  I am almost certain they viewed the allies as the good guys but I don't know how much it had to do with the reasons people use now.  </p>
<p>My understanding is it wasn't just &quot;some people&quot; being anti semetic then but more like a lot of people and those people came from across the political, educational, and economic spectrums.  </p></div>		</li>
