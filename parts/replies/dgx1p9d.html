			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that the effects of alcohol ARE the end goal, whether it's getting drunk or buzzed.  Just to clarify, the stigma I'm talking about is the thing that causes people to say &quot;Let's go out drinking&quot; instead of &quot;Let's go get drunk&quot; or even &quot;Let's go get buzzed&quot;.  I think that subtle choice of phrasing indicates that people would rather put the focus on the activity rather than the effects, which feels like a stigma to me.  If there is a stigma there, it's held by the people doing the drinking, not some judgmental outsiders.    </p>
<p>I'm learning reading through this that there are plenty of people who DO say &quot;let's go get drunk&quot;, so maybe I've just been hanging out with a hung-up crowd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly.  If it helps provide context, I'm 30-something, married with kids, and most of my friends are married with kids.  I have a feeling a lot of the people answering might be at a different stage in life than me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A part of the difference in phrasing I think really comes down to time commitment. Maybe this is a silly notion but hear me out. To get stoned, with the exception of heavy users, only takes a few minutes. You share a joint and boom you're high. </p>
<p>Getting drunk takes a little more time. Unless you want to get blackout drunk immediately, you usually don't get drunk in a matter of minutes. So when I say to my friend &quot;Let's go drinking&quot;  it's actually a little more nuanced. It's like saying &quot;let's go to the pub, talk for awhile, have some food maybe share some hot wings, during all of this time we'll be having pints so after about 2 hours I'll be nice a liqoured, and then let's keep that buzz going the rest of the night&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To tag onto this... being stoned doesn't necessarily mean loss of cognitive function either. Don't get me wrong, I've been baked out of my mind and had trouble forming words... let alone thoughts, but it's rare. Weed affects everyone differently, but many are able to normally function. However, drinking... and continued drinking...  will always subsequently lead to a slow shut down of the brain... for anyone. </p>
<p>I think that's the stigma difference </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's all your own interpretation which to be honest with you is a gigantic stretch.</p>
<p>To answer your question, you smoke one joint and you're high. You can get more high, you can get crazy high, but even a few tokes and you're high - that's it. To get &quot;drunk&quot; you need to drink a lot of drinks. You don't take two sips of a beer and suddenly you're drunk.</p>
<p>It's not a like for like comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another aspect at work. Most people don't mind a few drinks after work to unwind, but they certainly don't want to get tore up as they have to start the grind early in the morning. Not something done easily with a hangover. Whereas a quick bowl could very easily make you feel more rested for work in the morning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Drives me crazy when I'm drinking and someone goes &quot;oh you're drunk!&quot; Yeah, no shit, what did you expect after I've had that many shots!? I'm partying to get drunk and have a good time </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some guys I drink with just want the buzz and social activity of some drinks. They associate being more drunk than that with wanting not to remember that night. To them its like saying that you don't want to remember hanging out with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, also there are different stages of drinking. You can be tipsy, or just drink to loosen up slightly. It would be the equivalent of people that never know when to stop smoking and end up vegetables all night.. there is getting high and having a good time, and getting high to the point where you can't communicate with people... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could understand that, and like it was said, there's totally different levels. I love being a good drunk, past buzzed but before I'm falling around and whatnot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on the situation. If you are at a party thats meant to be a little &quot;wild&quot; then I think no one cares how drunk you get, but if you're at a party thats just meant to be a &quot;chill&quot; gathering then generally the goal for most people if to remain just buzzed enough to relax and take the edge off, but not so drunk you cant speak right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. My goal in when I'm drinking is to find that perfect equilibrium where I'm sober enough to think rationally, but buzzed/drunk enough to have more fun than I otherwise would (yes, Mr. Lahey was right). My other goal is to enjoy what I'm drinking. Usually bourbon.</p></div>		</li>
