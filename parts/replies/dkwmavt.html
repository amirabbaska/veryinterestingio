<p>It seems to be because of ordered (crystalline) structures turning unordered when stressed. See source below.</p>

<p>It's actually the opposite.  Crystalline polymers are generally opaque and glassy polymers are generally transparent.  Crystals are <em>forming</em> under stress, not being disrupted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Think of a pile of spaghetti,  all random and mixed, then grab each side and pull, the spaghetti becomes more aligned and ordered this is analogous to what happens when polymers are strained.
More ordered is more crystalline, by definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question, why are crystalline polymers opaque? Something white is scattering light in all different directions. Why would a well ordered substance scatter light in all different directions rather than all in the same direction to appear shiny/transparent?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://zeus.plmsc.psu.edu/~manias/MatSE259/lecture6.pdf" target="_blank">Bulk samples of polymer will never be 100% crystalline.  The crystalline and amorphous phases of any given polymer have differing refractive indices, so there is scattering of light off the boundaries between the crystalline and glassy regions.  This is what causes increasing opacity with increasing crystallization.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The opacity in crystalline polymers is caused by light scatterting at the boundaries between the crystalline and amorphous regions. Therefore, 50% crystallinity is the most opaque. The material would become more transparent as you increase OR decrease crystallinity from 50%.</p>
<p>Keep in mind there are other microstructural features that can scatter light besides crystalline/amorphous boundaries. Light can scatter off of spherulites or crazes (a special case of cracks unique to polymers) as well. In fact, the whitening observed in polymers after straining them (e.g. bending a plastic fork) is generally caused by the formation of crazes rather than stress-induced crystallization. Not all polymers crystallize under stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And most colored plastic is clear crystalline plastic mixed with pigments. When you bend it the clear turns to white, so the light does not reach the pigments.</p>
<p>edit: /u/Coomb is right, clear plastic is amorphous, not crystalline.</p></div>		</li>
