			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Phoenix too, and not gonna lie, I <em>love</em> the way the Streets and the Avenues are organized. It makes getting around so much easier to just be able to know where something is based on whether or not it's &quot;street&quot; or &quot;avenue&quot;</p></div>		</li>
