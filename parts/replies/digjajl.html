			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, that's interesting. So really the only difference is that it encrypts the communications between the terminal and the bank? I would have thought that encrypting a message that can't be more than a handful of bytes would be such a trivial task that it would add a negligible delay to the existing processing times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe part of the problem is how the chip works as well. Whereas the magnetic strip is static and merely read by the scanner, the chip is essentially a microprocessor that must be booted up each time. And as part of the encryption process it also updates after each purchase. So it's the back and forth communication and limitations of the chip itself that both contribute to slowing things down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they are entirely different systems. I will get to processing times at the end of the post, but it isn't actually because of the chip. </p>
<p><strong>The magnetic stripe essentially spells out your bank account number using magnetized iron particles.</strong> Not only your bank account number, but also your name and the expiration date of your card and your credit card number. <strong>That means anyone with a magnetic reader can read this information.</strong> </p>
<p>What's even more damning is that once you've allowed a merchant to read your info, if they decide to go rogue, they can charge you as many times as they want. They keep this information for legal, financial and data collection reasons. This is what happened to target, their database of everyone's bank account numbers got hacked and the hackers got all of your info. </p>
<p>Once the bad people have the magstripe reading they can either use a fradulent terminal to charge you directly or print new cards on your behalf and use it other terminals. </p>
<p>The chip cards do not let the chip reader learn any of it's secret information. Instead the chip is actually a computer chip that contains a secret key. It does a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The chip first sends the terminal the card ID, a unique identifier for your card. </li>
<li>Then the terminal sends the chip a summary of the transaction which includes things like card ID, the merchant ID and the transaction total. </li>
<li>In the chip-and-pin model, the chip checks if the total exceeds a certain threshold and if it does, it asks the terminal for PIN to ensure the card holder is present. </li>
<li>If the PIN passes verification, the chip generates a Message Authentication Code or MAC for short, for the transaction summary using it's secret key. </li>
</ol>
<p>The thing about MACs is that they can only be generated by someone who has the secret key and they are totally unique for the transaction summary. Because the transaction summary can include things like current time and randomness, the merchant effectively gets a unique, single-use transaction authentication token valid only for the amount the card holder approved. So the merchant can't go rogue or even let your data get stolen because you gave them no data, just a single use transaction token. The card also can't be skimmed, they are very hard to clone and if you have a PIN, physically stealing your card or cloning your card useless. </p>
<p>So why does this process take longer than magstripe? It doesn't have to, but using the current protocols in the US, the card has to remain inserted until the transaction is approved over the network and can't begin until the terminal knows the transaction total. However Visa is already working to improve the standard and soon in the future, the card will only have to stay in for a second or less, and as contactless becomes more common it will go wave-and-PIN. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If they have my card in their hands (the only way to swipe it to read hat info, they can just read that same info off the front/back of the card itself.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chip and the reader use cryptography to verify the identity of the chip and make sure it is the card that it says it is.</p>
<p>The communications between the reader and the bank are often plaintext. That's how companies like Home Depot and Chipotle and Target and Wendy's get hacked.</p>
<p>Point to point encryption or P2PE is the process of encrypting the communications between the reader and the processor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The delay is due to the added security features, the primary reason for using the technology.</p>

<p>Do not believe that lie. The &quot;added security features&quot; are no more complex than the security features your browser uses to hit this website with an SSL layer of encryption. It's why the URL is https instead of http.</p>
<p>The reason the system is so fucking slow is that it is shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that's the case, then why are the android and Apple Pay systems so fast by comparison? When I use my phone (wherever I can) it's about as fast as the old swipe. That system also creates unique credentials each use.</p></div>		</li>
