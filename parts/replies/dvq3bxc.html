			<div class="markdown"><p>Your lender accepts taking less money so that they get back some money.  </p>
<p>The bank doesn’t want to own your business, they don’t know how to run it.  But they have to either get nothing from you, or get less then what they gave you by changing your loan to something you can pay.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If that was the case they would choose liquidation instead of restructuring most of the time.</p>
<p>Turning around a bankrupt business can actually be extremely profitable. You are correct that they don't know how to run your business, but they tend to know people who do and have the money to hire these people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further from the original explanation. The    banks get 8 out of there 10 dollars back with you keeping a dollar to run your lemonade stand. The banks know sugar and lemons cost more than a dollar. They wait till you file bankruptcy sell your remaining lemonade for a dollar, your stand for 2 dollars and claim insurance for 5 dollars. Then when its time to pay taxes they pay less because you couldnt make lemonade you idiot.</p></div>		</li>
