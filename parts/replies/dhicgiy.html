			<div class="markdown"><p>They've done research on this.</p>
<p>The reason people in 3rd world countries aren't constantly suffering from E. coli infections is that they're immune. They spent about 5 years building up a tolerance to E. coli by consuming it with some frequency. Adults who grew up there don't feel it because they went through those 5 years as children. If you move to and eat like a local in a 3rd world country, you will experience the negative effects of an E. coli infection (and salmonella, and others) for about 5 years.</p>
<p>So, really, you just need to keep eating undercooked chicken for another 4 years or so! :)</p>
<p>Less than scientific, but a fairly thorough overview of the topic: <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/08/06/429356591/can-you-protect-your-tummy-from-travelers-diarrhea" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/08/06/429356591/can-you-protect-your-tummy-from-travelers-diarrhea</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes but just to be clear for those who don't click the link, the relevant quote on that page actually expands on this a bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shlim has spent 30 years studying travelers' illnesses in Nepal. He found that long-term trekkers and expats will eventually build up immunity to diarrhea-causing bacteria. But it takes years, not weeks or months.</p>
<p>&quot;Over a five-year period, your chances of coming down with diarrhea continue to drop,&quot; he says. &quot;And you get less severe cases. But nothing changes much for one to two years.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you might actually expect a reduction in severity after only a year or two, but milder symptoms could persist for longer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother had a colleague when he was doing linguistic research in India who was able to eat anything without getting sick because he'd given himself food poisoning so many times as a single American guy who didn't know how to cook. I know I've gotten less sick in the developing world than a lot of people despite not being particularly careful, I attribute it to four years of eating in a college dining hall that routinely failed health inspection. I'd get sick about once a week from the food, which sucked during college but was great when I moved to the developing world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies are actually designed to ingest raw meat, so long as it's from a fresh kill. The problems we think of inevitable with eating raw meat actually only arise when the meat has taken the couple of days necessary to arrive at your local market, during which time bacteria due to putrefaction flourish. Really though, you could straight up bite a chunk out of a living cow,  then chew and swallow it with no ill effect.</p></div>		</li>
