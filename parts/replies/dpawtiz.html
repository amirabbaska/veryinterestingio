			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that signal isn't really being pushed into your brain. The anti-sound and the normal sound ideally annihilate each other so that nothing remains, so there's just overall less signal reaching your ear, which is why everything gets more quiet.</p>
<p>Worst case, the anti soundwave is not entirely 90 degrees phase shifted and you'll hear a sound. The anti sound waves aren't magical weird special sound waves, it's just normal sound. If it's not uncomfortably loud it's not bad for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is my understanding of active noise cancelling, too. It uses a microphone to capture sounds outside the speaker, inverts the waveform 180 degrees and mixes that with the speaker output, muting most of the external ambient sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about cheaper noise cancelling headphones? I know a guy who complained about hearing problems after using some low end Beats for about 3 hours, and those seemed to just emit white noise rather than opposite frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I've heard about that sort of &quot;noise cancelling&quot;. Drowns out the sounds around you by replacing it with white noise. That sounds retarded and also is probably more likely to have side effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>decibels are a relative logarithmic scale, you can't do math on them like that.  They're referenced to your threshold of hearing, 0 dB is a +/- 10 uPa variation in pressure and is the quietest thing you can hear.</p>
<p>If you get it perfect you can take two sound waves with positive dB numbers and have them cancel to result in an extremely low dB number. 30 dB@0 degrees + 30 dB@180 degrees can equal a negative number which would just indicate that the remaining fluctuations in sound pressure are less than 20 uPa</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can initially experience a vacuum/inverted pressure feeling when putting these headphones on due to your brain not being used to what is essentially a very unnatural process. You get used to it though.</p></div>		</li>
