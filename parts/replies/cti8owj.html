			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you have a shoddy idea of the purpose of the space race to so plainly say we won. In the 1950's, when the space race started, neither the U.S. Nor USSR were aiming to send a man to the moon - to present the moon landing as the well-established finish line seems somewhat disingenuous. I'd argue that the USSR victories of Sputnik and sending the first man to space were more strategically important in terms of nuclear warfare than the moon landing, which seems largely symbolic in its importance - crucial for national propaganda but not for delivering nuclear missiles across the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are ignoring the hysteria of the cold war if you think facts were more important than propaganda back then. I might agree with your assessment today, but the battle against communism was all about perception at the time. Facts and solid analysis, like yours, that got in the way of the many administrations' agendas were hidden from the public for decades. The release of the <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/pentagon-papers" target="_blank">Pentagon Papers by the NY Times</a> is a prime example of that.</p>
<p>The frame of mind for the normal American when thinking about the Soviet threat was generally one of fear, especially for ten year old's. At school we played this game called 'duck and cover' where we pretended the evil communists were shooting missiles with atomic warheads at us. We would all crawl under our desk and keep quiet. I remember spending all that time on the floor trying to figure out why anyone in the world would want to kill me. It was frightening in a way I have never been able to explain.</p>
<p>We knew the Russians beat us to the start of the space race, but JFK drew the finish line when he announced we would walk on the moon and that was good enough for us. All we needed was something to hold on to for hope.</p>
<p>If you examine the cold war long enough, you'll find 'disingenuous' describes both sides main approach to communications and disseminating information to the public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This hits upon my my preferred answer to this question - SLBMs, MIRVs, improved targeting computers, and miniaturization killed the space race. Why do you need nukes on the moon when there's no way the enemy can hit everything you have on Earth?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, a major part of the purpose was propaganda. And if everyone <em>thought</em> America won, then it worked. America presented the finish line as getting to the moon. And everyone bought it. Symbolism is sometimes more important to a nation than cold facts.</p></div>		</li>
