			<div class="markdown"><p>100 mbar could definitely cause rupture of lung or airway tissue. I'm a Technical Physician and PhD student researching mechanical ventilation. Lung ruptured are seen at pressures as low as 45 mbar. The thing that would prevent an actual 'explosion' is your thoracic cage (ribs) that keeps everything together. </p>
<p>Edit: typo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's super surprising that such a low pressure differential can hurt your airways. The from playing with vacuum equipment I know that skin can withstand 1 bar without too much problem (albeit on a very small surface). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is in the pleural space between the lungs and chest wall? It's not outside air.  It seems if there's explosive decompression the air would just rush out through the throat, and that due to the velocity there might be some damage in the alveoli.  I don't see how anything would be trying to force its way into the pleural cavity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not quite true. Breathing in and out, and holding your breath, in a lower pressure atmosphere is not more difficult (it's probably slightly easier), because the pressure inside your lungs is the same as the pressure on your body (not the best explanation). That's true about the decompression though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I should have clarified a bit. It was my understanding that it wouldn't be the breathing necessarily that was hard- although there's less oxygen so its less effective. But if you have a lungful of air and suddenly the pressure around you drops from 15 psi to 5 psi, that shits all comin out</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you boil water at an altitude of 12000 ft, it is not as hot as boiling water at sea level. The lower the pressure, the lower the boiling point.</p>
<p>At pressures below the Armstrong limit, water will boil at normal human body temperature. As the boiling sets in, cellular function ceases.</p>
