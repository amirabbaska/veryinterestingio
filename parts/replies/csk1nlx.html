			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an Army MP in Colorado, and this is my understanding about the pot thing - granted, military installations are subject to federal <em>and</em> state law, and it's illegal to bring pot onto a military base, because the federal trumps state.</p>
<p>But anyway...Colorado says it's legal, but the US says it's not. Colorado doesn't want me to, and arguably actively wants me <em>not</em> to, arrest people for pot. There's precious few <em>federal</em> law enforcement officers (LEOs) - FBI, DHS, ATF, etc. - in a given area. </p>
<p>Those federal agencies have stuff that they're traditionally focused on - serial killers, kidnappings, economic crimes, crimes crossing state boundaries, terrorism, large-scale drug operations, organized crime, etc., etc., etc. - they don't have time to focus on Joey Smith, the 19 y/o Freshman at Pike's Peak Community College that got pulled over by a State Trooper and has a dimebag of weed in his center console. If the State Trooper doesn't give a shit about it, it's dramatically harder for the federal agencies to do anything about it.</p>
<p>A very large part, even a majority, of enforcement of federal laws (United States Code, or USC) relies on state LEO cooperation. Without those states to help the federal agencies do a lot of the initial legwork, the resource/personnel allocation model that those federal agencies currently have goes to shit - i.e., if the federal government suddenly wants to start hardline enforcing the USC marijuana laws in the state of Colorado, they would have to reassign and relocate dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of additional federal LE personnel to Colorado to pick up the slack that the Colorado state and local LE agencies refused to take part in.</p>
<p>That's how the practicalities of it work. As for how the specific legalities of it - i.e. how they 'get away with it' in a political or legal sense, I don't really understand that. I feel like, and I believe, that that aspect of it kind of just gets pushed to the side because of the significant practical limitations, in the context of the above explanation.</p>
<p>Not exactly ELI5, and I know /r/Mason11987 also explained it, but I thought it would be beneficial to share my knowledge and understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>EDIT: Holy crap, I typed this in a drunken stupor at 5 AM before I stumbled to bed. I'm amazed that it's generated such a response, and that someone gave it gold (Thanks!). I've tried to respond to every rational response, and I will continue to do so if anyone wants further clarification. Look to the response from /u/Taoiseach for an explanation of how this happens politically and legally, he has an excellent summary of it that doesn't seem to be getting much attention.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can explain that part.</p>
<p><strong>How they get away with it legally:</strong> It's called prosecutorial discretion. There are a lot of criminal laws in the US, and a lot of people breaking those laws. Most of those people are actually quite harmless - for example, nobody cares if you jaywalk in an empty street. Because of this, prosecutors are allowed to choose not to charge someone. More importantly for marijuana, prosecutors can also choose how they allocate their resources, including the law enforcement personnel /u/droidball mentioned. If the prosecutor's office decides that it's not important to arrest people for marijuana possession, they can just not assign any resources to doing so. That's why nobody gets in trouble for not sending those hundreds-to-thousands of LEOs to Colorado - it's a long-established tradition that prosecutors can assign resources however they wish.</p>
<p>Yes, this means that prosecutors can <em>de facto</em> decriminalize just about anything. This isn't even controversial. It's one of the major reasons that nobody was arrested for the white-collar fraud during the '08 market crash. Federal prosecutors were asked to keep their hands off the bankers to stabilize the political climate and thereby improve Congress' ability to work on the situation.</p>
<p>All of this means that <strong>how they get away with it politically</strong> is the really important part. Prosecutors don't use their discretion this way without a reason (although they frequently use it for bad reasons). In this case, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/29/eric-holder-marijuana-washington-colorado-doj_n_3837034.html" target="_blank">the Obama administration has told federal prosecutors to ignore anything that isn't a really serious problem</a>, such as marketing to children or pot-related DUI. The administration, in turn, is apparently receptive to the popular support for marijuana legalization in these states. If that popular support disappears, expect to see the feds swooping back in.</p>
<p>More chilling, though, is the possibility of a new presidential administration with different priorities. If we get a pro-drug-war president in 2016, expect to see more federal interference in &quot;legal&quot; marijuana.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does all this mean that if I'm super unlucky I can still get in trouble over pot in a state where it's legal? Like if one of those few federal law enforcement people happened to come accross me at the wrong moment or some such?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it this way, despite what you may hear. The DEA is spread realllly fucking thin these days now that people don't believe in this drug war and we are in massive fucking debt.
They could go around busting people for growing all day long in these states but they wont.
Also, every state has a level of Marijuana you can be caught with BEFORE its a federal charge.
Virginia it's a half ounce + and the Feds can take the case and give you real time. Under that and they won't touch it.
I felt this needed to be brought up in the discussion.
There are state levels and federal levels of possession.</p>
<p>[EDIT] -
Beyond all those other reason, Methamphetamine.
The DEA is using its budget wisely in a sense, they are targeting harder drugs then weed as a priority now.</p>
<p>I got busted with over a hundred pot plants in VA in 2012, the city shit its pants when it found out and it was a big deal in my small town. 15 years ago the DEA would of picked up the case and I would of gone to a federal penitentiary. However VAs DEA budget just isn't there due to a huge meth epidemic so instead of using resources to prosecute me they let the state do it. So I got off on a year probation and 1500 fine ; )
Thank god for crystal meth!
I could link articles but you would have quite a bit of info on me and I won't. I will say if you google my name the first 10 results are articles are about me &quot;on the run&quot;. Media spin though and the DA knew were I was at. I had immediately flown to Hawaii before they charged me with an actual crime. It was my buddies house and his deal, I just was living there as his pot mentor and they believed I had nothing to do with it at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't raid the dispensaries (in Denver) because they were upset about legalization. They raided them due to ties with Mexican drug cartels and smuggling operations. </p>
<p>The feds set some policies, and basically said that if the dispensaries followed them, the feds would allow them to operate. The ones that got raided were not complying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a couple of other things at play here as well.
First, drugs laws are legislative criminal laws. Their existence does not prohibit actions deemed as a basic human right--or at least that hasn't been determined by the SCOTUS.
What the Court's ruling on Gay Marriage means, however, is that discriminating based on the sexuality of the couple intending on marrying, is a violation of that couple's Constitutional rights. Since the Constitution provides only limitations on GOVERNMENTAL power (where the Criminal Code focuses of the limitations regarding PEOPLE'S rights), this ruling effectively states that any law banning homosexuals from marrying is unconstitutional--meaning NO state or the Fed can enforce it...they do not have the jurisdictional power, because no government entity have jurisdiction to violate The Constitution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you represent a drug company, and you argue that illegitimate pain medication such as cannabis have taken some of the market. You then argue that states' non-enforcement / flagrant disregard of federal law is the cause, and you have lost some profit.</p>
<p>And since the company you represent is based in biological science, it does not necessarily have opposition to cannabis as a pain reliever, but it faces a disadvantage by playing by the rules while states permit other companies to bend them. It would like to begin manufacturing and research without interference by the federal government.</p></div>		</li>
