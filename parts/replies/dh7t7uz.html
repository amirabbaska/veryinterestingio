			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, there is a way to put a satellite above a country that's not on the equator.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molniya_orbit" target="_blank">Molniya orbit</a> allows the satellite to hover over the targeted country at high altitudes (similar to geostationary orbit altitudes), then quickly loop around the earth at low altitudes to get back on station.  Usually such satellites would come in pairs, so that there's always one over the point of interest.</p>
<p>Obviously the US and the USSR used this technique to monitor each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the past times of many amateur astronomers is trying to track the black satellites in such orbits. Sometimes a nation will have an official payload like a communications satellite, but may have a secondary payload not made public. </p>
<p>They tend to have a very low albedo but by looking at a launch you can tell what kind of orbit it might have so you know what part of the sky to look at. It's pretty cool people still do that. </p>
<p>I only see the ones just after sunset that aren't secret ones. You can put where you found them and what time on websites and it will tell you what you saw. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be pointed out that spying from a satellite is a very limited ability.</p>
<p>You can't take photos of people and track them from a satellite, its just too far away.  The aberration and maximum resolution (limited by the wave length) of visible light is just too rough to take a clear photo of a person from orbit.  At best you can get a smudge of colors in the shape of a head, nothing to positively identify someone.</p>
<p>Smaller wavelengths allow for higher resolution but water quickly becomes opaque to UV as you start getting into UVB range, and our atmosphere is totally opaque to UVC.</p>
<p>So they are great at listening to stuff coming from the ground in RF or Microwave, but no so great at taking spy photos of anything smaller than a vehicle.  </p>
<p>If you want to keep your secrets secret, just don't openly transport them.  As far as people go, unless you are building a secret base on a deserted mountain, its not really much help.</p></div>		</li>
