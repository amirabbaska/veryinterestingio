<p>In simple terms, the body adapts to what you expose it to. More strength oriented training makes the former (stronger muscles that exhaust faster) dominate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so is there a training regime that will both add strong muscles, but also add a lot of endurance? E.g., if you're a soldier, you might need both high power (for close combat or fight), but also need to be able to do long distance runs/marches.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I assume that you would walk a few miles per day anyway. Compare that to a sedentary life style of someone who barely moves and his body will be different.<br />
That said, I've been hiking about 16 km every week in the last months and I notice a significant change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think sprinting a mile is more dependent on your cardiovascular system being able to keep oxygen up than your ability to burn calories to sustain the energy.</p>
<p>Someone with cancer or emphysema wouldn't be able to run let alone sprint, but they could relatively easily walk a mile depending on their condition. Of course sprinting would burn more calorie, if you're able to sprint a mile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, nobody is able to &quot;sprint&quot; for 10 minutes. But a sprint is defined as a short distance, top speed run. This means that a sprint is more dependant on your anaerobic system. So you have no use for oxygen to provide you with ATP and your cardiovascular functions are not gonna be as essential, as for a distance runner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For people in such conditions, burning calories is rarely important. Walking long term has a long list of benefits, moderate speed, non flat terrain. Free endorphins for you.</p>
<p>Also, I had CV problems, forbid me to run or bike; the only thing that would create an even cardio vascular flow was walking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How you feel after doing it is a poor indicator, because if you're sprinting you're only giving yourself a few minutes to expend all that energy as opposed to doing it at such a slow rate that you can recover as quickly as you can expend it. It's like if you're sipping from a bottle but also refilling it at say 1tbsp/minute. If you chug it, the bottle will be empty quickly. If you drink a little more than 1tbsp/minute, you can drink much more total water before it's empty.</p>
<p>That said I'm not contesting the answer, just saying how you would feel after sprinting a distance vs walking it doesn't really say much. Similarly you could feel just as awful sprinting 300m and feel only a little tired walking 7-8 miles, doesn't mean you burn more sprinting.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post proving it scientifically, of course.  </p>
<p>Just in terms of common sense:  </p>
<p>When you're walking, a foot is always in contact with the ground, supporting your weight. When running/jogging, you're fully leaving the ground with every stride.  Only for a fraction of a second, but obviously this motion is repeated continuously, every step planting and pushing you back off the ground and forward.  This mode of movement is more strenuous than walking the same distance, regardless of speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The physical quantity, Work [units of energy], is a function of the distance traveled. Not the time it takes to travel that distance. </p>
<p>For example, a car traveling at 50 miles per hour for 50 miles (1 hour) burns more gas than the same car traveling 30 miles per hour for 50 miles (1 + 2/3 hours). Ignoring issues with the engine and gearbox and things. Just qualitatively. It's because the engine has to supply more force to counter air resistance to keep the car going 50 than 30.</p>
<p>Same concept with walking vs running. More air resistance and the fact that with running your whole body leaves the ground. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way: when you run, every step has a vertical movement as well as horizontal. Even very efficient runners will have at least 2cm vertical movement with every stride. Extrapolated over an average of 1000 strides in a mile, thats an extra 20m straight up. So it would be sort of like walking a mile, then climbing a 20m rope. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well what is or isn't intrinsic to you is just like, your opinion man. </p>
<p>Really, it should be obvious that one is harder than the other. <em>Why</em> one is harder than the other may not be intrinsically obvious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its simple. going a mile takes x amount of energy. no matter how you do it. walk run jump hop fly flap swim.</p>
<p>but there is a second factor involved here. efficiency. walking is more &quot;efficient&quot; than running so it has a smaller energy penalty (energy required above the x amount to go a mile)</p>
<p>so going the mile does not take more energy. the act of &quot;running&quot; is less efficient so it takes more energy to do it. kind of semantic but it is important to know the difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fun thing about physics is that going a mile requires 0 energy, assuming your destination is at the same level.</p>
<p>If you're talking about drag from the air, it actually increases with speed. And force times distance (not time) is energy. So it takes more energy without looking at efficiency of running.</p></div>		</li>
