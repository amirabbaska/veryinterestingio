<p>Becquerels is a literal unit of activity. It's easy to measure because individual emissions are taken as equivalent. Doesn't matter if they're alpha or beta. Basically a rate of clicks on a Geiger counter for a standardized volume of sample. </p>
<p>Becqurel is a useful measurement when you can make assumptions of the source. Say you're monitoring negligent leaks of tritium water from seeping out of a power plant heat exchanger. Since you're assuming a tritium source, you assume only alpha emission so a becqurel can be contextualized in terms of health impact because there is only one type of emission assumed. Also, the monitoring is mostly done to keep an eye on a certain kind of reactor problem.</p>
<p>A becqurel isn't useful for adding much context to a nuclear disaster beyond &quot;this water sample is freaking hot&quot;. It's not very reasonable to make accurate estimates for safe exposure time because it lacks context for the profile of emissions and therefore consideration of the health impact.</p>
<p>Sievert becomes useful if you can assess the profile of the different emissions to assess health impact. Sievert is a combination of intensity and distribution of emissions with weighting upon the damage potential of the different emissions which makes it a much more complex measurement that is expensive for routine monitoring of low health impact sources and for the most part uninformative for the context. If you got a very high becqurel output from a reactor outlet, one might put that sample in for a more comprehensive analysis though.</p></div>		</li>
