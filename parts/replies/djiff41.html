It seems likely that 2 gravitational objects would attract each other, but dark matter may not even be a material.  After all, it is merely a correction to the standard laws of physics.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark matter and black holes must behave according to the Einstein field equations. The interior of a Schwarzschild black hole is causally disconnected from the outside vacuum. If baryonic or non-baryonic dark matter was somehow able to leave the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole, it would need to have exotic properties not compatible with the theory of general relativity, and I doubt that it would then show the behaviour (for example, gravitational lensing) we are observing.</p></div>		</li>

Just because dark matter is a puzzle doesn't mean it's magical... it's like saying, &quot;well, consciousness is a mystery so you should say that we <em>think</em> humans can't see the future.

			<div class="markdown"><p>While correct, I think your comment is missing an important point: Regular matter will form accretion disks around black holes. Regular matter falling into these disks will be slowed down until it merges with the disk, and falls in over time thanks to internal friction. Dark matter does not have such a process - the particles either hit the black hole directly, or make a single passage and escape again. The probability that a dark matter particle hits a black hole is much smaller than the probability that regular matter falls in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many asteroids pass the Earth safely at distances where the gravity of Earth is stronger than that of any other source.</p>
<p>The effective cross section is larger than the &quot;actual size&quot; thanks to gravity, but it is still small compared to the size of accretion disks.</p>

<p>Almost none. Microlensing surveys don't find enough black holes, and the velocity dispersion of stars in dwarf galaxies don't look like what you would expect if 80% of the mass was high mass compact bodies. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Sure, the LIGO detection of the ~30 solar mass black holes has sparked a lot of work on this again. Personally, I don't believe the claims.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My research is in primordial black holes. There is one region of parameter space (around 10^(20) g) where it's still possible (you could also have a <em>very</em> wide distribution of masses that would evade the constraints, or maybe some quantum gravity effect comes into play to prevent BH from evaporating completely, leaving Planck-mass remnants), but I'm not super optimistic. </p>
<p>That's not to say that that primordial black holes couldn't exist, just that it's unlikely (in my opinion) that they could make up 100% of the dark matter. There are a number of recent developments that suggest that it is possible that PBH exist in <em>some</em> capacity though, and there could be interesting effects associated with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's neat but also out of my area. </p>
<p>Are there no constraints from microlensing surveys on the abundance of objects with those masses? If they are that small they should be very abundant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My understanding is that there is no evidence for any other particular type of dark matter either, aside from detection of mass / gravity from galaxy rotation curves and lensing.</p>
<p>Is there some reason that small black holes are easier to rule out than other dark matter possibilities?</p></div>		</li>
