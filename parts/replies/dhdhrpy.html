<p>The 3 wheeler should be resting neatly on my skull after a flip, so it should be easy to find. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can buy new three wheelers. They were introduced with a single rear wheel and chain drive so that they would be under motorcycle regulations instead of car regulations. Polaris Slingshot is the most common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe /u/Stuckin_Foned is referring to three-wheeled ATVs, such as the Honda ATC series. While not illegal, nobody makes them anymore due to large numbers of lawsuits and calls for them to be banned. Three wheeled road vehicles are a different animal entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're a bit off base here. The three wheeler you are referring to (Slingshot) has a few things in place to keep it flat. Stability control for one. Also with the two out front layout, those and the can am spyder (way more common than the Slingshot btw) are nearly impossible to turn over. Sure you might get a wheel up but then the computer takes over. The honda big red from back in the day was a death machine. 3 wheel atv's have been banned in the USA since 1987.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool story time: when you moved from poland to uk, and had your driver's license with only &quot;B&quot; (cars) replaced by UK version, they gave you &quot;A (79)&quot; extra. A means motorcycle, A (79) restricts it to three wheelers. </p>
<p>Now when you went back and replaced your UK license that had &quot;B&quot; and now also &quot;A (79)&quot;, polish dmv didn't know what 79 is and you got full &quot;A&quot; back :)</p>
<p>This doesn't work anymore..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, scrote is short for scrotum. Pretty synonymous with &quot;chav&quot; which is a UK specific phenomena. Also scratter or (as per the Viz character) Rat Boy. Likely to be going out with a slapper.</p>
