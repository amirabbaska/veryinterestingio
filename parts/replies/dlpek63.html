<p>Knowing to answer things consistently doesn't exactly require insider knowledge.  Most people who lie in real life usually try to keep their story straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this.   Many large companies use personality assessments, ethics tests and psych evaluations now as part of the hiring process.  You log in, and have to answer 200-300 questions.   You soon learn most of the questions are previous questions re-worded, and it becomes immediately obvious what the test is trying to account for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can also look for something called social desirability lying which is independent of memory. We basically see who endorses highly desirable behaviors which have very low base rates in the population. Endorse enough and we either assume you're lying or a saint. We err on the side of &quot;lying&quot; and may remove the data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite examples of this is the question:</p>
<p>&quot;Do you ever lie?&quot; Other versions include &quot;Have you ever told a lie?&quot; &quot;I have never told a lie.&quot; and &quot;I never lie.&quot;</p>
<p>If someone tells you that they've never told a lie, you can infer that they're lying or didn't read the question. It is used on several major personality inventories.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If Bob regularly uses cocaine and knows it's illegal, he doesn't need to have too good of memory to consistently answer &quot;no I don't use cocaine,&quot; no matter how many ways it's asked.  Now if you're asking what shampoo Bob uses?  That's very different, because he doesn't know what answer is desirable.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You generally wouldn't ask someone if they did illegal things in a situation where that answer could come back to bite them. Like, you won't find a murderer by asking &quot;have you ever murdered&quot;. Obviously. That is not a problem questionnaires solve. You can't find very specific answers with multiple choice questions either, right tool for the right job.</p>
<p>However, in the case where someone is claiming to have not done cocaine, or malingering (pretending to be mentally ill, generally in order to get prescription drugs/get an insanity pleas) you can ask questions like &quot;Have you ever considered experimenting with illegal drugs?&quot; and if they say &quot;No/never&quot; you can have a flag up because most people have considered it at some point. &quot;Have you ever broken any laws?&quot; getting a no as well throws up a bigger one if we have reason to suspect they have. You ask questions that a guilty person would OVERCOMPENSATE for. One thing they've found is that when you send actual depressed people vs actors being told to ACT depressed, to a doctor the big tell is actual depressed people are far more subdued and the actors, even with training, are trying to hit as many points as they can on &quot;being depressed&quot;. Another thing you can do is ask &quot;Do you ever hear voices telling you to kill the mayor?&quot; and &quot;do you ever lose large quantities of time where you don't know where you were?&quot; which are 2 symptoms that are both very rare on their own (that specific auditory hallucination, not hearing ANY voices) it is incredibly unlikely for someone to have both. So if someone is checking answers to SOUND crazy you can catch them with things like that. It's not just about being consistent with your own story, it's about being consistent with the answers, the type of person you are trying to pretend to be, would also give. And most liars don't know how those people answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about when questions are vague?</p>
<p>Like &quot;it is never acceptable to hit someone&quot; with strongly disagree to strongly agree answers. </p>
<p>I read into those a lot. Like, walk right up and hit someone for no reason? Or in self defence? Because depending on the situation, my answer will either be strongly disagree or strongly agree. </p>
<p>Do they ask vague questions like that on purpose?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really annoying one because it has &quot;never&quot; right in the statement. Someone who thinks it's <em>almost</em> never acceptable but is a stickler for mathematical precision could easily answer &quot;strongly disagree&quot; and then what have you learned? If you compare it to similar questions, you can't tell whether you are measuring their consistency or their reaction to nonsensical absolutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just don't hit &quot;strongly disagree&quot; if you only disagree with the &quot;never&quot; or &quot;always&quot; part. Use your &quot;moderately disagree&quot; option to represent your &quot;strong agreement except for a few cases where I strongly disagree&quot; opinion.</p>
<p>Yes, it's a category error, but just be practical. For most roles, you will set off red flags for aspergers if you are so literal on principal during the interview process anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some jobs screen out people of higher independence or intelligence, see the US military for example, and if the personality test indicates either then the candidate is undesirable. There may be specialized roles where it's good, but for worker drone type roles it's frequently considered a negative.  </p>
<p>Some tests look for and screen out depression, eHarmony.com was a good example of that.  100% of the people I knew who had experienced some degree of depression were rejected by eHarmony.</p>
<p>I've also seen some personality tests that can strongly indicate that a potential sales person will be poor at actually closing deals, and reject for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually an intentional thing called &quot;reverse scoring&quot; because some people/cultures are more likely to agree with things they're asked then disagree (or vice versa) or think of things in more specific instances when presented with certain wordings. So If someone's sheet says </p>
<p>&quot;It is almost always not acceptable to hit someone.&quot; - Strongly Agree</p>
<p>&quot;it is never acceptable to hit someone.&quot; - Strongly Disagree</p>
<p>we're good. But if someone's sheet says </p>
<p>&quot;It is almost always not acceptable to hit someone.&quot; - Strongly Agree</p>
<p>&quot;it is never acceptable to hit someone.&quot; - Somewhat Disagree</p>
<p>And their answers generally skew towards that pattern we can deduce they tend to be more agreeable and correct for that bias.</p>
<p>The questions that say &quot;Never&quot; are counted as negative whatever their score is and so your answers to those two questions would both count you in the same direction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is no way to know if it's rare or not.  </p>
<p>Consistent lying can't be detected... therefore it can't be measured... therefore we have really have no idea at what rate it's occurring. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. We have other ways of controlling for lying, but it's hardly fool proof. Still if we collect enough data, liars are averaged our. Most people are honest., and when they're not it's often because they are trying to convey some message. That's something we account for too </p></div>		</li>
