			<div class="markdown"><p>No, infinity density means that whatever amount of mass is all at a single point.</p>
<p>The strength of gravity is defined by the mass and distance from it. The more mass, the stronger the gravity, and the further away you are from it the weaker the gravity.</p>
<p>The event horizon is the distance at which you need to move faster than light to escape the gravity. Blackholes form when the amount of mass is enough that it's gravity tugging in on itself is strong enough that no known force can keep subatomic particles from overlapping, and so the stuff starts collapsing in on itself, getting smaller and smaller, shrinking even smaller than the calculated event horizon.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p>If the sun was replaced by a blackhole of the same mass, nothing would change in the orbits of the solar system. Though, since it is a point, you can get infinitely close to it, and so yeah, in a way, there is infinite gravity, but only if you get exactly at the center of the blackhole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was under the impression that once past the event horizon the composition of what went in is unknown.  As in its not known if its infinitely dense, or if its broken down into quarks or some unknown even denser type of matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can never actually reach infinite density because the higher the density, the slower time passes. Its sorta like going from A to B by always taking a step that's 50% of the remaining distance, you can get closer forever but never get there.</p>
<p>Also, black holes do lose mass because &quot;they get too light to hold the mass in&quot;. The lower the density, the higher proportion of virtual particles make it out and thus the faster the evaporation. A black hole that decays to around ~1.5x the weight of our sun would be decaying so fast it would literally be an explosion.</p>
<p>Also we don't know how hawking radiation would work once the expansion of space accelerates up to and past the speed of light since the math just falls apart. They could either be ripped apart, continue evaporating or just stay there forever, nobody knows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking in absolute terms, than the density isn't infinite. Obviously. </p>
<p>But we normally define infinity as &quot;too absurdly large to be worth measuring&quot;. This means that while studying camera lenses, you'll learn that the building ahead is &quot;at infinity&quot;, because 10meters is wayyyyyyy more than the 1-2 cm focal lengths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if two black holes got close enough that the more massive one started to take mass from the smaller? Is that possible or would still nothing be able to escape the smaller one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blackholes are points surrounded by the event horizon. If blackholes get too close, they merge into a bigger blackhole.</p>
<p>There is no known way for something to come out of a blackhole, and as far as we know, they're just a point, there is no &quot;material&quot; to be ripped apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a bit, one of the most fascinating features of black holes (to me, at least) shows up when you consider the relativistic effects of time dilation. In GR, time goes &quot;slower&quot; (relative to observers at rest) not only when the observer is moving quickly, but also when the observer is in a stronger gravitational field. The end result of this is that by the time you actually fall into a black hole, all of time has already passed for things outside the black hole. Part of why nothing can escape a black hole is because as far as we know, there wouldnt be anything to come back to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For our purposes the speed of light is infinity, as nothing can go faster than that. Wether it's a tiny black hole or a super massive one, the escape velocity is the same, infinite. This means that one black hole no matter how big can ever pull mass out of another, because they each hold on to their mass with the same value of gravity. When they do collide they just merge into a fatter one. This event creates a phenomenon known as gravity waves, ripples in the fabric of space time. Scientists recently detected these for the very first time, which is awesome </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add to the above points for when black holes collide; recall <del>a few months ago</del> (wow almost a year ago!) when scientists detected two black holes merging into each other and releasing some humongous gravitational waves. Well these gravitational waves took a large amount of energy- equivalent to the mass-energy of several suns and therefore the mass of the final black hole was significantly less than the combined mass of the original two black holes.</p>
<p>So; if you think that you have &quot;too much black hole&quot; in your galaxy, then one way to decrease the amount of black hole you have is to throw all your holes together into a single BH. How you would go about picking up two black holes and throwing them at each other is another matter entirely...</p></div>		</li>
