<p>IMO, there is another important factor,
any nation able to place a satellite in space is a nuclear power, and proved by putting such a satellite that it can send a nuclear warhead to every country of the world. which put you in the club of the country able to do what they want (i.e. U.S. invading Irak against the UN, Russia invading Ukraine, France  putting friendly dictator all over Africa etc...) </p>
<p>This is the reason why space-race occurred during cold-war (by recycling the German scientists who created the V2 missiles) and the reason why the limit between the world of rocket and the world of nuclear missile is unclear. </p></div>		</li>
