			<div class="markdown"><p>And even being a disadvantage isn't enough to make something go away, because one gene can sit next to another more advantageous gene on a chromosome for one. </p>
<p>Like you said, evolution doesn't have goals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an exceptionally poor rejoinder.</p>
<p>Rhythmic ejaculation is conserved across all mammal species. No physiological traits are that well conserved without them serving a purpose.</p>
<p>Traits which are neutral with regards any advantage are the ones most at risk of atrophy due to genetic drift. Universal conservation of a trait suggests there is a strict evolutionary pressure maintaining the trait. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah it has a valid purpose</p>
<p>people are saying here it has no purpose, they are wrong</p>
<p>ejecting the semen gives the sperm a better chance at fertilization</p></div>		</li>
