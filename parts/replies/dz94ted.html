			<div class="markdown"><p>I love reddit I swear! I just posted a comment about my daughter having Sturge-Weber Syndrome! You explained it very well. I met another SWS parent on reddit haha
Would love to know more about your daughter or if you want to ask me about my daughter I'd be more than happy to share what we've gone through! My girl is 29 and back in 1989 when she was born I had to find information myself which led me to Karen Ball who started the SWS Foundation. She has seizures they started when she was almost 4 years old. I'm in southern California area. PM me if you'd like!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a PWS stain that wraps the bottom of my left foot to my lower back.  It is a result of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.  A similar vascular disease/disorder.  This one is caused by a somatic mutation  in the PIK3CA gene.  Not genetic, though several people in my family have birthmarks to a smaller degree, am the only one diagnosed with a vascular disorder. </p>
<p>My birthmark was with me since birth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, yes - we hear Klippel-Trenaunay mentioned frequently but I wasn't sure what the similarities and differences were. I'll have to look it up again! Just out of curiosity, are laser treatments suggested for Klippel-Trenaunay as they are for Sturge-Weber?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laser treatments are available, but I never even considered it.  Being on my leg I can hide it if I want, but I've never had a bad encounter about it once.  I was teased a lot as a kid, but the leg never came up lol. </p>
<p>I can understand how it might effect someone if it was more visible.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OMG! I have the exact same mark! I have Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome all along my left leg and extending to my Lower back on the left side! The vascularities are more pronounced along my foot and calf, but I don’t have too much swelling thanks to using a compression stocking since I was little.
I am so happy to meet someone else like me!
I don’t know about you, but I felt so self-conscious about it growing up that I never wore shorts or skirts. Now I just feel naked with a bare leg, even though my PWS has faded with laser treatment and is less noticeable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! Thanks for the share!  It has never bothered me,  mentally, one bit.  I think if it was on my face or arms it might, but on the leg not so much.  Been in swimming pools, ect. never once had anyone worried that or thought it was something weird.  Some people ask about it, but that is about it.</p>
<p>The symptoms didn't really start to bother me until about 2 years ago.  My leg always feels 'heavy' and its started to have some affect on my bladder.  I dropped 50 pounds recently and that helped, along with a compression sock.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, but on my right side.  Toes to hip.  2 Compression stockings one on top of the other, help tremendously.  </p>
<p>Is pain an issue for you?  How do you manage the pain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would love to chat about this more with you! I was born with two PWS's on my face by my lip and eye. I had 10 laser treatments when I was much younger (90s era).  </p>
<p>The marks still show (albeit much lighter than the deeper purple from how it began), and as a self-conscious teenager, I explored getting them further removed. After a first return treatment, the laser &quot;shocks&quot; were pretty uncomfortable and I pretty much said screw this. Didn't seem much easier than the process from when I was younger. I left them as they were and don't mind them now. But, I am really glad my parents chose to give me the treatments they did when I was young.  </p>
<p>The process is a unique memory from throughout my childhood, and I mostly made it through based on the promise to rent a Nintendo each time we returned from a treatment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome to PM me! Every laser treatment is hard for us as parents - even though she has numbing cream and the procedure only takes about 90 seconds, she cries as soon as she is strapped in and clearly some areas of her face and head are more sensitive than others. I was curious to know what it felt like so I had the doctor use the laser on each of my hands - one numbed, the other not. It felt like needle pricks. The number hand was less bruised and the irritation went away within a day or two. On the not-numbed hand, I got a blister and the skin fell off. There is still a mark there and it's been at least a month. I think the laser treatments will only get more difficult for a while but we are certainly not above using bribes :-) the results have been astounding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have PWS on my face, two spots on my cheek and one right under my lip. Mine also still show and are pretty noticeable, but as you said the laser treatment really wasn't worth it at all, at least after doing them at an older age (I was around 22 when I was doing the treatments, i'm 27 now). I've looked into all kinds of things to help and none of them have really worked, so I just ended up saying fuck it and bought CC cream, which is a tinted moisturizer/sunscreen. It is basically makeup to be honest. </p>
<p>I'm a guy who has never worn any kind of makeup before so I did it on a whim wondering if it would be difficult to apply or be noticeable... really I had no idea what to expect, but in all honesty wearing it hasn't been much trouble at all. I'd say it reduces the redness probably by 80-90%; it makes it much much less noticeable. I was mostly worried if people would notice that it looked like I had makeup on but I haven't really had any problems with that, and I mean it's still better than always walking around being self conscious about red spots. I've gotten used to it by now, it's as simple to put on as any moisturizer, just have to make sure it's evenly applied, and at night I just use a cleanser to get it off.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is something you would ever consider, but as someone who has gone through the struggle I would recommend trying it if you don't care about the idea of having light makeup on. <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/your-skin-but-better-cc-cream-spf-50-P411885?skuId=1868140" target="_blank">Here is the cream I use if you're interested.</a> There are a lot of different brands available but this is the only kind i've tried and it's worked well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I appreciate the recommendation. Something interesting I have noticed is that on particularly cold days, my birthmark by my eye gets darker. I've had people see me for weeks without saying anything, and then on a random day it becomes darker and more noticeable and they ask something like &quot;what happened to your eye&quot;?  </p>
<p>I understand the desire to use some kind of cover up (and have done that before on occasion), but as I have gotten older, I have cared about it less and less. It's the kind of thing that people might notice when they first meet you, but nobody really thinks twice about it after that. I just think of it as something that is a part of me now, although I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't grateful for the treatments that made it much lighter than it used to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve got a Port Wine Stain on my right forehead / eyebrow. Also had laser as a baby and again in early high school but the bruising that lasted for two or so weeks after was much more embarrassing than having the birth mark in the first place.</p>
<p>It used to bother me a lot but these days I barely even think about it.</p>
<p>One thing I wonder though is about the sun. I work outside (on a boat) and sometimes my birthmark tingles after a long day in the sun. Not sure if that’s all in my head or what but it’s weird.</p>
<p>I’ve also had a couple weird occasions where a “pimple” that I pop on the birthmark bellows up into a boil-like thing that looks really nasty. Had two of them surgically removed thus far, aged 24. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you could have a vascular disease like the others. I would definitely have that checked out. I would also make sure to used high SPF sunscreen on your birthmark. My brother has a birthmark on his nose and it would get really red in the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our daughter is so little still that the &quot;spotty-dotties&quot; are not a big deal - everyone around her knows she gets them, and out in public we might get a few looks but nobody has ever accused us of abusing her or anything. As she gets older we are hoping that if she wants to continue treatments they might only have to happen once or twice a year. And yes, our docs always remind us to put sunscreen on the PWS, and to wear hats if we can get her to keep them on.</p></div>		</li>
