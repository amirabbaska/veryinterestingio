			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to know what is the largest prince Rupert's drop ever made. Someone should drop a car sized glob of molten glass into a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Also, has anyone ever smashed a prince Rupert's drop without breaking the tail? What happens if you use a massive sledgehammer or an hydraulic press? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will break -- it's just far less spectacular.  The thing that makes Rupert's so impressive is that it's quite a large glass explosion for the small amount of input energy (breaking the tail).</p>
<p>If you smash it in a big press or something it'll break, but so would any other piece of tempered glass, so it's a bit less interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first glassblower you find, you just need to drop molten glass into a bucket of cold water. I don't expect they're shipped much because any shock nicking the tail and your package is full of shredded glass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd be interested to find out if it would be any more efficient, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably mean a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Neiko-5-Inch-Adjustable-Automatic-Breaker/dp/B008DXYOLC" target="_blank">center punch</a>, which is usually hardened steel.  This is what firefighters use to pop windows, and it works on the same principal.</p>
<p>Hard to imagine a pen would do this as easily, thought some 'high end' pens are advertised as window breakers as well.  Probably mostly advertising.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just meant could they be used so effectively as this ceramic or is there something special about the ceramic in how sharp the pieces can be or the like.  If you had a larger piece of industrial diamond and flung it at a car window, would it explode the same way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question speaks to what the difference between a rock and a &quot;ninja rock&quot; is.</p>
<p>A broken piece of spark plug has a Mohs hardness approaching that of diamond and most likely has sharp edges. this combination allows it to break the layers of the tempered windown.</p>
<p>A rock has a lower hardness than aluminum oxide and most likely has a more spherical shape.</p></div>		</li>
