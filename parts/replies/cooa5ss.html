			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to know what is the largest prince Rupert's drop ever made. Someone should drop a car sized glob of molten glass into a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Also, has anyone ever smashed a prince Rupert's drop without breaking the tail? What happens if you use a massive sledgehammer or an hydraulic press? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will break -- it's just far less spectacular.  The thing that makes Rupert's so impressive is that it's quite a large glass explosion for the small amount of input energy (breaking the tail).</p>
<p>If you smash it in a big press or something it'll break, but so would any other piece of tempered glass, so it's a bit less interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first glassblower you find, you just need to drop molten glass into a bucket of cold water. I don't expect they're shipped much because any shock nicking the tail and your package is full of shredded glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question speaks to what the difference between a rock and a &quot;ninja rock&quot; is.</p>
<p>A broken piece of spark plug has a Mohs hardness approaching that of diamond and most likely has sharp edges. this combination allows it to break the layers of the tempered windown.</p>
<p>A rock has a lower hardness than aluminum oxide and most likely has a more spherical shape.</p></div>		</li>
