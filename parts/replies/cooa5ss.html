			<p>I want to know what is the largest prince Rupert's drop ever made. Someone should drop a car sized glob of molten glass into a swimming pool.<br><br>Also, has anyone ever smashed a prince Rupert's drop without breaking the tail? What happens if you use a massive sledgehammer or an hydraulic press? </p>		</li>

			<p>It will break -- it's just far less spectacular.  The thing that makes Rupert's so impressive is that it's quite a large glass explosion for the small amount of input energy (breaking the tail).<br><br>If you smash it in a big press or something it'll break, but so would any other piece of tempered glass, so it's a bit less interesting.</p>		</li>

			<p>The first glassblower you find, you just need to drop molten glass into a bucket of cold water. I don't expect they're shipped much because any shock nicking the tail and your package is full of shredded glass.</p>		</li>

			<p>You can break your car window with a pen, so I'd only assume that a diamond could work in a similar way.<br><br>I'd be interested to find out if it would be any more efficient, though.</p>		</li>

			<p>You probably mean a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Neiko-5-Inch-Adjustable-Automatic-Breaker/dp/B008DXYOLC" target="_blank">center punch</a>, which is usually hardened steel.  This is what firefighters use to pop windows, and it works on the same principal.<br><br>Hard to imagine a pen would do this as easily, thought some 'high end' pens are advertised as window breakers as well.  Probably mostly advertising.</p>		</li>

			<p>EMT and (onetime) volunteer firefighter.<br><br>I think the idea behind the ball point pen is that the tip is exposed to friction during writing, so you want it to be hard enough that it doesn't wear. <a href="http://www.coursestuff.co.uk/ENVT1010/designed-world/bic-ball.html" target="_blank">The Bic Biro,</a> just to cite one example, uses a tungsten carbide ball in the tip. Tungsten carbide would prove quite useful in trying to pop a tempered glass window.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> notes that the ball in the tip is &quot;usually 0.7â€“1.2 mm and made of brass, steel or tungsten carbide,&quot; citing &quot;How Stuff Works&quot; as the source for that bit of info.<br><br>I suppose you might end up very sorry if you tried to punch through a tempered glass side window if the ball in your pen was a brass one.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; I suppose you might end up very sorry if you tried to punch through a tempered glass side window if the ball in your pen was a brass one.<br><br>Why?  Because it wouldn't work?  I'm just trying to make sure I understand the implication behind the statement... is brass not hard enough?  Wouldn't the pen just bust then?</p>		</li>

			<p>The whole idea is to use a penetrator that is substantially harder than the tempered glass; it's not the force you put into it- it's starting to damage the surface, causing the tempered glass to propagate cracks throughtout, breaking it.<br><br>Brass isn't hard enough. The reason the spark plug chip works is that the ceramic used is extremely hard. The tungsten carbide ball used in some pens is also hard enough to to it.</p>		</li>

			<p>For the record, a center punch is not exactly the correct tool for this. There are purpose-built window breakers that are similar, but do the job better, which is probably what you'll see firefighters and EMTs using. </p>		</li>

			<p>I just meant could they be used so effectively as this ceramic or is there something special about the ceramic in how sharp the pieces can be or the like.  If you had a larger piece of industrial diamond and flung it at a car window, would it explode the same way?</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't think it's so much as &quot;flinging it against the car window&quot; as it is applying pressure. Maybe someone who is actually qualified can correct me, but I'm pretty sure that the only thing you need is a hard object with a relatively low surface area that you can press against it.<br><br>Edit: Just saw that the question was about flinging it, so I guess this comment and my first reply is/was pretty useless.</p>		</li>

			<p>The question speaks to what the difference between a rock and a &quot;ninja rock&quot; is.<br><br>A broken piece of spark plug has a Mohs hardness approaching that of diamond and most likely has sharp edges. this combination allows it to break the layers of the tempered windown.<br><br>A rock has a lower hardness than aluminum oxide and most likely has a more spherical shape.</p>		</li>
