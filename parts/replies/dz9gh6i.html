			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 1930's, a flutist released his pet lyrebird into the wild, which had learned to mimic some of the songs the flutist played. The bird shared the music with other lyrebirds, who have passed it down over the generations, and those melodies are still sung by the birds in the wild.</p>
