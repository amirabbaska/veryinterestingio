			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: do you think it would be better/more healthy for our hair if we treated it like they did in the &quot;old days&quot; by not washing everyday with products that strip natural oils and instead use soft bristled brushes to just move the oil from the scalp down the strands?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Back then, women shampooed their hair once a week. Each week it was set on rollers and at night, pinned in pin curls or they slept with a silk hair covering or silk/satin pillow case. This protected the hair from breakage and a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Vinegar rinses are too harsh for more than once a week. Also, they would mix baking soda in the shampoo in their hands to help remove hair spray. It really works.</p>
<p>But, if you like to shampoo daily and wear your hair down and not traditionally styled, save the rinse for every few times. Boar brushes are absolutely the best thing for hair. They help distribute the oil from the scalp to the ends. Most people who have dry hair but feel their scalp gets greasy if they don't wash everyday would benefit from through brushing with boar hair brushes, once a week shampoo and vinegar rinse. It will help rebalance the scalps oil production.</p></div>		</li>
