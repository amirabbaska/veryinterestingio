<p>As it was believed that he had received far in excess of a fatal dose of radiation, Bugorski was taken to a clinic in Moscow where the doctors could observe his expected demise. However, Bugorski survived and even completed his Ph.D. There was virtually no damage to his intellectual capacity, but the fatigue of mental work increased markedly.[2]Bugorski completely lost hearing in the left ear and only a constant, unpleasant internal noise remained. The left half of his face was paralyzed due to the destruction of nerves.[1]He was able to function well, except for the fact that he had occasional complex partial seizures and rare tonic-clonic seizures.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get paid to operate a small particle accelerator. We produce deuterium, proton, and helium beams mostly.</p>
<p>If we want to tune the beam (by looking at the beam spot) we hit a quartz crystal with illuminates when hit with the beam. We have cameras hooked up to a glass pane to look into the vacuum chamber. So we can see the size and shape of the beam. </p>
<p>Last summer by chance I managed to make a triangular beam spot, which had been a joke goal of mine for a while. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've been there. A nasty beam spot can significantly complicate the analysis.</p></div>		</li>

It doesn't take much to make one. <a href="https://ww2.kqed.org/quest/2015/11/12/homegrown-particle-accelerators/" target="_blank">The first cyclotron fits in the palm of your hand (see half way down the page).</a>.
