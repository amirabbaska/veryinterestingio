<p>Because it's not something that you inherit. Straight people can have gay kids. Gay people (at least those who do have kids), can have straight children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, gay people are perfectly capable of having heterosexual sex if they desire to procreate, just like straight people will have children with partners they aren't particularly attracted to if they really, really just want to have children.</p>
<p>Homosexuality is about sexual attraction, not necessarily the absence of the desire to procreate.</p>
<p>Now, one would imagine that they'd have fewer accidental children and therefore fewer children in general.  However, making as many babies as possible isn't the most advantageous reproduction strategy, or we'd be breeding like rabbits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, bisexuality is a thing. There is a spectrum from 100% straight to 100% gay in which many people who aren't 100% straight have opposite-sex relationships with people that they're really attracted to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess that just falls under your second point, but still... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that individuals who do not procreate can still have a large impact on the family unit they live with.  Doing chores and hunting.  Think about if you had an aunt/uncle who didn't want kids but still helped raise you.  It happens a lot.  They might as well be homosexual for the purposes of this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the best theories I heard is that homosexuality is an unavoidable side effect of having genders. A lot of evidence points to homosexual brains being similar to their opposite gendered counterparts, i.e. a male body whose brain has female characteristics. Genders obviously are hugely advantageous for allowing adaptation, the fact that a certain percent of the healthy population are less likely to breed is small beans compared to the benefits of two genders.</p></div>		</li>
