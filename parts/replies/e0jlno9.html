			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but still. I think it’s very misleading, and also harmful, to advertise the plastics are being “recycled “ when they’re not really, because it teaches people that it’s OK to keep using as much plastic as they do, because they think it’s being recycled and not harming the environment as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And as I said above, the recycle/reuse processing is sometimes worse for the environment than using new products.  However, it's a selling feature now, and typically provides cheaper raw materials. </p>
<p>Ultimately understand recycling via private companies happens because it's profitable, not because it's the right choice environmentally.  Not that it even usually isn't, but environmental factors are secondary bonuses, profit is the motive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always.  There are a lot of recycle/reuse processes that are more damaging to the environment than simply replacing.  </p>
<p>Not to say recycling is bad, but just that it's often much more complex than people think.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Recycling yes, I can't really think of a re-use scenario where it's much worse than just throwing it away and making a new thing instead. Most metals make more sense to recycle. Glass, afaik, is very good to reuse but has a higher resource cost to recycle than make new. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reusing is good too. That speed bump could've been made from new plastics instead. Plastics generally can't be recycled an infinite amount of times. </p></div>		</li>
