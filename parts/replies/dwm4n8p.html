<p>I’ve been drinking 100% Kona coffee for the past week, and I have no idea how I’m ever going to go back to the mediocre (at best) stuff I drink at home. </p>
<p>Hot, cold...doesn’t matter. This stuff has totally changed my perspective on coffee. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife had a friend who lived in Hawaii and sent her some Kona.  It was hands down the best coffee I've ever had.  Regular coffee tastes like weak dishwater after that.  Do yourself a favor and buy a huge box of it and ship it to yourself.  All the &quot;Kona&quot; I've tried locally tastes like crap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's essentially slowly brewing over 12 hours in a mason jar in the fridge with a coarse grind.
It comes out with less acidity, but very smooth. It also packs a punch. Very strong flavour and caffeine.

Here is what I found from a quick Google search: </p>
<p>A FEW TIPS FOR MAKING COLD BREW COFFEE</p>
<p>Grind your beans at a medium coarse consistency ( the same consistency for brewing Chemex coffee). You don’t want finely ground coffee beans, which is what you’d use for drip coffee. I recommend this coffee grinder, if you’re looking to grab one.</p>
<p>You’ll brew at a ratio of 4:1. Four cups of water to one cup of coffee beans. If you want more cold brew, just double this. And if you’re using a mason jar, you’ll need to use slightly less to get it to fit – 3 cups of water to 3/4 cups coffee beans. Just keep the ratio consistent.</p>
<p>You can steep the coffee in pretty much any container (though I recommend glass). I use a mason jar, but you could also use a french pressor KitchenAid even has a nifty cold brew maker.</p>
<p>Use filtered water for the cleanest cup of cold brew.</p>
<p>Steep for at least 12 hours. After that, you can play around with the flavor. If you’d like it stronger, brew it longer – up to 24 hours. But I find that 12-15 hours usually keeps most coffee lovers happy.</p>
<p>While the cold brew can steep on your countertop at room temperature, once you’ve strained it, keep the concentrate in the refrigerator. This will keep it fresh for a week or so. You could go a little longer, but the flavor is best when consumed in the first week.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible that the mason jar helps avoid that. (I'm just guessing). The beans have oils and gasses in them that are released when you grind them. That's why you should avoid buying pre ground coffee if you can.</p></div>		</li>
