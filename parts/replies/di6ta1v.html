<p>This is plain wrong. If we're calculating average acceleration, we need total change in velocity and duration of impact. </p>
<p>The duration will be much less than one second. I don't know anything about fly crashes, but we can ballpark it by dividing the fly's length by his speed. Basically, how long would it take for his butt to catch up to his now stationary face? This is rougly 1cm / 2m/s = 0.005 seconds that the fly is in contact with the window. </p>
<p>Also, flies bounce off of windows. If Luke Flywalker is traveling at 2.2 m/s before the impact, he's probably moving backwards at 1.1 m/s afterwards, giving a total change of velocity of 3.3 m/s. </p>
<p>Put all of this together, and his average acceleration during the crash was more like 660 m/s^2 .</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not though. Starting velocity resting on a plate is 0m/s and the ending (and also maximum) velocity at the precise instant of impact is 2.235m/s . Acceleration is (Vf - Vo)/(time) = (2.235m/s - 0m/s)/(1 second) = 2.235m/s^2 . </p>
<p>Also the duration of impact (impulse) <strong>is</strong> much less than 1s. The idea was to create a simple ELI5 scenario where the maximum velocity scalar is achieved exactly 1 second after takeoff and at the precise moment of colliding with the window assuming everything worked out just right. The fly starts from rest and accelerates to a max velocity <strong>over the course of 1 second</strong> and then hits the window at the precise instant that that velocity is reached. we aren't trying to get Luke to the moon so I watered it down to exclude things like drag, energy transfer, and the fact that the glass window is a deformative body.</p>

<p><strong>So you're telling me a 12mg fly is routinely pulling (660/9.8) ~67 g's at the time of hitting a window?</strong> The whole point was to show that even at max speed in the shortest integer amount of time, the acceleration when colliding with something will never produce enough force to do any significant damage.</p>
<p>EDIT: Think simple Newtonian kinematics. I wasn't trying to bust out my old text books bc beer. </p>
<p>2nd EDIT: Re-running the calcs using energy transfer (<a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/04/crashing-into-wall/" target="_blank">something like this</a>), I see where you're going, but <strong>the point remains that they are too small and move too slowly to do any real damage to their bodies</strong>.</p>
<p>Computing max acceleration using the energy method would yield (2.235(m/s) / 0.01(m)) * 2.235(m/s)) = 499.5225 m/s^2 (~51 g's). Multiplying this max acceleration by a mass of 0.000012(kg) yeilds a Force of 0.00599427 Newtons, which translates to 0.001348 lbs of force, or ~0.000611 kg. This would subject the fly to a force roughly 51 times it's own body weight (0.000611(kg) / 0.000012 (kg) = 50.916), whereas my original example would only subject it to a force of just 23% of it's body weight (0.000002735162 (kg) / 0.000012 (kg) = 0.2279). To be honest, my original example seems more reasonable for this ELI5. A fly accelerating at 500m/s^2 would reach 500m/s after 1 second but only 2.5m/s after the 0.005 seconds that you computed, making the computations more similar to my original example in which the velocity is 2.235m/s.</p>
<p><strong>A fly survives a window impact 99% of the time in my experience and it seems unlikely that this would be the case if it was subjecting it's body to a force equal to 51 times what gravity does every single time it collided with an object at full speed.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>51 (or 67)  g's seems totally reasonable to me. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/gmp1208/speed-freaks-of-nature-the-fastest-accelerating-animals/" target="_blank">This article</a> says that leafhoppers sustain accelerations of 700 g's when jumping. As you note, this isn't fatal to flies because of their very low mass. </p></div>		</li>
