			<div class="markdown"><p>I reported heavy smoke a little way behind the parking lot I was in a few weeks ago. I named the wrong town as the store I was going to had another location nearby that popped into my head. As I was correcting myself the operator told me where I was and set me up with the correct FD.
I didn’t think about it at the time but she knew where I was calling from before I did.
(They knew about the fire and were handling it fyi.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had the opposite experience.  Last time I called 911, I had pulled over into a strip mall and there were no road signs immediately nearby so I wasn't sure the name of the street.  They claimed they were unable to send anyone to my location unless I could give them an <em>exact</em> address - naming a handful of stores in the strip mall and the city weren't good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a dispatcher, it really can just depend on the situation. Sometimes somebodies phone will show where they are in a 6 meter circle the second I pick up, sometimes the phone will never push its actual location even if we are on the phone for a few minutes. if you don't have the help from the phone, you might really have to ask a lot of questions to get a location where are 100% sure is correct. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Australia a boy died because he was lost in the bush (woods) and a dispatcher refused to help without an exact address. He knew roughly what area of the National Park he was in but there is no address for a bush track. She eventually just hung up on him as he didn't comply with the address requirement.  Later the boy died from exposure.  I think the agency is still trying to defend themselves today, claiming there couldn't possibly be anything wrong with this system ... :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I called 911 on what I assumed to be a drunk driver, and the dispatcher knew what road I was on and corrected me when I gave her the wrong route (I said 4 instead of 14 or something). Is there really no GPS thing pinging my phone? How would she know that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the phone companies make huge amounts of money by selling services to foreign telecoms who are out of our law's reach. </p>
<p>Those foreign telecoms dont require verified information to sign up, they'll take stolen creditcards and whatever you tell them. When its traced back to one of their numbers, all they have is a stolen CC and a fake address. But in the mean time, they've stolen 200 more CC's and dont care that one got burned</p>
<p>They have a huge financial incentive to allow terrorists and swatters etc to use their services.</p>
<p>They could identify which phone networks the calls originate from, and cut them off, or add a new &quot;flag&quot; to those calls that each customer can opt into or not.... but that would drastically hurt the scammer's ability to make phonecalls and thus, reduce profit margins for our telecom companies, who are legally allowed to donate unlimited amounts of money to political campains</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All new cell phones, for over a decade, are required to have location services for 911.</p>
<p>The legislation requiring this followed some young people on Long Island Sound losing their boat and drowning, despite their successful calls to 911 for help, whereby the 911 operator had no idea where the kids were. (There were other problems that happened during this incident on the 911 end of things, as well.)</p>

<p>You mean trilaterated. Triangulation uses multiple directional antennas, whereas trilateration uses multiple omni (or anything that isn't unidirectional really) and determines location via time of flight of the signal, or relative signal strength.</p></div>		</li>

After some sweet maneuvers and mind tricks I lost them and headed home. Bout an hour later the cops knocked at my door (like 5 miles away from the call) to see if we were all right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on, with the proliferation of VoIP systems. It would be criminally easy to setup a fake number, connect over VPN, and make a call. Many telephony systems aren't the most secure either. Purchasing a SIP number means you'd get to fill out the E-911 information and can put whatever information in that would get passed to operators.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In addition, when ordering PSTN numbers, the Emergency Service Address and Emergency Service Number (think forced caller ID) can be set to any valid number/address. It is much easier to spoof this information than most people think. </p></div>		</li>

<p>“Traced” is a movie term, in this context. Your IP address could certainly be found in the logs though, and they could use that with a time stamp to contact the ISP and find out who had the IP at the time.</p></div>		</li>
