			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the design, there might also be a lot of eg. water around the reactor, absorbing much of the energy. Could either make it really unexciting, or turn it into a steam explosion.</p>
<p>Either way, it would really just be like any other industrial accident - the radioactive release would be negligible because so little fuel is in the reactor at a time (whereas a fission power plant has <strong>years</strong> worth of fuel, plus spent fuel/waste from prior years, sitting in the core).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The air would rush in to equalize the pressure, that's extra energy compared to what the plasma will release. In the video they mention 12 kg of TNT, though they calculated based on a &quot;house sized&quot; volume which may or may not be as large as the ITER reactor depending what country they used for this example. The ITER vacuum vessel has an interior volume of 1,600 m^^3 according to the official page.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For reference, 12kg of TNT is about 48MJ of energy, which is just over 1kg of petrol (gasoline). The nature of the energy release is important, if its converted effectively into a rapidly expanding hot pressure wave, it would behave like TNT. </p>
<p>A more likely scenario is that the plasma radiates (and conducts, convects) thermal energy to the shell of the reactor. If the energy transfer is slow enough, thermal conductivity of the shell is high enough and its adequately cooled, nothing will happen. If the energy transfer is much faster then the conduction of heat away from the shell, parts of the shell will ablate info the plasma cooling it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's picture a scenario where the fuel regulator fails and sends a bunch more fuel into the reaction chamber than intended. Maybe even all of the available fuel.    </p>
<p>What would most likely happen in that situation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The plasma will likely stop &quot;burning&quot;, as in there will no longer be gain in power and the device will consume more energy than it produces. It's difficult to achieve net production from fusion, it would be nice if it was like a fire on which we can just add however much wood we like and it would just keep going. Alas, it's not a star, it's a contained plasma that took a lot of energy to heat up and stop it from dissipating the heat to the walls of the chamber before enough nuclear fusion reactions start happening.</p></div>		</li>
