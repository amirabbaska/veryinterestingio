			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't live in an HOA thankfully but I do have a huge ass yard to take care of. I inherited my mother's house which was my family's house. My mother <em>loved</em> her house and her yard and was constantly working in it. Plants, flowers, trees, everything. She had several citrus trees in the back for years plus huge oak trees. All of that stuff is gone. My son had it all removed thankfully except for the oak trees. </p>
<p>I am not a young woman and I don't enjoy lawn work. I don't want to spend my time messing with plants and stuff so the fewer the better. I have a couple of potted plants on the front porch and some shrubs in the front but they are low maintenance. I have a riding mower for the huge back yard and I recently purchased a self-propelled mower for the front. For a few years I was having to drive the riding mower out of the back gate, onto the side road and to my front yard. Screw all that. The front isn't very large so it isn't hard to mow. I still have to do the weed whacking, trimming the shrubs once in a while and blowing off the driveway, porch and sidewalk. I live in Florida and I hate <em>hate</em> yard work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya most of us don't give a shit, in fact I only mow mine when we get a notice from the fire dept to mow or be fined. We try to see how high it gets.</p>
<p>Once we had to hire a team of lawn professionals and they asked permission to take photos for their yelp page. </p>
<p>One guy stood in the middle for a photo and you could only see his face. He was about 5'7&quot;.</p>
<p>Yes: my neighbors probably hate me but it's ok since I hate them too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It stands for Home Owner's Association. In theory, they are a group of people made up of home owners in a certain areas. It's common with town homes but entire neighborhoods can be one too.</p>
<p>Their purpose is the keep the value of the neighborhood up. So they usually have rules like  preventing you from painting your house, or lawn services, or even community pool, gym, road repair, waste service, snow shoveling, etc... basically to keep everything nice and tidy.</p>
<p>They get the money to do this by charging every home a certain amount of money to provide these services. For home owners, this is usually a good thing IF the HOA does their job right (which in many cases don't).</p>
<p>If you're the kind of person that enjoy the freedom to do whatever you want to YOUR house, HOA is not for you. Though you're risking the devaluation of your house.</p></div>		</li>
