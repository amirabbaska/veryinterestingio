			<div class="markdown"><p>Autistics people don't lack empathy- we lack the ability to <em>express</em> empathy. </p>
<p>Example: a kid killed himself at our school back in October. I couldn't demonstrate how bad I felt not because I didn't <em>feel</em> bad, but because I'm not really sure how. I don't cry easily, but I still felt bad inside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah totally,it's like recognised as different forms of empathy. Autistic folk can struggle to explain WHY someone feels a way but know they are feeling it and often feel it too, sometimes to greater degree. Psychopaths have the opposite they know why people think/feel the way the do but are unbothered by it and don't feel the same emotions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience working with autistic children is that they feel EVERYTHING so much more strongly,  there's no self protection filter or outlet valve, so their system becomes overloaded. It's so awful that more people don't understand this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is. I felt absolutely horrible because everyone else was crying and I wasn't. I don't react like everyone else does! I feel as much and maybe more than the average person, as you said. I started crying when I watched a movie where a dog got hurt in Kindergarten. People can't tell me I don't have empathy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;common&quot; pathway is:</p>
<p>Oppositional Defiant Disorder&gt; Conduct Disorder&gt; Antisocial Personality Disorder</p>
<p>Many people with ODD and CD also are diagnosed with ADHD. ADHD does not cause sociopathic/psychopathic traits. The diagnosis criteria does not even cover those traits any more than most other psychiatric disorders. </p>
<p>In sum, many people diagnosed with ODD/CD/ASPD also carry, or previously carried an ADHD diagnosis. In some cases it's mainly because their behavior was labelled as &quot;impulsive&quot; and &quot;hyperactive&quot; and someone missed out on the other traits. So, if you are freaking out that you, or your child, with ADHD is going to go totally psycho, it's unlikely. </p></div>		</li>
