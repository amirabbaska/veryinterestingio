			<div class="markdown"><p>HDR is homology-directed repair. This is a major area of focus in the lab. This is a process, by which new sequences can effectively be &quot;pasted&quot; into a CRISPR editing site. Successful HDR offers enormous flexibility to insert or re-write targeted genome sequences. These precise modifications in human immune cells could be used to correct mutations that cause severe disease or &quot;program&quot; cells to have specific disease-treating properties. We recently published an approach use CRISPR to achieve high rates of HDR in human T cells without the use of viruses to introduce DNA sequences: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0326-5.epdf?author_access_token=hTOPYXbVI_zEiZj3d3PwlNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PJkSBqpqUc27ivPcWBqjm5ofw-5kxKHrta_dUB6FvTY9t_KLUx2qfLfoD4thaDTsluDkI1J4N9CcP39muRRXSxxxHx8VX0Tw7o18py_Z30QA%3D%3D" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0326-5.epdf" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0326-5.epdf</a></a>. </p>
<p>We are in pre-clinical stages of exploring the therapeutic potential of these HDR-modified T cells as described in a recent article about the lab: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/health/gene-editing-cancer.html" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/health/gene-editing-cancer.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/health/gene-editing-cancer.html</a></a>.</p>
<p>We are working hard to push therapeutic applications forward, while also continuing to optimize the efficiency of HDR in targeted human cells.</p>

<p>We are focused on applying CRISPR in general (including HDR applications) to human &quot;somatic&quot; cells and not to embyros or &quot;germline cells&quot; including sperm or egg. My lab is primarily focused on achieving high rates of HDR – this molecular paste function – in human immune cells outside of the body.</p>
