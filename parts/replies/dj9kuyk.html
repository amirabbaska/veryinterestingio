			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also from Australia and this question confused me a bit. I've never heard of someone having a turkey sandwich. It's always ham or chicken. Then again we don't have Thanksgiving and usually don't have a turkey for Christmas so the turkey industry here has to be pretty small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of my friend's mothers would ask me, as a young kid, if I'd like a chicken sandwich. I was brought up on delicious leftover roast chicken sandwiches, so enthusiastically agreed. Most of the time it'd end up being a dreaded chicken roll sandwich, and to be polite I'd miserably have to force it down. I've never had a worse eating experience than that. I absolutely hated the stuff, and I don't understand how anyone can spend any amount of money on that crap. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Turkey meat was a niche</p>

<p>My Dad and many of my parent's friends were Americans working at Pine Gap in Alice Springs in the late 70's. They ordered a bunch of turkeys for Thanksgiving from a local butcher. The guy thought it was an American holiday thing and ordered in more for the Fourth of July. Luckily they felt sorry for him and bought them.</p></div>		</li>
