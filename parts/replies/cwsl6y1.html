			<div class="markdown"><p>It also has to do with the way people's brains handle greatness, this goes both ways for conspiracy theories:</p>
<p>JFK was a great man, an important man, my brain can't accept that he was killed in a mundane way by a random unimportant guy. It must have taken a grand conspiracy to kill someone as important as the president. </p>
<p>9/11 was tragic, I can't accept that some random wack jobs could just hijack some planes and killed all those people. It must have been some grand conspiracy. </p>
<p>A man walking on the moon is fantastical, I can't accept that we had the ability to do that 1969, it must have been an elaborate hoax.</p>
<p>Basically there are two kinds of conspiracy theorist: Those who need to take complex things and make them simple (the moon landing was faked) and those who need to take simple things and make them complex (9/11 was an inside job). </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a really really smart way of looking at it. </p>
<p>I shall now use this when talking to people about conspiracies, and pretend that it was I who said it.</p></div>		</li>

It goes into the psychology and biology of why people believe what they believe even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes there's more to it, though. There are often political associations with it. With Holocaust denial, there's often an anti-Semitic agenda there. With 9/11 conspiracy theories, it's either anti-Bush or a need to create a sense of security in response to a tragedy that hit close to home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Belief is rarely about accepting proof and largely just a matter of accepting what someone <em>wants</em> to be true. They convince themselves that whatever argument they like is valid and based on solid evidence but it usually just comes down to whether they like the idea. </p>
<p>Look at anti-vaxxers. There was never any real proof that vaccines caused autism, but people like feeling empowered by unique knowledge and uneducated people are especially susceptible to fearing things they don't understand, like chemistry.</p>
<p>You can see the same stubborn mentality in young-earth creationists, conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers, moon-landing deniers, holocaust deniers, white supremacists, 9/11 truthers, etc. They all do the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even when you can <em>show</em> them, it won't work for some people. They will just come up with an excuse to refuse the &quot;trip to China&quot;. There are flat-earthers today in the era of satellites and space stations! Apparently some flat-earth redditors have been offered, on reddit, the chance to personally go up high enough that the curvature of the earth becomes definitely noticeable (this doesn't require going into space). They disengage and stop talking to that person. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can definitely detect it on a plane if you're lucky with weather! You can also, from ground level, just look at things disappearing over the horizon, the classic example is the bottom part of ships will disappear before the top. I guess that one requires the person to be capable of logic though. </p>
<p>I just don't know, you read some arguments to a certain point and just decide there must be mental illness involved.</p></div>		</li>
