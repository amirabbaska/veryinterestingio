			<div class="markdown"><p>Just look &quot;beyond&quot; the word.  Although that might be hard with no depth perception.  It's not really looking &quot;beyond&quot; it but more looking at the center of the word instead of reading it left to right like you normally would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Move close to the screen and the focus your eye on infinity</p>
<p>Or move a bit away and focus as close as possible.</p>
<p>Most people can voluntarily focus there eye(s) at whatever distance they chose by simply imagining looking at something very close/very far.</p>
<p>Or to reproduce crossing your eyes: look at the tip of your nose and focus on it as best as you can, everything further away should become a blurry blob.</p>
<p>And another way to trick the test is by focusing on a single corner on every word. But that can still fail because the word recognition engine in your brain is rather strong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the brain is plastic and once it gets wired by words (or other experiences) there is no going back.  Getting re-wired by learning in the point of brains (and being able to breathe and walk and see is also awesome, but that is  different story)  </p>
<p>This kind of happens with words in general.  There is another psych experiment <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/loftus-palmer.html" target="_blank">here</a> where you can read about how words can change what you are SURE you saw.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why?
The words themselves have a strong influence over your ability to say the color. The interference between the different information (what the words say and the color of the words) your brain receives causes a problem.
There are two theories that may explain the Stroop effect:
Speed of Processing Theory: the interference occurs because words are read faster than colors are named.
Selective Attention Theory: the interference occurs because naming colors requires more attention than reading words.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>now translate that to movie audio subtitles. There isn't a visual cue (okay there - is, the moving lips of the actors) but audio cues - which are also words... then why do we end up reading them instead of focusing on the scene and listening to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My own theory is that text get translated automatically to words by our brain unconsciously, but naming color requires more conscious brain process. It is easier to look at colors and don't have their name inside your head than to look at some text but don't actually read it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brains takes visual stimuli as more important in most things, eg. <a href="https://youtu.be/G-lN8vWm3m0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/G-lN8vWm3m0</a>. Probably stems from when we used less vocal and more hand signal communications (but who knows). Basically the answer is how we are wired, the signal is just stronger. The area that processes the information is stronger. Like all electrical systems the stronger one guides</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmm, I'm not sure this Stroop effect is quite the same thing. With subtitles, the word you read vs the word your hear are the same. They convey the same information, but OP is saying the brain prefers to read vs listen.</p>
<p>With this Stroop thing, the opposite is happening. You're being presented with 2 opposing sets of information; the word as you read it vs the color the word is written in. It seems only natural the 2nd list takes longer to get through because you have to stop and make a decision about each word and which bit of info is actually relevant.</p>
<p>I'd like to see if there is any difference between reading a list of colors written in their corresponding color vs listing off the colors of a group of generic shapes or reading the list of color all written in a neutral color. I feel like these would be a more accurate comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this needs to be higher up. The stroop effect is two kinds of visual information, one taking priority over the other in brain processing. This is about visual vs audio. </p>
<p>You could do an experiment with friends, /u/Cashforcrickets, in which you change the subtitle for a scene in which something is being described. Detective Munch says the suspect was wearing a brown jacket, but change the sub to blue. Then ask friends what they remember about the suspect after watching the scene. It's always worth confirming that what you notice about your own brain processing is universal and not idiosyncratic. </p>
<p>Sorry if this covers stuff others have said already.  </p></div>		</li>
