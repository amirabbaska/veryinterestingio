			<div class="markdown"><p>It's even stronger than that : the mold in blue cheese (or at lest the original moldy cheese, French Roquefort) is actually an antibiotic fungus (pennicilum) and its family byproducts is used as medicine (pennicilin).

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been told since I was child that I am allergic to penicillin. Not deathly or anything, I don't wear a bracelet, but enough to have a bad reaction. I love blue cheese of all sorts and never hold back. Would the fungus on cheese be enough to cause a reaction? I've never experienced one in waking memory and I know some allergies over time, but now I'm paranoid about blue cheese.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be allergic to a specific type of pennicilin, different than <em>roqueforti</em> ? Also once it's in the cheese and it gets old, chemical reactions might change molecules that you are allergic to ? If you don't feel any problem when you eat blue cheese them I'm pretty sure it's fine.</p>
<p>For instance I'm allergic to something inside cucumbers but I have no problems with gherkins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's wired because I've been told that I'm allergic to penicillin and have been putting that on my release forms of all kinds that ask for allergies, my whole life, but goddamn I love blue cheese and can eat it alone by the handful and have homemade salad with blue cheese for lunch every single day for work the last year or so </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can cause a reaction but doesn't sound like it's enough to notice. Brie is another cheese made with penicillium mould. Penicillin is the byproduct of the mould on the cheese so maybe since it's more dilluted you aren't eating as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on how hard the food is and if the mycelia can penetrate into the food. Hard cheese they mold doesn't grow deep, soft cheese don't do it. Same with bread, way too many air pockets and a preference for toxic mold to infest those. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh god i saw that when i was a kid. He inhaled some of the bread mold spores into his sinuses where they spawned and slowly ate his face from the inside. When he went to the doctor they had to remove his face and open all his sinuses up to disinfect them. The worst part was his eyes, they simply had to remove them. Dude woke up with a large hole in face and no eyesight.</p>

<p>I've treated a man with a less severe treatment, his entire nose was removed exposing the sinus. Pretty amazing and terrible at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
