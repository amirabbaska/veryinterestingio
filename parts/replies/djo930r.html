			<div class="markdown"><p>You should mention that you can have a longer stroke on the V8 of the same volume. Bore and stroke are the two variables in displacement. You can make the stroke really, really short with a really large bore piston and vice versa. If you want you can shorten the stroke with a larger piston or lengthen the stroke with a smaller piston. A long stroke will make high revving more difficult. Just making it a V8 doesn't automatically get you a shorter stroke with the same engine displacement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that, but generally cars are made to be square (1:1 bore and stroke) or undersquare (stroker motors). Only Subaru with their Boxter engines are oversquare (until very recently, because increasing stroke meant a wider car), and Honda's old VTEC engines which were oversquare to hit high RPMs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you're saying,  but I think comparing the redlines of an ancient,  iron block, pushrod (2 valve/cylinder) engine to that of an  OHC (4 valve/cylinder) engine, especially one that runs on premium,  is a bit apples and oranges,  no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't the 3800 v6 also a 90 degree angle as well or was it 60? If it was 90, with pushrods and balance shafts it's actually remarkable it revved even that high. I do remember it won several Wards top 10 engines awards.  My mom had one in her grand am and it was stout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really true. Max RPM is set by cam profile, head flow and valve-train mechanics. For example the Nissan 370z is a 3.5 V6 that revs to 7500.</p>
<p>You can get displacement by using a larger bore than stroke, but optimally you're looking for around a 1:1 ratio, or a bit more bore than stroke (oversquare), and the max engine speed from the bottom end is determined by stroke length. So your displacement roughly decides the amount of cylinders you'll use.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That just sets how well the engine works at certain rpm-bands.</p>
<p>What sets max rpm is almost always the stroke length. Sure you can have a valvetrain limitation, but if you get past that, like the pneumatic valve springs in F1/MotoGP, you still have to shorten the stroke. Even the 18000+ rpm F1 V10s had an average piston speed in the 25 m/s range, because of an extremely short stroke (just over 40mm) compared to bore diameter (a.k.a. oversquare design).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spot on, piston speed is the ultimate limiting factor for RPM ceiling. everything else can be designed around that for particular usage, but piston speed is the limiting factor (which is determined by stroke as you say).</p>
<p>Another slight addition to this, the weight of an engine overall is mostly determined by how well the piston is designed. I can't remember the exact %'s but it was something significant. Heavier piston needs a stronger/heavier rod, needs a stronger/heavier crank, needs stronger/heavier bearings, casings etc.</p>
<p>That's partially why certain brands of motorcycle end up so heavy, rushed/poor piston optimisation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well then I guess we could say max RPM is set rod metallurgy, ie for a given engine it'll rev best with titanium rods. But then that would be a bit disingenuous.</p>
<p>Realistically, if you want your average road car to rev out past 6-7k it's going to be valve springs and lifters that are holding it back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the end of the day, max RPM is determined by piston velocity and connecting rod strength. The second upper limit is the valve springs, which if they're not stiff enough will not close on time and cause valve float. The third upper limit is the cam profile and head flow, which is the effective redline that many manufacturers go with. </p></div>		</li>
