			<div class="markdown"><p>They definitely are. I have some organic beeswax chap stick that I use from Etsy (I’m allergic to some preservatives in mass produced lip products). I google each ingredient to see if was harmful when my dog had chapped lips. It was all good and they were fine a day or two later. I’ve bought some since and just them for my dogs when we are planning spending lengthy time outside with chillly temps. </p></div>		</li>
