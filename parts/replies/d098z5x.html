<p>backdoors are not always intentionally coded into websites </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You seem to be confusing &quot;vulnerability&quot; and &quot;backdoor&quot;; a backdoor is <em>by definition</em> a deliberately-created bypass of access control mechanisms. This could be something like <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html" target="_blank">CWE-798</a>, where a hard-coded credential is in place; or something like <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/489.html" target="_blank">CWE-489</a>, where a backdoor was inserted for debug purposes but escaped to production.</p>
<p>There are <em>definitely</em> other ways to bypass access controls; from screwing up the implementation (category <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/723.html" target="_blank">CWE-723</a>, e.g.), to things like SQLi and XSS that you mention. But those are <strong>not</strong> backdoors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the example.I've given that is a pretty solid description of a process by which an exe can be installed to bypass authentication. I'm not confusing terms here. That can be considered a backdoor in the malicious sense of the term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of learning about the technical side of security is learning deeply how particular technologies work -- a deep understanding of hardware and software architecture, common platforms (OS, things like Java and .NET and the C/C++ environments, networking, etc.) will help you understand the rules of play.</p>
<p>And that's really what technical security practice ultimately is: developing a sense for what the rules <em>really are</em>, not what <em>they claim to be</em>.  The best pen testers are basically rules lawyers with deep technical knowledge.</p>
<p>That said, a good overview of penetration testing isn't a terrible way to start thinking about the technical side of security, and <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/pentesting" target="_blank">Georgia Weidman's book</a> is a pretty decent place to get that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, if you look up anything on penetration testing for beginners that would be a good start. You could also look at how to use various security tools and pen testing OS distributions.
Don't try to run before you can walk though and I'm not encouraging you to do anything illegal! </p></div>		</li>
