			<div class="markdown"><p>Former WalMart cashier here. In case you've ever thought about yelling at the cashier or manager for there being too few registers open, know this: Often, we actually can't just open more registers. When all front end cashiers (as the official title goes) report for their shift, you punch-in back in the stockroom, but you don't just go up to a register and log on. You actually have to go up to one of those price scanners (the ones that never seem to work and always give you a different price than listed on the label of the product) and you scan the back of your name tag, and you actually have to request a register from the computers in Bentonville, Arkansas. There are scheduled allotments of registers by hour and by day, and if the specific store goes over those allotments, they get some sort of blemish on their record. Too many of those overages can result in fines/ management changes for the store. Basically, corporate has determined how long of a line people are willing to sit through before they leave their cart and walk out, and calculate per-store average customer loads by hour, day, and season. With this formula, they can determine how many registers a specific store is allowed to have open at any given time. That is why the lines are always horrifically long, but you always stay and go through them anyways, just like WalMart knew you would. Oh and the reason that the lanes open seem so random - thats because on any given day, at least one or two registers are broken, and sometimes one of them is just covered in crap (usually returns, sometimes your kid's discarded McFlurry). (The price scanner actually does tell you what register to go to, ostensibly to reduce overuse on certain machines, but thats often ignored by managers/ CSMs for the aforementioned reasons)</p>
<p>As an interesting aside, on the back of the badges that we scan is your employee ID number and name. They're actually printed on a price label just like the ones that are on the metal shelving telling you the price of a box of cereal. Its always struck me as an interesting commentary on how Walmart actually thinks of their employees - they literally wear price tags just like the goods for sale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to this that Wal-Mart has zero concerns of wasting money. Certain departments make so much money that other parts of the store can consistently lose money as long as it would make a customer happy and get them to go to another department. </p>
<p>I worked at the Garden Department of a Wal-Mart in Maryland, and saw the financial reports once. There was one garden department in the state that made a profit. The others just burn money, but they keep them there in hopes that shoppers who buy flowers buy groceries at the store as well instead of going somewhere else.</p>
<p>If you want another example, when it comes to stolen or damaged products, stores aren't judged on how much gets stolen. Stores don't start doing anything about what they are wasting unless they lose over $2 million annually.</p>
<p>Edit: 2 not 20</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wal-Mart doesn't want to waste money. If they could run their garden center at a profit, they would, and they will still do everything to minimize their losses. </p>
<p>The practice of having some items, or even entire departments run in the red is what is called a loss leader, and a lot of study goes into what they will use as one. A great example is diapers. The cheapest place to get diapers is usually a baby store. That, on the surface, would seem counter-intuitive, but it will get people to make the trip there more often than they would if they were the same price as they are at your grocery store, and while you are in there now, they have a good shot of you making some additional purchases, and keeping their store in your mind as where you can go for all of that.</p>
<p>Garden centers in general are, i suspect, a tough department to run. If I want GOOD stuff, i go to a legit garden supply place. If i want OK stuff, i go to homedepot\lowes\walmart. Pricing is pretty much dead on between the 3 of them when you are talking about stuff like mulch, top soil, basic plants, etc. </p>
<p>As for stolen and damage products (shrink) there is ultimately a point of diminishing returns on trying to prevent it. If everything of value is under lock and key, it hurts the image of your store, and complicates the shopping process. If you have large teams of competent security, it costs money. If you want to prosecute everything to the max, it takes time and money. Generally what most places are concerned with is organized shrink and internal theft. That can become really costly, and at the same time, its far easier to catch than some kid stuffing something down his pants. </p>
<p>Back in the day when i was in the industry, the item we had the most issues with in terms of shrink was baby formula. Relatively high value item, and you had a good sob story of &quot;i needed to feed my baby&quot; if you get caught, which of course, makes you feel terrible about it. People would try and sneak it out, counterfeit coupons\vouchers, etc. But it turns out that the reason people stole it was because it was easy to move on the street and convert to cash. So you were like, &quot;Hey, screw you, you baby food stealing jerk&quot; but then you considered that there were some people down the line willing to buy black market baby food to give to their kids for one reason or another, and would get all sad again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Baby formula is a heavy shrink category, but in my experience, the biggest by an enormous margin is cosmetics. Formula is a necessity, and electronics are big-ticket and popular, but cosmetics carry an absurd value relative to their size and slip into pockets and purses oh-so-easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've shopped on Christmas and the day after at several Wal-Marts (my dad is a terrible planner for the holidays) and even then, not all the registers are open. I'd say the lines were probably 12-15 people deep, and probably 75 to 80% were open. </p></div>		</li>
