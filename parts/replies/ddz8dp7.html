			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any hypothesis as to <em>why</em> PIE was this way? It seems to me like some languages tend to simplify over time, for example Latin lost the neuter gender and English then lost grammatical gender altogether. But then why the original complexity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Beyond any obvious physiological difference or animacy, there's no real explanation. Languages just happen. Most at least. You have some modern examples of &quot;natural conlangs&quot; like Hebrew or Arabic, but that's it. I assume that some historical peoples just came to express different genders, reflecting that in their languages. </p>
<p>It's not that old languages are inherently complex; languages just have different cycles. Some become simpler, others become more complex. Gender doesn't make complexity alone. English has plenty of nuances that make it complex, it just look simple because you're a native speaker. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, correct on both counts. My intention was to give a better example than <em>das Weib</em> since that is a rather archaic term that has negative connotations(similar to <em>shrew</em> i guess?), but <em>das Maedchen</em> does indeed mean <em>the girl</em> not <em>the woman</em>. It's still gender neutral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was simply the first example that came to mind. It also demonstrates my point better, since <em>-chen</em> is inherently neuter, unlike the premise of <em>Weib</em>.</p></div>		</li>
