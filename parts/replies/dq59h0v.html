			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't the value that you have to substract from your terms to make the groups have equal values get bigger and bigger for every 1/2 that you add? If this were the case, the value that you would have to substract from your terms would approach the 1/2 that you are adding to your series, which would bring you back to the original problem where the values that you're actually adding in your series approaches zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m not sure about the series of numbers that are subtracted, but the amount you add never approaches zero. It was always be 1/2, the number of terms you need to add together to get 1/2 increases, but there will always be more terms to add, because infinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8... is always &lt;= the harmonic series for the same number of terms, so if the first sequence diverges the harmonic series must also diverge.</p></div>		</li>
