			<div class="markdown"><p>This is going to sound extremely unscientific, but for men, does the ability to get a hard on help prevent urination?</p>
<p>I find in the mornings when I'm desperate for a piss I have the hardest Morning glory to go with it. I often wake up thinking 'young me would have pissed himself for sure'. </p>
<p>Obviously anyone who's ever tried to piss with an erection would know it's damn near impossible. </p></div>		</li>

<p>During the first three years of life, bladder storage capacity increases disproportionately relative to body surface area. By four years of age, most children void five to six times per day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, is that a lot? I pee like 10 times a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do too. The normal urine output is from 0.5-2L a day. But I also drink a ton of water and occasionally caffeine so that would affect it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be an unusual case. A combination of bad up bringing and more than likely psychological trauma. When i lived with my parents it was a commen occurence. My mother would tell me not to worry everybody gets used to it. She left when i was 6 or 7. My father who cared for me very much took to drinking quite often i would be in the pub with him until all hours after school and be late for school every morning. I smelled of wee because we were always in a rush and i never learned to control my bladder (probably because somewhere there was a connection with my mother that i wasnt able to let go of) i am aware that this is neglect and is not ok. But i also take into account the hardship of his situation. He is a good person regardless he has been a great father in many many other aspects. </p>
<p>A year later i went to live with my grandparents who lived a plane ride away. My father stayed behind to earn money. My grandfather was a manic person he would be sweet and holesome some days and angry and vindictive other days. My grand mother was the most caring woman i have ever met and she would clean up after me. Change my sheets wash my clothes cook me dinner and wash the dishes. If i ever tried to do anything it'd be &quot;no leave it there&quot; or &quot;i'll do that&quot; (a lonely woman who considered me her last child). This interaction changed me to the point i expected things done for me. My grandfather on his vindictive day would pour water on my clean sheets a short time before my bedtime.</p>
<p>Skip forward a year and i move back with my dad and he is dissapointed that i cant control my bladder at night. It's an extra chore for a single father that he is ashamed to admit he has to do. Because of all this i didnt stop until around 18. It was problematic with girlfriends. If i drink quite heavy (it used to be worse) then i would wet the bed and have to act like it was nothing....just a freak accident....it happens now and then.</p>
<p>I'm older now. My bladder is doing pretty well. Nobody takes notice how often i go because it has become less frequent. </p>
<p>This i probably something i needed to get off my chest but i hope the story helps somebody. All you have to do is keep control of it yourself. Dont let anybody do anything in the way of sorting out your mess. Learn to take it into your hands. Let it be the last this you think of at night and the first thing you think when you wake up in the middle of night and i assure you the puzzle pieces will fall into place. </p></div>		</li>
