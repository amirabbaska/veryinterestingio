			<div class="markdown"><p>But then... When we smell something fouled? Like.. Yesterday at hospital they cleaned the bathroom with some kind of antiseptic that smells...like nothing but at the same time foul and not clean. Then they served me my breakfast and my bread... Tasted like the bathroom. Was so horrible I almost throw up </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That there are 5 different kinds of taste buds has nothing to do with how many different tastes you can perceive.</p>
<p>There are only three different kinds of color perceiving cells in the retina, roughly sensitive to red, green and blue areas of the spectrum, but the combination of the three allows you to perceive a few million different colors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not an accurate comparison. There is no halfway point between salty and sweet. Our tastebuds detect any of the 5 tastes present, and recognise them individually, not as some amalgam. Think of popcorn, you can identify that it has saltiness, sweetness, but they aren't combined into some new taste. It's completely unlike how sight works.</p></div>		</li>
