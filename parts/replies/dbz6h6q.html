<p>It's asymptotic, so that's incorrect.  At some point it's all 'at infinity'.  The magellanic clouds are 100,000 light years away, but look like they're just as close as the rest of the night sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ach, no more late night redditing for me. Good catch. As the distance increases, disparity of objects goes to 0 (rays are parallel). In the paper cited above, using a conservative estimate of 10 sec, we should be able to have stereopsis about 1km out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stereopsis aside, we still have depth perception beyond 1 km within the atmosphere. This is mainly provided by &quot;atmospheric perspective.&quot; As there's more and more air between you and an object, it will appear desaturated, blueish (or reddish, brownish, depending on time of day, presence of smog, etc.), and lower contrast.</p>
<p>For example: <a href="http://www.flickriver.com/photos/kmyelin/2058683220/" target="_blank">http://www.flickriver.com/photos/kmyelin/2058683220/</a></p>
<p>This won't help you with the moon and sun since the amount of air in the way is the same in either case (one atmosphere worth), but it reaches much further than our stereo vision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this place.  Thanks to people like you, and the countless other multidisciplined users that take time out of their day to enlighten curious minds, I can embrace my intellectual sponginess with pride.  The internet is truly wonderful.  This Au is merely binary, but I hope my gratitude has more weight.</p></div>		</li>
