			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this stems from the fact that coal can be rearranged into diamonds seeing as they are both carbon lattices, which is misinterpreted to mean coal forms diamond naturally which it does not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Kimberlites where diamonds are found are some of the deepest and hottest igneous rocks we have. </p>
<p>Coal is from the carboniferous period - which is my favorite because of its awesome demonstration of evolution. When trees first took off as a species there were no microorganisms that could consume cellulose*. So, mountains of dead trees built up until evolution produced something that fed on them. All the buried dead trees turned into coal, and not much more formed afterwards.</p>
<p>EDIT: * To clarify, it was the woody polymers of trees in combination with cellulose that was difficult to break down. That's why this phenomena didn't affect other plant life before the rise of trees. It's also why no organisms with these capabilities developed until trees existed to provide the evolutionary pressures for it to be necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a very interesting period of Earth's history. But I believe cellulose had been around for a fair bit longer, it was the new wood polymers lignin and suberin that prevented the full decomposition of wood.</p></div>		</li>
