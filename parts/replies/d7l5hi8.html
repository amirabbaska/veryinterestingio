<p>There were very few Technicolor cameras for Technicolor at the time- they were very expensive and hard to make. They were so rare that Gone with the Wind and Wizard of Oz were constantly fighting for the same cameras as they were in production at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. I would add that you can compare it to modern films with fully CG characters. It's definitely something that can be done, but it comes with a big price tag and a substantial burden on the cinematography, direction and acting in terms of adapting to the presence of the non-physical elements.</p>
<p>The same was true of color.</p>
<p>Makeup had to change, costuming had to change, special effects had to change (Hitchcock's famous shower scene in Psycho used chocolate syrup for blood because fake blood looked too light in B&amp;W), composition and framing were quite different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make a good point that I haven't seen mentioned yet. Many of the actors and actresses were uncomfortable being filmed in color with the present day makeup. Once Max Factor invented a pancake makeup that was appropriate for color film, the willingness increased greatly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or like 3D movies. It's expensive but can be done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reasons we use red, green, and blue (RGB) when projecting light is because those are the three colors your eyes see in. The three types of cones in your eyes each receive one of those colors, and they figure out what color you're <em>actually</em> seeing by mixing them together. They're called additive color because the light adds together in your eyes. </p>
<p>Now, when we're mixing paints, you're dealing with something called subtractive color. This is because, when you see paint as yellow for instance, it's actually absorbing every color of light <em>other</em> than yellow. Thus, it subtracts colors from light that hits it. </p>
<p>Now, our choice of colors for painting is actually a little weird. You may notice that if you mix all of them together, they actually turn to a brown color. This is because these are not the <em>true</em> subtractive colors, but rather because they work well enough for painting. </p>
<p>The real subtractive colors are Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow. These colors are actually the opposites of the additive colors, if you look on a color wheel, and that's no coincidence. It's why printers use those colors. When you mix those colors together, they collectively subtract all incoming light and appear black. And when you add all the additive colors together, you get white. </p>
<p>The reason we don't use all the true subtractive colors for painting is that it's simply harder for us humans to do. Red, yellow, and blue make it easier for us to mix other colors, even if we can't make black with them. </p>
<p>If you have any other questions, just ask. </p></div>		</li>
