			<div class="markdown"><p>Rocker6465 has it right: these days, they're just marketing terms. Band X and Band Y have similar sound.</p>
<p>Band X's lead singer is a third-year philosophy dropout and will thusly appeal to douchenozzle hipsters, so they're &quot;Indie&quot;.</p>
<p>Band Y is four kids with suburban angst and bad haircuts. Broader appeal, ergo &quot;Alternative&quot;.</p>
<p>Both signed by the same twacked-out AnR guy and get their songs &quot;punched up&quot; by the same writing/production team.</p></div>		</li>
