<p>If homelessness could be solved by giving people homes we would have done it already.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, that's exactly how states and cities are beginning to solve chronic homelessness. It's called &quot;Housing First&quot; and the basic idea is that providing housing for the chronically homeless, rather than forcing individuals to participate in certain programs in order to receive benefits, has better outcomes for the individual and saves society money in the long run.

<p>well no shit.  if you put someone in a house 1 day out of the year, you can say they are no longer homeless.  it's real easy to eliminate homelessness with definitions like that.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We're not saying this is a one-size-fits-all solution for chronic homelessness,&quot; Walker said  </p>

<p>this is the most important part.  Utah is nothing like most of the country.  what do you do with 4,000 homeless in the city of portland?  like said above, the actual shelter is only a small part of it.  I can point to lots of Baltimore housing projects that kept people from being homeless, but at the same time caused such a decline in property value that whole sections of the city sank into decades long hellscapes through which most people are afraid to drive, let alone walk or open a business.  ask someone in LA how well they feel housing projects solved the homelessness problem.  if you don't solve the underlying psychology of poverty, then any sufficiently dense city will just end up with even worse problems as they create a poverty cycle on a large scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the easiest way to make sure people are not homeless is to give them shelter. </p>
<p>But we can't just give people 'free stuff' - we have to make them jump through hoops, and to shun them if they do anything bad, like drink too much or smoke a little  weed. And you learn that what most governments - and so the people they represent - are more interested in scolding the homeless than fixing the problem. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it does cost money to make sure they are jumping through those hoops, and to have people hold the hoops, and to maintain the hoops.  Either way resources are being spent when trying to help the homeless transition to becoming a competent citizen again.  </p>
<p>What /u/justabuffywatcher is pointing out is that it may be more effective to offer them housing first, as opposed to making them jump through hoops first.</p>
<p>P.S. - as I get done writing this i'm starting to think you may agree with what i'm saying but how you worded your comment has me a little confused.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes and this is why 90% of the homeless can't stay in shelters in my neighborhood.  They have to quit using first. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your points are all valid with regard to continued homelessness, however, there's a couple of things you miss:</p>
<p>For some, the substance abuse and mental health issues are a <em>symptom</em> of their homelessness, not the cause. Providing mental health and addiction-recovery services <em>without</em> housing is worse than providing housing without such services</p>
<p>You point out:    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If we took all the homeless and put them in a house, and gave them an easy job, half of them would be back on the street within a few months.    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that also means that for about half of them, just having a home <em>is what they really needed.</em></p>
<p>And during those few months, the people who end up homeless again were at least not sleeping rough, and their lives were better for at least that time.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you are making this argument, but many people use your same stats and arguments to say that <em>there is no point</em> in giving people housing without all the other stuff, but that's silly. Even with its limitations, a program to provide safe housing for the homeless still has significant advantages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh absolutely.  And I think the housing first program should be expanded dramatically and quickly and see if we get the same results on a larger scale.</p>
<p>But when we talk about some nebulous concept like homelessness and ask &quot;why should we do other things when we still have homelessness&quot; I think it is important to note that we can't solve homelessness yet.  Sure we can do better, but just because we can't fix one problem doesn't mean we shouldn't fix others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dead right. People definitely underestimate the difficulty of <em>solving</em> the homeless problem, and overestimate the complexity of <em>improving it dramatically</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what is known as magical thinking.  Reality doesn't mesh with your personal beliefs so you build a fantasy to describe it.</p>
<p>I work for an organization that provides outpatient psychiatric care for those that suffer from mental health issues and substance abuse.  This includes a state-of-the-art managed detox and (expensive) prescription drugs.  </p>
<p>They are also provide free housing and a case worker.  Every year they help some of their patients, but the vast majority of them relapse and leave the program.  </p>

<p>Every city in the US has this and it doesn't work for chronic serial inebriates because they want to keep using.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are literally half-naked mental patients ranting and raving on the street in my neighborhood.  </p>
<p>They routinely kill themselves, each other, innocent people, or OD and die in the gutter.  I've seen emergency services pick up dead bodies in the street multiple times in the last year.</p>

<p>Throwing them out on the street like trash isn't better than 24x7 psychiatric care. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is what I absolutely hate about this country.  We take something that is broken and instead of fixing it, just sweep it under the rug.  Instead of fixing our mental health system we just ignore the problem and throw everyone in the gutter.</p>

<p>We have that and I work for the public health system that provides outpatient psychiatric care.  It's not enough for the worst cases, which need 24x7 support. </p></div>		</li>
