<p>So what you're saying is, they did know about the issue of the high acidity, and said it was safe anyway, because they assumed the water would be treated.  Then later on, the people in charge just skipped the part about treating the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  </p>
<p>See, they were saving so little in changing their water supply that hiring a proper engineering team to design and remodel Flint's water treatment plant to account for the untreated water would have blown any savings for a long while.  </p>
<p>So in the spirit of saving money (which their electorate put them in office to do) they didn't hire the engineers to check the water, and ignored the red flags thrown up that they probably should have engineers review this decision in parallel with economists.  </p>
<p>But put yourself in their shoes.  Flint's water treatment plant already had engineers, and previous leadership hadn't switched away from Detroit water probably for a reason.  You asked engineers if they could handle the switch and they said &quot;Yes but..&quot; and you stop listening.  If you ask more engineers you're only going to get more very expensive &quot;buts&quot;. </p>
<p>However, if you don't ask engineers then nobody has told you there's a problem, and therefore you can make this decision in good conscience! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Nah. In Michigan, if you live in a city with a lot of black people, Snyder appoints an emergency manager to make sure you all don't get too uppity. Can't have 'em electing their own leadership!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to point out - the water was being treated at the Flint Water Treatment Plant. However, it was not being treated correctly.</p>
<p>The fact that it was being treated was why the red flags weren't believed by everyone initially.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Rick Snyder should have never survived this atrocity. </p>
<p>Get ready for this situation to repeat itself over and over with the new Trump EPA. Those people wrote the book on this shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They knew, water treatment facilities everywhere have to deal with this They use a chemical called zinc orthophosphate to coat the pipes in order to prevent the lead pipes corroding into the water. Problem is zinc orthophosphate is pricy af and many people in the Flint situation were trying to cut costs. </p>
<p>Consider that you're pipes are almost certainly no better than flints and any budget cuts to the EPA affect money that could be used to protect you and your drinking water. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems nobody purposely got anyone sick. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did someone say, &quot;hey, screw Flint residents, let's make them sick?&quot; No. </p>
<p>Did they say, &quot;hey, the water from the Flint River is 'good enough', and we'll fix any problems later, because, we don't think it's important to spend any money&quot;? Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>Flint</del> <em>The Governor-appointed Emergency Manager</em> was looking to get out of its water contract with Detroit Water and Sewage, where they were receiving treated, clean water for many years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was with the proviso that <em>the water be treated before being used for residents</em>.  Furthermore, the Governor <em>knew</em> that GM was having problems using the water for their manufacturing because it was corroding car parts on the assembly line, so the state funded $440k for a water connection to Lake Huron for them.  At the end of the day, it came down to not wanting to spend money on proper water treatment for citizens.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Flint river was presumed, and indeed <em>is</em> safe for use... But I'll get back to that.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The water they got from the river had to be treated, so they built a water treatment facility. However, old pipes, poor planning, etc.. created issues and the water ended up bad.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All water needs to be treated, the problem here goes back to why the switch was made in the first place- MONEY. Flint allowed people who didn't know what they were talking about to literally flip a switch and go from Detroit water back to flint to save money. While barely tolerable (should have been phased in) the guiding principles of saving money lead to hiring cheap incompetent labor and poor management.  </p>
<p>Buffering PH might not be stupid easy, but testing PH level is. Theres no way flint didn't know their water ph was 6.0, but the incompetence of the water department didn't have enough knowledge to know that it meant that the acidity would wear down the LINING of the pipes allowing lead to seep in. With the lining slowly wearing away, its actually buffering the water PH level- so the PH is moving to a more normalized rate. Now, when we test water we're getting say 7.0 instead of 6. This wouldn't ring bells for most incompetent people unless you realize that 1. You're not buffering your water at the treatment center because the department is cheap, and 2 that the river water is still ph 6 so that buffer has to come from somewhere.  </p>
<p>Now eventually lead starts turning up- what does incompetence do? Well they're lazy so they'll test the river before going out to a house- no lead there. What next? Well, maybe if we test the water at the treatment center it'll give us a different result- nope, no lead there because lead hasn't leeched an appreciable amount by volume. This shitshow continues until a house where lead is present, so it must be at the house level. As more problems pop up eventually panic sets in, what has happened? Incompetent water department doesn't know and tries to hide the problem that they don't want to spend the money to fix.  </p>
<p>TL/DR The decision makers of Flint got what they paid for at the expense of the city's health.</p></div>		</li>
