			<div class="markdown"><p>The media argument is bunk. It reverses cause and effect. The media portrays breasts in a sexual way because there is inherent desire for them that is caused by <em>some other factor(s)</em>. </p>
<p>If the media suddenly decided to start sexualizing ankles, they simply would not succeed. There's nothing desirable about an ankle. It's not symmetrical, it's not soft, it's not warm, it's not related to reproduction or child rearing, and it's not rare to see.</p>
<p>Sure, there are probably a few people with a fetish for ankles specifically (I know there is a foot fetish), but the media couldn't make a billion or so western men suddenly develop an ankle fetish... If there <em>was</em> a large ankle fetish, then the media would merely respond to it, not cause it.</p></div>		</li>
