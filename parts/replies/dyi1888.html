			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned of this when I had cherries ready to harvest from my tree.  I went out the next day and my tree was was being harvested by ants and aphids.  I Google researched what was going on and it blew my mind.</p>
<p>The ants drug the aphids to subdue them also.  The ants use chemicals they secrete and apply to the paths of where the aphids walk.</p>
<p>Learning this, I started to see ants as civilized.  Then I started to wonder all sorts of things, like do they have a religion, or art?  Do they keep historical records?  You know, stuff like that.</p></div>		</li>
