			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important thing is the US has never missed a payment. Everyone holding US debt can use it like cash to buy things (not quite, but it is considered cash equivalent). It is used as the risk-free rate for other investments to be compared to. Also under the worst case scenario the US could just print more money to pay off the debt, ironically by increasing other debt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the way you used the individual debtor analogy, but it sometimes causes more confusion. The U.S. also prints the currency in which it pays debts, so the household analogy is limited. The primary limitation is the maximum acceptable inflation rate caused by currency debasement. But the U.S. also contains the businesses that generate income using dollars, which shows the limit of the household employee analogy. Because money demand fluctuates for business cycle and technical reasons, you could see large increases in money supply that doesn't result in massive currency debasement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only one of the credit agencies downgraded, and that was only because the politicians couldn't get their act together and raise the debt limit. It really had nothing to do with the ability to pay the debt but typical Washington Bureaucrats made it difficult and it was concerning to one of the agencies, frankly not really justified.</p>
<p>US debt isn't as big of a deal as people make it out to be. It's higher than most would want it to be, but that's no different than the fed rate being too low for comfort. National debt doesn't really work the same way as personal debt. We'll always be in debt, it's actually healthy that way, what's more concerning is the rate we take on additional debt which has mostly been shrinking for a while (increased this year though).</p>
<p>Edit to add: Also has nothing to do with the right vs left. Bush jacked the deficit to fund some wars, Obama jacked the deficit to bail out some banks and pump money into the economy (TARP got paid back and then some so that's good)</p>
<p>2nd Edit: TARP ('08 bank bailout) was Bush. QE (pumping money into economy to stimulate) was Obama.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Fed buys and sells US debt to put pressure on market interest rates. </p>
<p>The returns on any bonds they hold as a result are handed over to the treasury and the member banks (as interest on the reserves they are legally required to hold at the Fed).</p>
<p>The Fed paid $97 billion to the US treasury in 2015 as bonds it held matured and $1.7 billion as dividends to member banks as interest on reserves.</p></div>		</li>
