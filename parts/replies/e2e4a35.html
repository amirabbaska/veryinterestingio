			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like complete nonsense; they eat century eggs and durian because its traditional and native respectively. </p>
<p>Westerners eat all sorts of weird shit - blood sausage, fermented fish, haggis, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood sausage is actually a pretty widespread dish across almost all kinds of nationalities. There's a very popular Korean dish called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundae_\(sausage\)" target="_blank">&quot;soondae&quot;</a> which is a type of blood sausage.</p>
<p>And it's kind of absurd to claim people eat things solely due to tradition. Durian wouldn't be eaten if it didn't taste good. A better claim is to say some things are eaten as sort of traditional medicine, but that's basically the equivalent of eating liver for health benefits - pretty much every culture does that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, but you also get haggis flavoured chips in western countries too I think it's also because there's a market for it there. They combine traditional flavours with candies and junk food and seem to have the market for more adventurous tastes. Whereas a lot of companies in western countries do attempt more adventurous flavours but its usually as a limited time thing. If there was a market for it, it'd probably be more common, although then you get into the whole business side of things where it might drive up sales to market something as limited or only available for a short time, then release it periodically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that might not be true. If it's something they've grown up with, they may not consider it adventurous to eat something like durian or fermented tofu.</p>
<p>They may consider it really adventurous that westerners eat stuff like snails, or frogs legs, or kombucha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also eat snails and frog legs, but it's the smaller snails, where you can eat a hundred in a day</p>
<p>The real adventure is eating cheese and butter and trying not to pass out for the rest of the day</p></div>		</li>
