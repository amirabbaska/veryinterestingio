<p>If you were to toss a positron at a proton they would repel each other because of the like charges, rather than merge and annihilate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right - and even if we could overcome the electric repulsion, you'd run into another problem: if two positively-charged particles are destroyed, charge is not conserved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only its counterpart... but keep in mind that: </p>
<p>a) particles and their anti-particles are strongly attracted to one another</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>b) All matter which we are familiar with on a day to day basis is made (effectively) of nothing but electrons, protons, and neutrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understand antimatter isn't the only way you could go about extracting energy from matter.  You could focus a whole ton of laser light to generate a kugelblitz black hole.    if you could feed said micro blackhole.. or generate said black hole with some feed matter at the focal point you would get some approaching antimatter for matter to energy conversion  </p></div>		</li>
