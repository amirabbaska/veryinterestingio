<p>Source: majoring in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4kvi43/what_cheap_product_is_extremely_overpriced/d3inhsu/?context=1" target="_blank">packaging science.</a>  </p>
<p>Edit: So I would like to add to what /u/chriswlezien said the Bottom Push-Up serves a less stated function. Take a 2.5inch dowel and try to stand up on a gravel road it will be very hard because of the flat end will cause it to just fall over. The bottom push up creates a ring. This ring is better able to sit level over different contours making your life easier. The five points further elaborates on this. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, it worked almost exactly like this. You do the best you can with what you have and pray you made the right decisions, the company stays afloat, and you keep your job. I feel like a surprising amount of the world works this way.</p></div>		</li>
