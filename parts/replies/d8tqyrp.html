			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.  Everyone thinks I had braces but my straight teeth came from an awkward phase of losing most of my baby teeth about the same time.  I've always believed it's because there was no competition between my adult teeth coming out. The only other person I know who had straight teeth growing up had accidentally had a TV (the old school big kind) fall on her and she lost all her baby teeth at the same time. It also helps that I was born without wisdom teeth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are your twins identical? I've heard identical twins get all their teeth in the same order, and that mirror twins get their teeth in the same order on the opposite side, but I don't know if this is true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, fraternal. But their teeth are coming in the same order, I think. I thought I read somewhere that pretty much everyone's teeth come in the same order.</p></div>		</li>
