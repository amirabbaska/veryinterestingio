So that probably creates a false sense among other people that their are way more moral crusaders out there than there actually are. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We've all seen a mom that makes too big of a deal about their kid's allergies or starts a rant with &quot;as a mother&quot;. It's all tied to the same need to feel important. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer. Add to this that you'll only hear the people calling for the &quot;censorship&quot; and saying they're offended. People who are pretty reasonable aren't going to be protesting or creating movements. Vocal minority is real.</p></div>		</li>
