			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose that fact is, there's no proof. Math is based on how we sense the world. First we have positive numbers since we count, then we add, we subtract. Oh, what (shall) happen if you take three stones from me while I only have two? Then we have negative numbers.</p>
<p>You see how we found the math system and continue to build upon it? We expand it, introduce new things to it but try our best to not break it. So TL;DR, there's no proof. We defined the rules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is though -- we defined &quot;additive inverse&quot; (negative number) as the thing that makes 0 when we add it to a starting number, and proved that &quot;additive inverse of an additive inverse&quot; returns us to the original number. Now, this isn't the way we designed it to begin with, but it is indeed proven from simpler statements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but the standard process in maths is to assume a very select few 'axioms' are true. These can't be proved.</p>
<p>Then a 'proof' links some theorem back to the statement 'assuming the axioms hold, this theorem holds'.</p>
<p>So a mathematical proof never 'proves' something. It's all conditional on those fundamental axioms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, now I am piqued. What if a naive person says:</p>
<p>Your proof makes the assumption the additive inverse is unique—or, alternatively, that the arithmetic over the Reals is even consistent!—so, how are you sure that there isn't also some other algebraic derivation that shows (–1)·(–1) ≠ 1?</p>
<p>For all I know, maybe (–1)·(–1) is not a valid Real or Integer, and the logically explosion is what allows you to write any proof! After all, we're not allowed to divide by zero… Etc.</p>
<p>What do you do <em>then</em>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My explanation is designed to help students understand that arithmetic over reals IS consistent (save division by zero), or to see at least in small part how to build a definition of (-1)(-1) that avoids absurdity. [For example, if you allowed its product to be (-1), then (-1)*[1+(-1)] could be both equal to 0 and -2.]</p>
<p>Choosing 1 for the value avoids &quot;logical explosions&quot; insofar as all the usual laws of arithmetic apply. That's the point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be proven that the additive inverse is unique.</p>
<p>Sadly, we can't prove consistency (stupid restrictions on axiomatic systems).</p></div>		</li>
