<p>1) The government borrows from social security in the same way that Chase bank borrows from its account holders. Would you really rather have had the government stuck the trillion of dollars of our SS surplus in a vault? The government has not and will not default on the government backed bonds that the SS trust fund is invested in. The money is not gone, it's just been put to use within our nation.</p>
<p>2) Social Security under its current structure is not solvent. As more baby boomers retire they are going to receive more benefits than the current taxpayers are putting in, which will cause the SSA to drain money from the Trust Fund. As the Trust fund only equals around 3 years worth of current SS benefits, then its easy to understand how a decade or two of this process would easily drain the budget from its funds which is why the SSA estimates that in <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html" target="_blank">2037 the trust fund will be wiped out</a> and we will only be converting 76% of our liability. </p>
<p>3) This is not a new problem. The SS benefits/eligibility/taxes/etc. have been modified by previous generations to meet the needs of the day. Doing this is nothing new and isn't a result of some gross malfeasance by the federal govt. Rather its simply the logical consequence of people living longer and having less children.</p></div>		</li>
