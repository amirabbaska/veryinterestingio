<p>China does not produce dollars. They hold dollars that the US previously printed and they want more. The US issues its own money and does not need China to &quot;lend&quot; it more dollars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's the wrong line of thought.  what I mean is that chinese companies and government have dollars from american comapanies buying goods from China.  chinese firms and government then buy treasuries.  treasuries are bonds.  bonds mean a corp or gov borrowed money to finance activities. thus, U.S. gov borrowed money by selling bonds for US dollars.  feel free to ask any more questions regarding this.  I'm happy to answer, but please ask me to explain what I mean rather than accusing me of being wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US does not go to China and asks them to lend them back their dollars. If China did not then somebody else would buy the bonds (maybe even the Federal Reserve). But China has a big reserve of dollars - due to their trade deficit - that it needs to &quot;invest&quot; somewhere and US treasury bonds seem like the best placement for these dollars. And China cannot at present offload its reserve due to the original question (why it needs the RMB to keep its low value compared to the US dollar).</p></div>		</li>
