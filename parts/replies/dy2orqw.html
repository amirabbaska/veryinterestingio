			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, spherical bubbles, spherical and oblate spheroid planets, and even the funky semi-polyhedral shapes clusters of bubbles make are all examples of <em>minimal surfaces</em>. </p>
<p>Minimal surfaces are solutions to problems that ask, &quot;Given certain <em>boundary conditions</em>, what shape has the minimal surfaces area?&quot; (Surface area can be replaced with length, volume, or some other quantity depending on the nature of the problem.) These boundary conditions might be things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the total volume is fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the pressure on both sides of the surface must be equal at every point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the net force on the surface at each point must be zero.</p>
</li>
<li>the position of some or all of the edges are fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to name a few.</p>
<p>Spheres are so common because they are one of the simplest minimal surfaces. They have the simplest boundary conditions. But there can be much more complicated ones. </p>
<p>You can visualize minimal surfaces by taking a stretchy material, like a balloon or panty hose, and stretching it in different ways. The fixed points (where you hold it and the edges of anything you stretch it across) define the boundary conditions, and the stretchy material itself defines the minimal surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Building on this, the shape of the earth is actually called an “oblate spheroid”, or basically a slightly flattened sphere.  This is because of the centripetal force “pulling out” the earth at the equator, leaving it slightly flattened at the poles.  The shape is a balance between that force, and gravity.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth</a></p>
<p>In a bubble, the main balancing forces are surface tension, and air pressure.  The bubble generally won’t form as a perfect sphere so it will resonate between different shapes (lots of calculus here) until the energy dissipates (lots of fluid dynamics here).</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can’t find a quick link, but there are equations that approximate the shape of a planet, and the coefficients can tell you at a glance how far away from a sphere it is, and in what way.  And I’m sure NASA and other aerospace organizations go into much more detail with modeling planet shape.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Centrifugal, not centripetal.</p>
<p>The centripetal force is a force that's always directed inwards towards the axis of rotation, and what keeps the planet from flying apart. In this case, it's just gravity acting to make the planet <em>less</em> oblate.</p>
<p>Centrifugal force is what's pushing the equator outwards from the perspective of someone on the planet. Or, if you prefer a non-rotating reference frame, it's just inertia trying to carry mass along the same tangential path while gravity pulls it back in.</p>
<p>...and if your high school physics teacher taught you &quot;there's no such thing as centrifugal force,&quot; then that's just wrong, but you'll need to wait until college physics to find that any reference frame is just as good as any other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my bad, wrong word - centripetal is the reaction force.  Looks like this got more attention than I expected.</p>
<p>Centrifugal force is a bit weird to deal with because, as you’re getting at, it’s a pseudo-force that’s the result of using a non-inertial reference frame.</p>
<p>And now you’re reminding me of why I’m glad I’m no longer in college.  Getting my mind into a rotating reference frame just makes me dizzy.</p></div>		</li>
