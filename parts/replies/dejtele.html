<p>When we post on Facebook on someone's wall or comment on their posts, we do so in a public forum (not totally unlike Reddit or other forums and aggregates). </p>

<p>I've been thinking about it based on all your great responses, and there's a divide between friends and strangers. We all want to see friends' posts, and friends' comments on other friends' posts. We don't want to see strangers' posts that have no connection to us, and we don't want strangers to see posts of ours that have no connection to them.</p>
<p>The issue is that &quot;friend F comments on stranger G's post&quot; crosses that friend/stranger boundary in a way that it's not obvious how to proceed. Some people prefer to see them and have them be seen, and some, like myself, don't. I understand now why facebook made the decision they did, I just wish there was an alternative or option about how to deal with those cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 22 so naturally a lot of my friends are getting married, and I swear 1/5 of my feed is my friend F liked &quot;G and H got married&quot;. I don't know G or H, have never heard of them, don't give a shit that they're married or that my friend F liked it. But maybe I do care about what F actually posts, so I don't want to unfollow them.
Super annoying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The friend/stranger divide you cite is a core problem of the zuckerfacebookberg. You could alleviate this problem by wading through the sewage that is faceberg groups/privacy options.</p>
<p>But ultimately zuckerbook doesn't want you to have a say in any conversation (or on the internet at large) unless it comes tied to your entire identity. So just like you say, there is normally a natural boundary between strangers where you wouldn't walk up to a random stranger and hand them your entire life's history, and they hand you theirs.</p>
<p>It is completely unnatural, but understandable given the bookberg was never made to be a &quot;social&quot; app, rather just a place to &quot;look up information about people&quot;, like a phone book.</p>
<p>Of course one benefit to showing you other people's conversations is to pad your feed. The longer they can keep people in that mindless &quot;fb scroll mode&quot;, drooling at their feed, the more money they can make.</p></div>		</li>
