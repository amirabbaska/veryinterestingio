			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually pretty slow, though still lethal.
Airsoft guns shoot between 400-600 at the high end, and they arent even close to considered lethal. Guess lethality of bullet is due to heavier weight and penetrating shape.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bingo. </p>
<p>Force=mass x acceleration.</p>
<p>An average airsoft pellet is .2-.3g. </p>
<p>A .30-06 springfield bullet is 9.7-11.7g</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just a university entry-level physics student, but at terminal velocity, where the bullet is at its maximum speed, it should not be accelerating at all. So there is no net force (force of gravity is cancelled out by forces of friction, air resistance, etc).</p>
<p>The thing that kills people, and the equation you're looking for, is momentum p = m*v. The bullet will have a (relatively) light mass but high velocity, enabling it to break through skin/bone/other important things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am piggybacking to explain what goes in to that terminal velocity. </p>
<p>In general, any object shot upwards will have a moment at the top of its trajectory where it's vertical velocity goes to zero. A bullet shot from the ground is then equivalent to a bullet dropped from rest at the top of its trajectory. </p>
<p>You might imagine dropping a bullet from a really high building. The bullet will reach its terminal velocity when the force of gravity (constant) is balanced by the drag force on the speeding bullet. In this sense, terminal velocity has nothing to do with how it was shot, only with how high it falls from. Even so, the bullet will reach its terminal velocity after only a short time. Dropping a bullet from a higher point would not result in a faster bullet.</p>
<p>TLDR: Bullets are deadly.</p></div>		</li>
