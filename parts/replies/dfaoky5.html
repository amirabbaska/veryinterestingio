<p>Now, since the inudstrial revolution, and more specifically, with the advent of electronics, society has pretty much told you to stop, sit down, and don't move.  For the majority of your day.  This is going against millions of years of biological programming that has made it beneficial for you to always be moving.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's true. The body is pretty sensitive, and will remain so for a long time, to pressure and activity. A good example of this is the effect on blood vessels in the legs while walking vs sitting. </p>
<p>The veins that run up your legs are filled with tons of one way valves that open up with each pump of blood and close to prevent the blood from just pooling in your feet. Walking/running/exercisinf the muscles around these veins helps the blood move to where it needs to go, kind of like when you get your finger pricked for a blood sample and they &quot;massage&quot; the blood out of your finger, but on a smaller scale. </p>
<p>Being on your bottom and not exercising for long periods of time causes those valves to weaken faster than they normally would, leading to things like varicose veins or more seriously, blood clots around the valves.</p>
<p>And of course there's also moving around to prevent bone density loss. </p></div>		</li>
