			<div class="markdown"><p>The M110 was called a SASS. Semi automatic sniper system. It was specifically fielded for sniper use, not the designated marksman role.</p>
<p>The Barrett was also specifically designed for use as a sniping platform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curiosity question. In the Bulgarian military there were actually two types of snipers - what you'd call a marksman and a snipers. The first ones were the best two shots in a platoon, given long-range rifles with scopes but they weren't as trained or as the real snipers, who worked IIRC in teams (sniper and a spotter) and were in a way SF you may get a team or two for a given task, but they aren't part of your platoon and they often operate quite away from them. I was wondering if the things were similar in the NATO forces (can't say about our army after the reforms, since they came after my time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Special forces is obviously a lot different, and Im sure they act a lot more autonomously. However, our snipers generally won't be operating just by themselves. Yes they operate in spotter/sniper teams. They definitely can be sent out by themselves to do traditional sniper missions. However, it really does depend on the situation. My scout snipers platoon is essentially a battalion asset they will use as they see fit. Generally they will just want reconnaissance from us. We would work in small teams and set up observation points. Our snipers alone could be requested to other missions. I think it's one of those things about the military where it really depends on your unit, and what theater you fight in. One sniper could spend an entire deployment merely on observation with a scout team. Another could be tasked out on a large variety of missions. I'm on mobile, and at work so it took me ages to finish this long of a comment. </p></div>		</li>
