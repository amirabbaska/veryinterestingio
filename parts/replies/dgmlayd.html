			<div class="markdown"><p>Lmao I don't have an answer for you but you made me realize there must be a bunch of times where first kids do something they shouldn't have and try to be all sly about it in front of the agents. Like this professionally trained Secret Service agent with a military history and 20 years of on-the-job experience has to sit there and pretend like he doesn't see straight through your bullshit about how that grape juice stain in the Oval Office wasn't you...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you're definitely right about that. I bet they feel pretty confident in their ability to read people and know their intentions anyway...what I'm sitting here convincing myself is that there has probably been at least one time a &quot;First Kid&quot; has slept with an agent. I could see how that would be a huge no-no so maybe not, but how many college-aged first kids have there been? Match that with a youngish, in top shape agent that you are spending all of your time with? Just saying.</p></div>		</li>
