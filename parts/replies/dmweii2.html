			<div class="markdown"><p>To that note, the outlets in the US have safer variants where you can't stick a single prong in an outlet (or a screwdriver or knife) because there is a flap that only opens if you plug both prongs in simultaneously. I want to say it's become standard for gcfi outlets but that could just be my wacky state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's increasingly rare to find a two-prong (ungrounded) outlet in the US. Older homes that havent been rennovated may have them but most homes have grounded outlets and the codes require ground fault circuit interrupters for outdoor outlets and those close to a water source like a bathroom sink.</p></div>		</li>
