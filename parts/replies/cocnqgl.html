If there was ample food, there would be a population explosion by families having 10 kids and their kids having 10 kids until all available food was exhausted and you have some people dying off from the occasional draught or bad hunting season.</p></div>		</li>

Name escapes me unfortunately,  but on the gathering side, the woman gathered in one day ( fruit vegitables, small game and insects ) enough for her family for 3 days. Unfortunately we only tend to see these peoples when they are in drought, or pushed to the edges of their territories .</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, people generally can't reliably have 10 kids per couple even with enough food. Health, infant mortality, complications of childbirth, plagues and wars all constrain population growth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, <em>most</em> people certainly aren't trying to build cities on the sea.</p>
<p>True, some people are, but that's because they are eccentric. Or, tying back to biological evolution, sea-city builders are filling a social <em>niche</em> that has yet to be filled, and those successful will profit (bio: procreate) immensely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about humans is that they will live off <em>anything</em>.  Humans taken all together probably eat the widest variety of food of any species that has ever lived. For hunters and gatherers, you've got Inuit living almost entirely on marine meat.  You've got peoples eating whatever range of edible plants and catchable animals are in their area.  Once agriculture got going, you have whole populations living mostly on grains.  But despite certain diets claims to the contrary, hunter gatherers ate grains too (the paper I linked above has some discussion of this, and here's something discussing <a href="http://www.mnh.si.edu/highlight/Neanderthal_Diet/" target="_blank">grain consumption by Neanderthals</a>). Before farmers took all the really good land for growing crops, the stuff grew wild in thick stands and where it was common, people ate it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I find that absolutely fascinating. We even eat stuff that has specifically evolved to irritate only mammalian tissue, to the point of excruciating pain, vomiting and diarrhea....like Capsaicin.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, exactly what they ate I couldn't say. However one of the human advantages is being able to eat a lot more varied than other animals, so presumably they ate what they could find near them. They also ate better than most people did the next 10 000 years, as you can see from hunter gatherer skeletons that we've just started to catch up in average height to their levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if climate change made harvesting grains harder in the Middle East. A quote from <em>1491</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Almost pure stands” of einkorn wheat covered “dozens of square kilometers” in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and other parts of the Middle East, according to Jack R. Harlan and Daniel Zohary, two agronomists who pored over the area in the 1960s to determine the distribution of wild cereals. “Over many thousands of hectares” in those countries, they wrote in Science, “it would be possible to harvest wild wheat today from natural stands almost as dense as a cultivated wheat field.” In the Middle East, therefore, the impact of agriculture was thus less a matter of raising the productivity of wheat, barley, and other cereals than of extending the range in which they could be grown, by developing varieties that could flourish in climates and soils that daunt the wild plant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm also not sure we can really say that the advent of agriculture was &quot;accidental&quot;, exactly. Humans had been altering their environments and the foods in it for a long time before agriculture rose (humans in the Americas for example learned how to make agave and acorns edible long before agriculture). Humans also knew how to domesticate natural organisms before the rise of agriculture; dogs were domesticated sometime between 11 and 16 thousand years ago and sheep were domesticated around the time that agriculture arose. Altering varieties of grains into agriculture seems a fairly logical extension of that behavior. The important discovery was probably less noticing that seeds turned into plants than in finding &quot;non-shattering&quot; varieties of wild grains. In nature, wheat and barley and rye (corn doesn't exist in nature) have stalks that break off (&quot;shatter&quot; in the parlance) allowing the seeds to fall to the ground and continue the species. Through random mutation, some plants have non-shattering stalks which is bad for the plants, but great for humans who can easily come by and harvest the grain. Recognizing that planting these non-shattering varieties of grains would lead to more non-shattering stalks seems to be the key discovery in the ability to cultivate large fields of planted grains. </p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that agriculture arose separately several times and wasn't something that was invented once and spread around the globe (like, say, dogs). Mesoamerica and the Andes seem to have independently developed agriculture shortly after the Middle East and China, India, New Guinea, and the Sahel all developed independently as well. </p></div>		</li>

<p>i don't see how this changes what i said.the change in climate, which had a drying effect on the region, pushed the the wild cereal fields farther and farther away from the wet areas of the coast, which is where the settlements were located. this increased the time it took to harvest. in response, the people began to experiment with growing their own. we know this because the human remains at those sites don't shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural laborer overnight, but it's a general trend. agricultural didn't just take off, it took experimentation for us to figure out.  it wasn't just some intuitive thing we knew of but didn't feel the need to do. </p>

<p>the &quot;shattering&quot; of the seeds developed over time. again, it wasn't like a lightswitch went off one day. it took experimentation and observations over generations. </p>
