			<div class="markdown"><p>The most amazing part is Tao's strategy for resolving the Navier-Stokes question -- to show that finite time blow up is possible by showing that you can make logic gates out of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. Essentially, to show that a computer could be made entirely of water (according to the Navier-Stokes model, not real life water). It's one of the most creative math ideas I've ever heard. I recommend googling to read Tao's early explanations of his strategy.</p></div>		</li>

This is the key quote:
&quot;If one wished to simulate this for the true Navier-Stokes equations, one would have to build a “machine” purely out of (inviscid) incompressible fluid (a “water computer”), which, when running, constructed a smaller copy of itself, injected almost all of its energy into this smaller copy, and then “turned itself off”.
By the scaling properties of the Navier-Stokes equation, this smaller copy should then make an even smaller copy, and so forth until a finite time blowup is achieved. As far as I can tell, there is no mathematical barrier to such a machine existing (for idealised fluids). There is however an immense engineering barrier to actually constructing such a machine, even on paper. The most significant obstacle seems to be the need to build some analogue of logic gates purely out of ideal fluid (as opposed to out of averaged Navier-Stokes equations).
With such gates, one can in principle build a Turing-universal computer, and from that one should be able to build the right sort of self-replicating machine. There actually is a branch of engineering called fluidics that constructs logic gates out of fluids, pipes and valves. So, the main remaining challenge (in principle, at least) is to figure out how to simulate pipes and valves out of an
ideal fluid!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Navier-Stokes equations attempt to describe the behavior of fluids like water, but they do not describe the behavior of water perfectly.</p>
<p>If it turns out that you can make logic gates out of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, that does not mean you could make logic gates out of actual water, in the real world. Rather, it would only mean that the Navier-Stokes equations have certain strange solutions that you would never observe in real life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who is actively involved in mathematical fluid dynamics research, I have to say that nobody in the community that I have talked to seems very interested in this work. Sure, it might work, but so might the other thousands of other creative approaches to the problem.  I think the only reason it gets press is because of Tao's celebrity status. I don't mean to say it's not a new idea, but it doesn't feel like a promising one.  It just seems like yet another weird idea, that might work, but that probably won't.  I haven't heard anybody who works in fluids saying they expect Tao will win a prize for this work. In fact, I haven't even heard them discussing it. I have only heard about this from people not in the field, which isn't a good sign.</p>
<p>Moreover, Tao's approach could be going in the wrong direction.  The community is totally split on whether Navier-Stokes has a singularity, so we don't really know which direction we should prove.  This is different than say, the Riemann conjecture, where nearly everyone assumes it is true, but we just don't have a proof yet.  It may very well be the case that the Navier-Stokes equations <em>don't</em> blow up.</p>
<p>To give one point of data, I think the ideas of Camillo De Lellis and László Székelyhidi on &quot;wild solutions&quot; are much more interesting, and much more likely to reveal results in the next few years.  In fact, their results so far have already been outstanding, and represent some of the biggest progress in decades.  They also use a completely new set of tools, namely convex integration, that hadn't been used in fluids really at all.  Granted, this is for the Euler equations, not Navier-Stokes, but the community is watching these guys, while not really paying attention to Tao.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coming from quantum information, the basic idea of embedding computational systems into physical ones is bread and butter (so it's a beautiful general idea that I chose to spend my life researching, but not the kind of A+ level creative or exciting idea that I expect from a mathematician).  Just being honest, but Tao's approach seems pedestrian enough that I thought it was just blog material when I first heard of it.  It will be great if it turns out to succeed though, I have no guess on that front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is awesome!  I didn't know about that recent result of Isett.  He's a young man who clearly had a lot of promise, and now he has made a major contribution.  It is also fantastic news (if it is true), that we finally have a resolution to this 67 year old conjecture!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not generally believed that Navier-Stokes is close to being solved.  This statement </p>
<blockquote>
<p>my PDE professor said that most of the mathematics community expects him to be the one to win the prize for it.</p>

<p>might be true, but only in the sense that <em>'if the problem were to be solved in the near future, he is more likely than any other mathematician to be the one that solved it'</em>, not <em>'the problem is likely to be solved in the near future, by him'</em>.</p>
<p>In particular, this prediction</p>

<p>This particular professor was so confident that he predicted that Dr. Tao would do it by 2016.</p>
