			<div class="markdown"><p>Potential gravitational energy is based <em>entirely</em> off an arbitrary reference point. When he mentioned the elevator, it was assumed the reference point is where the elevator was lowest, so he would have gained potential energy, but I could choose to think of the floor of the elevator as the reference point, in which case it stays the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a potential energy associated with the system that consists of you and the Earth. As you increase the distance between you and the center of the Earth, this energy increases in value.</p>
<p>The energy associated with your mass is independent of this potential energy.</p></div>		</li>
