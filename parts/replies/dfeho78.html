			<div class="markdown"><p>We had to wear gloves and safety goggles, OSHA rules were not broken (except maybe no waist leashes to the dangerously high platform). There was one time I was involved with a rule being broken, it was the &quot;Team lift&quot; rule. The other person on my team didn't lift, 12 years later my back still cripples me with pain on a regular basis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a person in the scrap industry I have one correction to make. The hammers on the shredder are not titanium, but rather high manganese forged steel. They wear out every 5,000gt or so and have to be replaced. The trouble with scrapping the hammers at the end of their usable life is the high manganese which most steel mills will not take in their raw materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're probably right, I suppose it's also possible that the machine this scrapyard used then (10 years ago now) had titanium (or titanium alloy) hammers. The machine may have been old even then, it was literally powered by a train engine that we had cables running across the grounds to connect the shredder to the train (Scrapyard had rxr tracks right through the middle of it). I only heard them say what it was made out of once though, so it's entirely possible it used manganese forged steel and I misheard/misremembered it as titanium. </p></div>		</li>
