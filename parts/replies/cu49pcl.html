			<div class="markdown"><p>How does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYv82K27rX8" target="_blank">a StopSaw (SawStop?)</a> work then? Are there capacitors throughout the entire blade, on the tip of every saw tooth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, I was actually thinking about referencing that product in my original answer. </p>
<p>A sawstop can actually afford to be quite simpler. A phone needs many capacitive plates in it because it needs to know where your finger is with a lot of accuracy. But a sawstop only needs to know when your finger is near it at all. That means that the entire blade becomes one big capacitor!</p>
<p>You could touch the blade on the body of it, or on the part hidden under the table, and the mechanism would still activate. It's just that, for safety reasons, the blade tips are often the only thing you'll be near. </p>
<p>It's a wonderfully inventive use of the technology. The inventor deserves a lot of credit for figuring out to combine these two separate technologies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works in the exact same way, except there is only one sensor connected to the saw rather than the grid you'd find in a phone. It charges and discharges the blade and looks for a change in the energy needed, and trips when it's over a set threshold.</p></div>		</li>
