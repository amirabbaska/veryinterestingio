			<div class="markdown"><p>At the risk of sounding like a true 5 year old... If the particles are a parallel to the windows of the car, then we can open the windows and ventilate it. Is there any way we can &quot;cleanse&quot; those particles in some sort of fashion? Not asking whether it would be affordable or big enough to work, but if there's any possible way of doing it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You couldn't stop the greenhouse effect but you could reduce the amount of the sun's energy coming into the earth in the first place by putting aerosols into the upper atmosphere to reflect sunlight back into space. That exact thing happens during large volcanic eruptions which spew sulfate aerosols into our upper atmosphere and cause a noticeable drop in temperature over the next couple years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;ELI5&quot; top comment is a long essay on greenhouse gases and carbon emission. Your car analogy is far better and in spirit with the sub. I understand you cant simplify everything but this sub is a joke. Top post might as well be in a politics or world news thread.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explanation is actually wrong, unfortunately. The reason your car gets hotter than the surrounding air is almost entirely because the hot air is trapped from being able to rise. The effect of the windows blocking infrared radiation specifically is actually very minor. It's basically an entirely different mechanism from the &quot;greenhouse&quot; effect involved with global warming. Tagging /u/pillbinge in case he/she does not know this. </p>
<p>EDIT: omg, it's so depressing when completely incorrect comments get voted to the top and correct comments get downvoted. I'm a physicist, if that helps. Also, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect#Real_greenhouses" target="_blank">here</a> is wikipedia explaining the same thing...</p></div>		</li>
