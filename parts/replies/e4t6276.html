			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean starts to the left of the previous line because Chinese goes from right to left with the only exception when writing horizontally due to westernization. Novels, textbooks, newspapers and magazines are mostly written this way. If the novel/textbook, etc was translated from a foreign medium, then the lines would go horizontally which is left to right, top to bottom.</p></div>		</li>
