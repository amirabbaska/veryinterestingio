			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's a good example.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if all that survived of English writing were contained in one particular school that future archeologists discover, we'd also know things like that their/there/they're sounded identical to speakers because people wrote about how to know which is which by meaning.</p>
<p>Though this also shows the limitations of this sort of thing.  Considerations like teaching standard spelling and distinguishing homophones in writing is already greatly affected by dialect.</p></div>		</li>
