<p>Now here are 2-4 follow-ups...</p>
<p>What happens if a manufacturer tells GS1 to drop dead and just starts assigning their own bar code numbers?  Is there some law mandating that a manufacturer <em>must</em> deal with GS1?</p>
<p>Or what if they start using QR codes?  Are QR codes also regulated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they're going to have a hard time getting people to actually carry their products if their barcodes collide with pre-existing barcodes.  Or, worse, the barcode software that the company uses might choke on the non-standard barcodes and fail entirely. </p>
<p>The use of a particular barcode organization system doesn't need to be regulated by a government entity because it's regulated by the distributors (namely, distributors won't buy product from you to sell if they'd have to re-work their whole system to accommodate your special snowflake barcode).  For anyone moving enough product to actually put it on a shelf and scan it with a barcode, the cost of paying for GS1 barcodes and getting it universally recognized is trivially worthwhile.    </p></div>		</li>

<p>A barcode is essentially a quick number entry system.  </p>
<p>See those tiny numbers printed underneath the barcode?  That is (pretty much) the same number as the barcode itself, it's just written in a human-readable form.</p>
<p>Barcodes also contain a few figures to help calibrate the reader. The first, centre, and last digits are often markers (like those big squares in the corners of QR codes).  No data is stored there, it's just for helping with scanner/barcode alignment)</p>
<p>If a company decided to go their own way, they would still have to adopt parts of at least one of the standard barcode formats, otherwise readers wouldn't recognize it as a valid barcode.</p>
<p>But, once you get past all that, provided they go their own way and make a working bar code, I just scan the code and enter the info into the store's system, then add the rest of the product details, and it will work from then onward.  </p>
<p>The chances of it being the same code as another product are minimal.  If it was the same as something else already in inventory, you'd have to take the less common item, and give it a custom code, and train the staff to do manual entry on that one product.</p>
<p>tl;dr: not a big deal, hardly matters.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Barcode readers can read any unicode format, it's the software that interprets the barcode and not the reader. The reader simple transmits the bits like a regular keyboard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then when that manufacturer tries to get Kroger or Walmart or JoeShmoMart to sell their product the store will say, &quot;wait, you don't have a UPC? Please let us know when you get one or kindly piss off.&quot;  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, book publishers buy batches of ISBNs. These can be used in any order, so sometimes you'll notice a series of books have consecutive ISBNs even though they were published years apart because the publisher reserved a range of ISBNs for that particular series. Other times they're not consecutive because the publisher just uses the next available ISBN for books published in the interim.<br />
I assume other manufacturers also buy/are allocated UPCs etc in batches.<br />
Edit: Just double-checked the Wiki article and it seems that the system I'm familiar with from the UK is not universal and that issuing bodies are country specific - in some countries there is no fee for issuing an ISBN, in other countries there is a fee which can vary considerably (e.g. USA $125 for a single ISBN, Italy €49 for a batch of ten, UK £120 for a batch of ten).<br />
Also to add that a publisher will use the same ISBN for a <strong>reprint</strong> of an edition, but must use different ISBNs for different editions, i.e. hardback/paperback/ebook all require different ISBNs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, they made up a country called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookland" target="_blank">Bookland</a>, so that ISBNs have their own range in the EAN system. That's why most book barcodes start with 978.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks! used to work in a book store, and books starting with 978 is the one bit of barcode trivia I happened to pick up, and I was curious why... this is the most hilariously unexpected answer to this question...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Finland ISBNs are issued through our National Library and don't cost anything. I guess that the benefit for them is being sort of aware of the books that get published here, though they should receive a copy of all books anyway. And supporting literature  in a small language. Anyone can get an ISBN, even for a self published memoir that isn't even for sale. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL about ISBNs being a thing, thanks ! With EAN, it is a bit different, you don't buy specific numbers, you get registered by the GS1 which assign a manufacturer ID number that goes in each of your codes. You are then free to create product numbers however you want within that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like ISBNs were better known among the general public back when to order a book you couldn't just click onto amazon and you had to actually go into the store. We always used to take the ISBN down when possible because of the problem of two books having the same title or not knowing which book of an author's you wanted.</p>
<p>This makes me sound super old but I'm only in my twenties. Feels weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You generally can know the country of any book just at looking the ISBN. 978-987, for example, is an Argentinian book. The rest numbers represents the publisher and the specific book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that - </p>
<p>I work for a company that has some product in Wal-Mart and they specifically required us to create a barcode that was GS1 compliant or whatever.  So the big dogs actually have a requirement that your bar codes are in the GS1 database and helps eliminate any risk for redundancy.</p>
<p>I.e. Joe Blow can't mass produce something with his own made up bar code because Wal-Mart won't accept it.  </p>
<p>edit - changed 'allow it' to 'accept it'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup, that's why we had to buy the GS1 codes.   Most big retailers will want you to do that.  It costs them way more to fix overlapping codes.</p></div>		</li>
