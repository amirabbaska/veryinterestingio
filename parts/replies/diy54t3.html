			<div class="markdown"><p>My sleep position has changed so much over the past couple years. Throughout my childhood and 20s, I was a side sleeper who often spun from one side, to my belly, to my other side. After a bad work accident injured my shoulder pretty bad, I could only sleep on the opposite side. The shoulder is partially disabled, which helped me find out maybe laying on my back would be better. It took a lot of trial and error (and still changes from time to time), I have a ton of pillows- a reader with three to four other pillows to make a wedge and others for under my legs. Gotta love getting old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I slept on my left side exclusively for the first 25 years of my left. Then I injured my left shoulder bad enough that I either wake up in horrible pain or wake up in the middle of the night from the pain. So I had to completely retrain myself to sleep on my right. Took a lot of time and it still takes me longer to fall asleep on my right than it ever did on my left. Sometimes I still roll on to my left out of habit and fall asleep quickly only to wake up in pain. Sucks man. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I got a sleep test they insisted that I sleep on my back.  Took forever to get to sleep and they would wake me up nearly immediately because I kept rolling over to my side, as God intended for us to sleep!  :p~~~</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because the most severe respiratory events happen when people are in supine position &amp; the tongue and soft palate fall towards the back of the throat.</p>
<p>Especially as people get older and their resting muscle tone reduces.</p>
<p>Personally, I just let people fall asleep on their side if that's what they normally do, and just see if they go on their back on their own. If not, about 4-5 hours in right before they should go into REM I might go in and turn them if it's clinically useful. At this point there should be enough info to make a diagnosis.</p>
<p>For a CPAP study where they are being treated for sleep apnea, you always get the respiratory controlled lateral first before turning them supine. Waste of time otherwise.</p>
<p>And some people just can't do it, in which case why bother since if they can't do it with someone trying to make them they almost certainly don't do it at home.</p>
<p>TL;DR Your techs were making the kind of mistake a help desk does when they get outsourced and they`re reading off a list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard of anyone going to one of these studies and not getting a cpap. What would you say is the percentage of people who go in and don't need one? Are there any other disorders that a cpap doesn't address? Just curious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am going to schedule an appointment with a sleep specialist in the near future but maybe you can give me a small piece if information here...</p>
<p>I sleep on my back, always. And the second I fall asleep I start breathing through my mouth... <em>Loudly</em>.</p>
<p>I am not overweight, I'm physically fit, and my sleep schedule is consistent. I'm in bed at 10-11 and up around 7 nearly every day.</p>
<p>However apparently I snore so aggressively to the point that my girlfriend is scared. She said it sounds like im breathing water and loudly choking more than breathing, until eventually it builds to a point where I wake up.</p>
<p>I'm not out of breath and show no signs of breathing trouble when I awake, so prior to sleeping with my girlfriend I didn't realize why I was waking up so frequently - I had no idea I snored or had &quot;breathing trouble&quot;.</p>
<p>Despite my best efforts to eat well, sleep at a good hour, and be generally healthy in terms of sleep and lifestyle - I am always fatigued. (Being overtired all the time has actually started triggering some pretty bad anxiety as a side effect)</p>
<p>Again, i'm going to see a doctor shortly, but does this sound like apnea, or a condition of some sort? Or am I just a loud snorer and my issues are unrelated? I know you can't give me much other than a super high level diagnosis over the internet, but just figured I'd ask - it's been ruining me for a few years now.</p></div>		</li>
