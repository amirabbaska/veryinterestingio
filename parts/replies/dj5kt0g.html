			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, that's a good run down of reducing the size of the parts of the eye: rod and cone limits, aperture/lens size, diffraction, etc.  But what about the dimensions of the eye itself?  In particular, a smaller eye will have to have a smaller focal length.  This would require a significantly different curvature of the lens.  Is there a limit to a biological lens's curvature?  Would it reduce (or expand) the ability to adjust for near or far focus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small eyes, if we're talking insects and stuff, aren't built like ours.  Some of them are simple light sensors like those in flatworms, others collections of tiny lenses, as you see in insects.  Each of those little hexagons in an insect's eye contains a few light sensing cells, a lens, and optic nerves.  They don't, as often seen in movies, show the insect an array of the same image.  Each one sees a little bit of it's surroundings, and the brain meshes them all together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am more curious as to how we know this. How does science know that some animals see in color and others don't or a limited range? How does it know that flies don't see things as it is often portrayed in film?</p>
<p>From my perspective of ignorance, I can't imagine how we could come to understand these things without seeing through an insect's eyes ourselves. Or even how it would be possible to have an idea of how something non-human actually perceives things, because even two humans can perceive the same things differently to a degree. Red, for example, may not necessarily look exactly the same to everyone after the brain interprets the raw stimuli.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, would that mean that their brains are somewhat exceptionally powerful in the &quot;visual department&quot;?
I'm just wondering, merging two images seems to be a really complex matter already; can't imagine how difficult that would be with tens or more of separate images?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if you could swap every fourth pixel on a 4k monitor for an image sensing pixel and merge all the million images together. </p>
<p>The sensors would  be so tiny you wouldn't see that the monitor you're staring at is staring back at you. </p>
<p>Very Nietzscheish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well designed, expensive camera systems are typically diffraction limited, and we're well beyond the capability to make sensors below the diffraction limit of visible light. Cheaper systems (read: cell phones) usually aren't diffraction limited, and will often rely on algorithms to extract a good image.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The OnePlus3T and the Google Pixel have the exact same sensor but photos are better out the Pixel because of the algorithmic processing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In daylight (small pupil), your eyes' sensors (Retina) and the optics of your eye are pretty well matched, and pretty close to the diffraction limit in the fovea (if you have eyes of the correct length, aka you're not myopic/hyperopic). </p>
<p>Daytime pupil size: ~3mm</p>
<p>Focal length: ~22 mm</p>
<p>Cone pitch: 3 microns</p>
<p>Wavelength (smallest): 400 nm</p>
<p>Diffraction limited spot size: d=2.44*wavelength*FNumber = 7.2 microns</p>
<p>That's about 2 receptors per diffraction limited spot. Nyquist sampling says we should have 2 sampling points per resolved distance, so if our eye was diffraction limited, we just about have that. The question is, are the optics good enough?</p>
<p>As it turns out, we have a little better Nyquist frequency than predicted by the cone pitch (60 cycles/degree for healthy eyes). It is speculated this could be due to the hexagonal packing of the cones in the fovea.</p>
<p>So, not only are we approximately diffraction limited (in the daytime), our retinal sampling is very well matched to our optics.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, the retinal sampling frequency decreases with field of view (or eccentricity), closely following the optical resolution of the eyes' optics, which have field dependent aberrations as the FOV increases.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to hear the answer to this question. My guess is no, since an elephant probably doesn't need amazing vision to survive. Whales even more so, if we're comparing their air-vision to ours, but I'll bet they're great at seeing underwater.</p>
<p>My guess continued: Birds have better vision than we do for the most part (they can see things further away more clearly at least) because they had an evolutionary need to see rodents in the grass from far away. This doesn't negate whether bigger eyes (elephants/horses/whales) have higher quality vision than smaller though. So yeah, I don't know and would like to hear from a proper biologist.</p></div>		</li>
