			<div class="markdown"><p>not all plants absorb lead, or absorb it at the same rate from the soil.  You might be able to purposefully grow and then dispose of certain crops for several years to &quot;de-lead&quot; the soil.  Its called bio-remediation, however its not cheap to do all the testing required to know when you have enough lead out of the soil.  Or avoid plants that bio-accumulate lead.</p>
<p>It might be a lot easier to just remove and replace the top soil. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fascinating, how do you responsibly dispose of the crops after they've sequestered the lead? Can the lead be retrieved for industrial purposes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need to store it in a landfill, or whats really interesting, some bacteria can convert the lead to less harmful compounds, so what you would do is use one kind of plant to suck the lead out of the ground, and then a series of bacteria and fungus and other life process to slowly work the lead into harmless compounds, at the end of the line you have healthy soil.</p>
<p>It works with water as well, do some googling, some folks have built some really interesting systems to take pollution in at one end and spit out clean soil and water at the other.  Its a lot of work, but with careful application of various species you can bioremediate even really nasty stuff (like radiation, heavy metals, oil, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sunflowers are easier. They grow like weeds and sequester lead and most other heavy metals in their stems and seeds. They're water and sun intensive, but remediation via sunflower is a common bioredmediation technique. Additionally they're rather easily analyzed, which makes testing cheaper and more accurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction: A lot of university extension services have the bags and envelopes and instructions for you to collect and send your soil sample, with a check, to an actual lab that can test your soil for nutrients and scary non-nutrient things (you don’t want lead, for example). They don’t do the testing themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same is true if your house was built before 1978 and has ever been repainted. However, if you build raised beds and bring in new topsoil you can mitigate the contaminated soil issue, plus raised beds make really effective garden spaces.</p></div>		</li>
