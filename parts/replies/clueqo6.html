			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a young boy with this (I'm a paramedic). It was kinda bizarre, but I instantly understood why it used to be referred to as &quot;happy puppet syndrome&quot;. He had all of the signs and symptoms you've listed. Massive smile on him, but suffers with convulsions in a massive way. I really wanted to know what that life must feel like, because I just have no idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be a bad example, but it seems sort of like priapism in a spinal cord injury.  The body gives a response that we interpret one way (he's smiling, which indicates happiness) when they have no real ability to control what's happening and their reaction is a completely physical response completely unrelated to what's going on in their minds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a kid who will never walk, never talk, and never progress beyond a few month of age developmentally is going to be hard regardless.  I'll take that and happy 24/7 any day of the week bc who wants to think their severely developmentally challenged kiddo is also unhappy? </p></div>		</li>
