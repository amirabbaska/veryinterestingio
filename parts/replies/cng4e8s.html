			<p>Water, being more dense than air, will, for lack of a better word, &quot;support&quot; more weight. Try to hold something in the air, then underwater. It will feel like it weighs less because water &quot;pushes up&quot; more than air does.<br><br>EDIT: Buoyancy is the word I was trying to think of.</p>		</li>

			<p>You explained why efficient swimming and hunting/protection designs are important,  but i dont see any explanation as to why theyre not just as important for shallow water fish.  What are the selection pressures on &quot;normal&quot;  fish that cause them to be smooth and symmetrical when youve just stated that different designs are more efficient? </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/unanimous_anonymous" target="_blank">unanimous_anonymous</a>
			<p>The closer to the surface something resides, the more plentiful the populations become. Because of how scarce other fish are at such extreme depths, the bodies must be built to last for much longer lengths of time without food. For comparison,  its the difference in the water usage efficiencies between a non-desert species and a desert species. Both could benefit from retaining a lot of water, but the desert species NEEDS to retain water in order to survive. If that wasnt part of their ability, then they wouldnt survive very long in that environment.</p>		</li>

			<p>I understand this.  But its not like deepsea fish have this big list of selective pressures on them and shallow fish dont.  Shallow fish have a different set of selective pressures that force them to not use the &quot;more efficient&quot;  designs of deepsea fish. And i want to know what those are </p>		</li>

			<p>Evolution does not select for efficiency or complexity. Whatever survives passes on its traits. Shallow fish did not need higher efficiency designs to procreate successfuly. <br><br>Deepsea fish, however, are in a highly competitive biosphere. This would create the pressures required to select for traits that allow them to survive to procreation.<br><br>Edit: cleaned up the last paragraph.</p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly. A fish would not evolved differently because the fish's molecules somehow knew that it needed to be slimmer in order to attack an enemy faster in order to survive, it just so happens that fish who are slimmer can attack an enemy faster, thus surviving and passing those genes along. Discovery channel does this all the time.....&quot;The butterfly has what appears to be eyes on it's wings to scare aware predators&quot;, when in fact they should say &quot;Because the butterfly has what appears to be eyes on it's wings, predators are scared away&quot;. </p>		</li>

			<p>Does anyone ever actually think this, though? I don't understand why people clarify this every time evolution comes up; I'm pretty sure most people here understand that molecules aren't autonomous beings that have a definitive goal in mind.<br><br>I only ask because it seems to detract from meaningful discussion very often and it's frustrating to see an interesting thread derailed by someone who feels the need to emphasize it instead of address the original topic. </p>		</li>

			<p>You would be astonished at how many people are so used to thinking in terms of planning and intent that they think there's some 'will' behind evolution. Heck, even science fiction can be horribly guilty of this - Star Trek is an egregious offender. People think of &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; and think of the equivalent of the ripped, toned guy at the gym. For the general public's purposes, the process of evolution really should be described not as &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; but &quot;A giant game of 'Who's The Worst At Dying Childless'.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Short answer: Yes<br><br>Longer answer: Imagine no-one had ever really explained evolution to you properly and you were just kinda making half-formed guesses based on what people around you said about it. Or maybe they did but it was years ago and you forgot. Now further imagine that you'd never really thought about the whole thing too hard because it didn't seem relevant. <br><br>So yeah, there are a huge number of very complicated things in the world. We would go nuts if we all tried to understand them all, so it makes sense that lots of people don't try to understand things that aren't relevant to their lives. If knowledge of evolution gave you $500 more a year through better business practices, everyone would have it. It doesn't, so proper understanding is relegated to the lucky (were taught it properly) and the curious (surprisingly rare) who are able to tell fact from fiction (rarer still).</p>		</li>

			<p>Based on some of the comments on here, yes, some people do believe that animals (fish, in this case) have a certain trait because they need it to survive, NOT that they survive because they have a certain trait (or, they at least word their thoughts in a way that suggest this is what they believe). Statements like those are what detract from meaningful discussions on the topic (which is why I bring it up). <br></p>		</li>

			<p>Reading /u/owls_with_towels original comment, it seems as though fish with more eel-like body plans are more efficient swimmers, but fish with fish-like body plans are better at acceleration (not to mention they can afford its energy requirements) and therefore better hunters. So fish living at depth with less food available need to be more efficient, and therefore develop the eel body plan with some additional adaptations to help with hunting/discourage predation. Those additional adaptations are some of the 'weird' things we see (eg bioluminescence).<br><br>In other words, shallow fish need to be able to catch other fish (or escape) in areas of high biomass, while deep sea fish need to be able to conserve energy. Please correct me if I'm wrong, /u/owls_with_towels!</p>		</li>

			<p>In short, the eel-like bodies of deep sea fish are more efficient, but have lower capabilities. Kind of like a prius vs. a semi truck.</p>		</li>
