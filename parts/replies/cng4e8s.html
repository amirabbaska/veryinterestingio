			<div class="markdown"><p>You explained why efficient swimming and hunting/protection designs are important,  but i dont see any explanation as to why theyre not just as important for shallow water fish.  What are the selection pressures on &quot;normal&quot;  fish that cause them to be smooth and symmetrical when youve just stated that different designs are more efficient? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The closer to the surface something resides, the more plentiful the populations become. Because of how scarce other fish are at such extreme depths, the bodies must be built to last for much longer lengths of time without food. For comparison,  its the difference in the water usage efficiencies between a non-desert species and a desert species. Both could benefit from retaining a lot of water, but the desert species NEEDS to retain water in order to survive. If that wasnt part of their ability, then they wouldnt survive very long in that environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand this.  But its not like deepsea fish have this big list of selective pressures on them and shallow fish dont.  Shallow fish have a different set of selective pressures that force them to not use the &quot;more efficient&quot;  designs of deepsea fish. And i want to know what those are </p></div>		</li>
