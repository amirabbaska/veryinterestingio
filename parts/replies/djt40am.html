			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual entomologist here.  Very good and succinct answer, I was going to post the exact same thing.  </p>
<p>Hijacking this comment to also add that the firing of a nerve's action potential has a refractory period, a sort of &quot;reloading&quot;, which is longer than a single wing beat using the indirect flight method.  It would be physically impossible to fire one nerve for every one wing beat fast enough to fly.  </p>
<p>An example of a direct flight muscle attachment in insects can be found in dragonflies and mayflies, thought to be the most primitive groups of flying insects.  These insects' nerve and muscle control attaches directly onto the base of the wings.  As a result these insects flap their wings much less quickly, but have much more control, to the point that they can flap their two pairs of wings independently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this part of the reason bugs flight seems so erratic? I imagine the first beat being the strongest and each successive beat losing energy.</p>
<p>Though the beats seem so quick that they would quickly &quot;average&quot; out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is certainly a loss of control when a single nerve impulse amounts to several wing beats, called asynchronous flight (see /u/alanmagid's answer), but any loss of power is negligible.  Insects with 1:1, nerve to flap ratios like butterflies and dragonflies are exquisite flyers, not the least bit clumsy or erratic.  One incredibly useful thing which asynchronous flight allows for, though, is smaller wings can generate the same amount of lift.  </p>
<p>Flies have special organs called halteres which compensate for this reduction of control by giving them greater perception of their balance and orientation.  Beetles, arguably the worst flyers, have no compensatory mechanism, and are generally clumsy, inept flyers with little control.  Their small wings, however, allow them to safely tuck their flight wings beneath a hard outer shell, so their wings are designed to be as compact as possible while still getting the job done.  </p>
<p>One additional thing I will say is that once an insect itself is small enough, the viscosity of the air becomes a major factor for how flight works.  Imagine that if your body was millions of times smaller and lighter than it is now the fluid mechanics of air become much more noticeable.  As a result, different techniques to generate lift, like <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/19/3076" target="_blank">clap-and-fling</a>  have to be employed in very small insects, which are only possible with ultra-fast, asynchronous wing beats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A dozen or more years ago I read that a fly's wing-flapping is connected to their legs. The flapping starts when the fly's leg is straight, and stops when its knee is bent. So to take off, the fly just &quot;jumps&quot;, straightening its leg and the fly flies. To land, it just crashes into something legs first. When its knees bend, the wings stop.</p>
<p>Is that true? It was a side note in an article about robotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like each contraction/expansion equals a beat. The top comment was saying that the muscles move less than one cycle for the wings to move one cycle. Here it looks like a one to one ratio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, the muscles forcefully contract for the first cycle, then relax for multiple cycles. Even though the muscles are still moving, it's a result of the vibration rather than a direct action by the muscle cells.</p>
<p>OP's guitar string analogy may not be the greatest since you typically don't remain in contact with a guitar string as it continues to vibrate, so a better example might be a swingset: If you pump your legs while sitting on a swing, you can set it into motion, but once moving, the motion continues even if you stop pumping your legs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This confused me when I first started learning insect anatomy too. </p>
<p>B's are the attachment points of the wings to the exoskeleton, so each wing is attached to two plates of exoskeleton. If you picture an insect wing as a <a href="http://www.school-for-champions.com/machines/images/levers_class_1.gif" target="_blank">lever</a> These two points act as the effort and fulcrum.  The air surrounding the wing is therefore the load.</p>
<p>D's are another pair of muscles running from front to back of the insect's thorax, contrasted with the C muscles which run top to bottom.  When C flexes it forces the wings up, but When the D muscles flex they sort of &quot;pop&quot; the thorax back into it's original shape, forcing the wings down.  As you can guess, the &quot;down-stroke&quot; is where all the real work happens.  </p></div>		</li>
