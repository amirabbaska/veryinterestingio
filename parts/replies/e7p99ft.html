			<div class="markdown"><p>Also keep in mind all insects and arachnids have a hard skin that the muscles attach to instead of bones.
So different leverage involved in muscles moving legs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't really walk as such, but they do move their legs to manipulate their perch.  For example, they wouldn't be able to lean down to get their proboscis into your skin without moving their legs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said,I love the part about nervous and muscular systems being connected. Insects have muscles in their legs, and they have five segments to the leg, and muscles generally connect two adjoining sections which makes the musculature in insect legs quite complex. The first muscle crosses from the sternites (side bones) of the thorax to the coxa, next I believe the muscles run from the coxa across the trochanter to the femur, then muscles run from the femur to the tibia, then there are 2 to 5 segments in the tarsi, which are separately muscled, ending in a pad. </p>
<p>The action of insect legs is generally in triads, with the front left, middle right, and hind left legs acting together. However the neural ganglia are in each thoracic segment, 3 separate ganglia each with the halves operating in opposition. The neural pattern is quite complex.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I took General Zoology, my professor refused to refer to the systems as separate and instead called it the &quot;neuromuscular systerm&quot;.  His reasoning for that stuck with me.</p></div>		</li>
