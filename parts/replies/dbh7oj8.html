			<div class="markdown"><p>We literally, completely, and wholly have no idea. We have never in any way whatsoever discovered why or how the Big Bang And What Happened After did not result in equal amounts of matter and antimatter. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry" target="_blank">From the wiki, which does posit some general guesses</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The baryon asymmetry problem in physics refers to the imbalance in baryonic matter and antibaryonic matter in the observable universe. Neither the standard model of particle physics, nor the theory of general relativity provides an obvious explanation for why this should be so, and it is a natural assumption that the universe be neutral with all conserved charges. The Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Since this does not seem to be the case, it is likely some physical laws must have acted differently or did not exist for matter and antimatter.</p>
<p>Several competing hypotheses exist to explain the imbalance of matter and antimatter that resulted in baryogenesis. However, there is as of yet no consensus theory to explain the phenomenon. As remarked in a 2012 research paper, &quot;The origin of matter remains one of the great mysteries in physics.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's more in the realms of philosophy than science at this point, as there is no way to test for the presence of another universe outside our own.</p>
<p>Given current understanding though, I'd say it's extremely unlikely. It is theorised that both antimatter and matter were produced at the same time during the big bang; the big mystery is: why was the process asymmetrical?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a problem with observation, we know that much. While looking at a single star wouldn't tell you if it was antimatter or normal matter, we know that our world is normal matter, and that there are traces of gas and dust throughout space, even intergalacticly. This means that if there were antimatter regions of space, we would see the clouds of matter interact with antimatter stars, as well as clouds of antimatter interact with normal stars. </p>
<p>We aren't entirely sure why there is so much normal matter. Based on most models of the universe, the same amount of matter and antimatter should have been created after the big bang, and would have all annihilated itself, leaving nothing left over. That is clearly not the case, because there is something and not nothing. The leading explanation is that, for some reason, for every billion particles of antimatter, there were a billion and one particles of matter. The billion antimatter particles, and a billion of the matter particles annihilated eachother, and the remaining matter became the galaxies and the stars and the planets and us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could the difference be explained by probabilities?  I.e., there was an equal chance that energy would transition into either matter or anti-matter, and that it just &quot;happened&quot; to produce more of one than the other?  (Similar to flipping a coin 10 times, and 6 of them coming up heads, etc.)</p>
<p>Additionally, once matter is formed, is it possible for that matter to influence the formation of additional matter, such that it would lead to more like-matter being produced?  So if anti-matter formed, it would be more likely that energy would form as more anti-matter, and the same but reverse if matter formed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a probabilistic element to it, yes. But it still doesn't explain why matter won out. Let's use the coin flipping analogy, because it seems useful here. Say you flipped a coin once, and it comes up heads. Not unexpected. Say you flipped a coin ten times, and it comes up heads 6 times, and tails 4 times. Still not unexpected. Say you flipped it a hundred times, and it comes up heads 60 times, and tails 40 times. Now it starts to get strange. Say you flipped the coin a quintillion times, and you still get significantly more heads. While technically possible, it is extremely unlikely with a fair coin, so the reasonable assumption is that the coin is not fair. Thus, in the same way, we know that there is almost certainly some reason the universe favors matter. We just aren't sure why it does.</p>
<p>As for your second question, I honestly don't know, though my intuition says no. If that were the case, then we should have found some evidence to support it. Though, my intuition may be entirely wrong, as they often are in science. We will simply have to continue searching for answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... in the big bang, is it believed the vast majority of 'stuff' in the universe was simply destroyed in that matter-antimater annihilation?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive always felt that the majority of anti matter exist on the outside of the observable universe and it's whats causing the universe to expand like it is, due to the constant annihilations on its edge.  Any theory into this I can read on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know of any. That wouldn't really fit the data though. Why would galaxies fly towards explosions? Why would they speed up as they got closer to the edge, rather than be propelled back by the force of the explosions? For that matter, what are the odds that we'd be in the center of this whole thing? It just doesn't fit, unfortunately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The energy released by matter/anti-matter annihilation at the boundary area between predominantly matter and predominantly anti-matter regions of space would be observable from Earth. At least, if those regions of space are relatively smaller in scale than the observable sphere of the universe. I'm unfamiliar with anything that disproves there being structures larger than are observable from our vantage that are predominantly antimatter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it would be observable on the  cosmic scale. If there were antimatter stars and galaxies next to normal stars and galaxies, the clouds of gasses they expel would meet between them and annihilate, resulting in light shows that might outshine their host bodies. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, identical spectra means the electronic behavior is unchanged, so by extension a ton of other properties should be the same - in particular, it means it should have the same chemical behavior.  So while your point is valid, I think the conclusion being drawn is not unreasonable in a common language sense.</p></div>		</li>
