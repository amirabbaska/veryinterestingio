			<div class="markdown"><p>Move, yes.</p>
<p>Move continuously? no.</p>
<p>Assuming the outside magnet is stationary, there will be an equilibrium state that it will move to then stay in. Wherever the forces of repulsion balance each other out. It's <em>possible</em> to find a sweet spot that creates a pattern that takes a while before it settles into equilibrium, but probably not particularly likely in your set up.</p>
<p>The outer magnet will have to either move or have its poles switched back and forth (such as with alternating current) to be able to create a cyclical movement in the fan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. But not indefinitely. You need electromagnets to do that (which is how that pc fan works btw) if you place a magnet near the fan the blades will move untill they are closest then stop. If you wanted to keep moving you would then have to remove that magent and place it somewhere else. </p></div>		</li>
