</blockquote>
<p>Close; he was willing to accept the <em>possibility</em>, given that evidence, but knew it needed replicated, thus why he spoke in terms of &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; rather than it being a surety which exists undeniably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey I love Robert Heinlein.  He might be most famous for 1959's hard science fiction novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers" target="_blank">Starship Troopers</a>.  I couldn't think of what novels he wrote that talked about telepathy and then it hit me.  His arguably most famous novel, 1961's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land" target="_blank">Stranger in a Strange Land</a>, is about telepathy.  And telepathy is also the entire premise of 1956's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_for_the_Stars" target="_blank">Time for the Stars</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that collection in particular, &quot;Assignment in Eternity&quot;.</p>
<p>For instance in Lost Legacy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[regarding ESP research:] &quot;Look at what Rhine accomplished at Duke.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, telepathy is positively proved, though still unexplained, by Dr. Rhineâ€™s experiments.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...the possibility of direct telepathic control, the Rhine experiments, and similar matters...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Gulf, in the context of ESP being very real:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His tutor in E.S.P. ... At telepathy ... He called the Rhine cards once without a miss</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Time for the Stars mentioned by /u/ToDeathYouSay above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a deck of cards [for testing ESP] ...they were the classic Rhine test  cards, wiggles and stars and so forth...the Rhine cards were just another boring test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Stranger in a Strange Land:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[regarding &quot;Fair Witness&quot; Cavendish:] his professional hypnotic instruction had been undergone as a fellow of the Rhine Foundation.</p>
<p>&quot;Anne, you trained at Rhine...Have you seen levitation before?&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also telepathy of sorts in Starship Troopers. Can't remember which mission, but there's a part where Rico's unit holds an area while  what is implied to be telepath shows up. He supposedly just kind of wanders around and then doodles up a map of the bug's tunnels underneath. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am choosing to accept your answer and context, because I don't want to personally believe in Turing's mortal foibles.</p>
<p>That Heinlein accepted this (more or less) really brings home how pervasive  acceptance of those findings must have been, at least to futurologist types.</p></div>		</li>
