<p>It is! Some cursory searching on Google Scholar didn't turn up much on this specific type of case; could you furnish a link to the literature? I'd love to read more about psychosis in the disabled population.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It seems like it may be the case that language hallucinations and up misattributed to the auditory track by both deaf and hearing . More nuance regarding the  mechanism of the hallucination as elicited through sign language could suggest something closer to a linguistic hallucination in sign language  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd have to do some digging from about 2 years back when I had the research papers at hand, but I will certainly try. And honestly, there hasn't been much research done on this anyways, so don't think that this is something that is commonplace. It may be, it may not be, but the truth is there are plenty of schizophrenic individuals who are never even identified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Off topic, but if you wouldn't mind answering a quick question. Is it true that the &quot;voices&quot; experienced by schizophrenics are culturally determined? I've read accounts of individuals of different cultural backgrounds experiencing different types of auditory hallucinations (e.g. menacing vs. playful vs. soothing). However, these always seem over-generalized (say it with me friends: Africa is not a country). However, I had a professor in college whose area of research was cultural response to alcohol, and his observations about how the biological and behavioral responses to intoxication were almost entirely culturally dependent were mind-blowing. But again, he was just one researcher. The idea that the experience of mental illness may be largely culturally dependent is fascinating, especially in light of the point you make about it having such a strong biological component (not that the two are necessarily mutually exclusive). Thoughts? Research?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not &quot;just one researcher&quot; at all. Many studies have been conducted on this. While their credibility varies and the samples are predominantly university students in the USA, there is a largely found correlation between inebriation levels and social interation. Concerning your question on culturally determined &quot;voices&quot;, that would be most likely the case. I dare say it is probably 100% the case, and I say this with confidence only because of the following facts: speech and communication is socially determined. A paranoid schizophrenic would not hear random statements such as &quot;look at that car, it's red&quot;, but rather would be related to their own thoughts. If a person feels they are always being watched and people think negatively of them, the voices tend to speak in a negative manner. This is a well established relationship and it supports the theory that a schizophrenic's voices are actually their own voice which they cannot distinguish from another. </p>
<p>Think of it this way - if you are only aware of what you currently aware of, if your subconscious speaks to you, your conscious, that is, your awareness, would be taken by surprise, since in a healthy individual, the subconscious does not overtly interact with the conscious. They are not separate, but it's not like someone can experience their subconscious since by definition, it is that which us underneath your current awareness. It's like hearing yourself over the phone - you know it's you if someone tells you or you find out for sure, but often times you cannot recognize yourself. That is because how you sound to yourself and how others hear you is completely different due to the positioning of our ears relative to our mouth. In much the same way you can imagine how the conscious cannot recognize the unconscious if it communicates directly and surfaces without notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense that the unconscious itself and therefore its &quot;voice&quot; are culturally influenced, if not completely determined. But aren't there other factors that would greatly influence that voice that are more universal? The acutely mentally ill are often, regardless of what society they live in, ostracized, poverty-ridden, and even physically abused. So when people of different cultures experience hallucinations differently is it because the culture they were raised in or the language they were raised with affect their perception of their own mind throughout their lives, regardless of personal experience? Can the tone of hallucinations profoundly change with external events or is the nature of the subconscious &quot;voice&quot; permanent? Would two schizophrenic individuals, raised in similar circumstances, say good childhood, educated, but now homeless due to their mental illness, but in different cultures experience hallucinations in vastly different ways? Obviously this could be the case on an individual basis, not just across cultures but within them, but is it enough to generalize that schizophrenics of X culture hear menacing voices, while schizophrenics of Y culture experience playful ones? Moreover, based on what you say about the subconscious &quot;speaking&quot; wouldn't the nature of the hallucinations be shaped by the primary language of the individual in question, regardless of the culture they lived in? Sorry for the wall of text, I just find it fascinating that what for one person may be a near haunting can for another be a jovial commentator, entirely based on where in the world they happened to be born.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely. In some cultures, individuals with schizophrenia hear positive feedback instead of the telltale western society negative feedback. It truly depends on the demeanor of the culture. I think that the reason an American would hear such negative feedback is likely due to how they feel about themselves. I can't put a precise thumb on where I read this (likely a textbook as I have a MS in Rehabilitation Counseling). Here is a link to kind of back it up though: <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/" target="_blank">http://news.stanford.edu/2014/07/16/voices-culture-luhrmann-071614/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That speech is something in our DNA based on the fact that deaf persons described hearing voices seems like a very far-fetched conclusion that should be ignored unless there is more evidence that you are not describing in your comment. I'm sure that a deaf person, even though they have never heard a person speak, have an idea of what speech sounds like, one that most likely doesn't resemble the real version but nevertheless convinces them that they are hearing a person talk if they get to experience it. After all, even a schizophrenic person only thinks that they are hearing a voice because they're experiencing the sensation they identify as speech. Pulling DNA into this debate without any reason what so ever is exactly the reason why there are news agencies reporting that a glass of wine is as good as an hour of exercise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not THE conclusion, but A conclusion. A possibility. DNA is inevitably linked to most of what we do. It is not at all far-fetched to consider that it may play a role in things we do not see a connection with on a surface level. And you say yourself that a deaf person has an idea of what human speech sounds like. If you believe this, and we know that they have never experienced it, then where does this idea come from? You cannot explain noise to someone who has never heard it. Or the color blue to someone who is colorblind. Such explanations are relative to what WE experience and are thus subjective. Given all that, only one logical assumption remains: this individual MUST have something built into their body, something inside them that is NOT part of the outside world, INTERNAL to them, that leads to them hearing these voices. Given DNA's roles in such large parts of our lives, it is not at all far-fetched to say that the propensity for human speech has genetic elements. After all, it is in our genes to build a body that has vocal chords and a tongue capable of making the sounds we recognize today. Why not to be in our genes a way for those structures to function? Why not in our minds, our brains, a predetermined expectation of what those would sound like? We are inevitably a result of the environment and our genes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being A conclusions does not qualify it for being mentioned, especially if you are a qualified person that represents, whether they want it or not, the scientific community. Stuff like this belongs into a scientific debate between people who are literate in the topic enough to distinguish between scientific theories and purely hypothetical ideas that have no statistical relevant evidence yet.</p>
<p>And you did not understand me correctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And you say yourself that a deaf person has an idea of what human speech sounds like. If you believe this, and we know that they have never experienced it, then where does this idea come from?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These statements of yours imply that I meant that the idea a deaf person has to human speech has any correlation with what speech actually sounds like, which I explicitly did not say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[an idea of human speech] that most likely doesn't resemble the real version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Deaf persons merely have a <em>concept</em> of what human speech sounds like. If something they experience matches exactly this concept, it is impossible for them to determine if it is real or not. Just like you and me have a concept of speech as well and can't determine the realness of a sound if it matches our concepts of that. But the concept of the deaf person doesn't have to match the ones we have at all. That's why DNA is redundant, it's not a necessary part of the equation because we can't determine the concept a deaf person has to sound. Because of this, I can also follow that you are talking about an idea here that you came up on your own, which is something, I want to empathize again, is morally wrong because you represent the scientific community. </p></div>		</li>
