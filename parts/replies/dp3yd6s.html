			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this response... If you assume retroviruses evolved from RNA viruses a good question might be what advantage does reverse transcriptase offer to an RNA virus? One advantage is it allows the RNA virus to integrate in the host genome and persist indefinitely. I don't think anyone knows for sure what retroviruses evolved from though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also by keeping its own genetic encoding as RNA makes it much more susceptible to mutations, creating new strands that can survive attempts to destroy the original strand.  Information stored in DNA is much more resilient to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a point of pedantic clarification: While it is true that DNA is much more stable than RNA and therefore less prone to breaking and mutating, the frequent mutations of retroviruses are much more closely tied to the error-prone nature of reverse transcription. Whereas DNA and RNA polymerases are able to proofread and fix their mistakes, reverse transcriptase (RT) cannot do this. I cannot remember the exact frequency, but I seem to recall that HIV 1 RT makes an error in one in &lt;10,000 bases. Which is pretty frequent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's not any fundamental reason why a DNA virus couldn't do the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there are <em>some</em> DNA viruses that have been noted to integrate into the host genome in some instances, retroviral integration is a core step in its life cycle and is achieved via the viral intregrase enzyme, which DNA viruses lack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Retroviruses probably didn't evolve from RNA viruses, but from retrotransposons, or at least that's probably where reverse transcriptase came from. They may have acquired capsid genes and envelope glycoproteins from RNA viruses, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be possible to argue that the &quot;point&quot; of evolution is to make a species survive with the &quot;genetic tools&quot; that are available though? Perhaps I should have stated my question in the title more clearly: by asking &quot;what's the point&quot; I meant to ask what is the evolutionary advantage of having a reverse transcriptase that generates DNA from RNA instead of simply having DNA.
edit: I have read your edited answer and I have to say that I can't disagree with you, again, I should have stated my question with different words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally don't like some of the baggage that the word 'point' carries with it in regards to evolution, but I can understand the use of the word in the context you describe. Like I said, I think your question is a good one. It's important to look at advantages and disadvantages in regards to every organisms survival strategies because there are always give and takes to each. But it can be a slippery slope to ask, &quot;why doesn't it do this, it would be more efficient&quot; because it glosses over, what I consider, to be a central idea in evolutionary theory: that sometimes things are the way they are because of a long series of random changes with some limited amount of selection. I'm really not trying to discount your question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;point&quot; is that it works. It will die off when it stops working. The virus doesn't care if another way might have been better. </p>
<p>RNA viruses do have the advantage of rolling their genetic dice more frequently than DNA viruses, which can help them escape host defenses. But the virus doesn't care whether there is an advantage, or whether it uses that advantage to survive. All that matters is that it is successful in the niche it occupies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution is kind of like brute forcing, millions of mutations happen, most are neutral, some cause the specimen to die and so they don't get passed on and some make them better than other specimens in some way so they are more likely to survive and/or reproduce.</p></div>		</li>
