<p>instead of moving the clock to 45 mins, they would move it to 40, allowing the clock to be moved to 55 mins to show Advantage.</p>

<p>I don't know that you're wrong, but how does it make sense to <strong>always</strong> make the inconsistent ten point jump from 30-40 (instead of 30-45) to avoid the 45-55 ten point jump for &quot;Advantage&quot; rather than making the 30-45 jump (15 points, just like the other standard points) and then sometimes making that 45-55 jump for Advantage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to win a game by 2. Rather than continuing to count if a game is 40-40 (also called deuce), the winner of the next point is given advantage. If the player with advantage wins again, the game is won. If the player with advantage loses, the game is reset to deuce. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Wikipedia article also suggests this theory. People were harsh to downvote you. Both are theories rather than fact.</p>
<p>Edit: when I posted this it was on -13. Glad to see this rectified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, both this theory and the theory posted above have been suggested. Both theories make sense but neither has ever been proven, so they are just theories. With how much time has passed, we probably won't ever truly know where the scoring system came from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, -13? It's alarming how misinformed people are about what constitutes theory and fact. Every time I encounter something I actually know about on this website, I'm alarmed by how carelessly the line between knowledge and hearsay is treated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the &quot;jeu de paumme&quot; nonsense an actual theory and not something that that redditor just made up?</p>
<p>I always thought that the clock theory made complete sense, including the use of &quot;deuce&quot; because that word comes from the French for &quot;dozen&quot;, meaning both hands of the clock would be pointing to 12.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Excellent thread!</p>
<p>If I might add, I believe the term &quot;deuce&quot; is a derivation of &quot;douzes&quot; (French for &quot;twelves&quot;), a reference to both hour hands being at the twelve o'clock position.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But in (modern) French &quot;deuce&quot; is called &quot;égalité&quot;. Did they change it sometime in the past?</p></div>		</li>
