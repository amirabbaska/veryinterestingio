			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually works well all over the place - any situations where a choice has to be made.</p>
<p>Helps if you also throw in &quot;right?&quot; and &quot;makes sense?&quot; Occasionally to build momentum in your favor. Because to say &quot;no&quot; to those questions feels confrontational, and most people avoid that. And then to go back on your &quot;yes&quot; makes it feel like you are changing your mind or not listening, which makes you feel stupid, so most people avoid that too.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with this, in regards to an impulse buy. People that go to auctions have plenty of opportunity to review the item before the auction begins AND they go with the intention of making some form of purchase. You have to register in order to bid, Bidding isn't something that can happen impulsively. </p>
<p>Is it this way all over the world, of just in the US? If there is psychology behind that technique, you would think it would be like that everywhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm this. I went to a bake sale auction with a real auctioneer. I ended up buying a small box of cinnamon rolls for $45 (retail price $5). I really didn't think I would be the winner. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the rolls were delicious.</p></div>		</li>
