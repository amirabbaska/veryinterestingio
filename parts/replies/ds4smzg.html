			<div class="markdown"><p>The word &quot;rhotacism&quot; is weird. In this case it means &quot;not able to pronounce the letter R (rho)&quot;.</p>
<p>However, in most common usage it describes the accents of the same language where some speakers pronounce the R (rhotic), and those who do not (non rhotic). So for example, American English is typically rhotic when the R comes at the end of syllables and words, and British English is non rhotic in the same cases. For example, in the words &quot;car&quot;, &quot;ladder&quot;, &quot;part&quot;, the R is usually heard in American English (rhotic), while in British English it's more similar to &quot;cah&quot;, &quot;ladda&quot;, and &quot;paht&quot; (non rhotic).</p>
<p>So, it's difficult to compare languages based on their level of rhotacism. Languages like French or German don't have very strong Rs, while Spanish is very rhotic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The accent feature is rhoticism, whereas rhotacism is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld3A3QCpXd4" target="_blank">speech impediment</a> where the speaker is unable to pronounce r's. Very similar spelling but different things.</p>
<p>Kind of confusing, because rhotacism means you are unable to pronounce r's, but in the context of accents, it's non-rhoticism that means you drop them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just meant that my &quot;r&quot; sounds like an &quot;h&quot; when I speak English, and I have difficulties to make it sound rhotic, even when I don't have a problem to produce the sound in other languages. It's the way I learnt (leahnt) English.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But in this case, the «h» does not really describe a sound, that is, it is not pronounced. That «h» basically just indicates that the previous vowel is longer &quot;leaant&quot;. I believe what you are describing is just the typical British accent, not rhotacism. And as far as I know German pronunciation of R is similar to British English. Maybe Dutch as well.</p></div>		</li>
