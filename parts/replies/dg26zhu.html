			<div class="markdown"><p>I get motion sickness on everything. Roller coasters. Cars. Boats. Planes. I feel as though my case is pretty extreme compared to most people's. It really sucks, and has gotten worse with age. I also suffer from vertigo from time to time. </p>
<p>Basically, I can't even be spun around to hit a pi√±ata without getting stuck feeling dizzy for hours afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get a prescription for scopolamine patches. They're a life saver. I literally would avoid any activity that involved boats or long car rides and amusement parks I was the guy that held everyone's items on the bench outside the ride. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'll give it a try! I am also that person who holds everyone's stuff at amusement parks too. The last time I flew I took antivert and I was fine thankfully. Windy roads make me sick, but if I'm the driver it's not too bad. I don't really go on boats often. I try to just avoid situations the best I can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one really knows, but they're researching it and have come up with the hypothesis that it has to do with the way individuals move, i.e. their inherent sway. The researchers also found associations between motion sickness and genes involved in eye and ear development, as well as balance. Also:</p>
<p><em>Certain groups of people are more likely to get motion-sick: kids, women, people who get migraines. The 23andMe study also found connections between the motion-sickness-prone and poor sleepers.</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a weird one.  I used to notice motion sickness all the time when I was a kid and we would drive to my grandparents in Niagara Falls.  It would happen every single time.</p>
<p>Then for years no motion sickness.  However I've just noticed it happening again when on my phone in a less than 15 min ride and I don't feel good for at least an hour later.</p>
<p>Why all those years without a problem and now it seems worse and more sensitive than ever?!?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps linked to inner ear development? Similar to kids loving spinny carnival rides but then hating them as adults. Maybe your ears have changed again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think genetics is quite as simple as directly comparing 1:1 against your parents.  Some of these things can be the result of the combination of many of the genes you have inherited.  In this case, your mix of inherited genes relating to the development of your ears, eyes and brain (and probably a number of other things) have left you more prone to suffering from motion sickness.  </p></div>		</li>
