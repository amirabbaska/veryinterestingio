Theoretically, however, we could always build a bigger antenna to hear it farther away. The issue is not us hearing it, but it hearing us.  Its equipment is non-upgradeable.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In principle, is it possible that light from the earliest anthropogenic fires is still radiating through space, and could be detected by some life form a great distance away if it had powerful enough sensing equipment?</p>
<p>What about light reflected from the surface of the earth?</p>
<p>What I'm basically asking is whether it's possible that some aliens out there could be watching the Earth's past unfold in &quot;real time&quot;?  And if they were, and they recorded it, could it be possible to have a video record of, say, the beginnings of human civilization?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So i don't remember  my astro physics  to much, been like 10 years now  since i took that class in uni, but wouldn't  the atmosphere  and magnetosphere interrupt, not to count  all the cosmic dust, granted there  are not so much  inside the solar  system, but there  are some. This is a problem with  photons yes? Radiowaves from the voyager skips  many of these obstacles right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simple fact that you can see Mars tells you that light can get from here to there, or back. For cosmic dust to block the light from your flashlight it would have to be in the form of an opaque cloud between here and there. </p></div>		</li>
