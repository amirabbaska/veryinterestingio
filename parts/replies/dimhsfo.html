			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it's possible to know if you're lying to yourself. All the typical symptoms are there, procrastination has ruined my social life, but I've done very well academically this far by sporadic studying and last minute cramming. How can you tell if you're lazy and unmotivated, or if you have faulty brain chemistry? I mean even the former can be traced back to brain chemistry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read ADHD people generally don't just have attention problems, they tend to have other processing problems too.</p>
<p>Most ADHD books mention the high occurrence of learning disabilities that tend to be subtle and not necessarily noticed by the patient (dyscalculia, visual spatial, sensory and auditory processing seem to be the most common).</p>
<p>Russell Barkley has a great series of videos outlining all the different ways by which we can differentiate ADHD from a &quot;normal&quot; inability to sustain attention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have ADHD and dyscalculia. It's a good point that the learning disabilities can be subtltle. I didn't realize I had dyscalculia until I was 17 (and I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until 14). I'm quite good at math but I've always made &quot;careless mistakes&quot; like transpositing numbers. I can't tell left from right instinctually, most of the time I have to do the hand signal thing. I can't read an analog clock with a simple glance. I can't estimate distance at all, a mile or 20 feet or whatever is just an abstract concept to me. I always thought I was just weird until I learned what dyscalculia is and, just as with my ADHD diagnosis, so many things about me suddenly made perfect sense.  </p>
<p>This is pretty irrelevant to the topic but it's so infrequent that I encounter someone who actually knows what dyscalculia is! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. In my research I have met people who have managed to convince themselves they have ADHD. So when we find people telling doctors they have attention problems, but they don't really have ADHD, we make the conscious effort not to paint them as liars or abusers. My goal is that these people should be tackled with the correct intervention to address their perceptions. And most people get to that place because they are having trouble coping with the stressors in college. So we are trying to find ways to help them deal with the stress without using stimulants!</p>
<p>And finally, if you feel like you <em>might</em> have ADHD, but you aren't sure: go seek out a specialist. They are practitioners who specialize in attention deficit, developmental, and learning disabilities who should be able to tell you if you actually have ADHD or not. Their diagnoses are based not just on how you narrate your symptoms, but on cognitive behavioral testing. This testing can take anywhere from an hour to 4 hours on a computer, but they will guide you through a process and diagnose accurately. I understand what you mean when you say being lazy is also brain chemistry, but it is brain chemistry that causes laziness does not need treatment with stimulants! Whatever you problem is, a specialist should be able to help you find the right solution! Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your response, I have been diagnosed adhd inattentive type by a psychologist (with depression). It only took one meeting, and just me desribing my history, which i did truthfully but I fear my own confirmation bias. I've been put on concerta, which has helped, or maybe its just a placebo effect. I think the long term risks were also underplayed. Reading all the people critical of adhd, the societal bias against it, I think I will have to get a second opinion from a specialist who will do cognitive testing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One good clue is that even when I'm highly motivated I can't stop myself from getting distracted by anything and everything. One example: without meds I clean up randomly all over the house. Start by thinking I'll do the bathrooms, but end up clearing out the garage. On meds I do the thing I planned on doing, <em>then</em> move on to the next project. Also no ability to shut up ever vs 10 seconds warning before my face starts excreting my stream of consciousness. It really fucking helps in meetings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate this, not just because it makes managing my private life hell but because it makes working on my work hell despite the fact I am motivated at all times, it hurts like hell because I feel like I don't give it my all.
I've found I present better without my medication, as I always know what I'm talking about beforehand, and can the overall thrill of talking to an audience keeps me focused on the present/their questions. ( art student) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! So I just posted some of this info in the main thread but your response and area of study is a question I've wondered myself for many years. </p>
<p>So I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was six. That's right six years old. I've tried them all; Ritalin, vyvanse, adderall, adderall XR, Daytrana, strattera. I think at this point in my life I've been on some form of ADHD medication for 18 years.</p>
<p>The biggest distinction to me when using my medication vs when my friends used it in college to study, or clean, is that very rarely did I suffer any withdrawal or emotional effects when my medication wore off.</p>
<p>However, i did feel overly stressed or emotional when my dosage was too high. Which can be a tough distinction to make. Your attitude or mind could be affected by a myriad of issues or personal problems that might affect your mood or outlook on a particular day. What really was a sign, to me, was that if the response was proportional to the issue. Like did I feel that my world was gonna fall apart because I hopped a curb. (Exaggerating for effect).</p>
<p>At this point of my life I know what I'm like on my medication and when I'm off it and can try to compensate for it. I admit that sometimes I feel I need it but only because of daily pressures and my ability to work effectively. At least thats what I tell myself haha. If sometimes there is no way for me to have my medication I just try to keep myself aware on move on.   </p>
<p>But my question is that for those that take it and abuse it without really needing it, does that become a sort of long term addiction mentally? Leading to depression possibly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make a great point. People who actually have ADHD end up having to tweak their medication/dosage multiple times just to find what ends up working for them. This happens very often.  </p>
<p>For those who do not have ADHD, long term stimulant use, especially in greater frequency or dosage, can easily lead to addiction. Depression is one of the most common side effects of long term stimulant misuse. If you know someone in that position, stop them before it is too late, or ask them to seek help ASAP!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been on ADHD meds for about a decade and I had similar questions come up. In particular, why have I not developed a great dependency or addiction to the drug while others without my diagnoses have.</p>
<p>My friend's father, who is a specialist in drug use, said that the way the brain uses the drug is slightly different. In someone without ADHD it acts more as a supplement instead of filling a deficiency in someone who does have ADHD.</p>
<p>When I go off my meds, I feel not addiction to take them. I am very unproductive, but I do not feel as if I cannot live without them.</p>
<p>Though, I do suffer from anxiety and depression, which my father (who is also a doctor, though not a specialist) thinks there could be some link. But nothing even close to conclusive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen my fair share of stimulant abuse. I was prescribed Adderal for over a decade starting at eight years old.</p>
<p>Looking back the doses were kind of insane. The doctor had me on 20 mg pills by middle school and was recommending 30-40 mg per day in high school. I see adults taking 5mg now and look back with a raised eyebrow. </p>
<p>It improved my scholastic performance (which was never an issue in math and science) but made me feel horrible. I remember the itchiness, the lack of appetite in the day time, the insomnia. Most of all it struck me that I had great difficulty socializing when using adderal and felt more friendly and popular when not using it for weeks. </p>
<p>I had been skipping doses and avoiding it when possible throughout middle and high school. By college I'd only use it to write papers / cram / stay up all night before a final. I decided I didn't want to have anything to do with it midway through college after witnessing a great deal of stimulant abuse in peers which escalated into them pressuring me with offers like &quot;you don't need to stop, just let me buy the whole bottle when you renew&quot;. I declined. It was pretty clear that the same people looking for cocaine every weekend were also happy to put 80 mg of adderall up each nostril and I didn't want to have anything to do with that. There appeared to me more than enough supply going around without my participation. </p>
<p>As an adult now and a primary care practitioner, I see many people failing to respect stimulants as a whole whether they are RX or OTC. At the same time it is abundantly clear that on a public health level, many PEOPLE LOVE STIMULANTS. Coffee and Tea are two of the most heavily traded crops on the planet and they aren't food....... they're a botanical drug. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the strong belief that we a society will move from outrage to the opioid epidemic to a stimulant epidemic in the next decade. It is already happening, but there's just not as much public attention being paid to it (compared to the opioid epidemic). Part of the reason for the stimulant epidemic is how casually these drugs were prescribed in the past. And while the 5mg dosages are more common now, they are still being overprescribed. The 5mg dose frequency also suggests that maybe doctors are writing these prescriptions because they are unsure if the patient actually has ADHD and want to see if a low dose will help. In my opinion, these patients are better off trying other stuff first! But it is very promising to see PCPs like yourself who are aware of the problem and don't fall into the trap of indiscriminate prescribing! Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm prescribed Vyvanse 70mg and have tried Adderall, Adderall XR, Ritalin, Concerta, and Cocaine. The common theme with all these drugs is that your body builds up a huge tolerance in a very short time. I'm sure Methamphetamine is way more intense, but that's a whole separate animal.... The opiod epidemic was the result of doctors proscribing HUNDREDS of painkillers to a single patient on a monthly basis. Doctors aren't able to write scripts like that for amphetamines. I'm prescribed 30 Vyvanse a month and my buddy is prescribed 60 Adderall 10mg each month. If you find a way to abuse the 30-60 pills, I guarantee by day 3 of taking 5-10x the recommended dose will result in little to no effect. Been there done that....Unless it's meth, an amphetamine addiction is really hard to maintain. </p></div>		</li>
