<p>Please enlighten me, I have been reading this exact sentence for my entire life (and I am no doubt older than you) and yet.. still nothing.  This is the go to through away line that requires no proof when we want to talk about mysterious people and evil technology stomping corporations.</p>
<p>But my mind is open, I may just be missing all the scientific papers.. what &quot;new&quot; things have we learned from Tesla's notes in say.. the last 20 years?</p>

<p>That's very thin ice you are skating on, care to put on a life preserver?  I am sorry, I don't purposefully try to be a dick, but this kind of thing annoys me. Did he also invent the internet? The answer is.. we simply do not know!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are thinking from the wrong angle. He had notes and plans for devices that were in use after his death, that he never released his plans to till after his death. Not that they were working prototypes or such. </p>
<p>Think of Davinci and his bird plane drawings, airplanes wouldn't be a thing for a long while, but he was already seeing ways to do it himself.</p>
<p>A lot of what he planned and never released that later become a thing are theories on capacitors, resistors etc. Some were power supply techniques that wouldnt be actually in use till 40 years later.</p>
<p>Nothing HUGE, but things that could have helped us a long a little faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what would happen if you were in an airport, and they had a charging area. This area would blast out electromagnetic waves  in a sphere around it, so no one would be plugged in, you would just be able to sit there and the phone would pick up the waves.</p>
<p>Wouldn't this greatly increase the efficiency, it only needs to broadcast 2 meters if even, and you can pack quite a few people in to the circle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that idea though, is that when you're blasting out enough juice to charge things at 6 feet, its enough power to interfere with any other electrical devices out to a LOT further.</p>
<p>Think of it like an ongoing EMP device. Any wire long enough in the area will start having voltage and current flow through it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes and no. Even if the idea worked, as more devices 'connect' the load on the generator/transmitter would increase. Older technology would not be able to supply as much power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What about the technology now? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In one sense, it already has been done. The radio in your cell phone or car is basically the same idea.</p>
<p>You have a transmitter that puts out electromagnetic waves. You have an antenna some distance away that is tuned to the same frequency. They both 'vibrate' and this makes a very small amount of electricity come out of the antenna. </p>
<p>It's not nearly enough to drive a speaker or charge a battery. But it can be amplified and <em>that</em> can be used to do stuff.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, the wirless charging systems in your phone or electric toothbrush work the same way. But since they are much closer, you can actually transfer useful amounts of power.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Unknown, really. The affects on living tissue depend on both power and frequency. </p>
<p>At the power levels of cell phones and wifi stations, the affect is pretty much zero.</p>
<p>At the power levels of a FM radio, very close to the transmitter, it can produce headaches and nausea in minutes. (Not from <em>radiation</em> type effects, but more like being in a microwave)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember an &quot;electronic kit&quot; I had as a child that I used to build a radio that worked without battery. To this day, it still not clear how that radio worked. Reading your post made me believe it has something to do with the FM radio signal carrying enough power along the &quot;data&quot; to &quot;power&quot; the tiny speaker of the kit. Is that even possible?</p>
<p>/edit
apparently that's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_radio" target="_blank">crystal radio?</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really. It's being powered by either a battery or an engine, only a very tiny signal is being captured by the antenna, and that signal needs to be amplified by the addition of external power. (all points you covered.)</p>
<p>Wanna see a real AM radio powered by wireless power? <a href="https://youtu.be/FmIbyvMcjP0?t=3m35s" target="_blank">Here,</a> and don't try this at home (or anywhere else.)</p>
<p>The guy wires are electrically insulated from the antenna, so the power is being transmitter through the air, it's just that the range is <em>really</em> limited. </p>
<p>A crystal radio is another example, but the signal is tiny, and you'll need a high impedance headphones to hear much of anything. </p></div>		</li>

Ladders, cars, bikes, doorframes, window frames, pretty much everything big and made of metal could be as dangerous as a live wire, and there would be no way to turn them off without turning off the power for everything in the area.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Something the Tesla fanboys never mention is that if we had his 'wireless power' now, the amount of EM radiation in the air would be causing so much noise it wouldn't be worth it compared to where we are right now. </p>
<p>Would you rather have a world without radio astrography, cell phones, GPS, and WiFi, because you're too lazy to run an extension cord to power your weed whacker?</p></div>		</li>
