			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine always smells like cheetos (don't even eat cheatos) and nasty. If I go a day or two without showering, and try on a pair of glasses for whatever reason, the smell gets all over the glasses and I get super embarrassed. I'll go to the bath room and wash behind my ears until I can get home and shower.</p>
<p>No way on EARTH that shit's gonna attract a woman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can smell it when I'm making out with a girl and she's got a 'pheremone scent' behind her ear and upper neck.  I first noticed it a few years ago, different girls too and now I recognize it right away.</p>
<p>I've named it the 'fuck me' smell.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is the same smell you're referring to.  This doesn't require days of not showering. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you exercise and burn more calories than your body has stored as glucose, it begins breaking down fatty acids. This process takes some time to start, and quite a while to stop. It is likely that exertion induced gluconeogenesis elevated your blood sugar and increased the quantity of ketones in your bloodstream. </p>
<p>When you stopped jumping around at the show, blood sugar would have been considerably elevated until glucose storage caught up. </p></div>		</li>
