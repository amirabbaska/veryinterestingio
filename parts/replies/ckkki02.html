			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been dealing with chronic migraines my entire life (diagnosed at 6, woo!). My 3 main triggers are low blood sugar (not eating enough), dehydration, and some preservatives. </p>
<p>To prevent it: you need to learn your triggers. Blood sugar level is the easiest, but unless your doctor will give you a tester (like those they give to diabetics), your best bet is to learn your schedule. You've already mentioned you get them most frequently in class, but how long do you go between meals/snacks? I can go a maximum of 8 hours, given that I planned for not being able to eat for a while. If it's unplanned, 5-6 hours is average, so I make sure to eat at least every 3-4 hours, to prevent hunger headaches. If you can figure out how long between meals you can go, and make sure to stay well under that, you should be able to prevent it. </p>
<p>To try to cope with a headache you already have: Your best bet is to start with something high in sugar (and preferably caffeine). I always grab a chocolate bar, and usually an energy drink to go with it. This gets a super-duper quick surge of sugar into my system, to hopefully get the migraine to stop getting worse, if not get rid of it completely. </p>
<p>I immediately start working on getting a meal. Whatever that may be, you need something that'll give you plenty of energy over time. I usually go for something easy, but pack on lots of protein and starchy foods. When you eat, make sure to go for more to drink (you may be dehydrated as well, and it can't hurt). My usual is a glass of water and a glass of juice with the meal. </p>
<p>Now your stomach is full to bursting, and hopefully the headache is gone. If not, give it 30 minutes. If it's still there, you may want to talk to your doctor about pain meds. Sleep will almost always help, if nothing else, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My aunt is a neurologist who specializes in headaches/migraines. The way she explains it is that migraine brains need routine - consistent sleep schedules, eating schedules, etc. - and anything that throws off the routine can trigger a migraine. She tells people to try to get to bed at the same time every night as best they can and eat SOMETHING at their regular meal times even if it's not a full meal (like a breakfast bar). if your migraines are untreated there are tons of things you can try in addition to a steady lifestyle so you might consider asking your doc!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! Thanks for that information, that's really helpful because it can be so hard trying to pinpoint your triggers a lot of the time. These migraines are the reason why I gave up eating any kinds of sweets and drink only water to this day. But what things can we do when we actually get the migraine to suppress the pain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not eating is one of the many triggers for my migraines. The biggest is sudden weather changes and especially high humidity. The summer time is something to be endured for me, not enjoyed. </p></div>		</li>
