<blockquote>
<p>Our set of cluster lens models predicts that the SN will appear in the central image of the spiral host galaxy, at an approximate position of α = 11h49m36.01s, δ = +22°23′48.13′′ (J2000.0) at a future time, within a year to a decade from now (2015 to 2025).</p>

<p>The coordinates give a location in the night sky irrespective of where you are on Earth.  There's some math you can use to convert these to a local heading and altitude and time, but most people just use nearby stars at known locations to guide these things.</p>

<p>Edit/tl;dr:  It's basically lat/long in the sky.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~assassin/index.shtml" target="_blank">ASAS-SN (Assassin)</a> at Ohio State is one of them. You can find a few more by googling &quot;sky search supernova.&quot;</p>
<p>Whether or not they're interested in this particular supernova, I can't tell you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Regretfully, there's simply no way amateurs will be able to observe this.</p></div>		</li>
