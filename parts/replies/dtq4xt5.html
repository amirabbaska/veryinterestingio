			<div class="markdown"><p>Easier to make, since the curvature has to be round, and it works with the usual telescoping tube threaded focusing mechanism.  But the lens needn't be round to work. The shape of the image doesn't really depend that much on the shape of the lens.  Here's a <a href="http://images.slideplayer.com/15/4681783/slides/slide_25.jpg" target="_blank">diagram</a> showing what happens if you shade half a lens--making its shape a half circle.  The image just gets dimmer, but the whole thing is still there.</p></div>		</li>
