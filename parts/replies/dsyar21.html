<p>Four, it can be used as a &quot;garbage disposal&quot; for left over plutonium from decommissioned nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Four point five.  This garbage disposal property is, in principle, also capable of reducing the bulk waste and toxic lifespan, by a factor of 10, from most of current conventional BWR/PWR nuclear power plants.  The continuous reprocessing feature means you can utilize the 96%-97% of remaining fissile material in the fuel.  And all the normally problematic transuranic parts of the spent fuel are &quot;burned&quot; and consumed rather than hanging around in storage. </p>
<p>edit: Some other challenges that need to be overcome in order for commercial Thorium to become a reality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the inefficiency of fast reactors in comparison to those running off Uranium/Plutonium in the thermal spectrum.</p>
</li>
<li>the corrosive nature of high temperature salts.</li>

<p>You just couldn't fund it. All the money went towards reactors that could improve weapons technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s slightly different but related - the current dominant reactor designs are based on naval reactors. They needed enriched fuel to be compact and minimise refuelling but they don’t generate any materials for weapons - they just help carry the weapons around! The original civilian PWR prototype  at Shippingport actually ran with a thorium/U233 core as a test but the advantages of thorium are not significant when used in LWRs. </p>
<p>Edit: early molten salt reactors were also funded on the basis of military applications in an attempt to make a nuclear-powered aircraft. The obvious downsides and the advent of ICBMs meant that never went anywhere, thankfully. </p></div>		</li>
