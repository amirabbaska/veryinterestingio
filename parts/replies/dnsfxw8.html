<p>No they cannot. This is an urban myth. This isn't even theoretically possible, with some electron microscope reading hdd, and there certainly doesn't exist any method of doing this at reasonable price. You overwrite it, it's gone, permanently.</p>
<p>Some older hdd's from 90's had some method that made this sorta attack theoretically possible due to lower data density and that sorta stuff. It was never actually done, at least, there is no record of such an attack, but for two decade old hdd's this attack would be a theoretical possibility. For any drive made after 2000, it's not:</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many people make this possible through widespread fragmentation of their data. If you had your supersecret.doc saved across twelve fragments, and your new totallynotporn.mkv overwrites 2 of them, it's really not hard to reconstruct the rest based on what's still there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you overwrite 2 of 12 fragments, that means you didn't overwrite 10 of 12 fragments. I was talking of what happens if you overwrite the file contents. If you don't overwrite them, obviously you can still retrieve them.</p>
<p>Also, what you say seems a bit magical. If you overwrite 2 fragments, whatever those fragments contained is gone. I don't think most file types contain enough redundancy to actually reconstruct anything that was in those two fragments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with your answer is that &quot;normal&quot; use doesn't necessarily write over all of the specific data you're trying to destroy. Or rather it doesn't necessarily write over the hard drive segments with the Fragments you're trying to get rid of. There might still be some fragments of the data left behind and if there's enough you can reconstruct at least part of the data.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aluminum melts at a fairly low temp.</p>
<p>Take the drives apart, and melt the platters. Bye bye data.</p>
<p>For SSDs I have no idea but get the fire hot enough and it should work no matter the storage medium.</p>
<p>Also, strong acid is ready to make so you could just put them in some hcl.</p></div>		</li>
