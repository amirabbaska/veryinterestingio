			<div class="markdown"><p>Clarity is the best way to describe the odd feeling I get after a long period of no sleep</p>
<p>Auditory hallucinations are rare for me (I rarely stay awake more than 30 hours) but I'll never forget one very distinct one where a woman whispered in my ear.
It was so real and sudden. I couldn't make out what she said but it was more than just auditory. I could practically feel lips close to my ear, feel hot breath, and it was a loud whisper, I jumped pretty hard and looked around but nothing was there. No one.</p>
<p>And aside from supernatural or scifi explanations, there's no way someone could've done it and gotten that far out of sight so it had to have been a hallucination </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds familiar. I kept imagining people were talking to me when they weren't. Since I was doing something active, it was easy to focus on the task, and not the voices. I can't imagine how hard it would have been if weren't doing something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on the computer, sitting in a recliner that I have pulled up to a desk with my PC on it and suddenly it's like a woman whispered &quot;Hey!&quot;
Right in my ear </p>
<p>But there wasn't anyone there </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a young teenager, maybe 13 or 14, I tried to stay awake for 100 hours because why not? I cannot believe how bad of a decision that was. After about 30 hours, I was over the point where I was falling asleep in my chair. It was like my body said, &quot;Alright fine, you fuck, looks like we're doing this.&quot; By 45 hours, I was having a lot of auditory hallucinations. Creaking, things outside, thinking my mom was calling when she wasn't. By 60 hours, I had the munchies something fierce. I had no ability to focus at all. I would just stare at a video game for I don't even know how long.</p>
<p>Somewhere between 85 and 95 hours (I don't know exactly when), I passed out. I was standing in the kitchen waiting for food that was in the microwave. I came to after what can't have been that long, laying on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>I went to bed and slept almost uninterrupted for about 2 days. I got up a couple times to pee and drink some water, but otherwise, I basically just slept and I felt shitty for like a week.</p>
<p>0/10 would not try again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was 17 when I did this. I think the key was that I was standing and moving around for most of the time. I think if there'd been less people around, I would have lasted much longer.</p>
<p>When it was all over, I slept for 24 hours straight. Just completely missed an entire day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude after 40 hours the floor started to roll. I don't mean physically, I mean if I stare at the floor it looks like it's rising and falling just like the ocean.</p></div>		</li>
