			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, I'm on mobile and cannot provide sources easily, but I'm sitting at my desk as a research audiologist at a major hospital and would like to lend some insight.</p>
<p>The auditory system does employ multiple reflexes in response to particular sounds, though their purposes are mainly thought to be signal enhancement rather than noise protection. </p>
<p>The stapedial and tensor tympani reflexes cited in this thread occur in response to loud signals, suggesting a protective purpose. However, they also act to attenuate frequencies outside (I.e. below) the range of typical speech. While they may protect against long-duration stimuli (loud music), they likely help very little with sudden transients (I.e. gun shots) as their latencies are on the order of several milliseconds. The reflex also decays after a minute in ideal circumstances, so any protective quality is short lived. These reflexes are likely more protective against the levels of our own voices, which are quite loud at the point of our lips and vocal folds.</p>
<p>In fact, more evidence (again, I apologise for the lack of citations) suggests that the reflexes help to attenuate low-frequency maskers which, due to the macromechanics of our inner ears, often reduce the audibility of some higher-frequency speech signal.</p>
<p>In our lab, we frequently test a more complex reflex arc involving the brainstem and inner ear, known as the medial olivocochlear reflex, which provides additional help in improving the salience of speech when presented with competing noise.</p>
<p>Fascinating stuff. The ear is actually action-packed with little features that help to improve our perception of speech. It's always a little disheartening to see how little public knowledge there is about the whole system.</p>
<p>EDIT: This thread is picking up steam, so I want to make a PSA. Everyone, wear hearing protection when you know you'll be exposed to loud sounds, either transient or prolonged. Buy some disposable foam plugs and learn how to <strong>appropriately</strong> use them. I see pediatric patients exclusively now, but I've seen many, many older patients (teenagers included) in the past who've screwed up their hearing due simply to not wanting to protect their ears. None of them have been happy about it. </p>
<p>Take all the soft sounds in life that you love. Birds chirping, leaves rustling, wind in the car window, your loved ones whispering. Now take them away. See how much you miss them. You've seen the videos of kids crying after having their cochlear implant turned on, hearing sounds for the first time? Imagine seeing a 70-year-old retiree trying a hearing aid and suddenly hearing his wife snicker for the first time in twenty years. Feels for days.</p>
<p>Hearing's not one of those things you don't miss till it's gone. A lot of times it goes slowly; slips away without being noticed. You forget about it and don't realize how much you've missed it until you've bought it back at the price of an expensive-as-hell hearing aid. </p>
<p>Protect your ears! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking a small step back when looking at the whole issue - isn't it also simply the lack of evolutionary pressure to deal with extended exposure to loud noises?</p>
<p>For as long as eyes have existed, the sun has been around and the places that fish, reptiles and mammals can go have had wildly varying light levels. Having a contracting iris is quite obviously advantageous for protecting the retina in all of our ancestors.</p>
<p>For ears though, it's a different story isn't it? What were the loudest sounds our ancestors dealt with 200.000 years ago? Rocks hitting rocks? Warcries? Birdsong?</p>
<p>I don't see how we could be genetically prepared for amplified 2 hour rock concerts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume the loudest persistent sound exposure for our ancestors came from their own voices.</p>
<p>It's an extreme, uncontrolled example, but professional vocalists often present with the typical configuration of noise-induced hearing loss. </p>
<p>EDIT: Not to say that your own voice will cause you hearing loss...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One very cool addition to this - I don't have a link to the article I read in grad school, but apparently the tensor tympani can have an antecedent reflex if you are the one pulling the trigger to the gun. Still not adequate protection by any means - our ears were not evolved to protect us from the industrial revolution. But the reflex has been noted to occur without lag when you are the trigger puller. Even if you know exactly when the gun will be discharging - but you are not the one pulling the trigger - the acoustic reflex will have its standard lag. </p>
<p>Cool stuff right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I learned the part of my ear I can make &quot;rumble&quot; is the tensor tympani, I started doing it when I was near loud sounds.</p>
<p>Is it a placebo effect or am I actually reducing the amount of sound entering my ears and protecting them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked my professor in audiology if the rumble (I can do the same, but only if I squeeze my eyes shut) was the tensor tympany, and he said that it is more likely tied to the muscles in the eye making noise from vibrating. Do you have to squeeze your eyes shut too? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are causing some attenuation, not more than 15 dB or so. I have a relatively strong voluntary TT reflex and have had my hearing sensitivity/middle ear admittance tested while &quot;rumbling&quot;. There is also a small masking effect due to the rumbling itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why after you have listened to really loud music (say, at a club) for a prolonged duration, your ears take a long time to re-adjust to hearing at a normal level. Sort of like entering a dark room after sitting in the sun for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Either I'm missing something, or this is just total nonsense that you've made up.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_reflex#Protection_role" target="_blank">The acoustic reflex responds in seconds, quickly 'tires out'</a>, and is not the cause of temporary hearing-loss following a loud concert.</p>
<p>The Internet has proven rather unhelpful with regard to the cause of temporary hearing loss, but I get the impression it's the temporary 'stunning' of the hair-cells, which then recover. (They can be killed permanently if you really overdo it, though.)</p>
<p><em>Edit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2z8rzx/the_pupils_in_our_eyes_shrink_when_faced_with/cpgsob4" target="_blank">apparently</a> it has to do with a 'threshold shift'.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The analogy deepens. I thought though that as you age, and interfere with more loud sounds that your hearing becomes permanently damaged and can no longer re-adjust. So it becomes a guarantee that younger people have better hearing than older people. This isn't this case with sight though is it?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I commented higher up in the thread, but I thought I'd point out that the middle ear reflexes have pretty rapid offsets once a loud stimulus ceases. The period of attenuated perception is likely a symptom of &quot;temporary threshold shifting&quot;, most likely caused by some amount of damage to the outer hair cells of the inner ear, which serve as amplifiers for soft and moderate level sounds.</p>
<p>It's important to note that though perception may return to normal after a few hours, single event long-duration exposure to loud sounds has been shown to cause degeneration of ganglion cells within the inner ears of mice who otherwise regained normal behavioral thresholds. The point being that even if perception appears to be normal, the system is likely not the same as it was before the exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why people with Bell's palsy are sensitive to loud noises.  Bell's palsy is a temporary infection/inflammation of the facial nerve which controls the stapedius muscle (among many other things).  If you can't control the stapedius, you can't dampen sounds as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to NemoSum and djsubtronic, loud sounds cause the most damage when they are abrupt (think gunshot), because the muscles in the ear have no time to adjust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Loud sounds are certainly much worse for you as their duration increases. The middle ear reflexes decay rather quickly, so a five minute exposure to a 100 dB SPL sound will do more damage than a one second exposure.</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for audiologists to run certain tests using stimuli with levels beyond behavioral tolerances, but with durations of about 100 microseconds or less.</p></div>		</li>
