			<div class="markdown"><p>Hillbilly cousin has been bitten 4 or 5 times by various poisonous snakes. Never even went to the doctor when his hand or foot was black as coal. Then he gets bit about 5 times by a pigmy rattler on the foot and ankle, he falls down trying to get away and lands on a copperhead that gets him 3 times in the groin. Med-flighted to the city and spends 3 days in ICU tripping balls. Only know survivor of this much venom from 2 separate sources. It's believed that the previous bites built a resistance and saved his life. </p></div>		</li>
