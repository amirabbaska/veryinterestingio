			<div class="markdown"><p>It does. Ever since teen years I was always watching anime with original voice and English subtitles, and I bet I'm not the only one that noticed how weird it actually works. It's like hearing one voice use two languages at once, though usually I don't focus on it enough to notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - it drives me nuts when I see dubbed versions of things I've already seen in subtitles, because the &quot;voice&quot; is all wrong. I &quot;know&quot; what the person sounds like in English even though they've never actually said a word in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude it’s kinda crazy when I really think about it, sometimes I’ll remember watching an anime and if I remember certain dialogues or phrases it feels as though I watched it in dub because I remember the whole thing being in English. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed something even weirder. English is my second language, but because I don't have much opportunity to use it in real life, I sometimes watch tv shows/movies and play games with English subtitles to practice it in a way. After doing this, for a few hours I think in English instead of my first language. I have no idea why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've experienced this too! I sometimes even <em>dream</em> in English, mostly after watching movies in English subtitles instead of my native language. So weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something similar happens for me when I listen to computer generated text to speech for novels. After a few books read this way my brain adjusted and the robot voice was like dim background noise and my brain added voices to the story just as if I were reading it myself.</p></div>		</li>
