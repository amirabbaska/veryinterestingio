<p>I can stare out of a window and imagine a world far from reality, for a period of time. </p>
<p>I guess I was thinking, as I was watching her, that at some point the ability to believe wholeheartedly that this world she creates is real dissipates as the brain forms through growth in some form. </p>
<p>Also as others have said some don't lose it as writers, directors and other creatives still can pull on that talent and skill to create something others cannot. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Or at least in my case, I'd argue that in some sense I have <em>more</em> imagination than as a child, since I don't need to act the fantasy, just imagine it. I do it while walking in the street, an elaborate fantasy scenario without any outside clue that I'm doing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a wee lad I used to play with Legos and speak the dialogue of each minifig out loud. My family would laugh at me and so I stopped doing it. I wonder how much of it is conditioning?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! If left to my own devices I can spend all day in my imaginary world, and totally forget about responsibilities, and while I enjoy pretending household objects are spaceships still, I now find drawing and writing to be more satisfying, which I imagine is due to my increased critical thinking skills which I enjoy flexing.
My worlds now fuel my artistic endeavors and while I can keep track of most of them if I want to, writing helps me expand them further and more specifically than my brain ever could. ie dates and imagined technogy and governmental organization and character backstories.
That being said, I do still remember my more childish and fantastical imagined worlds that were based on my toys, from the story about the nuclear radiation that gave all the animals inside the wildlife preserve super powers and shrunk them to tiny size while leaving 99% of the world a wasteland, to what each superpower is and each character's personal arc and external goals, as well as how their relationships to each other changed over time. And how the gorilla betrays the rest of the group and becomes an evil dragon as his power. And how buzz lightyear forsook his fellow humans to save himself, and his guilt about it.
I don't know why you weirdos can't still do this...</p></div>		</li>
