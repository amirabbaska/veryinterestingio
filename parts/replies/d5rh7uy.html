			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the unit of metre was chosen first, and then the units of mass were derived from that.</p>
<p>The first suggested definition for a metre was actually based on time - a pendulum with the length of a metre produced a half-period of about one second. However, this suggestion never caught on because it was, at the time, difficult to measure time with quite enough repeated accuracy, and one of the main reasons for creating a new unit system was to make it possible to recreate the units anywhere on Earth, without the need to rely on qualified trade weights or measuring sticks.</p>
<p>The first <em>official</em> definition of a metre was 1/10,000,000th of a quadrant of a meridian of Earth, ie. the distance from the pole to the equator was defined as 10,000,000 metres (or 10,000 km).</p>
<p>Then, after it was found that the polar diameter of Earth was lesser than its equatorial diameter, it was defined that the equator was 40,000,000 metres, and thus &quot;metre&quot; was 1/40,000,000th of Earth's equator. This had the advantage of making navigation rather convenient, at least near the equator; however, the far more common navigational unit of nautical mile (one minute of arc across Earth's surface, basically, so 60 nautical miles is equal to one degree across the equator) already fulfilled this niche, so the SI units never took over for navigational purposes. This, incidentally, is the reason why ships and aircraft still mostly use knots as speed and nautical miles for units of distance.</p>
<p>The original basic mass unit for the metric system (or rather the international system of units, or SI) was actually gram, and it was defined as the mass of one cubic centimetre (a millilitre) of water at certain temperature; however, it turned out to be too small an unit to be very useful in most situations, so kilogram quickly replaced it as the mass of one litre of water, which of course happens to be one thousand cubic centimetres. This part of &quot;convenience&quot; doesn't actually come from any particular selection of units, it's more of a mathematical feature of a system that doesn't arbitrarily change the base number when moving from smaller units to larger.</p>
<p>For example, before SI units, the smallest unit of distance was an inch, and then you had half-inch, third-inch, quarter-inch, and what have you. These units live on in firearms, where calibers are often announced as fractions of inch - and even when converted to millimetres of the muzzle diameter, they're still usually some common fraction of an inch. 7.62mm for example is a very common calibre, and it just so happens to be almost exactly 0.3 inches - which is the common .30 caliber. And of course, 12.7mm machine guns are actually .50-caliber guns. Thousands of an inch were - and are - also used in precision engineering. But I digress...*</p>
<p>The problem with these old units was that they were not designed for convenient calculation. In fact they were seldom designed at all, rather they were historical units that had &quot;always&quot; been (almost) what they were. The inch was not a bad unit at all, but then you had 12 inches to a foot, and three feet to a yard, and six feet to a fathom if you were in naval business. What's up with that? And then a mile is 1,760 yards, and if you were in naval business, a nautical mile is 2,025 yards and then some, and a nautical mile is 1,012.68591 fathoms, and none of these units neatly coincide with each other.</p>
<p>By contrast, a millimetre is 1/1000th of a metre and centimetre is 1/100th of a metre, which makes millimetre also 1/10th of a centimetre.</p>
<p>Naturally, moving from distances to volumes, this meant that if you had a block of 10x10x10 centimetres, you had exactly 1000 cubic centimetres, and this was an useful volume for daily purposes and was named a litre. Similarly, a 1x1x1 metre cube is a cubic metre, and happens to contain exactly 1000 litres. A kilometre is, literally, one housand metres. This is just multiplications working when your units change by factors of ten, instead of by historical, but essentially random factors like 12 inches to a foot, 3 feet to yard, 6 feet to fathom (or two yards to fathom), etc. etc. There's just no way to do useful calculations like this, unless you choose one unit (like inch) and then stick to it on everything you do. So the fundamental advantage of metric system is that for anything you measure, you basically always just use one unit and its multiples of ten. The base number being ten is convenient because it is the same base number as our (currently used) number system, which makes calculations and conversions much more convenient than changing yards or fathoms to inches.</p>
<p>The linkage between units of distance and units of mass is as explained earlier - first, a gram was defined, but obviously a litre is more useful and easy to measure, so the official unit was changed to kilograms, even though &quot;kilo&quot; is more commonly used as a prefix rather than integral part of the unit itself.</p>
<p>Later, of course, most of these units have been defined more accurately, deriving them from natural laws, but retaining their dimensions as accurately as possible. As a result, a metre is no longer exactly 1/40,000,000th of the Earth's equator, but instead it is an exact fraction of the distance that light travels in one second. And one second is defined as a certain multiple of oscillations in some specifically defined atomic nucleus (can't remember which), so atomic clocks using this nucleus to measure time are <em>by definition</em> always exactly correct.</p>
<p>Ironically, the third most important unit for basic physics - unit of mass - is still basically defined as a particular lump of matter. To be specific, one kilogram is the mass of the prototype of kilogram, made of platinum (and there's some interesting stuff going on with the other prototypes, because they don't seem to stay exactly the same).</p>
<p>But that gives the three most important units for basic mechanics: Time, distance, and mass. Units for things like force (Newton), work (Joule), and power (Watt) are derived.</p>
<p>Other base units for more advanced physics (like thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and chemistry) are for electric current (Ampere), temperature (Kelvin), luminous intensity (Candela), and amount of substance (mole).</p>
<p>All other units for every quantity currently in use in all of natural sciences can be derived from these units.</p>
<p>* Yes, I'm aware that the original imperial inch was slightly different from the current metric inch which is defined as exactly 2.5 centimetres, but the point still stands that a lot of engineering standards are inherited from the days when the inch and its fractions was the only thing used in precision engineering. It still defines common dimensions of planks (2 by 4 being perhaps the most prominent example), steel beams, pipes, bearings, axles, drill bits, car rims, and other things besides firearms, but firearms is one example where these units are most prominent and still often labeled as such.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So they decided to divide the distance the light travels by 299,792,458 and call it a metre? Sorry, I'm just confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the previous meter definition, scientists measured the speed of light as accurately as possible. That previous definition being quite unreliable, they decided to define it from the single universal, non-changing thing they'd just measured : the speed of light (in the void).</p>
<p>They could have decided to redefine the meter entirely to have a neat, pretty number as the speed of light, but that would have required the whole population already using the meter to change their habits.
So instead, they redefined the meter and kept overall its value. Which allowed the common people not to change their habits, whilst also defining it in an absolute, never-changing manner,
the only casualty being ugly looking constants.</p>
<p>I remember having heard about some people trying to design a unit system in such a way that all the main physical constants' values (such as the speed of the light c, Newton's gravitational constant G, Avogadro's Constant Na, and many more) would essentially become 1 or 0, thus rendering them useless in their respective equations and driving them out of them. I think i can remember such an attempt ended up failing, but i can't remember why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Since we know that the speed of light in vacuum is an absolute constant, it makes sense to tie the definition of space (distance) to our definition of time.</p>
<p>Now, our measurement of time is based on fine structure constant, which affects things like nuclear physics - atomic clocks observe some specific nuclei which oscillate between certain energy states N times in a second, and that can be used to define a fixed length of time very, <em>very</em> accurately.</p>
<p>And when you can measure <em>time</em> very accurately, you can measure <em>space</em> very accurately, when you have something that moves at constant speed - in this case, electromagnetic waves in vacuum.</p>
<p>This, I think, is actually a very elegant example of how time and space are two sides of the same coin, as described by Einstein.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If &quot;kilo&quot; in &quot;kilogram&quot; isn't a prefix but an integral part of the unit, why is 1/1000th of a kilogram called a &quot;gram&quot; and not a &quot;millikilogram&quot;?</p>
<p>SI usage suggests that the basis unit can be the kilogram, while at the same time acknowledging that &quot;kilo&quot; is still a prefix.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Historical reasons, plus it would sound really odd.</p>
<p>The official base unit of mass is kilogram (kg), which is used in all derivative units like Newton, Joule, Watt, etc. Grams can also be used in applications where it makes more sense, mostly with chemistry but there are certain other places, like dealing with masses of small animals, or some cases of materials science.</p>
<p>Milligrams, micrograms and nanograms are also used in similar contexts with increasingly smaller amounts of matter (nutritional values is one such case, as well as something like samples of interplanetary dust absorbed into aerogel on a space probe for example), but they're slightly anomalous compared to other SI units in that the prefix is not attached to the base unit, but rather the original gram.</p>
<p>Larger prefixes are usually not used, with the exception of tonne, or metric ton which is 1000 kg precisely because talking about kilokilograms would be highly inconvenient.</p>
<p>If you're just using masses alone, it doesn't really matter whether you're using kilograms, grams, milli-, micro-, or nanograms or what have you.</p>
<p>In physics, if you're using an equation that produces another, derivative unit - like Newtons, for example (1 N = 1 kg*m/s²) it is highly recommendable to input all units in the SI base unit form, and present the prefixes as exponents of ten. So one gram would be 1 x 10⁻³ kg, milligram would be , 1 x 10⁻⁶ kg, etc. Other prefixes with kilograms would similarly be seemingly &quot;off&quot; by a factor of 10³ one way or the other (though the larger prefixes are very rarely used, as mentioned earlier).</p>
<p>There are of course exceptions, like in chemistry a lot of things are expressed in grams (like atomic weight of elements being expressed in atomic mass units, but because of the way the unit &quot;mole&quot; is set up, it also express the molecular mass in grams/mol). The trickiest customer might be thermophysics, which has lots of parallels with chemistry so sometimes a lot of the energy potentials are represented as joules per gram-Kelvins (J/gK) and sometimes as joules per kilogram-Kelvins (J/kgK), and you just have to be really, <em>really</em> alert on what units you use when you feed values to your equations - whatever it is you're using.</p>
<p>That said, if you're used to it, this little speed bump doesn't really matter, and SI units are still far better and more efficient than Imperial units by any metric you could choose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those who are interested, there is a reason we chose numbers like 24 and 60 to represent hours in a day and minutes in an hour/seconds in a minute respectively.  These numbers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_composite_number" target="_blank">highly composite</a>!</p>
<p>Highly composite numbers are easy to break into lots of smaller pieces.  Take 60, the number of minutes in an hour.  We can break it in half into 30-minute chunks, break it into three pieces to get 20-minute chunks, break it into four pieces to get 15-minute chunks, break it into five pieces to get 12-minute chunks, break it into six pieces to get 10-minute chunks, break it into ten pieces to get 6-minute chunks, break it into twelve pieces to get 5-minute chunks, break it into fifteen pieces to get 4-minute chunks, break it into twenty pieces to get 3-minute chunks, break it into thirty pieces to get 2-minute chunks, and break it into sixty pieces to get 1-minute chunks.  </p>
<p>Mathematically, this is because 60 is highly composite.  These numbers are positive integers that have a greater amount of factors than any smaller positive integer.  60 has an insane number of factors for a 2-digit number (it actually has the most factors of any 2-digit number).  60 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.  This is why we can break it up into smaller pieces in so many different ways, and this is also why 60 works so well to represent the number of minutes in an hour.  We think about time as 15-minutes, 10-minutes, 5-minutes, etc. every day.  These units of time are divisible into 60.</p>
<p>This is also why 24 works so well as the number of hours in a day, and why 12 works so well representing the number of inches in a foot.  12 and 24 are, you guessed it, highly composite.</p></div>		</li>

The problems occur when you get past one day or past a foot. All of the rest of the numbers like 7, 365, 30/31 are all so arbitrary that it causes lots of problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, 365 is not arbitrary, we're stuck with that one, and unfortunately it's kind of a tough number. You could divide it evenly into 5 day weeks, but there's 73 of them, and 73 is prime, so even then you're not going to get even months. And then there's leap years to screw everything up anyways.</p></div>		</li>

<p>we will get 365, 30 and 7 regardless of the number of hours a day. </p>
<p>365 being the approximate number of days a year.
