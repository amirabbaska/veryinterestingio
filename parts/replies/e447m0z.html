			<div class="markdown"><p>In New Mexico there's a group who live near the Trinity site and White Sands testing areas who also call themselves &quot;Down Winders.&quot; Sadly that whole community is stricken with cancer. They continually fight with the government for support and compensation but seem to always be on the losing end. Our National Nuclear Museum in NM doesn't acknowledge them, so on the anniversary of Trinity they stand outside the entrance with signs to raise awareness to all the visitors about their experiences. Other communities, mostly native reservations near uranium mines, have had similar health experiences with radiation exposure and are also ignored by the government.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The National Nuclear Museum left a sour taste in my mouth. From the weird justification of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (including hypocritical statements about Japanese war crimes) to the complete absence of any negativity about anything in there, it just didn't feel right. Whoever's idea it was to have a thoughts book next to the atomic bomb exhibit should be sacked, some of the stuff written in there was disgusting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He who wins writes the history.  Nothing says it's going to be accurate or inoffensive history though.  There's still tons of debate today whether the bombings were justified or not, so interestingly, one could argue that history isn't even actually settled in this case, in a sense.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/650215537/Fallout-link-to-thyroid-cancer-gets-boost.html" target="_blank">For a woman born in Salt Lake City</a> in 1952 who has lived in the area to the present, who has consumed retail commercial milk and who has never had thyroid cancer, the chance of coming down with that disease is about 6.6 out of 1,000. (That is a mean, with the lowest figure 1.2 and the highest 28.)</p>
