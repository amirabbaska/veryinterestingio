			<div class="markdown"><p>DC-DC boost converters are switch mode power supplies, which have a transistor switch between the input and output.  When the switch is off the circuit is only the battery and a capacitor (or inductor), so a moderately high current is pulled to charge the capacitor; when the switch is on the output is connected such that the battery and charged capacitor are now in series and the voltage is doubled.  The capacitor rapidly drops in voltage, but the switch flips back very quickly to charge it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. However, only alternating current can be stepped up and down through a transformer. Luckily, today we have MOSFET transistors that can switch the direct current into high frequency square-wave alternating current. The fact that it's switching at such a high frequency is the reason the transformers in your phone charger and computer power supply can be so small. The high frequency square-wave AC is then rectified back into DC at the desired voltage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make a voltage spike by opening a circuit and stopping the current in an inductor. Spill off some of this over-voltage into a capacitor. Rinse and repeat. This is how to convert DC 3v into 5v. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_converter" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boost_converter</a></p></div>		</li>
