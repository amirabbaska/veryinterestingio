			<div class="markdown"><p>Strangely enough this discovery owed as much to luck as it did to mathematics: Le Verrier used an empirical law (called 'Titus-Bode's law') to narrow down the semi-major axis, and then calculated the position from that, but the law misses the true value by around 20% or so. Turns out that for the section of Neptune's orbit which was relevant, this did not matter too much for it's position in the sky, but had Le Verrier started searching a few years later or earlier, he would in all likelyhood not have discovered the planet. Just goes to show how timing and coincidences sometimes make or break discoveries!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly true, and it goes to highlight the selection bias of looking back upon scientific discoveries.</p>
<p>What about all the predictions which didn't come true? They're lost to the sands of time.</p>
<p>But those 'amazing coincidences' and genius predictions are remembered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He tried to do the same thing with Mercury with mixed results.  He was the first to recognize that Mercury's orbit could not be adequately explained by Newton's physics unless there was something hidden in the solar system.  That is amazing.  However, the success with finding Neptune caused astronomers to have so much confidence in finding another planet closer to the sun that they had named it even before finding it.  Of course it could not be found, because no such planet exists.  Decades later, another man would offer a more precise explanation that only required completely redefining how we view the relation of space and time.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also how and why Pluto was discovered and incorrectly labeled as a Planet. </p>
<p>Basically after Neptune was discovered through this method everyone hoped to discover the next planet the same way, based on changes in Neptune's orbit, theorizing up to 5 new planets beyond Neptune.</p>
<p>Pluto was discovered and everyone was so excited they declared it a planet, despite that it was much smaller than it would need to be to fit the calculations, and that those calculations were wrong in the first place</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is false. The only reason pluto isnt a planet anymore is because at some point they decided to redifine what a planet is and pluto didnt meet all the requirements such as size. Those requirements didnt exist when pluto was discovered</p></div>		</li>
