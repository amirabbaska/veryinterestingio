<p>I think of them more like tools. Say C is like a nail file, C++ is like sandpaper, and C# is more like a belt sander. It really depends on what you're doing with them to determine which one is appropriate. You wouldn't want to file your nails with a belt sander for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's in your budget it's kind of true though. The model s is a family sedan that is helping to push society towards sustainable energy, gets over 100mpge, can charge for free at a ton of places, looks awesome (subjective but pretty universal opinion) has a third row of seats (for kids), has two trunks, has a really well designed interface and can beat most supercars in a drag race (p100d is the third fastest production car of all time by acceleration and ties a million dollar purpose built for speed buggati veyron to 60mph). Range is far, far farther than most people ever drive (208 miles for cheapest and 315 miles at high end), and the free charging stations are available along most popular long routes. There's a reason it's been reported as the best car of all time.</p>
<p>Genuine question. What else drives your purchasing decisions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's also not a great analogy. The thing about C is that you KNOW exactly how everything is going to work. In certain applications(say the curiosity rover) is written in c, why? Because it's the safest(in terms of runtime errors) practical language they can use with it. Writing in other C variants might do but in straight C you know what you've got and how you've gotten there. It's safe, reliable and though extremely tedious to test, it's very robust and can be modified to fix almost any issue. </p>
<p>When you start getting into C++, objective C you have this language that's optimized to do certain things very well and designed to make your life just a little bit easier. But that comes at a cost. With more complicated things given shortcuts its easy to just find a library, use it and not worry to much about what's under the hood. It's great for practical things like large video games, large desktop applications and non critical scientific applications etc.</p>
<p>Then c# is actually a .NET language if I'm not mistaken. It's designed to better help you integrate with a server in mind. Now that doesn't mean you have too, but it's definitely more modern with a different functionality. Things like c# are perfect for web applications, indie games(can also be script based - how unity functions), but can definitely be Frankensteined into non critical desktop applications.</p>
<p>So the analogy would have to be closer to this:
C - that guy that always knows everything but he's pretty annoying most times so you ignore him. But you hang out with him when you really need to get an A on that test
C++/objective C - your friend who you hang out with all the time, there's a few things you can't do with him though like camping, bowling, and oh, he absolutely hates Chinese food.
C# - your friend you COULD hang out with all the time but he's only REALLY fun to hang out with for certain situations, like going camping, bowling and going out to Chinese food </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>C is a pretty simple machine. It doesn't have a lot of parts and when it breaks you can usually fix it yourself either by giving it a good whack on the hood or just using simple tools and off-the-shelf parts. </p>
<p>C++ has much more complex assemblies, with electronic breaks instead of the simple steel wire that C uses. It doesn't break as often but when it does, you need to take it to the dealer and it isn't cheap. </p>
<p>Objective-C is really no more complex than C++, but it's a strange imported brand and no dealer in your city will touch it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gone be honest, I think that's a bit disingenuous towards Objective-C. Moving out of ELI5 realm here, ObjC is definitely strange syntactically, but it's really powerful and actually is a strict superset of C. It was the first language to meld Smalltalk-style object orientation onto C. Yes, it's currently showing its age, but it played an important part in the development of languages. Java's type system is said to have been derived heavily <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/stuff/java-objc.html" target="_blank">from Objective-C</a>. Plenty of people still use and love Objective-C every day, though Swift is IMO a better spiritual successor.</p></div>		</li>
