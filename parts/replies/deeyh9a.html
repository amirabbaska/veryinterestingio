			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, crap. My room is basically a big fridge; it's large, but only has two vents, neither of which can blow anything but cold air. Also, there are three storage areas connected to the room, <em>none of which are insulated to the outside.</em> That would explain why I had so many nightmares as a kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience this brushes against the correct answer. You dream quite frequently, but only remember those dreams if you happen to awaken while the dream is still in progress.</p>
<p>If you're uncomfortable for any reason (not just &quot;cold&quot;, but any troublesome sensation), two things happen. First, your unconscious thoughts will tend to be negative (unpleasant), probably due to stress hormones. Second, your Reticular Activating System will work to wake you up so you can relieve the discomfort. If you happened to be dreaming at the time, you wake up with an unpleasant stream of thought already in your head, and we call that a &quot;nightmare&quot;.</p>
<p>A second cause can be the thought itself. If your brain is doing housekeeping on your memories, which is what we think it does during dreaming, and it comes across something particularly unpleasant (whether real or imaginary), and you were in a light sleep, it may confuse the danger with a real danger and wake you up. Again, the unpleasant thought is front-and-center as you wake.</p>
<p>Finally, if you're dreaming but are woken more quickly, say by a sudden unfamiliar noise, and are dreaming at that time, your brain is more likely to work some part of that stimulus into your dream as you awake (a buzzing clock becomes an attack by angry bees).</p></div>		</li>
