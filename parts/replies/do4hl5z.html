<blockquote>
<p>trick is that microalgae and cyanobacteria are able to most efficiently use photosynthesis to make more functional biomass</p>

<p>On the contrary, much of the published literature states that wild-type cyanobacterial photosynthetic efficiency rates are pretty similar to plants and green algae -
maybe equivalent to C4 plants, when controlling for current methodologies underestimating their efficiency (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4578884/pdf/pone.0139061.pdf" target="_blank">source</a>), otherwise their photosynthetic efficiency averages around 4%, compared to C4 plants as theoretically high as 6%.</p>
<p>Of course, engineered cyanobacterial strains are more efficient, but that's kinda' cheating when you have scientists on your side!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe i mis-read what they were writing but i assume they were saying that those are better an having more cells doing photosynthesis rather than say a tree where the roots/trunk/ branches/etc. Are structure.  So for 100kg of each, the microalge/ cyanobacteria is going to turn the most sunlight into biomass because 100% (or damn close) of the cells are doing it while that percentage is much lower with other plants. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Except that's not true. The analysis I quoted was at an organismal scale; cyanobacteria simply aren't as efficient as, say, C4 photosynthesising plants, even with roots, stems, gnarly bits n' the rest thrown in. </p>
<p>An argument could be made that photosynthetic microbes are more efficient <em>per unit area</em>, as you can cram more photosynthetic microbes into a m^2 of the Earth's surface than any land plant - I guess it depends on how you interpret OP's question.</p>
<p>If you wanted to grow stuff to huff the most O2, a shallow algal soup would be stellar. If you were playing photosynthesis top trumps however, C4 grasses would shred cyanobacteria to bits.</p></div>		</li>
