			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is accurate it doesn't explain <em>why</em> bacteria survive microwaves. Simply put, microwaves are too big of a wavelength to actually do any sort of damage to a cell of that size. Comparatively speaking, what OP is asking is equivalent to &quot;will the kick in a slamming trap banger kill me?&quot; and the answer is not at the intensity that's really feasible. The waves simply jostle the cell around in the media that is being effected. Yes microwaves impact water, but that's due to the electrical polarization of free molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because UV can cause damage to DNA which will result in cell death depending on exposure. However, UV are not penetrant so they will only kill whatever is on the surface and many types of bacteria are able to survive UV light. Also there have been cases of biofilms (layers of bacteria organized as a group) growing on the inside of a UV lamp, the first layer of dead cells enough to protect the bacteria underneath.</p>
<p>Therefore, UV can be used to desinfect things but only in very specific situations and I wouldn't say it can sterilize anything.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Microwaves are to radio as to what ultraviolet light is to visible light. Ultraviolet is also known as ionizing radiation because it imparts a charge when it makes contact with an object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this depends on the bacteria though right? Also isn't there a limit on how much bacteria is considered &quot;disinfected&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for household standards, shrug... personally i'd just soak the sponge in bleach. </p>
<p>if i'm talking about my line of work, you must press your fingertips to a growth medium for bacteria after putting the gloves on three consecutive times. [you put them on 3 times and press a new medium every time]. if a single colony is found on any of the three after incubation, you fail the test. 100% is acceptable. there are about 3,000,000 bacteria on your average hand. if i use 99.99% disinfectant, that's 3,000 bacteria potentially going into your veins. is that fine to you? zero, zip, zilch, none is the only acceptable level for IV. for your household 99.9% cleaner, that's 30,000 bacteria still left assuming it is used perfectly. :P</p>
<p>when we do the cleaning of the room, we use one pass of bleach, then a pass of sterile alcohol. the bleach is the heavy hitter here and not much different from your usual clorox. no microwave necessary. tl;dr, a better solution might be right there in your typical household cleaning supplies.</p></div>		</li>
