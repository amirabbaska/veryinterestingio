&quot;What, you did B?  Well, I've done B and you're no B&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Larus Gull is one example. You have gull species all around the north pole. From Britain, through North America, Russia and then Europe. I think it is the European and British gulls that can't hybridise. There's an irony about brexit in there somewhere. There are several others, including one in the plant kingdom. But generally they are very rare and their definition as a ring species can be controversial. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you really interested and have some time I recommend reading the red queen. There's an audio book of it on YouTube. It's explains a mushroom that can breed with 18 types but one of the 18 can only breed with the first and two can only breed with 17 and 4 can only breed with 14 others, I know that's a very rough explanation but the book goes into suuuuper detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coyotes and western NA wolves are genetically incompatible for cross breeding. However, the eastern species of wolf is capable of hybridization with coyotes and subsequently (due to the eastern species dwindling due to human interference) we have quite large and intelligent coyote/wolf (coywolf) hybrids. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that. Dog's can also interbreed with the Gray Wolf and is currently considered as the same species as the Gray Wolf (canis lupus).</p>
<p>However many disagree with this classification due to the dramatic difference in lifestyle and looks between the Dog and the Gray Wolf so a new species classification for the Dog has been proposed (canis familiaris). So far 'familiaris' has been considered a subspecies of 'lupus' and not a species of it's own, though this seems to be changing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The personalities are not <em>vastly</em> different, they're all easily identified as being a &quot;dog&quot;. Throw a stick and the majority chase after it. Now try that with cats. Any differences are minor in comparison.</p>
<p>They all live in the same environment (with us), and they are more or less interchangeable.</p>
<p>Not to mention it's too much work to invent a new species every time there's a new kind of bastard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, because it didn't make sense. It's always been the ability to produce <em>fertile</em> offspring, as far as I know, but even that doesn't make a huge amount of sense because there are cases where you could daisy chain them together - A can breed with B, B with C, C with D, but D not with A. </p>
<p>The issue is that words tend to make things binary when they are anything but. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The definition of species has changed and expanded the more we learn about biological nature. Although it is handy in some occasions, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_problem" target="_blank">the species concept comes with a lot of problems</a>.</p>
<p>The sexual compatibility definition of species only works with some major vertebrate groups, where there's individuals with separate sexes but it doesn't work with other groups, for example, fungi or bacteria don't have a male-female sexual dichotomy.</p>
<p>It was later changed to &quot;actually or potentially interbreeding populations, which are reproductively isolated from other populations&quot;. It seemed it was the one but rapidly enough it began to fall apart. Again, organisms that don't reproduce sexually were left out and it couldn't differentiate fossil species.</p>
<p>Nowadays there's several definitions for species, mainly because it's almost impossible to come up with a single definitions that can encompass the entirety of biological diversity. As a result, in some groups we use the sexual definition, in others we use the population definition, in others we use a taxonomic definition, in others a genetic definition, in others an ecological definition, etc.</p>
<p>It's quite easy to differentiate between species that are quite apart, like a human and a fig tree, it's obvious they're different but how about two closely related &quot;species&quot;? It is possible to pin down the actual difference between them? We're still discussing it.</p></div>		</li>
