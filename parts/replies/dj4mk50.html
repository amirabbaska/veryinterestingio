TL;DR: 15-yr old boy tried to kidnap my friend, then drove to Atlanta to commit suicide by cop, but not before killing an Atlanta police officer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But while you say that like it's a no brainier, even after reading his post that thought still didn't cross my mind. Although currently all I have in my fridge is grape jam, minced garlic, chicken broth, a takeout box with nothing but a cup of marinara in it, and some cannabis coconut oil. Maybe half a dozen pizza rolls in the freezer...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People used to abandon fridges in my old frat house all the time, so they'd sit all summer turned off with food still in them. Every single one of these we opened was full of maggots. It eventually became kind of a thing to dare someone to open a fridge during move in because you never knew whether it would be a &quot;maggot fridge&quot; or not.</p>
<p>We never even thought about trying to clean one.</p></div>		</li>
