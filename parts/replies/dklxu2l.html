			<div class="markdown"><p>Pair production is the creation of particle antiparticle pairs (normally people mean an electron positron pair). The nucleus near the site of interaction recoils, and the positron interacts with some other electron producing lower energy photons.

<p>My understanding isn't that pair production itself is the problem (particularly because water is low Z), but at really high MeV photon ranges photodisintegration becomes a concern. The release of unaccounted for neutrons and/or protons can severely damage tissue, and shielding becomes more of a concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are important, but the biggest thing is that you can effectively treat most people with energies &lt;20 MeV. You have to commission the linac for specific energies, meaning you do a lot of testing/modeling so you can have accurate treatment planning. Most places have something in the 5-10 range, then one or two from 10-18. The problem with the high energies (from what I was taught at least) is neutron contamination and issues near higher Z stuff (bones, orthopedic hardware, etc).</p></div>		</li>
