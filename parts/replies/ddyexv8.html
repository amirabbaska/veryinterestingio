			<div class="markdown"><p>Circadian rhythms again. Individuals are <a href="http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/science/variations/individual-variation-genetics" target="_blank">genetically predisposed</a> toward waking and sleeping at certain times of the day. It may just be that your body was not built for waking up at 6am. There is also a sleep disorder called delayed sleep phase syndrome which is characterized by inability to fall asleep until after midnight or get up before late morning. So the ELI5 version: early birds and night owls are a real thing, and when you match your sleep cycle to what your body prefers, you're gold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is truly glorious when you match your body preference, i once did 15 work days in a row with 3 double shift, those were mainly night shift and i wasnt even tired by sleeping 6 to 7 hours a day..... If i work dayshift, even with 10h of sleep i still feel like shit till lunch break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel ya. Over years and years of having to match my wake time to jobs of varying shifts (mostly thanks to retail!), I've discovered that my sweet spot is waking up between 7:30 and 9:30am. Right now I get up before 6 for my job, and I'm a <strong>rage-filled monster</strong> for the first 2-3 hours after I get up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in complete agreement on this one. Sleeping until as late as possible and only eating two meals a day was how I got in shape in college. It was fucking glorious. Now having to get up early for work and living with someone who has the nerve to cook delicious food every day is ruining me. I've gained almost 25 pounds in the 3 months since I graduated.</p></div>		</li>
