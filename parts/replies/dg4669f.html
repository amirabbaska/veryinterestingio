			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting fact is that the average Southern English person (London and surroundings) looks rather different than the average white person in the US, even the &quot;British&quot; type. They tend to have a slightly different facial structure. This is mainly due to most immigration coming from the North of England, which has more Celtic admixture, and the US having a <em>lot</em> of &quot;hidden&quot; Central or Eastern European ancestry, mainly German, Russian, and Polish.
German-Americans in particular will often not know about their own ancestry since from the 1st War, German-speaking people stopped speaking their language, changed their surnames, and basically auto-suppressed all of their History in order not to be lynched. WW2 didn't make things any easier...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Columbus OH and I recently learned some really cool facts about our German Village. First off we were voted one of the best German neighborhoods in the country so if your ever in town I highly recommend you walk around and go to some of the restaurants. Also, around the time of WWI they built a wall around the village to protect the residents. Due to the hatred of Germans at the time, at night they would lock the gates to prevent people from coming in and vandalizing homes and shops. It's amazing that rather than hide their culture they took those steps to protect themselves</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>German-American kind of fits into here too. They have been here for hundreds of years and gradually just started to blend in with everyone else. However, many retained their &quot;Germanness&quot; up all the way into the 20th century, but for several (war-related) reasons, they pretty much assimilated by the end of the first half of the century. So yeah, in modern America, English-American and German-American seem to be the ones most likely to just consider themselves &quot;American.&quot; Of course, American culture and cuisine includes many contributions from German-Americans, so they were also successful in mainstreaming certain parts of their original heritage as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my family has been here since 1610. I've never heard anyone refer ourselves as Welsh-Americans the only time I ever mention where my family is from it usually as a joke or just an interesting fact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, fellow way back Welsh-American here. Were your ancestry projects in school as boring as mine were? </p>
<p>Me: I'm Welsh, which means my family is English-lite. Also the Welsh flag has a dragon on it, which I guess is a thing.</p>
<p>Teacher: Can you tell us a fun fact about Wales?</p>
<p>Me: Fun fact; there are no fun facts about Wales. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh come on... </p>
<p>Mount Everest was named after Welshman Sir George Everest from Gwernvale, Breconshire.</p>
<p>Wales is believed to have more castles per square mile than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyll-llantysiliogogogoch is the name of a town in North Wales which translates as “The church of St. Mary in the hollow of white hazel trees near the rapid whirlpool by St. Tysilio’s of the red cave”.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha. Yeah, I never really had many fun facts about Wales. I would mostly make fun of the fact that there was a lot of incestuous marriages. </p>
<p>I was watching LOTR Fellowship of the Ring last night and laughed <a href="https://youtu.be/bYFPxU9xGZI?t=2m40s" target="_blank">when Pippin describes his relation to Frodo</a>, because this is how I explain my relationship to others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, name very much checks out. When your family has been here since the beginning of English colonization, you run out of options. Of course, if you consider my parents, that might as well have just been following tradition.</p></div>		</li>
