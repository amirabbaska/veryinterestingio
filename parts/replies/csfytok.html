			<div class="markdown"><p>but we dont hear anything about this because they're not cute and cuddling and they don't provide us with sweet sweet honey</p>
<p>would the lack of guano affect a lot of farmers just like lack of bee pollination would???</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just made me extremely worried about our bat populations. And the honey bee population is dropping drastically to. It seems like we could live in a very changed world here soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say the bat problem is bigger than the bee problem, if only because we can turn the bee issue around dramatically by changing our agricultural practices.</p>
<p>For bats, there may be nothing we can do.  Consider that vast majority of the entire species of Indiana Bats (<strong>Myotis sodalis</strong>) hibernate in just a 4 or 5 caves that we know of.  They could be wiped out in one winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is scaring me. By the time i have kids, the world will be a different place. My children will not know the world that we know today will be a thing of legends. Except it will have existed. We are on the cross roads, one leads to wide spread ecological collapse, the other leads to the earth surviving for some time.</p></div>		</li>
