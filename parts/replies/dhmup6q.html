			<div class="markdown"><p>Ford had our 2 most profitable years in 2015 and 2016. I'm not a business analyst but deep shit is a little extreme. </p>
<p>I'm an engineer at Ford and there's just as many talented smart hard working people as some startup or Tesla. </p>
<p>The fact of he matter is huge car companies are doing something on a scale most people can't even imagine. Do you realize every 50ish seconds a whole new F150 truck rolls off the assembly line in Dearborn? That's is just ONE plant. Do you have any idea the engineering and manufacturing coordination that goes into that?</p>
<p>It's just a little annoying when for decades everyone has been calling you dead and yet here we are still making huge profits AND investing in future areas. Ford and the Big 3 along with forgien companies are not some stagnant legacy companies that google and Tesla will overtake. This is perhaps the most competitive industry in the world. So to think a company with Billions at stake is just sitting on its hands and &quot;deep shit&quot; is wrong. </p>
<p>Find me another American company in an equally competitive industry that's been around as long as Ford. </p>
<p>I feel like Rodeny Dangerfield, but damn sometimes we get no respect. </p>
<p>We make some SHIT products but some amazing ones too. Just like every OEM and there's thousands of reasons why those products had to end up the way they are. </p>
<p>If Ford has such terrible stuff why is the F150 the best selling vehicle every year? The Mustang the best selling sports car? The Focus RS garnished with dozens of car of the year awards?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's what I mean. F150s are everywhere here, and I can guarantee it's the 1st or 2nd best selling truck in NA probably yearly since the early 80s? I know that the Escort Cosworths were a yuge deal and highly coveted still in the UK, the RS200 is a great successor to that and people are still people are waiting for RS200 deliveries. Folks from New Zealand have well used F series trucks shipped out there for like 60+K. </p>
<p>I just see so much success and I don't know why a company seems to act like it's limping along when it appears to dominate the industry. Another guy here was saying that companies of this size look to trim 1-3% of their expenses per year, and if they do whatever it takes, even if they lay folks off, and they aren't very up front about it. They'll feign some sort of necessity rather than confess they just want a profit, and that's actually what the BBC article alluded to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I work for another legacy American manufacturing company and I'm not sure exactly how competitive the automotive industry is compared to others, but......</p>
<p>Coca Cola?</p>
<p>Corning Incorporated? </p>
<p>I would say Exxon except for that whole &quot;the federal government says Standard Oil is an illegal trust&quot; thing.</p>
<p>JP Morgan?</p>
<p>Jim Beam?</p>
<p>Colgate?</p>
<p>Remington?</p>
<p>Also, sucks that we can't pitch our companies w/o using throwaway accounts. American manufacturing is pretty fucking awesome, despite the ineptitude of some of the operators. And Managers. And the occasional engineer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair the f150 and mustang are probably best selling due to cost rather then quality. A new mustan gt is a bit cheaper then a camaro ss or a dodge challenger r/t.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ford is the healthiest of the big three.</p>
<p>The problem, ultimately, is that they don't make much profit because they can't build quality, desirable [by the marketplace] cars as cheaply as the competition.</p>
<p>The Big Three automakers were the last great Union manufacturing shops, from an era where skilled human labor was in extremely high demand, and when international shipping was expensive.  The automakers made deals with the United Auto Workers union that included guaranteed high wages, excellent benefits, and lavish pensions, and certain anti-automation guarantees (where the automaker would guarantee that if any new automation tech eliminated jobs, a certain percentage of the employees would be kept anyway).</p>
<p>Then, the 1980s happened.  Foreign cars entered the U.S. in a big way.  At first, they were kinda crappy -- but they were efficient and cheap.</p>
<p>Over time, the foreign cars became higher and higher quality -- but the foreign automakers didn't have these huge costs.  They just paid people to operate the equipment that built cars -- no guaranteed pensions, no eternal jobs, no anti-automation clauses...  Pretty soon, the Big Three found themselves squeezed.  I've seen estimates that between $2400 and $3700 of the price of each car goes to pay for the pensions, retiree-health-benefits, and automation-compensation for union employees no longer working.  The foreign makers have none of those costs.</p>
<p>The Big Three would have all died in the 90s, but then something saved them -- Americans (and <em>only</em> Americans) started buying huge SUVs.  SUVs were great, because they were a product for a US-exclusive market (so there was less interest in competition from foreign markets), they were upmarket (and therefore have higher margins), they were heavier (more expensive to ship), and they were taxed like trucks initially (thus having more-protectionist tariffs)</p>
<p>This allowed the Big Three to bump along despite their absurd cost structure.  They still struggled -- they couldn't make economy cars at anything close to an equivalent quality/price point (and therefore those models sold poorly), but they could sell enough SUVs and Trucks to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>Two things happened to break this once and for all:</p>
<p>For one, oil prices went from $25/barrel to $150/barrel, and gasoline went from $1.25/gallon to $5/gallon, and suddenly, nobody wanted SUVs that got ~12 MPG any more, because they couldn't afford them.</p>
<p>For another, the major foreign automakers built large, high-tech, automation-heavy factories <em>in the US</em> to build their US-only and US-mostly models -- mostly SUVs and larger non-luxury sedans (as a result of radically-higher taxes outside the US).  This allows them to make vehicles better targeted to the American market (and avoid import tariffs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an interview a few years ago with the then CEO of GM. He explained that GM is just as capable of building the same quality as the Japanese companies, but due to retiree health care and pension costs negotiated with the unions decades ago, all things being equal, the GM version would cost $2,000 more. So, to be competitive pricewise, they cut corners with cheaper interiors and wherever else they can to cut $2,000 off the price. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seemingly has a lot to do with &quot;drive profitable growth&quot; that he quoted. </p>
<p>People overlook or don't even realize that publicly traded companies are run by a CEO who answers to a board of directors who are voted in by stockholders whose main focus is to make more profits from the company.. The primary goal is to make money for it's shareholders in the near and long term. It has very little interest in ideological goals at a base level.</p>
<p>That said a big part of what they are doing is trimming now to find a market in the future. Analysts know they will not fill as big of a role in the industry going forward, that does not however mean they can't make money for their stakeholders at a smaller or leaner size.</p></div>		</li>
