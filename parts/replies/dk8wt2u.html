<p>In reality, concentrations are the key, just like they are in many of these things. To get physically dependent, one has to consume a lot for along time (we are talking about just unbelievable amounts but due to it's non-toxicity, is possible to do). Then it becomes actual physical dependency. The consensus is that marijuana is very weak on physical dependency and withdrawals are very mild to non-existent until we arrive at the extreme cases. So he is right just that the &quot;not as intense as other drugs&quot; makes it sound a bit different :) How much and how long has got a LOT to do with it and to consume such amount, the psychological dependency is very well developed, far ,far before we reach physical dependency. </p>
<p>Gut is the largest physiological change, digestion works differently, appetite is controlled partly by endocannabinoids. It is a bit like changing diets and just like it, can be taken to extremes. First signs of heavy smoking is when you don't get munchies but instead can stay hungry for long periods of time (and enter ketosis faster)</p>
<p>But then again, if only look at physiological side, we would have to declare a lot of drugs as &quot;safe&quot; and we have conclusive data that some of them are not that..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My roommate (who was a right **** for so many reasons) argued for legalisation because &quot;it's not addictive&quot;.</p>
<p>So why, if it isn't addictive, are/were you addicted, bud? Why weren't you able to hold back, so you could make it work? Why couldn't you not smoke for two months, so you wouldn't lose your driver's license?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've smoked daily for about 7 years. After a long time, I needed a new job. I quit for 6 weeks without an issue. Only thing close to withdrawl I got was a slighty lower appetite because food didn't taste as good. Other than that, I had absolutely no issue. Everyone is different I suppose?</p></div>		</li>
