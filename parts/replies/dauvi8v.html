			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on to this, a huge problem with fusion and helium is that the helium implants itself into the walls of the reactor; it doesn't just float around as a gas in there. So any helium that we do conceivably recover will be much lower than this estimate due to the fact it just gets stuck in everything (which leads to a whole host of materials issues that are off topic to this question). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have to design the reactors to let that helium out. If it got stuck in reactor walls of ordinary metal, it would structurally destroy them. Think of the metal 'foaming up' and flaking off. Most designs for fusion reactors center around a blanket of molten lithium swirling around the fusion reaction. This is to capture the kinetic energy of the neutrons as heat and breed more tritium as part of the fuel supply. So helium would just boil out of that for easy recovery. After that, the more advance aneutronic fusion reactions would lend themselves to direct electric conversion. That process slows the alpha particles (helium nuclei) to a slow enough speed that embedding in the walls is not a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the lithium concepts aren't really implemented yet, there's just a ton of research going on. Most reactors currently use tungsten diverters. </p></div>		</li>
