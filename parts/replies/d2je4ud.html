			<div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing on that chart that says that water cannot move faster through those types of pipes, let alone others.  It appears to be an industry guideline for sizing pipes, presumably for safety:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A theoretical conduit could resist cavitation forces of a liquid exceeding the speed of sound in the boundary layer and the flow would continue, but I don't know if you could call it a liquid at that point.  It certainly wouldn't be a homogeneous liquid.  That may be the upper bound to the lexical definition of that question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water can move faster. It <em>can</em> reach the speed of sound before it starts to really mess itself up and your pipe doesn't stay pipe-like for very long. That's the beat answer to the question.</p>
<p>For more practical purposes though, those &quot;max velocity&quot; estimates are recommended values. Higher than that and you start getting scaling and/or pitting, making the life cycle of the piping unpredictable.</p>
<p>You also start getting very high pressure drop/length of pipe. The higher the flow velocity, the higher the pressure drop in the pipe, meaning the higher pressure you need to apply from the pump to keep the fluid moving. With high pressures you need a bigger pump and stronger pipe to contain the pressure.</p>
<p>Those maximum flow recommendations are great engineering rules of thumb for making sure you don't undersize a pipe and end up oversizing a pump.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bernoulli's equation is unhelpful when the two factors limiting velocity are fluid viscosity and pipe friction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bernoulli is unhelpful when the limiting factor is compressibility as it's totally invalid. Those steel pipe flow capacities are really just structural limitations based on specific steel pipe dimensions and not really any fundamental physics (i.e. why is the head loss going up and down with increasing pipe diameter).</p></div>		</li>

<p>While invalid, you can derive a compressible form of the energy equation that is functionally very similar to Bernoulli. So often the intuition can be valuable, although admittedly Bernoulli is too often used without regards for its realm of applicability. </p>
<p>Otherwise agree with the above. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes indeed. Bernoulli can be derived from either the momentum or the energy equation - it just depends on the assumptions you are making, particularly when reducing it from the full integral form.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true and it's a good point I like to make in slightly more advanced fluid discussions (I can think of 4 &quot;Bernoulli&quot; equations in fluids off the top of my head.) However the compressible Bernoulli you're thinking of still only applies to adiabatic isentropic flow, which means even that is still not valid when you're looking at limiting cases of sonic/supersonic flow.</p>
<p>Over the years I feel like I've written a small novel on incorrect interpretations of Bernoulli on /r/askscience...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If OP wanted a rigorous mathematical answer, wouldn't The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations" target="_blank">Navier-Stokes equation</a> be a better starting point than the Bernoulli equation?</p>
<p>Of course, Navier Stokes is notoriously difficult to solve rigorously. And the Wikipedia article claims that in extreme conditions (e.g. very high flow rates) it tends to be less reliable.</p>
<p>So, yeah, empirical tables are probably the way to go.</p></div>		</li>
