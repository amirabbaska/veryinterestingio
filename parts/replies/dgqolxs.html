			<div class="markdown"><p>Responding to your edit: Roses actually make a fruit called rose hips that are often red or orange and are very high in vitamin C. Vitamin C deficiency is the cause of scurvy, which leads to tooth loss and flu-like symptoms. They can be eaten if prepared​ in a way that addresses​ their itching powder-like properties. So roses aren't &quot;useless&quot; flowers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned vinegar of acetic acid, but isn't that a taste that humans like?</p>
<p>For example, salt and vinegar chips, pickles/pickled products, etc?</p>
<p>Also what about fermented things. Aren't they technically things that &quot;went bad&quot;. </p>
<p>Not trying to discredit you. More so legitimately interested how sometimes things going bad became tasty to humans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course people like vinegar, but the point is that, in the wild, if you found something that smelled of it, you might think twice about eating it. Similarly, cultivated cheese gives off isovaleric acid... its why limburger cheese is infamous for being extremely smelly in a way thats offensive to people. Yes, people eat limburger cheese, but biologically, its a signal that &quot;something is up&quot; when you smell that compound. Humans are intelligent and do weird stuff like put spoiled milk in a sheeps stomach to see what happens though, so it doesn't always matter. Stinky fish sauce, weird cheeses, durian fruit, etc, there are a lot of edible foods that smell really weird. Just having the scent doesn't mean that something is bad to eat but hopefully you can imagine why, before humans started doing agriculture, fermenting beer, burying cabbage or rotten shark under ground with a bunch of salt for a few weeks and then eating it, that <em>generally</em> humans were well served by sniffing something and going &quot;hey, this smells... weird... maybe we should have Dave eat it and see what happens&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just my opinion, which probably isn't worth a ton because I catch fish by chumming the water with cum, but I'd imagine the stinky food came to be eaten out of desperation, when no fresh food sources were available and the rotten food was all that was left...starvation is a huge motivator. People kill and eat their friends when pushed to the absolute brink. The stinky fish was probably preferable to eating Steve, for instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rosehips, the fruit of the rose after the big bloom is pollinated, are a source for vitamin C.</p>
<p>Vitamin C can't be made by the human body but is necessary for the human body to live, so domesticating sources of vitamin C is wise.</p>
<p>I don't know if roses were specifically domesticated for the pretty bloom or because the rosehips helped prevent scurvy (a quick google search doesn't give me any quick answers on the forces behind rose domestication), but they certainly can serve a &quot;practical&quot; purpose beyond the flower.</p></div>		</li>
