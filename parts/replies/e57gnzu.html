			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking to clarify what happened with the dinosaur ending meteorite.</p>
<p>Newer models cast doubt on the dinosaur killing dust cloud theory. First the temperatures at the impact site didn't create dust, it created vaporized rock that covered the planet in a layer. We're talking at temperatures significantly higher than the surface of the sun at the impact point. This means the actual extinction may have taken as little as 2 hours as this superheated gas settled on the surface of the planet.</p>
<p>Second, the impact had the effect of RAISING temperatures by about 5 c for 100,000 years as it released a huge amount of CO2 into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If the goal is to replicate what happened to the dinosaurs, full scale global thermonuclear war would be fairly close.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>To further clarify my half remembered ramblings,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was just this big, expanding plasma ball that penetrated out of the top of the atmosphere, into space,&quot; Durda says. </p>
<p>The plume spread east and west until it enveloped the entire Earth. Then, still gravitationally bound to the planet, it rained back down into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>As it cooled, it condensed into trillions of quarter-millimetre droplets of glass. These shot down towards the Earth's surface at about the same entry speed as the space shuttle, heating the upper atmosphere so much that, in some places, land plants caught fire.</p>
</blockquote>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to paint a picture of what this looked like... </p>
<p>The impact sent tons and tons of small ejecta into suborbital trajectories spreading it to every corner of the globe. Not orbital, so what goes up, must come down.  It was essentially the mother of all meteor showers. Each tiny piece (most of it no bigger than small pebbles, we think), upon reentry, heated up the air just a <em>little</em> bit. But there was gigatons of this stuff, and it heated up the entire atmosphere planet-wide to the point where it started to glow a dull red.</p>
<p>Anything exposed to the sky was, for a few hours, inside an oven set to the self-clean cycle. </p>
<p>The only survivors were deep underwater, or at least a few inches underground (soil makes a surprisingly good insulator).  So mammals, insects, seeds, and tiny dinosaurs of the type that readily captured the &quot;small flying vertebrate&quot; niche, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>With this model, the mass extinction was <em>not</em> a long, drawn out affair as plant life slowly withered away from lack of sunlight, dragging down whole food webs down with them.  No, this was the work of a single afternoon.  The day started off perfectly normal, just like any other, and ended with 99.9% of everything dead and on fire. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly no one is really sure as we are filling in the blanks between meteorite impact and observing the K T boundary. Around the world there is this layer of rock that got there because of the impact. It was hot enough to become vapor and launched high enough to circle the globe but exactly what that looked like is beyond current modeling capability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean even though it's hot it's still heavy rock, perhaps the initial extreme heat allowed it to rise much less dense then air to a high level allowing it to reach around the globe, then as it cooled it fell but was perhaps still &quot;vapor&quot; on return to earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rock re-solidified into microscopic glass beads. We find them in the kt boundary. Know how the space shuttle heats up on re-entry? Picture that but as a cloud of glass dust all around the planet. The whole surface of the planet probably hit somewhere around 350F. Not really anything that isn't underwater or in a cave will survive that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The asteroid that impacted the Yucutan was estimated to be 10-14 km wide and impacted with a force of around 100,000,000 <strong>megatons</strong>, thus basically setting the planet on fire. ejecting an ungodly amount of debris, wiping out most large life, etc. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the theory. </p>
<p>Animals that burrowed, a few weird amphibians that got lucky and of course, birds, with the presumption that a small pocket of avian dinosaurs somewhere on earth were somehow (flight, dumb luck, whatever) able to withstand the impact events, but the power of flight gave them enough 'options' after the impact event (due to the ability to traverse huge amounts of space, unlike land based animals) that they were able to survive and adapt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>up to some point yeah. </p>
<p>The big thing was that send so much debris into the outer layers of the atmosphere that when it came back it started a global fire, plus, with the earth basically resonating like a bell there were a lot of volcanic eruptions. This made for an endless winter.</p>
<p>Depending on the angle of impact , the location of impact, speed of impact... It would be really hard to know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effects of the impact were almost entirely related to its impact location (as scientists are now realising; where it hit played a huge role in how it played out) <em>relative</em> to it's massive, massive size.... but the size was a big deal. </p>
<p>It was basically a rock larger than Mt Everest, larger than many small towns, travelling 10X faster than a rifle bullet, slamming into the planet and causing physical effects that boggle the mind. Its hard for us to even fathom the mechanics of that, but that's what happened and that's why the after-effects were so insane.</p></div>		</li>

The radiation would be phenomenal but I can’t see it blotting out the sun as completely as a KT event </p></div>		</li>
