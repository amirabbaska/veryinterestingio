			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how you view it, Mauna Kea could be a contender.  I'm typing this on my phone otherwise I'd include links, but read up on the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain--it's an undersea mountain range that makes up an archipelago in the Pacific (which includes the Hawiian islands).  Obviously most of these mountains are undersea, but Mauna Kea is 10,100 meters from base to peak!!</p></div>		</li>

<p>It snowed recently on both mountains, so I was up on both of them playing in it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can Mauna Kea really count?</p>
<p>Wouldn't a volcano like Mauna Kea be receiving substantial buoyant force from the water surrounding it? Obviously it doesn't actually float, but basalt is only about 3x denser than water. </p>
<p>If you drained away the water surrounding Mauna Kea, would the whole thing collapse?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a rule of thumb that I use, and I have given quiz problems in my physics class where the student has to use the equation: </p>
<pre><code>g_earth x h_earth = g_mars x h_mars</code></pre>
<p>to get the height of Olympus Mons this way. It's a fun exercise in dimensional analysis and teaches them something about surface gravity (I hope) and it's a great simple example for understanding how quantities relate (i.e. how this thing changes when that thing changes).  </p>
<p>In fact, I wonder if this can be used to predict the potato radius? Assuming constant density for all rocky bodies, do you hit a point where the limit of the maximum height of a mountain on that body is greater than the radius of the body itself? The equation above comes from the same sort of derivation as <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1004/1004.1091.pdf" target="_blank">was used to derive the potato radius</a> for studying elastic limits of materials. </p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt+%28+8848+meters+*+9.81+m%2Fs^2+%2F+%28Gravitational+constant+*+5.51+grams%2Fcc+*+4%2F3*pi%29+%29" target="_blank">So here's the math</a> where that gravitational constant and density are used to calculate surface gravity assuming a sphere with the same density as the earth. </p>
<p><strong>We get about 240 km for the radius where this happens, which is totally in the 200-300km potato radius given in the paper I cited above!</strong> </p>
<p>I'm going to go show my friends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>could you assume if a large collection of less dense raw materials were in the same location on the crust it would be able to reach a higher height due to less force due to gravity being applied on the mantle?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, assuming that less dense material can support its own weight to that height.  Build it out of weaker material and it may compress itself instead of the crust beneath it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. It could also be ever so slightly taller (probably not even a few millimeters) if it were sitting on the equator, due to centrifugal force and -since the Earth is wider at the equator <em>because</em> of that force- feeling a bit less gravity.</p></div>		</li>
