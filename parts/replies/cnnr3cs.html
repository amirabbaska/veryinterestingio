			<p>Depending on how you view it, Mauna Kea could be a contender.  I'm typing this on my phone otherwise I'd include links, but read up on the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain--it's an undersea mountain range that makes up an archipelago in the Pacific (which includes the Hawiian islands).  Obviously most of these mountains are undersea, but Mauna Kea is 10,100 meters from base to peak!!</p>		</li>

			<p>Winds scouring a landmass will load dust, both that resting on the landmass and that it erodes. The bigger the landmass and powerful the wind, the more dust the wind will load (that's a source of &quot;blood rains&quot; and &quot;blood snows&quot; in some countries, wind having loaded reddish dusts from deserts and unloading it with precipitations at higher latitudes, leaves a mess afterwards).<br><br>Because of how sensitive optical observatories are, dust-loaded air will make observations more difficult or impossible. A very remote oceanic location away from continental windpaths will have very little dust cover, increasing optical observation windows.</p>		</li>

			<p>Another huge factor in the placement of the observatories is the tropical temperature inversion, which tends to keep cloud cover well beneath the summit. Air parcels only rise because they are more buoyant than surrounding air. They are more buoyant because they are less dense, and they are less dense because they are warmer and have expanded faster than nearby parcels. Air on the summit is warmer than air downhill, which prevents air parcels from rising as the rising parcels are still more dense than the inversion layer.<br><br>Clear skies almost every day, it stays rather dry around the observatories. This inversion is also what keeps pollution (and dust) out of the air up there. </p>		</li>

			<p>This is a good thought, but not quite right. The water is affecting the mountain, but in the other direction. The mountain sits on the earth's crust, which sits on the gooey semi-liquid mantle. The water, also sits on the earth's crust, which sits on the gooey semi-liquid mantle. <br><br>The water is actually just adding weight to an already compressed crust. It doesn't provide any buoyant force up because it's not the mountain that's being pushed down. It's the crust the mountain and water sit on.<br><br>For an analogy, imagine sitting in a boat floating on the surface of a lake. If you put water into the boat the boat sinks a little. The ocean basin acts like the boat and the mantle underneath the crust acts like the lake water. You put more of anything in the boat (the ocean basin) the crust will have more weight and it'll sink a little.<br><br>For it to have a buoyant force up, the water would need to also surround the crust. <br><br>The Mauna Kea is more spread out than Everest and it doesn't have all the other mountains around it so closely (the Hawaiian islands are spread out mroe than the Himalayans) so it doesn't actually compress the earth's crust as much. I also think the rock is less dense than Everest, making it less heavy by volume, but I can't confirm that right now. </p>		</li>

			<p>Mauna Kea, and all of the Hawaiian islands are formed by the Hawaiian hotspot, and over time the ocean crust moves along towards the subduction zones (towards Asia). You can track the plate movement by looking at underwater topography (anyone can do this, check out Google Earth). The hotspot is also much less dense than anything around it, and acts as a sort of crustal car-jack. </p>		</li>

			<p>That doesn't discount his point though - You've got superheated rock causing expansion from below, but that's offset by the weight of the water it's trying to expand into.  The crust is an upward force (not really buoyant but similar in result to the force he was expecting from the water).   It really shows the massive amount of crust that's expanding in the hotspot when you think about 6KM of vertical water weighing it down without successfully compressing it.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think it's more impressive when volcanics penetrate 2-4 times more rock through continents, whereas the ocean crust is very thin. <br><br>Water doesn't weigh that much in the grand scheme of things when it comes to extruding rock, the energy output is too great. The water would facilitate cooling and chemical composition, and would help it build vertical height faster. On land the lava would spread thinner, over greater distances, as it would take longer to cool. <br><br>Oceanic volcanics differ from continental volcanics in that the viscosity of the partial molten lava is incredibly different. The water present in oceanic volcanics allows the lava to be more fluid, which makes eruptions more recurring, but less damaging. Continental volcanics on the other hand have little water and are very explosive - see Mt St Helens - the difference in viscosity is like the difference between maple syrup and really old, dried out organic peanut butter.<br><br>The crust is NOT an upward force, it actually weighs more than the asthenosphere in which it lies on - this is how plate tectonics can be a thing. The molten rock becomes less dense when its super heated and causes partial melting of the crust, decreasing it's localized density, and causing it to rise further into the crust. If there is sufficient heat, you get a volcano. ONCE THE LAVA COOLS, it becomes as dense/more dense than the crust it just came from, since it is a mix of mantle material and crust material.</p>		</li>

			<p>a little, but probably not much. A mountain can only be so dense, probably about the density of granite. If there's an upper limit to density there's an upper limit to the size of the mountain before it pushes too hard on the magma.<br><br>Another factor than crustal deformation is that the rock under several miles of other rock actually gets hot enough to plastic, meaning it squishes and deforms. So if the mountain is several miles high the rocks at the bottom center are actually kinda mushy anyway. <br><br>The regional crustal deformation will play a factor in how tall the mountain is and crustal deformation is determined by how dense and tall the main mountain is, plus the surrounding mountains.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Volcanic mountains on continental crust have a huge base of thick crust beneath them that goes deeper into the mantle than oceanic crust. You never see it since it is well below ground; but it's there, essentially balancing out the extreme weight of the mountains above.  Simplistically, it's much like an iceberg in water. You see the top, and it is floating more or less in equilibrium, but there's a huge amount of ice volume below the water line you can't see. So it's not likely to get  higher with fewer mountains because the base in the crust won't be as big and the equilibrium will therefore keep the mountains lower. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ah, that makes sense. I guess the mountain is a little bump on what's essentially already a large chunk of rock (the crust). <br><br>Is that true for non-volcanic mountains like the Himalayans? They were created from upwelling of continental crusts when India collided with Southern China/Mongolia. There it's the crust that's being broken and squished. Do you end up with the same huge chunk of rocky crust below the mountain range like you'd get beneath a lone volcanic mountain say, say in South America or would the upheaval of the crust make it thinner?</p>		</li>
					<ul class="replies">
		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cassowaryattack" target="_blank">cassowaryattack</a>
			<p>Yes, it does - the difference is that you have two continent crusts colliding and unlike with oceanic crust that is much more dense and tends to sink below he other, these two tend to mash together. With the force of the crusts pushing together and the mantle boundary below, the only place the whole mess has left to move is up, which forms the mountains. Depending on how fast the two collide they can get very high, but over time the crust below will tend to sink under the increased weight of the two crust sections mashing together, plus erosion will help to lower the height. It's an ongoing process over huge timescales of course. </p>		</li>

			<p>Not, not exactly. If anything the magma would tend to well up around the edges of the mountain. However, the mountain's weight - believe it or not - is a nearly insignificant factor concerning where lava upwells out of the crust. Plate tectonics - which doesn't appear to be significantly affected BY mountaint ranges - determines where lava will come up. Plate tectonics, instead, CAUSES mountains. </p>		</li>

			<p>The definition of &quot;highest mountain&quot; that makes the most sense to me in this context is &quot;what is the mountain that is the highest from the Earth's center of gravity, accounting for rotation-induced and tidally-induced bulging&quot;.  Mauna Kea definitely doesn't come close to Everest in this accounting because its peak is substantially lower.  Yes, Mauna Kea has the misfortune of having a much lower base, but it's not clear to me why this shouldn't count against it, as the base itself bears weight just like the structure of the mountain, and given that the two are largely even composed of the same materials, does it really make sense to distinguish the mountain as being fundamentally different from the base?  The higher base upon which Everest rests on is itself load-bearing, and structurally counts just as much as the mountain.</p>		</li>

			<p>But /u/CydeWays did specify that part of his definition as highest from the centre of gravity of the Earth accounting for any rotational or tidal &quot;bulging&quot;. By this I believe he means treating the Earth not as an oblate spheroid but taking the average distance from centre to land surface which would be somewhere between equatorial distance and polar distance from the centre.<br><br>Earth has an equatorial bulge of around 25-odd miles at the equator and so if you account for this Chimborazo wouldn't be the highest point any longer and I believe that was OP's point. :).</p>		</li>

			<p>I guess it depends on how you want to define the base? If you look at a cross section of mt. Everest, it goes FAR below sea level, if you include the crustal material supporting the mountain and not just the arbitrary amount above some elevation chosen to be zero. In that case you have to look at something on the order of 40-60 km (not 100% on that offhand but it's close) of mountain!<br><br>On the other hand, yeah Mauna Kea is something like 11 km high from the ocean floor...but it also only sits on about 7 km of similar material which you could consider a homogeneous base. In that respect Everest in an easy 20 or so km taller than Mauna Kea. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>The point I was trying to make though is you don't have to follow a mountain down 6400ish km to the exact center of the earth to figure out its true height, just as much it seems odd to pick some arbitrary base point at sea level.<br><br>The limiting factor initially stated has to do with isostasy, which is more about the interactions between the Earth's crust and the upper mantle.<br><br>See, the mantle acts as a supper viscous fluid and the crust, well in a way it floats across the surface of the mantle. When you have material of a certain density, it will push down on the mantle. Denser materials push down farther into the mantle more then less dense fluids, which is what you'd expect. Here's a figure to illustrate that point a little more: <a href="http://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/mathyouneed/isostacyhandrho.v2.jpg" target="_blank">http://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/mathyouneed/isostacyhandrho.v2.jpg</a><br><br>In this manner the crust doesn't have on unique depth...it sort of varies depending on the density of the material and the thickness of the material. In the case of Mauna Kea, you have a large structure above the sea floor granted, but you only have a very thin slice of high density crust underneath it (In the figure this could be represented by the purple boxes). In the case of Everest, you have so much above sea level, but you have a huge amount of low density material underneath it (the large pink squares in the figure). You could also think of these bases perhaps as the roots below teeth.<br><br>The reasons for this have to do with properties of buoyancy and the densities are a story that encompasses most of Geology and our theories behind plate tectonics. <br></p>		</li>

In the case of rock, however, if it sinks to the bottom and is not completely surrounded, as it would not be on the bottom, the water in a vertical column over it would only serve to add weight on top of it. </p>		</li>

			<p>Venus does have a magnetosphere but it's just weak compared to earth which is why the lighter elements have gone away. The planet also has some tectonic activity but not like Earth's (from memory it somehow undergoes a total crustal upheaval at intervals rather than our subduction system) so there's enough of a magnetosphere to protect the heavier parts of the atmosphere. The CO2 was partly produced by being baked out of the rocks by the heat (basically reverse carbon sequestering) once the greenhouse effect passed the tipping point and went into overdrive.</p>		</li>

			<p>Interesting question! Say we're only interested in planets which actually <em>have</em> an atmosphere (or the answer is too easy!) The atmosphere's height is relatively insensitive to how much it weighs -- it only depends <em>logarithmically</em> on the surface pressure (since the mass is exponentially distributed in altitude). There's a characteristic scale to the atmospheric height: it's the balance between the pressure of the gas, trying to inflate itself, and the weight of the gas, trying to collapse itself. The pressure scales with the absolute temperature (1); and the weight scales with the (molar) gas density (2), and with the planet's surface gravity (3).<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height</a>    <br>(^ has a table of planet's atmospheres)<br><br>So those are the three main parameters we could twiddle. (I don't know about the isostatic limit; maybe a geology person will address that)<br><br>There's no point looking at the surface gravity, since the mountain-height limit depends on it in the same way (it'd just cancel out).<br><br>You'd get the shallowest atmosphere with a dense gas (high molecular weight), at a low temperature. Take the earth's atmosphere for example: it's mostly N2 (weight 28 amu), at ~300 K, with a scale height of 8 km. You go up 8 km, the density goes down to 1/e ~ 36% of sea level. At 16 km, 1/e^2 ~ 14%. Everest is about 9 km from sea level (~1 scale height).<br><br>If you moved the Earth as from the sun as Jupiter, the temperature would be roughly halved. So the atmospheric scale would shrink to ~4 km; Everest's summit would be above two scale heights -- above ~90% of the atmosphere.<br><br>At the distance of Neptune, the temperature would be ~40 K and the scale height ~1.5 km. But then, earth's atmospheric components would all be frozen cryogenic solids, like the nitrogen ice that covers the surface of [Triton](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon%29" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon%29</a>). So we wouldn't have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_%28moon%29#Atmosphere" target="_blank">meaningful</a> atmosphere.<br><br>Hydrogen and helium would remain gases at very low temperature. But you wouldn't find them in on an earth-size planet, since they're light enough to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape" target="_blank">escape the atmosphere</a>. And anyway, low molecular weight makes atmospheres <em>taller</em>, so that's not useful.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>But does the lower density of air reduce wind speeds? I obviously have no experience with buildings on top of mountain peeks, but for regular structures on flat ground, wind speed actually increases inverse-parabolically the higher up you go, and is essentially zero at ground level due to friction (similar to liquid flow near the boundaries in pipe flow). However, I imagine at the peaks of a huge mountain range like the Himalayas, it's much more complicated, with wind vortexes, different atmospheric conditions, etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>It increases wind speeds actually, but the force exerted by the wind scales linearly with air density, and I'm pretty sure density drops faster than speed rises. <br>A 70 km/h wind on top of Everest would feel weaker than a 50 km/h wind at sea level.</p>		</li>

			<p>Isostacy is the most limiting factor when determining mountain height. However, the fact that mountain ranges influence their own weather/climate also leads to increased rates of erosion in comparison to lowlands, causing them to reach a &quot;maximum&quot; elevation. Just as climates are colder as you get closer to the poles, it also gets colder with increased elevation (eg. Mt. Kilimanjaro is 3 degrees south of the equator and was glaciated less than a decade ago/might still have a few small glaciers left). This causes precipitation to fall in the form of snow. With enough snow, glaciers grow. In turn, glaciers erode mountains with great efficiency. </p>		</li>

			<p>Wouldn't it depend on the density of the rock?  iirc Everest was something relatively low density, I remember something about an experiment looking for the gravity pull caused by the rock, and it was less than expected.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vmbuford" target="_blank">vmbuford</a>
			<p>Yes, it depends on the density of the rock; the limit is <em>about</em> 10 km for that reason. Most crust material is ~2.5-3 g/c.c., and we can't really accurately calculate the density of a mountain this big. </p>		</li>
						<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CydeWeys" target="_blank">CydeWeys</a>
			<p>It's not about density, it's about the compressive strength of the material relative to its density.  You could thus build a higher structure with aluminum than steel, because for the same height the aluminum structure weighs less, and thus exerts less downwards pressure on the plate beneath it.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/touchable" target="_blank">touchable</a>
			<p>But based on what I understand from the original comment, it's not the compressive strength of the mountain that's governing here. It's the bearing of the crust on the upper mantle that governs how tall the mountain can get. If it gets any heavier, it just sinks down into the molten mantle. Therefore the primary factors are the density of the rock, and the geometry of the mountain (ie. whether it is freestanding or part of a large, heavy mountain chain).<br><br>Edit: word</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vmbuford" target="_blank">vmbuford</a>
			<p>Almost: the isostatic limit doesn't cause the mantle to compress (or the mountain to sink more into the mantle), it causes the mountain itself to stop being a solid, and begin flowing out the bottom. The weight of the mountain itself becomes larger than the yield stress (max force you can apply before something breaks down internally), so the mountain starts squishing itself out the sides once it reaches ~10km. </p>		</li>

			<p>To add to this from a geological point of view. The earth has essentially been cooling since the start of earth history. It is therefore believed that the earth's crust is presently more rigid than ever before. Making the possible max height due to isostacy at its greatest. So Everest is likely the tallest ever mountain. </p>		</li>

			<p>I remember reading thirty years ago about scientists being puzzled about the gravitation of mountains being less than expected, all kinds of wild brainstorms were floated, including hollow mountains!

			<p>Technically it also depends on how you measure a mountains height.  Everest is the highest compared to sea level, but the Earth is not round, it bulges at the equator.  So sea level itself is &quot;higher&quot; the closer you get to the equator.  The atmosphere also bulges there.  If you measure from the gravitational center of the earth everest isn't the highest.  Chimborazo is.  <br><br><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimborazo" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimborazo</a><br><br>If you measure from base to peak and don't worry about water being over some of it then a Hawaiian island is.</p>		</li>
