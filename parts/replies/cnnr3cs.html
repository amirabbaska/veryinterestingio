			<p>Depending on how you view it, Mauna Kea could be a contender.  I'm typing this on my phone otherwise I'd include links, but read up on the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain--it's an undersea mountain range that makes up an archipelago in the Pacific (which includes the Hawiian islands).  Obviously most of these mountains are undersea, but Mauna Kea is 10,100 meters from base to peak!!</p>		</li>

			<p>Winds scouring a landmass will load dust, both that resting on the landmass and that it erodes. The bigger the landmass and powerful the wind, the more dust the wind will load (that's a source of &quot;blood rains&quot; and &quot;blood snows&quot; in some countries, wind having loaded reddish dusts from deserts and unloading it with precipitations at higher latitudes, leaves a mess afterwards).<br><br>Because of how sensitive optical observatories are, dust-loaded air will make observations more difficult or impossible. A very remote oceanic location away from continental windpaths will have very little dust cover, increasing optical observation windows.</p>		</li>

			<p>Another huge factor in the placement of the observatories is the tropical temperature inversion, which tends to keep cloud cover well beneath the summit. Air parcels only rise because they are more buoyant than surrounding air. They are more buoyant because they are less dense, and they are less dense because they are warmer and have expanded faster than nearby parcels. Air on the summit is warmer than air downhill, which prevents air parcels from rising as the rising parcels are still more dense than the inversion layer.<br><br>Clear skies almost every day, it stays rather dry around the observatories. This inversion is also what keeps pollution (and dust) out of the air up there. </p>		</li>

			<p>This is a good thought, but not quite right. The water is affecting the mountain, but in the other direction. The mountain sits on the earth's crust, which sits on the gooey semi-liquid mantle. The water, also sits on the earth's crust, which sits on the gooey semi-liquid mantle. <br><br>The water is actually just adding weight to an already compressed crust. It doesn't provide any buoyant force up because it's not the mountain that's being pushed down. It's the crust the mountain and water sit on.<br><br>For an analogy, imagine sitting in a boat floating on the surface of a lake. If you put water into the boat the boat sinks a little. The ocean basin acts like the boat and the mantle underneath the crust acts like the lake water. You put more of anything in the boat (the ocean basin) the crust will have more weight and it'll sink a little.<br><br>For it to have a buoyant force up, the water would need to also surround the crust. <br><br>The Mauna Kea is more spread out than Everest and it doesn't have all the other mountains around it so closely (the Hawaiian islands are spread out mroe than the Himalayans) so it doesn't actually compress the earth's crust as much. I also think the rock is less dense than Everest, making it less heavy by volume, but I can't confirm that right now. </p>		</li>

			<p>Mauna Kea, and all of the Hawaiian islands are formed by the Hawaiian hotspot, and over time the ocean crust moves along towards the subduction zones (towards Asia). You can track the plate movement by looking at underwater topography (anyone can do this, check out Google Earth). The hotspot is also much less dense than anything around it, and acts as a sort of crustal car-jack. </p>		</li>

			<p>That doesn't discount his point though - You've got superheated rock causing expansion from below, but that's offset by the weight of the water it's trying to expand into.  The crust is an upward force (not really buoyant but similar in result to the force he was expecting from the water).   It really shows the massive amount of crust that's expanding in the hotspot when you think about 6KM of vertical water weighing it down without successfully compressing it.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think it's more impressive when volcanics penetrate 2-4 times more rock through continents, whereas the ocean crust is very thin. <br><br>Water doesn't weigh that much in the grand scheme of things when it comes to extruding rock, the energy output is too great. The water would facilitate cooling and chemical composition, and would help it build vertical height faster. On land the lava would spread thinner, over greater distances, as it would take longer to cool. <br><br>Oceanic volcanics differ from continental volcanics in that the viscosity of the partial molten lava is incredibly different. The water present in oceanic volcanics allows the lava to be more fluid, which makes eruptions more recurring, but less damaging. Continental volcanics on the other hand have little water and are very explosive - see Mt St Helens - the difference in viscosity is like the difference between maple syrup and really old, dried out organic peanut butter.<br><br>The crust is NOT an upward force, it actually weighs more than the asthenosphere in which it lies on - this is how plate tectonics can be a thing. The molten rock becomes less dense when its super heated and causes partial melting of the crust, decreasing it's localized density, and causing it to rise further into the crust. If there is sufficient heat, you get a volcano. ONCE THE LAVA COOLS, it becomes as dense/more dense than the crust it just came from, since it is a mix of mantle material and crust material.</p>		</li>

			<p>a little, but probably not much. A mountain can only be so dense, probably about the density of granite. If there's an upper limit to density there's an upper limit to the size of the mountain before it pushes too hard on the magma.<br><br>Another factor than crustal deformation is that the rock under several miles of other rock actually gets hot enough to plastic, meaning it squishes and deforms. So if the mountain is several miles high the rocks at the bottom center are actually kinda mushy anyway. <br><br>The regional crustal deformation will play a factor in how tall the mountain is and crustal deformation is determined by how dense and tall the main mountain is, plus the surrounding mountains.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>The definition of &quot;highest mountain&quot; that makes the most sense to me in this context is &quot;what is the mountain that is the highest from the Earth's center of gravity, accounting for rotation-induced and tidally-induced bulging&quot;.  Mauna Kea definitely doesn't come close to Everest in this accounting because its peak is substantially lower.  Yes, Mauna Kea has the misfortune of having a much lower base, but it's not clear to me why this shouldn't count against it, as the base itself bears weight just like the structure of the mountain, and given that the two are largely even composed of the same materials, does it really make sense to distinguish the mountain as being fundamentally different from the base?  The higher base upon which Everest rests on is itself load-bearing, and structurally counts just as much as the mountain.</p>		</li>

			<p>I guess it depends on how you want to define the base? If you look at a cross section of mt. Everest, it goes FAR below sea level, if you include the crustal material supporting the mountain and not just the arbitrary amount above some elevation chosen to be zero. In that case you have to look at something on the order of 40-60 km (not 100% on that offhand but it's close) of mountain!<br><br>On the other hand, yeah Mauna Kea is something like 11 km high from the ocean floor...but it also only sits on about 7 km of similar material which you could consider a homogeneous base. In that respect Everest in an easy 20 or so km taller than Mauna Kea. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>The point I was trying to make though is you don't have to follow a mountain down 6400ish km to the exact center of the earth to figure out its true height, just as much it seems odd to pick some arbitrary base point at sea level.<br><br>The limiting factor initially stated has to do with isostasy, which is more about the interactions between the Earth's crust and the upper mantle.<br><br>See, the mantle acts as a supper viscous fluid and the crust, well in a way it floats across the surface of the mantle. When you have material of a certain density, it will push down on the mantle. Denser materials push down farther into the mantle more then less dense fluids, which is what you'd expect. Here's a figure to illustrate that point a little more: <a href="http://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/mathyouneed/isostacyhandrho.v2.jpg" target="_blank">http://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/mathyouneed/isostacyhandrho.v2.jpg</a><br><br>In this manner the crust doesn't have on unique depth...it sort of varies depending on the density of the material and the thickness of the material. In the case of Mauna Kea, you have a large structure above the sea floor granted, but you only have a very thin slice of high density crust underneath it (In the figure this could be represented by the purple boxes). In the case of Everest, you have so much above sea level, but you have a huge amount of low density material underneath it (the large pink squares in the figure). You could also think of these bases perhaps as the roots below teeth.<br><br>The reasons for this have to do with properties of buoyancy and the densities are a story that encompasses most of Geology and our theories behind plate tectonics. <br></p>		</li>

The equation above comes from the same sort of derivation as <a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1004/1004.1091.pdf" target="_blank">was used to derive the potato radius</a> for studying elastic limits of materials. <br><br>Edit: <br><br><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt+%28+8848+meters+*+9.81+m%2Fs^2+%2F+%28Gravitational+constant+*+5.51+grams%2Fcc+*+4%2F3*pi%29+%29" target="_blank">So here's the math</a> where that gravitational constant and density are used to calculate surface gravity assuming a sphere with the same density as the earth. <br><br><strong>We get about 240 km for the radius where this happens, which is totally in the 200-300km potato radius given in the paper I cited above!</strong> <br><br>I'm going to go show my friends. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Mars is also largely isostatically locked. There is little if any tectonics on mars there for there would be basically no isostatic response to the load.</p>		</li>

			<p>This was my first thought after reading the top response.  I seem to remember hearing that one of the problems in trying to terraform Mars, is that it doesn't have a liquid core, thus doesn't have a magnetosphere.</p>		</li>

			<p>Correct, the lack of a magnetic field is the primary reason for its loss of atmosphere and thus inability to maintain liquid water.<br><br>From memory I think there was a theory that the cooling of the core was related to the massive bulge on one side of the planet (the side Olympus Mons is on)</p>		</li>

			<p>Venus has lost most or all of it's lighter elements to space and has an atmosphere made up almost entirely of heavier ones like CO2 that aren't as susceptible to solar winds as water vapor or oxygen, that was how they explained it at uni from memory.</p>		</li>

			<p>I've always wondered that about Venus's(es??!?!) atmosphere as to why it was still there and Mars was gone when neither had a strong magnetosphere.<br><br>Also, I'm guessing because Venus is also still pumping out CO2 due to the heat caused from being so close to the sun AND from the greenhouse effect of the CO2 in the atmosphere, right? <br><br>Which replenishes the CO2 atmosphere?</p>		</li>

			<p>Venus does have a magnetosphere but it's just weak compared to earth which is why the lighter elements have gone away. The planet also has some tectonic activity but not like Earth's (from memory it somehow undergoes a total crustal upheaval at intervals rather than our subduction system) so there's enough of a magnetosphere to protect the heavier parts of the atmosphere. The CO2 was partly produced by being baked out of the rocks by the heat (basically reverse carbon sequestering) once the greenhouse effect passed the tipping point and went into overdrive.</p>		</li>

			<p>As terraforming efforts go, putting up a magnetic field on a planet cold enough for dry ice to exist on its surface will likely be one of the easier ones, particularly if high temp superconductors continue to advance.</p>		</li>

			<p>could you assume if a large collection of less dense raw materials were in the same location on the crust it would be able to reach a higher height due to less force due to gravity being applied on the mantle?</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/phunkydroid" target="_blank">phunkydroid</a>
			<p>Yes, assuming that less dense material can support its own weight to that height.  Build it out of weaker material and it may compress itself instead of the crust beneath it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Of course. It could also be ever so slightly taller (probably not even a few millimeters) if it were sitting on the equator, due to centrifugal force and -since the Earth is wider at the equator <em>because</em> of that force- feeling a bit less gravity.</p>		</li>
