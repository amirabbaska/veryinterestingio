What do they do once they reach where they wanted to go?  Do they revolve around the earth in circles? That'd be quite sad :(</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of weeks usually. For a lot of insects, the bug you see is just the stage of their life meant to reproduce.</p>
<p>For instance, june bug larvea spend 11 years underground before they metamorphose into a june bug. The june bug itself only lives for a very short period to reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What will happen with if I take a non-migratory ant and move it 100 miles away from its birthplace? Will this move kill the ant? Will it be able to integrate into a new family?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately this is another layer of &quot;difficult question to answer.&quot; There are so many kinds of ants with so many different behaviour patterns that it can be tough to offer a single, definitive answer. However, most ants fall into three categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ant won't make it. If it finds other ants, a foreign colony won't accept them, especially if they're a different type of ant, and the lost ant will likely be eaten. They may walk in fairly erratic patterns as a stress response, attempting to find a trail home, but odds are they won't find it before nature finds them.</li>
<li>The ant &quot;freezes&quot; and can't continue the behavioural patterns that keep it alive without the colony structure - i.e. being led by pheromone trails to food and shelter, or eating special, ant-processed foods that are only produced in the colony. This really cuts down on incidences of lone-wolf ants that can rough it on their own. This isn't to say that the ant will stand still until it dies (though that's possible), it just can't do what it needs to in order to survive, and neglects its health in favour of what we might recognize as rudimentary panic.</li>
<li>They do find another home. Though incidence isn't well-documented for many types of ant, certain army ants are occasionally &quot;adopted&quot; into new colonies if they're separated, or if one colony's queen dies, leaving the colony orphaned.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't paint a very positive picture for our lost ant buddies. :/</p></div>		</li>

<p>Another example of this is various invasive ant &quot;supercolonies&quot; which can be found across immense distances.  These ants are all very genetically similar, so an individual from one colony will be adopted into another: they are essentially all the same colony.  </p>
<p>They are so farflung because they were moved around accidentally by humans.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'll pretty much wander around randomly looking for its colony until it dies. Migratory ant probably wasn't the best phrase to use. Ants are part of a colony, take them out of the colony and they won't function. They'll just spend their time looking for colony mates, scent trails anything that'll put them back into their routine.</p></div>		</li>
