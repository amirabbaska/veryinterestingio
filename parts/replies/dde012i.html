			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. It's not even close to molecular scale.    Paper is a mesh of microscopic strands of wood fiber.   Think of a woven blanket, but smaller threads.  All scissors is doing is cutting the threads. Nothing happens to the molecules of cellulose that make up the wood fiber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mainly because it's really obvious just by looking at them.  They're not even razor sharp... and razors themselves are obviously blunt absolutely speaking, considering you can't slice through most stuff effortlessly (skin is obviously very frail). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct.  The longer the polymers are, and the stronger the intermolecular non-covalent bonds, the more you will experience intramolecular bond breakage as a consequence of the bulk disruption.</p>
<p>When you cut with scissors, you are pulling apart individual polymers, and along the way many covalent bonds are broken due to this stress.</p>
<p>Although your key point is correct that you're not cutting apart individual covalent bonds at an atomic level.</p></div>		</li>
