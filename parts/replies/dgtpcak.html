			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a better ELI5 is to compare the bands that the radios listen on to radio stations in a car.  The only way to listen to two stations at once: two radios.  And for what the OP's asking, both stations have to be synchronized well enough for the listener to get the same thing at the same time from both stations, so latency couldn't be a thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most data is stateless HTTP though.  The average webpage has dozens of assets to fetch, so it's pretty trivial to use two protocols to do so.  Open 2 - 4 HTTP connections to each server per protocol and pipeline requests in opposite order (e.g. 1.css 2.js 3.jpg over WiFI, 99.jpg 98.gif 97.mp4 over LTE).  For larger files like video you can segment the download, but you'd have to do some benchmarking of throughput/latency &amp; math to figure up how to split the download up.</p>
<p>OTOH, keeping a single TCP connection open over two protocols would be more difficult, and likely require a VPN or a rather sophisticated proxy.</p></div>		</li>
