<p>Thank you very much for taking the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not educated in the fields, but I don't think diluting the pill will have any significant effect. The potassium in foods are not in elemental form, but found in molecules that take time for the digestive system to break apart to free up the potassium before it is absorbed. A bit of extra water doesn't really change how fast the nutrients are absorbed if they are already 'ready to go'.</p></div>		</li>
