			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit again: I'm tired. <em>Both</em> homogeneous and isotropic are used to describe the cosmological principle. That's why I included both. I never said they are the same.<br />
I don't know if you tried to correct me of if you wanted to add a clarification. I should go to bed...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that what I said? Isotropy implies homogeneity, but homogeneity does not imply isotropy. </p>
<p>Edit: I mention this because isotropy COULD be abandoned IF we found out the Universe was toroidal, for example. </p></div>		</li>
