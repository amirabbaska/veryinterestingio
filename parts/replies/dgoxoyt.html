<p>so basically the whole ice ageWas caused by the closing of the Panamanian isthmus?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/how-the-isthmus-of-panama-put-ice-in-the-arctic" target="_blank">http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/how-the-isthmus-of-panama-put-ice-in-the-arctic</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The principal engine of this global circulation, often called the Ocean Conveyor, is the difference in salt content between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Before the Isthmus of Panama existed, Pacific surface waters flowed into the Atlantic. Their waters mixed, roughly balancing the two oceans’ salinity.</p>
<p>About 5 million years ago, the North American, South American, and Caribbean Plates began to converge. The gradual shoaling of the Central American Seaway began to restrict the exchange of water between the Pacific and Atlantic, and their salinities diverged.</p>
<p>Evaporation in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean left ocean waters there saltier and put fresh water vapor into the atmosphere. The Trade Winds carried the water vapor from east to west across the low-lying Isthmus of Panama and deposited fresh water in the Pacific through rainfall. As a result, the Pacific became relatively fresher, while salinity slowly and steadily increased in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>As a result of the Seaway closure, the Gulf Stream intensified. It transported more warm, salty water masses to high northern latitudes, where Arctic winds cooled them until they became dense enough to sink to the ocean floor. The Ocean Conveyor was rolling, drawing even more Gulf Stream waters northward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>snip</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On their journey to the North Pacific, these deep waters became enriched in nutrients and carbon dioxide. In the Subarctic Pacific, these deep waters could have upwelled, rising to the sunlit surface to provide the ingredients to spark enormous blooms of phytoplankton. Great abundances of silica and opal (the preserved material from the phytoplankton shells) in seafloor sediments are evidence of both the blooms and the strong upwelling.</p>
<p>The upwelling may have been so strong, however, that the phytoplankton did not keep pace with the upwelling—that is, more carbon dioxide upwelled than was used by the phytoplankton. Consequently, the excess carbon dioxide “leaked” back into the atmosphere, adding a greenhouse gas that warmed the planet.</p>
<p>What shut down the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period about 2.7 million years ago? And what finally caused Northern Hemispheric glaciation at about the same time—but nearly 2 million years after the Isthmus of Panama formed?</p>
<p>Neal Driscoll and Gerald Haug proposed one solution. They postulated that moisture carried northward by the Gulf Stream was transported by prevailing westerly winds to Eurasia. It fell as rain or snow, eventually depositing more fresh water into the Arctic Ocean—either directly, or via the great Siberian rivers that empty into the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>The added fresh water would have facilitated the formation of sea ice, which would reflect sunlight and heat back into space. It would also act as a barrier blocking heat stored in the ocean from escaping to the atmosphere above the Arctic. Both these phenomena would further cool the high latitudes. In addition, Arctic waters flowing back into the North Atlantic would have become less cold and salty—short-circuiting the efficiency of the Ocean Conveyor belt as a global heat pump to North Atlantic regions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait so in this article it says the azolla event is what created the &quot;icehouse&quot; earth, rather than the earth with palm trees and crocodiles at the poles.</p>
<p>So are you and the geologist guy talking about two different steps? Like this azolla event took us down from dinosaur-level warmth, and then way later the closing of the isthmus took us down to the temperature we're at today?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue raised by the water ferns leads me to a question, should we try to alter current global climate trends by actively doing something or by passively stopping things we do already? </p>
<p>If we take an active role in some modification and the climate changes in unforeseen ways, we would then have to take ownership and blame in events that follow. Kind of like if you break it you bought it. </p>
<p>I realize that we are already affecting climate passively by our actions, but are we as a planet confident in the science and united enough to even undertake such an activity? Would some group be willing or permitted do it unilaterally, given the potential for litigation and/or war?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Decrease?  But plants take in CO2 and release oxygen.  Wouldn't their sinking kill them and then more CO2 would build up because they are dead and rotting and not taking up CO2 any more?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The modern Antarctic ice sheet is also thought to be the result of changes to ocean circulation. Around 34 Ma the Drake and Tasman passages opened, allowing a current all the way around Antarctica to develop. We think that current isolated Antarctica from warm waters, enabling the ice sheet we know today to form. We're not sure of the exact timing (for example, did Drake or Tasman open last?), but the theory is sound. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>saying &quot;the whole ice age&quot; is a bit misleading, because if you look at the Earth's climate over the past 3m years,</del> we have entered and exited glacials and interglacials (where we are now) dozens of times. a <del>&quot;ice age&quot;</del> &quot;glacial&quot; like the last one that occurred ~12kya happens when co2 levels are about 180-190 ppm, and &quot;interglacial&quot; periods occur at about 280-290 ppm co2. it's important to note that there is a significant lag time in climate, and the warming we are seeing today is not even close to reaching a new equilibrium.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interglacials are not &quot;greenhouse&quot; periods. They are just somewhat warmer phases between glaciations during an ice age. We're living an (interglacial period of) ice age right now, even though colloquially the term &quot;ice age&quot; refers to a glaciation period. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>okay thank you</p>
<p>however, it's just interesting to discover how a small thing like the closing of the Panama isthmus created MAJOR climate shifts all over the planet.</p>
<p>I mean, if I'm reading the article correctly from the Woods Hole the only reason parts of North America and northern Europe are even habitable today are because the warm ocean current shifted after the Panamanian isthmus closed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/freeskier10000 I think you and OP are getting terminology a bit confused when I referred to greenhouse and ice house, (my fault I apologise), there have been several periods of each but in ice house climate periods like the one the Earth is in in the present day there are glacial and interglacial periods, right now is an interglacial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does your 'isthmus of Panama&quot; hypothesis fit in with this 2011 study on the pliocene paeoclimate, in which the author states: &quot;However, the reasons for the decrease in atmospheric
CO2 have not yet been determined.&quot; </p>
<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010PA002055/pdf" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010PA002055/pdf</a></p>
<p>Considering their conclusion is that:</p>
<p><em>This trend is consistent with the
suggestion that ocean stratification and iron fertilization increased after 2.7 Ma in the North
Pacific and Southern Ocean and may have led to increased glacial CO2 storage in the
oceanic abyss after 2.7 Ma onward.</em></p>
<p>How does this explain the CO2 reduction prior to 2.7 Ma, e.g the 3.0Ma that OP asked about...?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> lol should I have added that I'm an MSc Geologist to prevent downvotes or am I straight up just not supposed to question seemingly satisfactory answers on here? </p>
<p>Protip: when there's current literature that says &quot;we don't know, but here's one possible mechanism&quot; and someone on Reddit gives a &quot;here's the answer&quot; response, you all should be raising an eyebrow at them too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: in general, how do scientists figure out the atmospheric composition/average temperature of the earth millions of years ago? </p>
<p>This is one of those things that I've always seen the data on but never quite internalized how damn impressive it is that we actually know such information.</p>
<p>Given that you're a geologist I assume it comes from analyzing rocks and finding patterns in their chemical composition - but supposing you've got, say, some samples of limestone, how exactly would you be able to figure out the CO2 levels in the atmosphere from that?</p></div>		</li>
