			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more than that. Basically a good chunk of bugs and issues in software <em>and hardware</em> are called &quot;undefined state&quot;. Basically it means that your computer has gotten the data and code for a situation that was never planned, and acts in an unpredictable, wrong way. Most of these devices are extremely complex and it's impossible to know every state it could be in.</p>
<p>When you unplug it the machine clears out a lot of memory, and then when you plug it back in it starts from the initial state. This is why resetting fixes so many issues: OSes know very well how to work from boot, but there's not as good understanding about what happens when you've run the OS, done 5 patches and ran a few daemons that modify things in weird fashions (and lets not forget your own temporary modifications).</p>
<p>It goes even further though. Remember that I said hardware too? An issue that would happen (not as much nowadays) was issues with capacitors. A capacitor can hold energy in different levels, and these can also be more &quot;state&quot; that can be in unpredictable states. It used to be that cheap capacitors used in electricity, defects on fabrication that lead to faulty connections that only affect once the device has been running for 5 hours, etc. would prevent capacitors from emptying their charge when they should. The solution to this, the ultimate &quot;unplug and replug&quot; is what me and some friends call &quot;full power cycle&quot;.</p>
<p>Unlike a normal power cycle its not just &quot;shut down the machine&quot; but a more elaborate process. I've seen this thing save cheap PSUs, shitty hardware devices, and even a screen once.</p>
<p>The first step is to unplug the device. If it has a power switch leave it on. If it has a battery remove the battery. Next press the power button. Capacitors generally store energy that flows to them from the source, when the computer is off the circuit is broken, when you turn on the computer without a power source the circuit is closed, but with no energy source all the energy leaves the capacitors. You may see some signs of things booting up (rare but larger capacitors may have enough energy to move the fans a bit). Keep the power button pressed for about 30 seconds. If you want to feel extra safe press the power button a few more times. Then put back the battery if there was and re-plug the device. It fixes a huge amount of issues.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How do you apply this to vehicles? My car's flux capacitor is broken and there is no power button.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flux capacitors, as the name imply, hold flux energy in them caused by traveling to the past, travel to the future and it should help release excess energy. If it's truly broken then you're screwed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note that &quot;memory cache&quot; is the wrong word here. You're resetting the main working memory. A cache is a special kind of memory which is usually not the cause of the type of problem described here.</p>
<p>A program that was running on the device made a mistake and went into an error state it can't get out of. By cutting the power, you're resetting the state of that program, which means it will start from a clean and known-good state once power is back up.</p>
<p>This helps if the error state was recorded in a memory type that loses its information when you cut power to it. If the error state is recorded in memory that keeps its information even without power, such as flash or magnetic storage, this procedure will not help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You remind me of the time we had phone issues at work. The IT guy went to the phone server we rented on contract, pulled the plug, and put it back in.</p>
<p>Phone server forgot all settings....</p>
<p>So, the phone problems were caused by a damaged wire to a access-point caused by a contractor who didn't notice or tell. Would have been an easy fix, now the phone company had to fix it. </p></div>		</li>
