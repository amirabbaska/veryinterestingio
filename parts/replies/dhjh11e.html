			<div class="markdown"><p>It is thought that primates gained intelligence to help them find, store, and remember calorie dense foods like fruits, grains, and tubers. With tool using, humans also gained the ability to carry supplies. If you can bring water and some food with you, endurance-killing prey gets way more efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans didn't evolve sweat to disperse heat. All mammals sweat, it's closely linked to the basic definition of being a mammal since mammary glands (which are what the name mammal refers to) are modified sweat glands.</p>
<p>We evolved to sweat <em>more</em> to disperse heat <em>more,</em> which is also non-unique. (For example, horses also do it.) As for why selection would favor sweatiness as a trait over some other means of heat dissipation, it combines well with our relative hairlessness and the other mammalian means of heat dissipation (panting) doesn't work so well with our flat primate faces. (Small mouths.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Conversely, if you don't drink any water but you eat plenty of food with a high water content, like fruit or raw meat or crispy leafy greens, you're not going to die of dehydration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can technically eat raw meat still. Our body just lost the ability to handle the bacteria that makes us sick. Had we never learned to cook our food, we'd probably still be eating raw meat regularly. </p>
<p>Beef tartar is just raw beef. The meat is as clean as it can be, though. </p></div>		</li>
