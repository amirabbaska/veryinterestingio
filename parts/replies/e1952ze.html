While the thyroid is the most susceptible gland to radiation, that's not the only thing you should be worried about in the case of nuclear fallout. You're still going to be breathing in alpha and beta emitters, you're screwed either way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I - 131 (Radioiodine) is a fission product of Uranium and Plutonium. The reason everyone talks about it is because of its effects on the thyroid and the fact that it makes up a significant portion of the decay products of those elements. There are plenty of other nasty decay products from Uranium and Plutonium.</p></div>		</li>

<p>f possible create a positive pressure bubble around you using a fan, filter, plastic tarp, and duct tape to force clean air out and a away rather than allowing dirty air to flow to you. Assuming you survived the initial blast of course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you be a little more specific here? It sounds like you're saying you should encase yourself in a balloon being filled by a fan blowing into it. But I fail to see how this is forcing &quot;clean air out and away&quot; or how this prevents you from breathing radioactive particles.</p>
<p>If you have a scuba tank and you use that as your air supply in your bubble then yes, positive pressure would help keep the bad air out. But I don't see how a fan is supposed to accomplish this, since it has to pull the air from somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got the idea, but that's what the filter is for. You put a HEPA filter over the intake and do your best to make sure that's the only air getting into your space. This way clean air leaks out rather than potentially contaminated air leaking in because your space has the higher pressure. I've heard of people doing this with their cars as well by putting in a larger fan with a HEPA filter over the intake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay but who's got HEPA filters just lying around? If you're gonna buy a HEPA filter for that purpose, it seems like it would make a whole lot more sense to just buy a full face mask with HEPA filter and a plastic suit to keep the radioactive particles of your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Filter the air coming in.</p>
<p>In a pinch even a thin blanket or mattress cover will work better than just having an open air hole, as SOME of the radioactive fallout will get caught.</p>
<p>SO fan blowing outwards to REMOVE air (to prevent stuff coming in via that route) and something to filter the incoming air.</p>
<p>Of course the best way to do this in a hurry is to get to the centre of your house and try to camp in an area with relatively still air, so fallout isn't being pulled by air currents into the general rea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fan blowing filtered air inwards would work better, since if there were small leaks the air flow would go out not in. Positive pressure instead of negative pressure basically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How are you going to power the fan for two weeks.  I'm presuming that in the event of a nuclear blast, electricity is going to be out for a long time and any fan sufficient to move enough air to pull through filters and sustain life is going to need a bit of juice such that batteries will need to be changed every x amount of hours.  Generators are pretty much off the list as gasoline will probably be almost nonexistent other than what is stored.  </p>
<p>Even if you did manage the air quality problem, next on the list is going to be water, and then eventually food.  If you have these things then it's going to be trying to protect them from people who would happily kill you to take them from you, as all emergency services will cease to exist.  </p>
<p>Probably just better to die in the blast.  There are so many things that people take for granted on an everyday basis that will simply stop being a part of life and any little overlooked detail will probably lead to a slow, suffering death.  The vast majority of us simply aren't equipped to survive more than a few days/weeks without the support of society.</p></div>		</li>
