			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s actually more common than people realize, it’s why professional athletes have to get heart checks every year. It’s not the muscle build up on their body it’s the thickness of their heart that does it.  The other problem can be dilation of the chambers from the extra blood being pumped through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have hard numbers here, but you can likely attribute a lot of the heart disease in body builders to steroid abuse.</p>
<p>As for other professional athletes, its well known that endurance athletes (marathon/ultra marathon/iron men) are at an increased risk for cardiac death. These types of sports put too much of a strain on the heart. I'm not sure if we see the same type of risk in professional soccer players, for instance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a question. How can we tell the heart problems bodybuilders have is due to their use of steroids? </p>
<p>Can be the extra, unnatural muscles they carry around all the time is to blame.</p>
<p>As far as i know, there isn't enough research on the effects of PEDs on health due to their banning status.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>cycling I can run my heart near max for 20 to 30 minutes (though if I get too close I get exhausted quickly and have to stop). I don't think soccer players are keeping that sort of steady high heart rate going. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The steroid part in the edit makes me sad cause a good friend of mine used steroids to bodybuild when he was younger and he does have heart problems now.  I wonder how long he really has left...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the adaptations to endurance training is increased vascularization in the muscles. Would particular types of workouts increase vascularization of the heart muscles? </p></div>		</li>
