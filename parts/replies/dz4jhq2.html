			<div class="markdown"><p>They are both a stock photo house and also a photo wire service (like AP photos), who sell access to their news photos. Instead of 1000 magazines and newspapers sending photographers to, say the red carpet of the Ocsars or the unrest in Gaza, media can buy access to Getty’s news images and run those photos. Photographers can either w be hired/assigned to shoot events on Getty’s behalf or sell their images to Getty if Getty wants them.</p></div>		</li>
