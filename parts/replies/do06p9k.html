			<div class="markdown"><p>Well all of material chemistry changes with pressure and temperature right?  And pressure is a frontier, like it's genuinely quite poorly understood science, even if nobody likes to admit that. The thing about pressure is it doesn't really have a good limit. You keep increasing the pressure on ice and you get phase change after phase change. Eventually chemists just nope out, engineers say 'where's the money?' And you're left with physicists who go 'but what's next?'</p>
<p>And then your funding runs out and there's no postdocs in your tiny field and you leave physics with good memories and a bunch of ennui. But I can answer things on Reddit!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there's a cool experiment with something called a D-DAC, look that up on YouTube. Two vibrating diamonds with a tiny drop of water between them. It could vibrate between the phases, made quite a stir a few years ago in the community. You can see the ice phases in that!</p>
<p>But FYI you don't really 'release' the presses quickly like they do in the hydraulic press videos because it can damage the diamonds ( which are super expensive btw) so it's unlikely to be 'seen'. Even if the ice stayed around, its such a small amount it would melt by the time you looked at it, and the diamonds conduct heat really really well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been answering questions here but you're more of an expert than I am, so this one's for you: if you made a large sample of high-pressure ice and rapidly released the pressure and took it out of the chamber (not that this is a good idea), would it instantly revert to liquid, or would you have time to get a good look at it?</p>
<p>This is non-equilibrium thermodynamics which I don't know much about, I'm guessing it would take some time for the latent heat of fusion to flow in to cause melting, but I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a few things here that mess up our common sense. Firstly the word ice makes us think it's cold, and the word melt implies a temperature change, with a latent heat, it sort of messes with your 'thermodynamics' brain too so I'll avoid this. </p>
<p>What this really is is a pressure mediated phase change. On freezing there is actually a small enthalpy change but the overwhelming potential energy is in the pressure difference . Think of a compressed gas releasing but at much higher pressure. I honestly don't think the hydrogen bonds would hold the ice together long enough to see the ice exist, at any timescale. Hydrogen bonding is already pretty weak and it gets weaker with pressure. Ice VI and VII are largely structures that minimise packing density, regardless of bond length.  Now water in particular loves being metastable and existing in environments where it shouldn't, but this is a step too far for the tiny bond.</p>
<p>Ice VI is about 1.4 times the density of water which is an enormous difference to undergo suddenly. Assuming the bonds at least partially hold, there's still going to be some expansion. The outside volume of the ice will be able to expand first, with its outer edge expanding outwards. The expansion at the edges allows the material further in to also expand so there is a wave of expansion from the outer edges inwards as the pressure is released. This is called a release wave or rarefaction wave, and it travels like a shockwave inwards at the speed of sound (which for compressed ice is higher than normal). The material behind the rarefaction is released isentropically, which basically means adiabatically. Because it's potential energy, it's 'negative' so the adiabatic expansion to atmospheric pressure will lower the temperature significantly. </p>
<p>So you have a rapid wave of expansion outwards that in all likelihood occurs molecule by molecule because the bonding just isn't strong enough to maintain 'ice shards'. At the same time there's a huge temperature drop, I estimate around 85 degrees K. In short I reckon it would be an explosion of tiny snowflakes.</p></div>		</li>
