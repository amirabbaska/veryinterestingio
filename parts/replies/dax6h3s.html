			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a situation so-called a nosicomial disease (diseases contracted in a hospital). Staph isn't the only one. Clostridum difficul is a bacteria that is found almost exclusively in hospitals and gives you terrible diarrhea. Ironically it takes off because of the antibiotics for other conditions, to treat you need,  surprisingly... antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the same reason that antibiotic-resistant bacteria, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legionnaires'_disease#Epidemiology" target="_blank">legionella</a>, and many other rare infections from pathogenic organisms are found almost exclusively in hospitals (or on <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2013/09/cdc-meat-industry-yes-you-contribute-antibiotic-resistance" target="_blank">factory farms</a>); in-patient medical facilities are petri dishes filled with the sickest, most immuno-compromised patients, who are treated with the strongest available antibiotics. These pathogens become resistant, then environmentally entrenched in facilities and medical equipment, and are practically impossible to eradicate in that setting.</p></div>		</li>
