			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also what makes surfing in huge waves extra dangerous. Tour guide in Hawaii was telling our group, with the frothy surface, surfers have to hold their breath for a couple minutes if they go down since the surface won't be breathable for at least that long after a big swell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can breathe before a couple minutes after going down. Maybe your instructor was talking about hurricane sized waves. A couple minutes is a very long time to not be able to breathe and people would die all the time if that were the case.</p>
<p>Edit: especially when you are doing a strenuous activity. Try running 100 meters then holding your breath for two minutes and see how that works out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also a theory on why places like the Bermuda Triangle have so many ships disappear.  The theory is that there’s a massive methane vent on the ocean floor.  When a large pocket of gas is released and reaches the surface the density of the water drops so low that boats can no longer float and appear to just vanish. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The surfer can’t breath because of the water in the air after the big wave?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about the technical term, but they do the same thing with swimming pools that are used for really high diving, there's a system of air pipes on the bottom that inject a ton of bubbles right as you're diving so that the surface turns into a froth. It breaks up the surface tension so that you don't splat so hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume he's referring to the albatross. There's an old superstition that it's bad luck to kill an albatross (though wikipedia notes that this is a myth and sailors regularly killed and ate them). The superstition derived from a belief that an albatross was the wandering soul of a dead sailor.</p></div>		</li>
