<p>Also, offspring of tigons have been observed as far back as 1971</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It hasn't happened yet, but experts in the field are optimistic that it is possible.  You definitely can't just say &quot;Two ligers cannot reproduce &quot; as if it were established fact.  Sample size is way too small for that conclusion right now </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Homo sapiens has interbred with at least 2 different homo species:</p>
<p>a) All non-africans have interbred with Neanderthals.</p>
<p>b) Some east-asian/indonesian/papuan populations have interbred with Denisovans (a species only known and described by its DNA, not their fossil record)</p></div>		</li>

<p>We do also have a tooth and a finger bone. So we have SOME fossil record, just staggeringly incomplete. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like 2.5 of non-Africans % but that's quite a large amount. Any admixture event had to take place no sooner than 40,000 years ago. And models have shown that it would only take a small number of events for genes representing beneficial traits to spread through the population. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fertility of hybrid big cat females is well documented across a number of different hybrids. This is in accordance with Haldane's rule: in hybrids of animals whose sex is determined by sex chromosomes, if one sex is absent, rare or sterile, it is the heterogametic sex (the one with two different sex chromosomes e.g. X and Y).</p>
<p>According to Wild Cats of the World (1975) by C. A. W. Guggisberg, ligers and tigons were long thought to be sterile: in 1943, a fifteen-year-old hybrid between a lion and an 'Island' tiger was successfully mated with a lion at the Munich Hellabrunn Zoo. The female cub, though of delicate health, was raised to adulthood.[13]</p>
<p>In September 2012, the Russian Novosibirsk Zoo announced the birth of a &quot;liliger&quot;, which is the offspring of a liger mother and a lion father. The cub was named Kiara.[14]</p></div>		</li>
