<p>I'm imagining that these nanobots would synthesize whichever opiate from substances already found in your body and most people would already have these nanobots in their bloodstream, right?</p>
<p>Imagine if the controller was hacked. You could walk up behind someone, dose them on some opiates, and simply ask them for their wallet.</p>
<p>Or more scary: see a hot chick at the beach? Catch her eye and have your hack-tool dose her with serotonin. Repeat this any time you and her interact. Dose her again when you ask her out and she says yes.</p></div>		</li>
