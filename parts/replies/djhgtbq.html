			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your answer the most because it reaffirms that the classical idea of an atom taught to us from 4th grade is slightly misleading.  To ask about electron behavior requires dumping all of that conceptual framework that makes sense.  I actually have a tattoo of a waveform that I personally visualize to be an electron cloud/area/space, and I got it because it was so profound to learn that atoms are not made of fast moving poke-balls. </p>
<p>I've always wondered why is it that we can't develop a way to teach quantum math to 4th or 5th graders?  Since we're essentially scraping algebra and conventional notation anyways.  End rant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum math requires a pretty in-depth knowledge of differential equations and statistics. Unless a child is a prodigy, they aren't going to be able to learn the pre-requisites by the 4th grade. You could teach quantum <em>intuition</em>, but the intuition ultimately comes from the math, so it isn't as effective. This is what makes quantum physics hard (besides the math), in my opinion: There is no classical analog, so you can't use existing intuition to build up the ideas. You have to walk through the history of observations that led to the models, and you have to show how the models make sense mathematically. That is hard to do at even the college level, let alone primary school. You could probably introduce some of it earlier, say at the high school level, but to get a real understanding you would have to be working with students who were very advanced in math.</p></div>		</li>
