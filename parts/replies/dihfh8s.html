			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a bunch of taxa where males have adaptative strategies to maximize their certainty of being the father of their offspring. These strategies have various degrees of effectiveness and success.</p>
<p>Consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish#Reproduction" target="_blank">Ceratiid Anglerfish</a>, where the male adresses this issue by permanently fusing to the female and becoming a parasitic attachment. In some cases, the fusion is to the extent that their circulatory systems merge, and sperm production is initiated by hormonal signals from the female. Hard to beat, unless two males attach to one female. (Now <em>that</em> would make male #1 question his life choices, if he retained his brain,which he usually doesn't).</p>
<p>A more common strategy is mating plugs, which are extensively used by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/23/5/1140/233860/How-effective-and-persistent-are-fragmentsof-male" target="_blank">spiders</a>, some <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01149.x/full" target="_blank">scorpions</a>, <a href="http://masonlab.science.oregonstate.edu/files/masonlab/Friesen%20et%20al.%202013%20-%20Not%20just%20a%20chastity%20belt.pdf" target="_blank">garter snakes</a>, some <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0031-10492007002000001&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=pt" target="_blank">crickets</a> and <a href="https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-7-28" target="_blank">nematodes</a></p>
<p>One weird one, which might be more of a side effect that an actual strategy, is the joint in-utero systematic incest practiced and highly asymetric sex-ratio of the <a href="http://evilutionarybiologist.blogspot.ca/2007/10/extraordinary-sex-ratios.html" target="_blank">mite <em>Acarophenax tribolii</em></a>. These guys guys are intensely haploid-diploid, and have a strongly skewed sex ratio of one male per brood. The one male inseminates all of his sisters while still in the womb, before they are born. The females are ready to set forth and colonise a world where it is unlikely they will both find a mate and an exploitable resource in their lifetimes, so it sort of makes sense that way....</p>
<p>Other strategies notably include <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/aez/36/1/36_1_41/_pdf" target="_blank">postcopulatory guarding</a> and <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/284758?journalCode=an" target="_blank">infanticide</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a cool area of research. Some animals remove semen from previous males; there is the &quot;swamping&quot; (i don't remember the correct term&quot; technique used by right whales who basically surround the female in a sea of sperm (you can see it from a helicopter). Male salmon guard the eggs to prevent &quot;fertilization interlopers&quot; (b/c <em>external</em> fertilization); this has led to two disparate mating strategies in males: Big, aggressive defenders, who can protect more eggs; and small, sneaky males that dart in, fertilize on the sly, and escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun breeder is Cuttlefish. In some species the males will hold a harem of females and chase off/kill other males. Some other males will hide their tentacles and attempt to appear female so that they can sneak past the male in charge and mate with the females. Interestingly, female cuttlefish have the ability to choose and prioritize which sperm fertilizes their eggs and seem to give preference towards the sneaky males over the aggressive ones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the other great apes, for one. Female chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos all have <em>very</em> obvious <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DaTtukUnew0/T4_EX2b3W8I/AAAAAAAAABk/grIDo7gOQfo/s1600/bonobo_full_estrus.JPG" target="_blank">sexual swellings</a> when they're in their fertile period (oestrus). This means that males only have to guard females for the few days they're in oestrus to ensure fidelity. Silverback gorillas do so religiously, preventing any other males from mating with females in their troop (although instances of infidelity have been recorded). They also frequently kill the offspring of the old silverback when they take over a troop. Alpha male chimpanzees aren't so tyrannical, but they typically prevent other males from having sex with females when they're in oestrus. Bonobos, interestingly, have an extended oestrus that lasts several weeks, so that it no longer reliably signals fertility. This means its no longer practical to ensure fidelity and so enables them to use sex extensively to reinforce social bonds; a mirror to the evolutionary path taken by humans with hidden oestrus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some female primates can also enduce a false estrus in order to create paternity confusion. Basically, faking fertility and mating with multiple males so that the males are unsure of who fathered the offspring she is already pregnant with. This is done so that none of the males kill the offspring because they all think they fathered it. Male primates will sometimes commit infanticide when they want to mate with the mother, because females are not fertile when nursing a baby so the quickest way to get her to be fertile again is by killing her offspring. False estrus/paternity confusion is an incredible adaptive strategy for females to protect their offspring, especially considering what a huge time and energy investment pregnancy is for female primates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess you have generalized too much here. There are birds who mate for life. Parrots for example. Also science still didn't figure out how the psyche of humans work, leave alone other animals. So it is wrong to say animals do not feel hurt, or just do it for procreation. There are many cases where monogamous animals refuse to pair with another one after death of its mate. </p></div>		</li>

<p>While it may have the side effect of concealing the actual cycle, I'd suggest that the real purpose is to enhance attraction by trying to display the ovulation signal all the time.  </p></div>		</li>
