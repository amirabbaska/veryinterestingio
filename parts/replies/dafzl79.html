			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, however, I wonder where the fault lies in being able to prove this..... I'll try and let me know where I make the incorrect assumption:</p>
<p><em>edit and putting the edit on top because you guys don't read the full post:  oh I realized a place where I went wrong and why this is so complicated. we have to look at even/odd as 1s/2s
but also define 4s and 8s and 16s etc using powers of 2. This solution needs &quot;n&quot;s in it but I am confident it can be done eventually.</em></p>
<p>If you multiply an odd number by an even number, you get an even number always because it is a multiple of the even number you multiplied by.</p>
<p>And if you add an odd number to an even number it will always be odd because odd/even is always reset at an even number as if it was zero. This does not need to be proven and can be a &quot;given&quot; as it is basic logic.</p>
<p>Next, if you multiply an odd number by an odd number, you are essentially multiplying it by the even number 1 less than the odd number (which has an even result, resetting the even/odd counter as described above) and then adding an odd (the original multiplier) number to it once again, which will always result in an odd number. But then you add 1 to it per the rule, and adding 1 to an odd number results in an even number, because every other number is odd/even/odd, etc (another given assumption)</p>
<p>So when the original number is odd, you will indefinitely end up with an even number which you divide by two. If you divide it by two (per the rule) and keep doing so until it's not divisible by two any longer, then the last number you divided by 2 was not divisible by four. Also, the number you landed on, if divided by 4, will always have a remainder of 1 (this is where i went wrong) because if the remainder was 2+ your dividing by 2 would have resulted in a different answer since you can't have a remainder equal to or greater than the divisor (rule of math).  </p>
<p>So if the number you landed on is odd (can't be further divided by 2) and has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, then multiplying it by 3 means the resulting number when divided by 4 would have a remainder of 3, but the rule also states to then add 1, which would mean it is then divisible by 4, meaning it is divisible by 2 twice. And if it is divisible by 2 twice it will be 25% of itself, but the number that you multiplied to get there was 1/3 of 1 less, so 25% is lower. So the number you end up with keeps being lower than before until it eventually reaches 1 which we know by testing will always end up resulting in 1&gt;4&gt;2&gt;1&gt;4&gt;2&gt;1 etc. </p>
<p>Now, where did I go wrong? see edit above if you missed it</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is wrong isn't it? The remainder could also be three since three is not divisible by two either </p></div>		</li>

<p>Minor qualm, this isn't &quot;basic logic&quot; it is still a rigorous mathematical notion that one would prove (albeit not with much difficulty) in one's early career as a mathematics student in a number theory or algebra course.</p>
<p>It may be <em>simple</em>, but it is by no means tautological.</p></div>		</li>
