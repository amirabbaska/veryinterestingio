			<p>Dude, you're throwing out a lot of terms with loose connections. If I heard this from someone's mouth, word for word, I would envision it coming from a homeless dude promoting marxism. <br><br>And that's fine. This is your view of the world. But you're not addressing the question. How does this apply to the problem proposed by the OP?</p>		</li>

			<p>I stand behind every word I assure you (and there is very little Marxist about it).  <br><br>If the implication was not clear enough let me spell it out.<br><br>And unbalanced market promotes economic disparity between economic classes. Once upon a time the lower and middle classes were more equal to the higher classes because they had the tools to acquire their fair share of the wealth created by the market.<br><br>Having less power to do so the worker class is losing the competition with the Investor class. More for one equals less for the other. This is why salaries have not been kept up to date with inflation, while corporate profits have skyrocketed by comparison.     </p>		</li>

			<p>No, you're telling fairy tales. You're not giving examples. You're not SHOWING how things were. If I were from another planet, I would have no idea what time frame you're talking about. <br><br>You don't have examples. You don't have evidence. You are just stringing together buzzwords. </p>		</li>

			<p>Feel free to ask if there is anything you find hard to follow, I would be glad to provide examples.<br><br><a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/census/household-income.html?household-incomes-mean-nominal.gif" target="_blank">Like this measure of Mean Household income between 1965 and 2013</a><br><br>The black stapled line represents the top 5% of household incomes in the US, in other words the very rich. This is what happens when one part of the market is allowed to run roughshot over the rest of the markets actors.<br><br>While it is perfectly reasonable to assume the Growth in wealth happens to the rich first one would hope that the growth curve remains relatively even over the years. This has NOT been the case, as you can see the wealthy take a step upward swing and leave the rest behind aggressively. Specially over the past 30 years.</p>		</li>

			<p>You...don't even know what to do with that information, do you? That's <em>one</em> metric that can be used in <em>THOUSANDS</em> of different studies that encompass <em>that</em> metric, yet you see it as the be-all-end-all of your argument. <br><br>To put it in the most understandable terms: <em>this is one variable that can be used on any graph that requires this variable</em>. This is not a proof of <em>anything</em>. This is standalone data. I mean, I could put up a graph of the frequency of thrusts of various monkeys pumping their dongs into a dead frog's throat. But that doesn't tell me how hot that sort of shit is for a monkey. It just tells me how fast they do it. Maybe it varies by age, I don't know, I'm not a fucking monkey throat-fucking a frog.<br><br>In order to <em>prove</em> something, you need to correlate this data with <em>other</em> data, AND you need to show that there is a <em>correlation</em> with the first data with the <em>other</em> data. <br><br>You gave me a graph. You did not tell me what affected the datapoints of that graph or when. You see rich people got richer, came up with your own version of why, and purport it for fact. Fine. <br><br>Dude, personally, I think you're full of shit. I think you're some high-school senior or, possibly college freshmen or sophmore that's taken either an entry-level poli-sci course, or you're an early-declared philosophy major. I don't care. You've made an elaborate ad-hoc argument, then presented a graph that has no <em>specific</em> relation to any measurement of causality in this conversation.<br><br>I think you're full of shit. <br><br>Anyway, I'm going to bed. Goodnight, and good luck.<br><br>Edit: Monkey-frog throat-fucking.</p>		</li>

			<p>As I said, if you have any questions feel free to ask, Ad Hominem attacks are useless on me I assure you. (But nice try)<br><br>Also, I must remind this is an ELI5 thread, so the explanations are supposed to be simple and straightforward.</p>		</li>

			<p>...and they're supposed to explain things. Just a tip.<br><br>Edit: Ad Hominem only applies if I'm solely attacking your character. Or, rather, if the target of my <em>attack</em> is your character. Your substance of argument is a textbook example of ad hoc, braj.</p>		</li>

			<p>From Wikipedia:<br><br>&gt;An ad hominem (Latin for &quot;to the man&quot; or &quot;to the person&quot;[1]), short for argumentum ad hominem, means responding to arguments by attacking a person's character, rather than to the content of their arguments.<br><br>From your previous comment:<br><br>&gt;Dude, personally, I think you're full of shit. I think you're some high-school senior or, possibly college freshmen or sophmore that's taken either an entry-level poli-sci course, or you're an early-declared philosophy major.<br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>An editorial corollary to my comment. The substance was that the evidence you provided was entirely bullshit and ad hoc. <br><br>Bish, Pls.<br><br>Edit: I got some crazy straws, if you wanna grasp at those, too :P<br><br>Double-Edit: First Edit was an &quot;Ad Hominem&quot;, bro.</p>		</li>
