<p>Everything in an HDD is digital:</p>
<ul>
<li>cable interface</li>
<li>logic controller</li>
<li>data cache</li>
<li>step drive motor</li>
<li>magnetic discrete recording</li>
</ul>
<p>Please recheck your definition of &quot;analog&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that user was probably confused by the fact that an hdd platter is a magnetic disc with the data physically encoded onto it with motors and a magnet. But the data is physically stored as 1's and 0's unlike a record where the bumps actually correlate to the soundwave (actually analog).</p>
<p>Meanwhile an ssd is purely solid-state and has no moving parts. Typically that translates into efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're being pedantic, you're correct on the unit symbol according to the IEEE, but it's still correct to the write &quot;byte&quot; with a lowercase B :)</p>
<p>There's no real reason for a byte to be 8 bits, but it does fit in nicely with character encoding, as each letter is one byte.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual amount of storage is probably 128, 256, 512, 1024. However, some is spare capacity for wear levelling and replacing defects, some is needed for information for managing wear levelling, and probably a bit of it is defective and unused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably part marketing (rounded numbers seem nicer), and part cost savings. As I mentioned in another post, Samsung's 120/250/500GB SSDs really DO have lower capacity than 128/256/512GB SSDs from competitors, roughly the 7/6/11GB lower, respectively.<br />
It could be because they use significantly different firmwares/controllers, which contribute to their performance;  </p>
<p>Or it could be because they have allocated more chips to back-up, such that they'll take over when another chip has failed, (but don't quote me on this because I've no evidence or references for those Samsung SDDs);  </p>
<p>Or they could simply have looser production tolerances, so that defective chips can still be shipped.  </p>
<p>Bottom line is, don't assume 480/500/512GB drives are actually equivalent in capacity; same is true for such scenarios in other capacities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Very true. I worked on a manufacturing issue when our product builders noticed smaller free space available in the systems we set up. I then realized our supplier switched parts on us from 120gb (Samsung 840 Evo) to 128gb (Samsung 850 Pro) parts.</p></div>		</li>
