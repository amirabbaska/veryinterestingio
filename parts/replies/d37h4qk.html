			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is true that rigorous research on cannabinoid use is limited due to its scheduling, there are peer reviewed studies that number in the hundreds on the potential uses and adverse effects of marijuana, coherent overview or meta-analysis of these studies provides some consensus on likely effects of the drug.</p>
<p><strong>The plausible beneficial effects of medical marijuana include:</strong> improvement of chronic pain, reduced nausea and vomiting, reduced spasticity, improvements in glaucoma, treatment for epilepsy.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of improving pain, nausea, vomiting:</strong>
This useful <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com.ezproxyhost.library.tmc.edu/article.aspx?articleid=2338251" target="_blank">JAMA</a> meta-analysis notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compared with placebo, cannabinoids were associated with a greater average number of patients showing: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complete nausea and vomiting response (47% vs 20%; odds ratio [OR], 3.82 [95% CI, 1.55-9.42]; <strong>3 trials</strong>)</p>
<p>Reduction in pain (37% vs 31%; OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.99-2.00]; <strong>8 trials</strong>)</p>
<p>Greater average reduction in numerical rating scale pain assessment (on a 0-10-point scale; weighted mean difference [WMD], −0.46 [95% CI, −0.80 to −0.11]; <strong>6 trials</strong>)</p>
<p>Reduction in the Ashworth spasticity scale (WMD, −0.12 [95% CI, −0.24 to 0.01]; <strong>5 trials</strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Treatment of chronic pain, improvements in nausea and vomiting, and increased appetite are moderately well documented uses of medical marijuana.  This penumbra of health benefits makes medical marijuana symptomatically useful in the treatment of HIV/AIDS wasting disease, chemotherapy response, multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain, though other treatments are also available. </p>
<p>Other proposed uses of medical marijuana include treatment for glaucoma and treatment for epilepsy. </p>
<p>Medical marijuana can reduce intra-ocular pressure in humans associated with <strong>glaucoma</strong>, but other medical treatments are likely superior. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7053160" target="_blank">(1)</a><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15823551" target="_blank">(2)</a></p>
<p><strong>Currently knowledge of marijuana use in epilepsy</strong> is limited to small surveys in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24237632" target="_blank">humans</a> and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.12321/abstract" target="_blank">mice</a>.  However <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=%22sativex%22+AND+%22epilepsy%22&amp;Search=Search" target="_blank">phase III clinical trials</a> are underway further exploring the potential for cannabinoids to treat this condition (and many others).</p>
<p><strong>Marijuana does have well documented adverse effects and is not a completely benign drug.</strong>  A recent <a href="http://www.nejm.org.ezproxyhost.library.tmc.edu/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra1402309" target="_blank">New England Journal review</a> discusses documented adverse effects and associations.  The most serious adverse effect of marijuana occurs in the developing brain and is associated with <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/47/16913.full.pdf" target="_blank">dampened neural connections</a> as well as sensitization of the limbic system to drug use (i.e. MJ effect as a gateway drug is both physical as well as social).  Marijuana also creates severe short term memory impairment, though these effects are not permanent.  These adverse effects are correlatively linked to mental illness and reduced lifetime satisfaction/achievement.  </p>
<p>Marijuana is not strongly linked to increased risk of cancer at this time, and is not likely to be as potent a carcinogen as tobacco.  Inhaled marijuana does cause inflammation of the airways which can lead to chronic bronchitis.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR/ELI5:</strong> There is clear, published, evidence for the beneficial effects of medical marijuana for the treatment of chronic pain, nausea, vomiting, and combating appetite suppression.  Studies are underway to determine efficacy in epilepsy as well after promising preliminary surveys.  Despite its documented medical uses marijuana, like many other medications, does have adverse effects that are also well described.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Since this comment has some traction I'd like to provide some anecdotal evidence to hammer in the point that the medical benefits of cannabinoid receptor agonists aren't just academic.  <strong>In clinic, <em>in Texas</em>, today we prescribed a patient synthetic THC (Marinol) to treat nausea, vomiting, and poor appetite.</strong>  There are definitely therapeutic substances in the marijuana plant, its just combustion may not be the safest, purest, or most efficacious route of administration.</p>
<p>I think the lung questions are answered below, but here are some citations.  Again, smoking in general <a href="http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201212-127FR?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&amp;#.VzpH6GQrJp8" target="_blank">is bad for your lungs</a>.  For whatever reason <a href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17035389" target="_blank">smoking MJ versus tobacco doesn't seem to be as strongly associated with cancer</a>, at least within the confines of current research.  This latter point surprised me and I only learned it today.  There are more papers on this topic that I am not citing.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Agonists, not antagonists.  Since some people are less than smitten with the spasticity and pain confidence intervals, here are three additional studies on spasticity, including two randomized trials <a href="http://www.fasebj.org/content/15/2/300.short" target="_blank">(1)</a><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17355549" target="_blank">(2)</a><a href="http://www.neurology.org/content/65/6/812.short" target="_blank">(3)</a> and one <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2338266" target="_blank">2015 review</a> on cannabinoids and the treatment of chronic pain which notes significant decrease in chronic pain in 4/4 randomized trials vs placebo and in neuropathic pain in 5/5 randomized trials vs placebo.  Again there is much more research on this subject than I have cited in this relatively concise survey.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> Thank you.  I will continue to occasionally research interesting science and medicine questions posted on reddit to the best of my ability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but, anecdotally, after an extremely painful recovery from a surgery, I found that it didnt so much reduce the pain as it made it more possible for me to ignore it. I preferred that to taking opiates, because it meant that I did something I shouodnt physically, I got immediate feedback on that. With opiates not so much. If I thought about the pain, it was about the same or maybe a little less. The beauty of it was in being aboe to ignore it. Meaning that oerhaps they were asking the wrong question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also disparate studies covering a range of different diseases.  I'm inclined to believe cannabinoids can improve certain types of pain but more studies and, most importantly, head-to-head studies against the standard of care are clearly warranted.  For the question at hand I focused on plausible medical benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know specifically about this finding but I think it's always important for studies to report the % of patients who had a pre-defined benefit.  For example, the median change in pain could be 0.5 but if 30% of people in the cannabis group had a 50% reduction in pain whereas only 5% of the placebo group had a 50% reduction, it could be clinically meaningful.  A number needed to treat of 4 is pretty good.  Usually that would come with a difference in overall pain scores but not always. Not saying that's what happened here, but many studies using scales seem to leave out this type of detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can comment on this:</p>
<p>These citations collectively will prove the statement I am about to make. There is more tar in cannabis than nicotine, probably because you are burning different parts of the plants. A bowl may have as much tar as many cigarettes. However, there is some protective quality of cannabis which results in there being no correlation whatsoever between cannabis use and increased risk of cancer. There is a STRONG correlation between smoking cigarettes and risk of lung cancer that is exponential (meaning if you smoke like &lt; pack a month, your chances may be increased by 2 times, but if you smoke more like 10+ cigarettes per day your chances would be increased by 23 times). </p>
<p>There is no reason to associate marijuana use with lung cancer, and scientists are not exactly sure why.</p>
<p>Now, nicotine actually makes tar MORE carcinogenic, so smoking weed while smoking nicotine will increase your risk for lung cancer, despite the cancer-fighting properties found in cannabis which ordinarily protect you.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. MjA vs other medications is a good question for if a doctor should prescribe it, but the bar for rescheduling/legalization should be &quot;does it have <em>possible</em> medical uses?&quot;. If MjA outperforms a placebo, that is evidence that it has possible medical uses and should be sufficient to at least allow further study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the scheduling. When a clinical trial is run on a traditional drug, it is easy to control the dose. With marijuana (as opposed to a THC- or cannabinoid-based pill, oil, injection, etc), the dose is impossible to control because the amount of active ingredient in any particular leaf is not known. </p>
<p>This is why the FDA has never approved <em>any plant</em> as a medical treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really an obstacle with cannabis research. It's possible to distill individual cannabinoids to 100% purity and research them individually or in concert. See <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/gw-pharmaceuticals-gets-positive-result-for-cannabis-based-epilepsy-drug-1457959506" target="_blank">Epidiolex</a>.</p>
<p>It's also possible to test for concentration in the raw plant.</p>
<p>The hurdles are almost entirely scheduling/governmental blocks. Until last year there was an <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2015/06/obama-administration-removes-crucial-barrier-marijuana-research" target="_blank">extra hurdle</a> cannabis studies had to undergo even compared to other schedule 1 drugs, and even now if you want to do an FDA-approved whole-plant study in the U.S. you need to requisition material from the NIDA facility at the U of Mississippi.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That doesn't preclude research. The FDA just <a href="http://www.maps.org/news/media/6141-press-release-dea-approves-first-ever-trial-of-medical-marijuana-for-ptsd-in-veterans" target="_blank">approved a study</a> using whole-plant cannabis as a treatment for PTSD.</p>

<p>This isn't true in any sense of the word &quot;living&quot;, it is a product of a living thing. You can also synthesize THC without any usage of the plant, and I believe that it is done already.</p>
<p>The fact that it has the same effect as the same concentration of THC as a specified purity of oil seems to have been lost upon the DEA. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is one aspect of their work that we can all get behind, I feel: moving cannabis out of Schedule I. For a drug to be on that list, it has to fit 3 criteria, and all 3 of them should be objectively proven:</p>
<ul>
<li>High potential for abuse</li>
<li>No currently accepted medical use</li>
<li>Lack of accepted safety, even for use under medical supervision</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, &quot;high potential for abuse&quot; means higher than Schedule III. Schedule II drugs can be on par with the abuse potential for Schedule I drugs, but they are considered to have <em>some</em> accepted medical use. However, by current scheduling, Schedule I drugs should have higher potential for abuse than anabolic steroids (III), ketamine (III), Xanax (IV), Valium (IV), Rohypnol (IV), and codeine cough syrup (V).</p>
<p>Then consider medical use. If methamphetamine, cocaine, and PCP can all be Schedule II drugs because they have <em>some</em> accepted use in modern medicine, it's absurd to assert that cannabis does not.</p>
<p>Lastly, to assert that cannabis lacks &quot;accepted safety&quot; among the medical community is a bad joke at best. There has never been a single recorded death by cannabis overdose, addiction to cannabis can be relatively easy broken (with a <em>much</em> easier recovery than legal drugs like alcohol), and if it was implemented by a doctor, not a soul could argue that they'd have to do anything special to keep them safe (besides provide the patient with munchies, clearly).</p>
<p>If you can be as arbitrary as you want with the different criteria for drug scheduling in this country, then the whole system is meaningless (not to mention profit driven). It's in everyone's best interest that every drug on that list is scheduled properly, with scientific data to back it up.</p></div>		</li>
