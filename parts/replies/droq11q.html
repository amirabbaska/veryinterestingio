<p>Interesting that neurogenesis has been hypothesized as a cure for depression. SSRI's increase seratonin but also lead to neurogenesis. So do certain psychedelics with beneficial effects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Antidepressants increase levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, but they also increase neurogenesis, the birth of new cells in the brain. Throughout your life, you will grow new neurons in an area of the brain called the hippocampus. And if you take antidepressants for several weeks, you will get increased neurogenesis.</p>
<p>These new neurons correspond to changes in animal behaviours that are associated with long-term antidepressant treatment. The behaviours are novelty-induced hypophagia, which measures how much of a tasty food an animal will eat in a novel environment and reflects aspects of anxiety and anhedonia (the inability to experience pleasure); and the tail suspension test, which measures behavioural despair.</p>
<p>Animals show improvement in both of these tests (eating more, or moving more) after long-term treatment with antidepressants, and these improvements correlate with neurogenesis in the brain.</p>
