			<div class="markdown"><p>A wild bird used to play with my cat and prank him. Whenever he was in the tree he would be sort of wedged in the crook between two sides of the V, and couldn't turn around easily. The bird would swoop in and peck his tail. The cat would try to turn around to face the bird. By the time he finished, the bird would swoop in and peck the other side. Rinse and repeat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I witnessed a mob of wild white cockatoos feeding on grass in some grass, i saw a grounded cockatoo intentionally get in the way of a landing one at the last minute for what i can only assume a bit of horse play, the landing one had to do a fly over and came back down later. They had a bit of a rabble but in the end, all in good fun, squawks had by all and a bit of grass seed too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was little we had a Hill Myna who liked to divebomb the cat as he liked to sleep on top of the dinner table (which was a tabletop over an always-warmed billiards table). He'd swoop down until he flew about an inch over the cat's head, shouting &quot;PUSS PUSS MEOW!&quot; and then pull up, wait for the cat to settle back down and do it again.</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>Eventually the cat learned to just swat him out of the air whenever he did that and he stopped doing it, but it was hilarious while it lasted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How did your bird learn to say &quot;PUSS PUSS MEOW!&quot;?  </p>
<p>And why are billiards tables always warm?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Birds often do the latter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's definitely fun. Humor is the joy of overcoming a threat. So a joke or prank is basically setting up a false threat and then laughing about it or enjoying that you or another overcame it.  </p>
<p>The way it evolved was probably something like this: an animal got away from a predator and felt joy, an animal was surprised or startled by a friend and felt joy when he realized it was not a real threat, and then finally, an animal sought to create a false threat for joy (the prank was born).  </p>
<p>e.g. They're clearly having fun <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sbdy23k.gifv" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://giant.gfycat.com/SparseFeistyBagworm.webm" target="_blank">here</a>. edit: If they were not playing and having fun they would fight or run away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be argued that the concept of fun itself is a survival instinct. If you enjoy your survival and combat games, you will enjoy the hunt or at least be better suited for it. The brain rewards itself for low risk practice of real situations.</p>
<p>This could be as simple as pattern recognition, which many of our games are based on. If you can spot patterns and feel good about it, youâ€™ll be better at picking berries while avoiding poisonous ones.</p></div>		</li>
