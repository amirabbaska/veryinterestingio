<p>Another way to think about it -- we don't see reptiles like alligators using their front limbs to feed themselves or do much of anything besides locomote.</p>

<p>I think a better modern comparison would be to a chicken.  We don't see them using their wings for much of anything much of the time (though they can use them for some lift and to slow their descent when falling).  Given that they are probably more closely related to T-Rex than an alligator it's a fair comparison.  </p>
<p>The early portrayals of T-rex as upright with little hands led to this confusion IMO.  Portraying T-rex as &quot;hunched over&quot; with a straight tail for counterbalance makes the little almost vestigal hands seem less weird.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I now have an image of them bobbing the head/upper body in a similar fashion, like that chicken, burned into my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you mean but it is not a completely apt comparison. Chickens, especially wild ones, can fly with those wings and even if a bird like a penguin or ostrich doesnâ€™t fly, those wings were originally evolutionarily repurposed for flight long ago. They are not vestigial in the way the theorized short T. rex arms were. Even domestic chickens can fly enough to get to a high roost for safety or to hurdle obstacles in search of food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many dinosaurs had wings and claws on the same limb, including all of the early birds, and a few modern ones, including the ostrich and emu.  Basically everything more closely related to birds than to <em>T. rex</em> seems to have had wings, and most of them also had claws on the same limb.</p>
<p>Of course, not all wings are for flying.  Most of them aren't, actually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they'd most likely be vestigial wings for display purposes. They weren't even close to big enough to support any kind of flight. Could be like with modern whales - they have tiny little nubs where their back legs used to be, leftover from their land ancestors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are more onto the correct path with them being vestigial limbs from when the T-Rex ancestors walked on four legs. Most likely evolution started favouring them walking on two limbs(upright) so then the front legs just kept getting smaller.</p></div>		</li>
