			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot more similarities between the design of windows and linux than you are suggesting here.</p>
<p>Windows is not &quot;tightly&quot; integrated with its GUI. Quite far from it, the kernel is very independent of the GUI and several versions of Windows are designed to be headless. The reason no such open source GUI overhaul exists is because Microsoft has no interest in opening that aspect up to the public. </p>
<p>Windows is composed of many subsystems and components just like Linux. Just look at the .net framework. Pretty much any popular library you see in the Linux world has an equivalent development in Windows. The difference is the vast majority of it is developed by Microsoft instead of the wider community that is the case for Linux.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a simple example, most Linux programs rely on OpenSSL to do encrypted communication over the internet. This capability is provided in Windows by a subsystem developed and maintained by Microsoft. This subsystem is made available for developers through the .net framework.</p>
<p>.net tries to do more than just provide some libraries since it guides how programs are written as well (It draws on a lot of ideas that underpin Java and the Java Virtual Machine). Perhaps a better example I should have gone for is the Windows subsystem for Linux. This is a subsystem in Windows lets a Linux program run in Windows by translating that previously mentioned OpenSSL dependency into the Windows equivalent.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I wish. Microsoft's idea of headless is a blank desktop with a command prompt window.</p></div>		</li>
