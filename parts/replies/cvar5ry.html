			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny that the only actual correct answer to this question is so far down.  Unfortunately, it also contains, I believe, a gross factual error. I'm pretty sure the FDA instituted the program in June of 2006 under GW Bush. But, hell, everyone likes to blame Obama for everything anyway.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It goes back all the way to 1962, but the Obama administration has been much more aggressive in enforcing this decades old law than any of his predecessors.  Here's a summary of the history:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1962  Senators Kefauver and Harris decide that the Food and Drug Administration needs to ensure that drugs used, even for centuries, must be tested for safety and efficacy.  President John F. Kennedy signs the bill.</p>
<p>1972  Chancellor P.R. Lee of the University of California at San Francisco summarizes this in his book, &quot;Pills, Profits, and Politics&quot;.</p>
<p>2005  Senator Hillary Clinton, along with the Democratic majority in the Senate that year, says that the Bush Administration needs to appoint a FDA Commissioner who can carry out Senators Kefauver's and Harris' stipulations.</p>
<p>2015  FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, an Obama nominee confirmed by the Senate, has had great &quot;success&quot; with carrying out the Kefauver-Harris Amendment provisions.  Drug companies are increasing prices on drugs long used, even for centuries, because they are now complying with the long ignored 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boy. I wonder what kind of site you got this from that it specifically calls out Obama, Clinton(note that in 2005, the Republicans had the Senate majority so it can't even get basic facts right), and Kennedy. Surely unbiased and with no political leaning at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A company does has exclusive rights to a drug for a time period after FDA approval (think of this as a brand name drug). After a certain time period has lapsed (7 to 10 years I think), other companies can make &quot;generics&quot; of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referring to,the ophthalmic solution.  I'm not sure if the oral Phenylephrine has been rebranded yet.  If it has, once the existing supply runs out, look for the price to sky rocket as well.</p></div>		</li>
