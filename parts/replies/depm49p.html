			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this done in human medicine too? Someone I know who had an abscess had it just packed with sterile gauze, I think. Packing it with antibiotics seems to make more sense to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibiotics are expensive and limited because they must work inside the human body without killing the person. When it comes to packing a drained external abscess, there's no reason to use antibiotics as opposed to an antiseptic. I've seen open wounds from amputations washed with a weak bleach solution and wounds treated with an iodine solution. The reason abscesses are packed, by the way, is to make sure that the wound heals from the inside out. Otherwise, the surface of the wound may seal up while the inside is still not healed, which would trap contaminants. </p></div>		</li>
