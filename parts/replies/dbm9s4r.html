			<div class="markdown"><p>A bit further... about 90% of corporations in the US are structured this way. Either partnership, a mom and pop store, or a medium sized firm with a small handful of investors. Corporate income tax is the exception, not the rule, for most companies.</p>
<p>Large companies with shareholders do have to pay corporate income tax because it's too complicated to go after thousands of investors with the pass thru rules. But if you think about it, that makes no sense. They should simply tax dividends like income instead of making companies pay income tax... taxing dividends would generate more revenue, simply the tax code, and not hurt the middle class at all. But it's a bit of a political hot potato to suggest this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, when you referred to &quot;corporations,&quot; you really meant &quot;business entities.&quot;  A corporation is one specific kind of business entity. Other kinds include LLCs and partnerships. </p></div>		</li>
