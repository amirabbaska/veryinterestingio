			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much what happens whenever you become aware of an issue your body is experiencing internally. The moment your brain focuses on anything (i.e. Itchiness, pain, fatigue, strain, etc.) your brain now has involuntary attention to the area of your body. At this point your brain is now receiving all of the signals from the nerves and/or organs and proceeds to take appropriate action.</p></div>		</li>
