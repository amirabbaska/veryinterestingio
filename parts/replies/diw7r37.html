			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation! Is it possible to have emotional connections with all of your senses? I feel like a lot of emotions when I read books or look at paintings, and the other day I cried because I thought a candle smelled super nice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia" target="_blank">&quot;qualia.&quot;</a> It's a philosophical term for exactly this. Basically, the combination of sense experiences of specific events in your life create these subjective patterns of sensation, emotion and memory. Something as simple as looking at a color, or hearing a certain sound. It's interesting stuff.</p>
<p>I would warn however that you need to be careful how deep in the weeds you get with it. There are many sources that, IMO, give way too much significance to this idea beyond the physical and emotional phenomenon and start getting a little woo-woo. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Just like that one guy who responded is less [edit: responsive to emotional stimuli] than average, maybe you're a bit more [edit: responsive]  than average.  If it isn't impairing your life, it's just the way you are and it's all good. There's room in the world for everyone. Enjoy!  :D </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have never had a strong emotional reaction to input from your senses, ever in your life? Assuming your senses function within normal parameters, perhaps you're a person with low emotional affect. </p>
<p>Which is just a sciencey way of saying, &quot;you feel less emotions than most people.&quot; </p></div>		</li>
