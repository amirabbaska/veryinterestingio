			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a 51 49 split.  7-11 is upfront with this, but in reality that 2 percent is not bad considering you get a market manager who coaches you on your demography and helps you run promotions.  Not to mention that the store support center (HQ) completely eats promotional costs and item coverage for said promotions</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always hear gas stations don't make much money on the gas but there's a Chevron by me that has very limited hours for the convenience store part always sells it's gas 10 cents cheaper than the 2 other gas stations at the intersection. Assuming Chevron is still making at least 1 cent a gallon, that means the other 2 stations are making at least 11 cents per gallon and they're priced at or below the average for the area so all the gas stations have to be making a decent profit if Chevron can undercut them by 10 cents and still make money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally there is no income off a lottery ticket sale, again the theory is it brings people into your convenience store. Although, most states pay out to the location that sells a winning ticket - the amount varies dependent on the type of lottery ticket sold that ends up a winner. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In NY and many other states, just selling scratchers and lotto tickets alone can be a viable business.  In NY, you get a 6% commission on every dollar you take in.  Down the street from the pharmacy I work at, there's a tiny storefront that's maybe 80 sqft in the front section of another store that makes a significant chunk of change.  Even my pharmacy with it's small display of ~20 different scratchers ranging from $1-30 takes in about 5-10 thousand a day in revenue and that's considered low traffic since we just started to sell them just a few months ago with a &quot;smaller record&quot; of grand prize winners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for the Florida lottery and those retailers made a commission off every ticket they sold and the obvious bonuses for selling winning tickets and what not. I would see really busy stores earn 6 figure commission checks for selling lottery tickets</p>
<p>Source: my department would send tax forms directly to retailers. These tax forms showed exactly how much in lotto commission the store made the previous year </p></div>		</li>
