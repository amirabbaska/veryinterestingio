			<div class="markdown"><p>+1 for mentioning absorption chillers. People don't know that you can actually cool an entire building using steam. Only issue I have with them is that they are about 1/5th as efficient as your average electric chiller. Probably even less efficient than the new magnetic bearing chillers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Granted.  However, a chiller you already have is cheaper than buying a new one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Using steam to cool a building? Absorption Chiller? I don't even understand how my heat pump works and I've read like 5 articles trying to grasp it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It uses steam to heat up a lithium bromide(some times of solutions) solution that then boils water out of it then compresses it to a higher pressure. Temperature increases with pressure then it condenses at a very high temperature which is higher than ambient air so it move to the ambient air. Then the pressure is reduced and it passes through and evaporator and now boils at a temperature lower than the ambient temp so the heat moves into the evaporator now causing the liquid to boil. That causes the air to be cooled. Lithium is used because it's very excitable. I do this for a living(though I just I've only been doing it for 4 years) that's how I know. Its pretty amazing science/tech.</p>
<p>Edit: also a heat pump works like regular AC but just switches where the heat goes. Normally your outdoor unit gets hot and passes the heat to the outdoor air and your inside unit get cool, conditioning your house. Instead it reverses this with a valve and your indoor unit gets hot so you can heat inside then your door unit gets cool and absorbs heat from outside. It also occasionally runs A/C(defrost) for a few minutes to warm up the outside unit to melt any ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, interesting...TIL.  Lithium Bromide generally equals absorption chiller, Zeolite based solid usually is adsorption chiller, although the two have a lot of similarities and both are thermal chillers.</p></div>		</li>
