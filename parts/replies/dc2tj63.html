			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not start with the AlphaGo paper itself? It was published in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v529/n7587/full/nature16961.html" target="_blank">Nature</a> and as such the first part of it is fairly accessible (just not the pdf, but it can be found with a bit of googling I think). &quot;Deep learning&quot; also published in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v521/n7553/full/nature14539.html" target="_blank">Nature</a> is also accessible first introduction.</p></div>		</li>
