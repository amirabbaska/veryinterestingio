			<div class="markdown"><p>The fetus gets much of its antibodies directly from the mother's blood (some antibodies - like IgG - can directly cross the placental barrier). This gives a passive immunity to the infant for about 6 months after birth. The infant also gets IgA antibodies through the breast milk and colostrum, as you mentioned, though these do not cross into the infant's blood circulation in any significant amount. Instead, IgA coats the mucosal surfaces of the infant aka their GI tract. This protects against GI infections. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Embryo, not fetus. The distinction being is that a &quot;fetus&quot; is specifically the third-stage of development during the gestational process whereas an embryo, while it can refer to second-stage development, is also a catch-all term which can refer to any of the three. This is why the field is called &quot;Embryology&quot; and not &quot;Fetusology&quot;, embryo meaning &quot;The unborn&quot; or &quot;The developing (product)&quot; is the term you're looking for. The WHO and the AMA both recognize this as an important distinction and thus consider it very important to distinguish in speech given the extreme differences in sensibilization, pharmakodynamics , pharmakocinetics , etc. between each of the three stages.</p>
<p>But aside from that I see no errors in your statements, you are absolutely correct.</p></div>		</li>
