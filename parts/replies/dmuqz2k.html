<p>But one thing not debated is that the Old world was far more densely populated and the New World had far less contact with each other. Many up North had no knowledge of tribes and societies further south and vice versa. The disease however jumped across the continent faster than the Europeans did. </p>
<p>Europeans had contact with societies throughout Africa and Asia, thus their immune system had exposure to a wider variety of illnesses</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is putting it mildly. &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel.&quot; has a very bad rep among historians, mostly due to the rather bad scientific method used in the book. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/historians_views#wiki_historians.27_views_of_jared_diamond.27s_.22guns.2C_germs.2C_and_steel.22" target="_blank">/r/askhistorians has a whole section of their FAQ dedicated to the book and its criticism.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen had not terror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs of disease have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things--taken toll of our prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to many--those that cause putrefaction in dead matter, for instance--our living frames are altogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and fro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are. For neither do men live nor die in vain.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great video thanks for sharing /u/kyarmentari. </p>
<p>For those short on time Part 1 (link above) covers why Europeans gave Native Americans diseases, but not the other way around (because Europeans lived closely with animals that could transmit disease) </p>
<p>Part 2 is about the traits that allow animals able to be domesticated in the first place (friendly, feedable, fecund, family friendly). Very interesting video about why we have domesticated horses but not zebras (zebras have a worse temperament and horses live in a hierarchical structure that is hijacked by humans to facilitate domestication) </p></div>		</li>

It's regurgitating bullshit from Guns, Germs, and Steel, a book <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/historians_views#wiki_historians.27_views_of_jared_diamond.27s_.22guns.2C_germs.2C_and_steel.22" target="_blank">historians fucking hate.</a></p>
<p>Edit: And btw, please stop treating CGP Grey as if he's some intellectual authority, people. He's just a guy who googles shit and makes videos about it, and refuses to admit when he's wrong about something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, historians don't UNIVERSALLY hate GG&amp;S. A couple of Reddit comments talking about the book does not classify a fields opinion on the book. There's problems with it sure, but overall it's a very informative book that helps people look at history and the world in a different light (especially those without the time to read hundreds of academic books). It tackles a very large question, so it will inevitably have holes. But overall, it provides a very reasonable hypothesis for why the world may be the way it is. It talks about a number of factors that I hadn't considered before, which I found very compelling and interesting Like anything you read of that scale, take it with a grain of salt. But don't pretend to be some 'better-than-thou' historian because you claim to disagree with and hate the book. </p>
<p>Do you have another explanation to OPs that you would like to present? One that opposes factors discussed in the video and Guns Germs and Steel?</p></div>		</li>
