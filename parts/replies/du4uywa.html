<p>Or they abandoned their language for a new language...we see repeatedly in history that linguistic trends don't always follow genetic ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Language abandonment is incredibly rare if it ever happens. Language change is very, very gradual. The only instances that I could even hypothetically come up with are ones where conquering populations force conquered ones to use their language; even then, the change is gradual as one can only acquire a language so quickly. It typically takes generations for such a shift to happen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no clear answer here: it's possible that language arose once, in a single population of humans, and their descendants either took over the world or spread their language to other humans. It's also possible that language arose multiple times in different places.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To copy myself from a few days ago over on r/linguistics (apart from a few word corrections/clarifications) on three scenarios that would allow multiple languages to arise:</p>
<p>Humans have the ability to develop language before we come widespread. Different groups independently begin making sounds and stringing them together into sentences, because they all had the &quot;hardware&quot; for language, but had to independently come up with the &quot;software,&quot; resulting in many disparate languages popping up around the same time.</p>
<p>Or, maybe humans had speech long, LONG before language. We have bird-song or animal-call like noises, which are ultimately cognate, but on a scale of hundreds of thousands of years ago, predating H. sapiens entirely. Over the next hundreds of thousands (or even million) years, these lexemes diverge, are re-invented, whatever. Any language above the lexeme level only happens at behavioural modernity, with syntax/morphology being independently invented by different groups as they reach modernity (or possibly by copying indirectly, such as Latin alphabet &gt; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_syllabary" target="_blank">Cherokee syllabary</a>), leaving humans with cognate lexemes that predate their existence but non-cognate syntax and morphology being a recent invention at least three times younger.</p>
<p>Or the reverse could happen, where humans have the ability for speech in place before it begins being used, and as a result individual lexemes evolve independently. The first group that evolves language beyond the word-level is copied structurally by nearby groups, which is copied structurally by nearby groups, which is copied structurally by nearby groups, so that all groups are forming sentences in the same manner (e.g. past-tense with the word &quot;stop,&quot; the verb &quot;run&quot; being derived from the word &quot;cheetah,&quot; &quot;hunt&quot; being derived from &quot;gazelle&quot;). This results in a bunch of noncognate lexemes all being mapped onto a single, &quot;cognate&quot; syntactic/grammatical structure.</p>
<p>As an additional option, language may have arisen in a split lexicon/syntax way like one of those, or arose multiple times, but all <em>living</em> languages have a single ancestor due to later replacement.</p>
<p>There's basically no evidence from within languages themselves to support any option over any other one. I have my opinions, but they're just that, not anything supportable by strong evidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, linguists generally agree that if there was a single language in the past, we've been unable to deduce anything about it from comparing modern languages. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most linguists agree that 6-8kya is about the limit for reconstruction (roughly the dates for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language" target="_blank">Proto-Indo-European</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Tibetan_languages" target="_blank">Proto-Sino-Tibetan</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_languages" target="_blank">Proto-Austronesian</a>, for example). Most accepted language reconstructions are significantly younger than that. Beyond that point, individual words have undergone so much sound change, semantic drift, and/or replacement that it becomes effectively impossible to pick out any signal in the noise.</p>
<p>One possible exception is certain morphological similarities, which is the major basis for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages" target="_blank">Afro-Asiatic</a> as a language family. Cognate words are scarce, controversial, and/or inadequately demonstrated, but cognate morphology seems very likely, making it the oldest accepted language family at 10-12kya, with some estimates pushing it as far back as 16-18kya.</p>
<p>However, compare that with even conservative estimates of human language at ~50kya, and less conservative pushing it back to 80kya, 100kya, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6ningen_spears" target="_blank">300kya</a>, or even earlier for pre-language speech that may have formed the basis of later language. Even contoversial macrofamily proposals, that say there's traceable evidence of primary language families being related to each other, generally only stretch back ~12-25kya ago, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borean_languages" target="_blank">Borean</a>, the most far-reaching of them, is still focused on Eurasia, excluding most of Subsaharan Africa, Papua/Australia, and the Americas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_deprivation_experiments" target="_blank">There's a whole Wikipedia article about that, actually.</a></p>
<p>Most examples occurred in ancient times (or at least, allegedly occurred).</p>
<p>But tbh, cases like Genie seem to demonstrate that, if a child somehow isn't exposed to language at all during the critical period for language acquisition, they may never master it at all. (WARNING: That link is incredibly sad.)</p>
<p>However, it would also appear that children who have social interaction, but are not exposed to language per se, will naturally develop complex aspects of grammar and syntax.</p>
<p>For example, congenitally deaf babies with hearing parents will develop &quot;home sign&quot; systems.</p>
<p>Also, there have been cases of twins, who didn't have much contact with people other than one another, developing their own unique idioglossia.</p></div>		</li>

<p>African pygmies diverged from the rest of the human race ~300,000 years ago, and they don't seem to have any difficulty with language, either their own or learning other peoples'. It must have begun before that.</p>

<p>How could this possibly happen? The brain has many complex adaptations for producing and understanding language. That doesn't happen by accident -- they were selected for because they had a survival advantage, i.e. they were being used for something. I mean I guess it's possible that they were being used for something else and then language was a happy side-effect, but why posit such an extravagant hypothesis when there's no evidence for it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm highly skeptical because of the supposed age. I just don't think there's the evidence. I think there's plausible evidence of some of those languages being related to each other, such as Indo-Uralic, Dene-Yeniseian, and Austro-Tai, based on good linguistics, though not (yet) conclusively.</p>
<p>Some macrofamilies are <em>enticing</em>. Uniting Indo-Uralic with Eskimo-Aleut (not quite part of Borean) from a mid-Siberian ancestor, with IE migrating southwest and being heavily influenced by Caucasian languages while Eskimo-Aleut migrated east and underwent immense restructuring in contact with Chukchi/Nikh/Ainu ancestors. A Basque-Caucasian-Burushaski-Sino-Tibetan group, from a widespread, pre-Indo-European population that stretched from the Atlantic to Sichuan that was entirely replaced except in mountainous relict areas. But they mostly paint an interesting picture of history, and the actual linguistic evidence is more wishful than anything.</p>
<p>A bunch of others simply don't have the evidence. Altaic (specifically, Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic) is clearly a contact area, but non-loan cognates and cognate morphology between the three are lacking; adding in Korean and Japanese is very questionable, and there's about as much evidence that Japanese is <em>SE Asian</em> instead of Manchurian, and no one knows what to do with Ainu. Sino-Tibetan reconstruction is heavily reliant on Chinese, Tibetan, and Burmese, which some recent proposals place as the three <em>innermost</em> languages, making it heavily susceptible to sampling bias. It feels to me like more work needs to be done on Proto-Sino-Tibetan, especially the morphology, before external relations can be judged. North Caucasian is a clusterfuck, the two are morphological &quot;opposites&quot; compounded with messy phonologies, and NW Caucasian is made up primarily of one- or two-sound roots that make comparison a nightmare. Afroasiatic seems forced in, there's a few similarities between Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Semitic, but afaik not Afroasiatic as a whole. I simply don't know enough about some of the proposed families to say much, except to say that they're widely rejected and/or subject to multiple, contradictory proposals, like Austric versus Sino-Austronesian and Eskimo-Uralic versus Eskimo-Chukchi.</p></div>		</li>
