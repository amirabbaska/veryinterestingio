			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, wall-warts can only provide so much power, and they often lie about their amperage. I have an Apple one that puts out half its rated power (measured correctly).<br />
My tablet won't even start charging with my longest cable, the resistance is too high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say that the power transfer is at a maximum when the resistance of the wire matches the resistance of the phone but then you never actually use the resistance of the phone in your calculation. </p>
<p>Then in your formula the power just increases the less resistance you have which would imply the phone has zero resistance? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The maximum power transfer theorem he referenced does not apply to phones. They don't have a constant resistance. Phones have power supplies built into them that regulate the voltage to the battery and to the phone's circuits. If the voltage decreases, the phone's &quot;resistance&quot; decreases because it needs more current to get the same power for its needs. If the input voltage increases, the current goes down. </p>
<p>What matters is the minimum required voltage at the phone's input connector and the voltage drop across the wire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would you model a phone battery using just simple components, maybe as a current source with a minimum voltage required? I'd imagine it might take more voltage to charge the battery depending on how charged it actually is like a capacitor (maybe?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The resistance of the phone is unknown and irrelevant.  The point is that if the phone has any equivalent resistance other than that of the cable it will get less than the maximum power possible.</p>
<p>All we are doing is calculating the maximum THEORETICAL power.  We are not calculating the ACTUAL power.  The actual power transferred will depend on the exact design of the phone.</p>
<p>Also, don't think of the phone as having a resistance.  Really, the power circuit of the phone will have an &quot;equivalent resistance,&quot; which will determine how much power is transferred.</p>
<p>You could easily design a phone that draws much less than the maximum power possible.  It's not hard to design a phone that can draw the maximum power possible.</p></div>		</li>
