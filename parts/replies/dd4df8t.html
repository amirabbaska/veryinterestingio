			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a pretty heavy drinker from age 16-22 (more than 4-5 full sized bottles a week) and the only reason I'm able to drink socially now is because I completely stopped drinking for about 3 years.</p>
<p>I had to stop going out totally and ended up losing a lot of friends because they didn't want to do anything but drink, but I would say it was worth it.
Even now I'm not anywhere near as social as I used to be because I can feel myself craving alcohol sometimes, but it's getting easier</p>
<p>I also have a big issue with promiscuity but unfortunately I haven't been able to fix that yet; I mostly stopped having sex when me and my ex boyfriend broke up about 1 1/2 years ago but haven't been able to start again without wanting to fuck every minute, so I guess that one still needs some more time.</p>
<p>So yes, your theory holds up - abstaining for a good amount of time is a pretty effective way to rebuild your relationship with addictive things</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder how many people realize the majority of their social network is built around getting tanked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it wasn't until I stopped that I realized my whole life was built around work and drinking, I literally did nothing else but work and party. </p>
<p>I'm actually still struggling to find hobbies that don't seem boring. I guess I got used to the adrenaline rush of partying non stop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar story here. I was an Olympic class drinker (I once drank two Irish families under the table) and went on to quit drinking some eight years ago after being told by an angry doctor that I had a choice - drink and die before I am forty or get smart and stop now. </p>
<p>There were two noticeable effects of stopping drinking. Firstly was the complete abandonment by my friends. People stopped calling in, inviting me out - it was, weird. I really hope they've had a time because I simply don't miss them. </p>
<p>The other noticeable effects was financial. Since then I have been really quite solvent and able to invest in my own business. I estimate that drinking would cost me Â£4-5k a year (that's a conservative estimate) </p>
<p>So yeah, drinking buddies are only interested in you when you are drinking. Fuck 'em. I am healthier, happier and richer these days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a non drinker (my whole life), this is both a blessing and a curse to me. I know all my friends (few though they are) are true friends, because we bonded over interests, not alcohol, but it does make it difficult to meet new people and make new friends as I get older.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 2 weeks into sobriety after abusing alcohol from age 17-29 and am horrified by how I was willing and able to keep alcohol as a priority over pretty much anything else in my life.  </p>
<p>If I had developed a better sense of how to healthily process my emotions instead of &quot;augmenting&quot; reality by drinking, the reward pathways in my brain would be so different.  </p>
<p>I hear neuroplasticity is an awesome thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Listen, my one big regret is that I didn't think I needed to talk to someone about how to learn to handle emotions when I first quit. It was a big mistake and I ended up substituting other horrible habits for the alcohol and drugs to help me cope.</p>
<p>Even though I've been sober I'm just now getting out of a pretty deep depression. Don't make the same mistake</p></div>		</li>

<p>AA is not the only answer, unfortunately this is exclusively what is embraced by the US legal and psychiatric system. </p>

<p>The legal system, maybe. But not the psych system. I refuse to refer my clients to AA unless there are absolutely no other treatment options available to them. AA is not a peer reviewed, evidence based practice, and I think anyone in MH care who refers clients to it as an exclusive form of treatment should have their license pulled. That being said, AA can be a useful form of SUPPORT through the treatment process, but I would never ever ever tell one of my clients to get help at AA. The legal system loves AA because it's free. I, frankly, don't think they should be allowed to require it. I wonder if anyone has ever appealed an AA probation requirement, on the basis that it is not an evidence based approach to treatment... kinda wonder where that would go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has been challenged legally, and as a result other programs must be offered (if available), largely due to rights to religious freedom. Other programs like SMART Recovery, SOS, Women in Sobriety, etc. are typically approved by the courts, but they are far less available. As you mentioned, AA is not an evidence-based treatment and in fact it is not treatment at all, but instead a source of support. I encourage my clients to check it (and other types of meetings) out as a potentially helpful adjunct to their treatment. While I personally am not a huge fan, tons of my clients are surprised about what they get out of it, and that way no matter where they are in the world (practically) they can know that there is somewhere they can go or someone they can call if they are trying not to drink and they are struggling, AA and SMART Recovery also have web-based meetings too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coming from someone who has dealt with the US legal system regarding alcohol abuse, I probably could have appealed the AA probation, but the alternative was jail time. I'm sure this would be the case for anyone else. Mind you, this was in conjunction with court mandated therapy. So my options were: 1) go to AA 5 times a week, twice a day, plus therapy every-other week, plus fines, and random drug tests, while working 60hr work weeks with no car for any of these activities; or 2) go to jail for quite a few months, plus fines, and I get to lose my job and my car, and still be on probation when out. Would you really want to appeal the AA just because its not scientifically proven to work? Plus, you get free coffee and everyone is super friendly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you appealed it, there's now legal precedence for them to allow you to attend an alternative program. Legally required AA was challenged in California and was deemed unconstitutional because it violates the religious portion of the first amendment.</p>
<p>If they jailed you for asking for an alternative, contact the FFRF. They would probably be all over it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's bullshit. I see the problem with AA as being required and court-mandated is that they are trying to convince people that alcoholism is a disease, when it's not. There's no scientific evidence that says &quot;Oh look right there you've got the drinking gene, yep you've got this disease real bad and you're never ever gonna get better.&quot; </p>
<p>It's just crazy that you go through the court system and the courts basically give you no choice but to go to AA, and AA preaches that you have a disease from which you will never be healed.</p>
<p>Free coffee sounds cool though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't like a lot of AA philosophy. What's hard though is there are so few other options. I was thinking of trying that SMART program, they even have an online support group. Worth a try.</p>
<p>There's also NA which tends to have a bit of a different outlook. AA people are often AA only.</p></div>		</li>

If it went wrong, my husband, my toddler son, and my soon to be born son would bear the brunt of a possible (and probable, in my experience) relapse. It's just not worth it to me to roll the dice and have my family pick up the pieces... again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to consider is many people who abstain from one thing, just pick up another. One needs to heal the root of the problem, and the substance shouldn't be the focus.</p>
<p>Just to add though, I totally agree with your philosophy. However, my problem with AA is the all or nothing attitude. I agree you need to stop. But people who have a drink again aren't necessarily &quot;sick&quot;. It's a tough thing though, because for some people, if they think they can drink again they might use it as an excuse. </p>
<p>I think (as a drunk myself) abstaining for 5 years was enough to get it mostly out of my system. I did drink again after that but the pleasure was gone from it. My life was better and past that point. Not to say I couldn't end up there again if I'm not aware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the weirdest thing going back when you stop drinking for a long period of time after being an alcoholic. Especially if you're hitting your 30s-40s where hangover start to <em>suck</em>. You also lose your ability to metabolize alcohol, so you wake up stinking like vinegar (vomit inducing). And not only do you smell, you feel like death even though you only had 5 beer, and drank a jug of water before bed.</p>
<p>I honestly have no clue how I ever enjoyed it now trying again, but if my body were still 20-something maybe I'd have a different story to tell.</p></div>		</li>
