			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The pathway process above is more like a &quot;force of habit thing&quot;. Imagine every time you make a coffee, you make the drink, add the milk, put the milk in the fridge and leave the kitchen. You do this daily, for years. One day you make a cup and a friend knocks at the door, so you offer them one too. They ask for black with sugar.</p>
<p>You follow your usual process, make the drink, add the sugar, and are about to leave the kitchen, but because more of your focus is on conversation with your friend now that the bit you need to remember (black with sugar) is done, you suddenly find you've put the sugar in the fridge, because &quot;put item in place&quot; is <em>always</em> the last step.</p>
<p>The pathway process is like a neurological version of that, your brain is trying to be efficient and apply what it already knows to what seems to be an appropriate situation rather than always treat everything as new information for processing and storage. It's not exactly the same, but similar.</p>
<p>The issue about dreams isn't actually clear at the moment, but there are theories;</p>
<p>1)    In a dream, the laws of physics and time are changeable. What works in a dream may well be dangerous in real life. If in a dream you're being chased by a murderer and escape by jumping on the bonnet of a passing truck, you really don't need your brain remembering that too well and run the risk of making your response to danger to be to throw yourself into traffic. In this theory the belief is that it's an evolutionary trait to always discard information from dreams as being unreliable, rather than waste energy processing each little part of it. This may also be why you can have a profound dream that makes you realise a hard-hitting truth and it sticks with you all day, and really affects you emotionally - in that first ten minutes after waking up your brain while scanning and dumping all the information hits something that by all logic seems very much to be true. This confuses the brain because it doesn't know if it should give priority to the information learned or to the unreliable source of it. </p>
<p>2)   Dreams aren't information later cleaned by the brain, they are the process of the brain cleaning information already gained. This theory states that the reason dreams can be so weird and disconnected does tie back to the post by  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Em_Adespoton" target="_blank">Em_Adespoton</a> as it is the brain decluttering and removing all the irrelevant, unnecessary pathways built up over time. Your dream is your brain living through those scenarios, connections, thoughts and habits making things jump from one to another - in your dream you open the door to your house, walk in and you're in the office at work, yet that seems normal and familiar in the dream. This is another evolutionary theory as it claims that early man needed strong and reliable pathways formed in order to survive</p>
<p>3)    Dreaming is part of a wider group of mental functioning. There are two forms of mental functioning, focused and unfocused. Focused functioning is when you (or your brain) actively does something - try to remember something, try to answer a question, note what colour a passsing car is  - while unfocused functioning is the weird natural wanderings - an old memory randomly popping into your head, realising you still remember your cousin's friend's dad's phone number from 1997, barely notice a car go past you but when asked find you remember the colour even though you didn't register at the time. Dreams are an unfocused function which means they wander in and wander out without so much as a how-do-you-do. You might forget your dreams easily, but can you remember what you were thinking when you brushed your teeth this morning? Do you remember what made you glance over your shoulder as you were walking to work earlier? Unfocused functions are not &quot;connected&quot; to functional memory in the same way that focused functions are. This theory is neurological rather than evolutionary and claims that it's just how the central cortex of our brains are built - there is no 'reason' it is, it just is.</p>
<p>Again, none of these are proven and it's still an open book as to why, but there are a lot of interesting theories out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not nearly as hard after the first time. The reason it's &quot;a thing&quot; is because we were all bamboozled as a kid and it stuck.</p>
<p>The reason it's at least a little difficult is because we want to do the same thing with both arms/halves of the body. Yeah, you have drummers who can keep each limb on its own tempo, but without practice it's not easy to separate orders to your limbs</p>
<p>Another fun one is to sit on a tall chair, rotate your right foot clockwise. Then draw a &quot;6&quot; with your right hand.</p></div>		</li>
