Leptin, on the other hand, has to do with your fat mass, the leaner you are, the less leptin is secreted, making it harder for you to feel satiated. On the flip side, obese individuals typically exhibit high leptin secretion, but still don't reach satiation easily, because they become leptin resistant (the mechanism of this resistance is still unclear AFAIK).</p></div>		</li>
