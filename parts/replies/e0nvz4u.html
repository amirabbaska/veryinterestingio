			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats an interesting question! Im not sure, but i suspect it would be quite a boring case of all of a sudden the two regions of space can now interact. Nothing drastic would seem to happen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The paper is interesting and on-topic, but not quite what the OP is asking since the OP is asking about a <em>finite</em> collection of black holes. The paper you have linked discusses a cosmological model in which space is filled with a regular lattice of black holes (i.e., an <em>infinite</em> lattice).</p>
<p>However, what is really relevant here, is that it is possible to have a mass configuration in which so-called <em>piecewise silence</em> occurs, even if it may not occur in the OP's scenario. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah i wouldnt think so. The distances we see in the universe are much bigger than this lattice structure would be, so i doubt that we would be inside one. It is a rather ideal model so its technically physically possible, doesnt mean it would happen anywhere right. But you never really know i suppose</p></div>		</li>
