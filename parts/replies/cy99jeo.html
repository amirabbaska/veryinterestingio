			<div class="markdown"><p>can I ask. from what you just wrote it seemed to me like drinking coffee can make my brain perceive time differently, making it seem like less time has passed than the time that really has passed. Is that the case? Sorry for being so uninformed, I'm just a fluid mechanics engineer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may not be that simple, but by no means is it a bad question. From my experience the brain is so highly complex that targeting just one system rarely affects the overall result. It may very well change perception of time, albeit a small amount. But in this case I think that the adenosine gives frames of reference for <em>internal</em> cues rather than external conscious memories. It serves to tell the body how rested you are, and therefore how far into a wake cycle you have been, rather than directly speeding up or slowing down the perception of events. </p></div>		</li>
