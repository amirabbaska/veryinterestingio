			<div class="markdown"><p>Science communication can be very challenging. One of the big issues is that there is an expectation that communication be dumbed down; I've written articles which have been published by CNN, The Independent, and others and almost exclusively they expect those articles to have a reading age of about 12. Tabloid press aim for a reading age of under 10. Even more limiting are the word limits; it is expected that most people won't read further than the headline and first paragraph. Articles are frequently capped at 800 words or less. In that space and reading limit it can be incredibly challenging to actually communicate real science to the public.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of desire to have black and white answers to questions; the details get glossed over, but from a scientific perspective those details are the critical and important bit. I think the trick is to just keep communicating when you can, be as clear as possible, and use alternative methods to reach an audience in a more technical manner when you can. So things like AMAs can be really useful in that way. </p>
<p>That all said I think on the whole it's getting better. Slowly.</p>
<p>To your second question; a PhD is training you to become an independent researcher. It's how you develop your skills and interests after your PhD that will determine where you specialise. Don't be afraid of branching out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't related to science, but I frequently wish that articles came in both short and long versions.  There are some subjects that I don't care enough about to want tons of verbiage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientific articles and some presentations already do that. The short form is called an abstract and is just a one paragraph summary at the beginning of the paper.</p></div>		</li>
