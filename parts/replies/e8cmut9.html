			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe (didnt try to verify) that the masks are great for preventing things coming out than going in - its designed for doctors/surgeons to not contaminate their surrounds in whatever they are doing. Therefore, the masks are only effective (like you said) in protecting others and they only protect you if everyone else use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In hospital, droplet borne illnesses including flu are prevent ok ng from spread by having staff wear these kinds of masks plus gloves to prevent staff infection.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the biggest effect might be preventing contact from hands (with droplet borne virions) to face, eyes, nose, mouth rather than directly preventing spreading droplets to those targets, as I understand direct inoculation from hands to mouth is the major source of infection.</p>
<p>Our facility has stopped requiring gowns for this purpose, just gloves and surgical mask (N95).</p>
<p>Edit: N not M95</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, hospitals also require employees to have flu vaccinations. That's got to be the best protection against spreading the flu. As you noted, surgical masks are for keeping things in, you need a filter and seal around nose and mouth to prevent stuff from getting in.</p></div>		</li>
