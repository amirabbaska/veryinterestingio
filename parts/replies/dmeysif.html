			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to dairy, the gene to process lactose as an adult has cropped up a few times independently across humanity. Every time it's from a culture that eats dairy, and they're eating dairy because it allowed them to have access to food sources they wouldn't have otherwise. It's simply an adaptation to an otherwise uninhabitable environment. </p>
<p>Mammals that survive on just grass are very valuable for their milk for the simple reason that they convert inedible  (to humans) grass into meat and milk. Living in a harsh environment like mountains, the high plains of Asia, or the frigid north, having a high calorie, readily available food source is a huge advantage. Once cheese became a thing, it was even more advantageous because cheesemaking allows people to now store their milk for long periods of time. </p>
<p>However, 75% of people don't live in places like this. Most people live in tropical to subtropical areas and have access to fresh food all year round, and thus, digesting lactose as an adult provides no advantage, thus, the gene isn't selected for. </p>
<p>Edit: With the advent of modern transportation and trade solutions, fresh food is also now available to anyone in any developed country anywhere, so lactose intolerance is not a huge deal in places it used to be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also take a look at USDA vs Harvard's 'healthy eating plate's and you'll see what 'private interests' can do to confuse and mislead the public.  <a href="http://www.healthcastle.com/sites/default/files/harvard-usda_600.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.healthcastle.com/sites/default/files/harvard-usda_600.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>
