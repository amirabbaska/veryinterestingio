<p>Dolby vision becoming an industry standard</p>

<p>Pretty sure HDR10 is leading right now. The only company I've seen pushing Dolby is LG. But Samsung and Sony are pushing HDR10.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also under this impression, To add, I believe that Dolby Vision requires an additional proprietary chipset, while HDR10 is a software standard (not 100% positive, but this is my understanding from the research I have done)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not quite, but you need to license the use of Dolby Vision (which is very expensive from manufacturers).</p>
<p>There are no licensing fees for HDR10 or 10+. </p>
<p>Both technologies do the same thing, they add dynamic frame metadata to the HDR encoding.</p>
<p>In ELI5 terms, every frame/scene in a movie can be adjusted individually for HDR tuning rather than just the entire movie at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HDR10 is free open standard.  But it supports only fixed range.  Dolby Vision probably cost money but its range is can change from scene to scene.</p>
<p>HDR10+ suppose to match Dolby Vision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It costs money because it’s a certain chip inside TVs. It’s not a firmware thing unfortunately. I saw a demo of it at Dolby labs, and it’s pretty incredible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, LG is the only TV manufacturer right now investing heavily into large (TV-size) OLED technology, and that's pretty much the only type of display I will be watching movies on until something fundamentally better exists. Sorry Sony, you can't just keep adding filters to LED LCD panels to compete.</p>
<p>OLED is much better than LED LCD, even for non-HDR/4K content because each OLED pixel makes its own light (vs LCD which used an LED backlight, and there is not a 1:1 ratio of back lights to physical pixels). So much contrast and color is lost just because your TV has to generalize how much light it's illuminating pixels to some degree (which varies by model but none are 1:1 or even anywhere close afaik).</p>
<p>Also Netflix has shared their own internal data (sorry I don't have a link, on mobile) that both they and users tend to prefer Dolby Vision as it looks best on most
HDR compatible TVs. I have been paying attention to this space for a while, and I think Dolby Vision will win in the end even if it's not as open. Don't worry too much though, as most mainstream app sources like Netflix and Amazon will stream in whatever your device supports. DVD playback is the real bummer, and I'd suggest a TV that supports both (cough LG cough).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Sony A1E is an OLED and came out in 2017 (their first, as far as I know). They showed a new OLED (A8F) at CES this year, but no pricing.</p>
<p>But LG certainly has more models, and some of theirs are a fair amount cheaper than the A1E.</p>
<p>LED TVs only get close on full array TVs. The Z9D has &quot;more than 600&quot; local dimming zones, but I don't see an exact number. It basically means the backlighting is controlled on a very fine scale, greatly limiting any light bleed between zones.</p>
<p>Most TVs that people buy are actually edge lit, so your backlighting comes from the sides of the panel. There's a distinct drop in quality when you compare an edge lit TV to a full array. I own an edge lit TV, and my blacks are not even close to what I know a full array TV will get.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing is going to compare to simply being able to turn individual pixels off like with OLED.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UHD, while a marketing term, is not nonsensical. UHD is basically a standard for consumer products. UHD resolution is 3840 × 2160 which is not a &quot;genuine&quot; 4K resolution. The native 4K standard is actually 4096 × 2160. UHD aspect ratio is the classic 16:9 that is found from most TVs and monitors, while the actual 4K aspect ratio is 1.90:1 (256:135).</p>
<p>There is a difference. Super UHD is actually nonsensical.</p></div>		</li>
