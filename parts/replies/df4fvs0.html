<p>Because it's awkward to stare someone in the eye while you suck on their mouthparts, which is what it becomes if your eyes are open.</p>

<p>Is it only awkward if they both do it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try it. It takes you out of the moment as the normal social feeling of eye to eye communication isnt there but your subconsiciouly waiting for it and the cues youd normally get from the rest of the face too. Id say closed eyes allows focus on the task at hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of Bruno Mars' Grenade.</p>
<p>&quot;Should've known you was trouble
From the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?&quot;</p>
<p>and I can't help but think of Bruno Mars and SO just glaring into each other's eyes as he contemplates catching a grenade for her</p></div>		</li>
