			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious, in general is it more likely that magnetic monopoles exist, or that they don't exist? I know it's unknown, but is it more &quot;They probably exist, but maybe they don't&quot; or rather &quot;they probably don't exist, but maybe they do&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unification as we conceive it predicts monopoles rather generally , so I'm inclined to think they exist, but I don't think there's really a consensus that one scenario is more likely than another.  After all, unification is itself an aesthetic preference at this point; there is no direct evidence for it (proton decays searches and monopole searches have come up empty, after all).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't have the data, so your options are basically</p>
<ul>
<li>The math doesn't rule them out, and they make sense, so they probably do</li>
<li>We've never found them, so they probably don't</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are sufficiently weak that you're comfortably in the realm of &quot;belief&quot; rather than &quot;fact.&quot;</p>
<p>Personally I would like them to exist, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#In_Gaussian_cgs_units" target="_blank">they make Maxwell's equations beautifully symmetric</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if there's a good answer to that. On one hand, we've never observed one (that we can be sure of, see the link above). On the other hand, there's no theoretical reason why they shouldn't exist. As mentioned above, there are several theories that predict them. I remember in an electrodynamics class I took there was a whole lecture on how nice and symmetrical Maxwell's equations would be if there were magnetic monopoles.</p>
<p>It doesn't really make sense to talk about how certain we are of something when we have so little data. If we observe something we can say we're pretty sure it indicates x, y, and z because of the methods used, and then we can try to become more certain. But the lack of an observation leaves too many questions. Are we looking in the right places, at the right scales? It's very hard to say with certainty that they don't exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One should distinguish between two types of monopoles. First, there are Dirac monopoles, which are literally just fundamental particles with nonzero magnetic monopole moment. </p>
<p>Dirac showed that the existence of such a monopole would lead to the quantization of electric charges. Also they appear to make Maxwell's equations more symmetric. With only electric monopoles, Maxwell's equations are d<em>E = rho, d</em>B - d*E/dt = j, dB = 0, and dE + dB/dt = 0. rho and j are the density and current of electric monopoles, so we see that they are sources for electric field, and their current generates changing electric fields. There's no term to generate magnetic field, or changing magnetic fields, so adding such a term would appear to add a nice symmetry to the equations. </p>
<p>But these Dirac monopoles are not of much interest. Why not? They seem to have good qualities? Well, today we understand the electromagnetic field as connections on a bundle, and charged matter fields as sections of an associated bundle. For various reasons we think it <em>has</em> to be a gauge field; break the gauge symmetry and the theory is nonrenormalizable. In gauge theories, it is a requirement that dF = 0, as a basic mathematical consequence (Bianchi identity). Therefore Dirac monopoles are not compatible with electromagnetism as a gauge theory, and so no one is looking for Dirac monopoles.</p>
<p>So what are the monopoles that scientists <em>are</em> hoping to find? They are the second type of monopoles, t'Hooft-Polyakov monopoles. They are solitons, which are kind of like knots. Solutions which have topological obstructions keeping them stable. For certain gauge theories, these soliton solutions can be found which have a net magnetic monopole moment. This cannot happen in an abelian gauge theory (like electromagnetism). I believe it can't even happen in SU(2) or SU(3), so nowhere in the standard model. It occurs with larger gauge groups like SU(5). So the search for monopoles is really a means to experimentally confirm GUT theory. But they have nothing to do with quantizing electric charges or bringing symmetry to Maxwell's equations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, that explains a lot. I always found it confusing that people would search for a particle that makes abelian guage theory approach to EM invalid, since it is so natural and powerful. Is there a simple EliPhd answer why magnetic monopoles would exist for higher dimensional Lie groups?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole would let you rule out some theories in favor of others. How about a Dirac monopole? Are there any current serious theories which don't assume a gauge field for electromagnetism?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would look exactly like the electric or gravitational field of a point charge/mass.</p>
<p>If the monopole is located at the origin, and it has &quot;charge&quot; g, the magnetic field it produces will be</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>(<strong>r</strong>) = g<strong>r</strong>/r^(3).</p>
<p>Just like the gravitational field of a point mass is</p>
<p><strong>g</strong>(<strong>r</strong>) = GM<strong>r</strong>/r^(3),</p>
<p>and the electric field of a point charge is</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>(<strong>r</strong>) = kq<strong>r</strong>/r^(3).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume it would look like a gradient ascent or descent in the magnetic field, peaking at the source. Like a gravity well, but in the electromagnetic field instead.</p>
<p>If that's right, it would want to align dipoles to face the source. So you'd get a bunch of compasses pointing towards or away from the same spot.</p></div>		</li>
