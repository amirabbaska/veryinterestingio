			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't making that request of the ISP though. They are simply the carrier. they could and should restrict themselves to forwarding packets. They don't because we've allowed them to monetize their unique position as the one who can correlate those packets with account holders.<br />
Edit: amazed at the number of people with no clue how the internet works</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are requesting they carry the data to you. You are basically saying that ups isnt carrying your package because they arnt the source of the item. Doesnt matter. You are still having them (isp/ups) carry your shit, and that is not something you can try to monopolize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what you said though. You said you request them to get the data. I quote <em>you making a request of the ISP to get certain data</em>.  That's not how it works. </p></div>		</li>
