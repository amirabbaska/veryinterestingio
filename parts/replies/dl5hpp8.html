<p>Doesn't it have something to do with electrolyte fuckery? (If you'll pardon my super-scientific jargon here...)</p>
<p>I had/have(?) a severe eating disorder. Anorexics die of heart attacks all the time. In treatment, they explained it as electrolyte fuckery that is caused by forcing your body to live off fat stores for a long time. This seems to fit with the top comment, explaining that ketosis causes electrolyte imbalance and potassium/magnesium deficiency. Starving causes ketosis, because when you aren't eating, you definitely aren't getting enough glucose. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Another issue is that people who starve themselves appear to have much higher rates of organ failure, particularly heart attacks. The exact mechanism is unknown.</p>

<p>A third issue is that your body will break down muscles while starving yourself, requiring exercise to avoid loss of muscle mass.</p>

<p>Would it be a stretch to consider these two issues are connected? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So thinking back to like Jesus times. When they would do 40 day fasts or really just any fasting during that time period in general, would they have likely been running into problems with vitamin deficiencies or stuff like that? </p>
<p>Basically I understand this whole fasting shindig to be yes, you can fast off the power of your own fat <em>provided</em> your body is still getting water and whichever vitamins it needs. That one guy who did the year long fast was being monitored by doctors and getting water and vitamins, and obviously that's a much more extreme case than anything anyone was doing for practical fasting 2000 years ago. But without a higher level of monitoring over vitamins and stuff, would they have been dealing with problems related to those things?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they absolutely would... generally a healthy person can last ~3 weeks with just water before they begin to have significant issues. besides vitamins you also actually NEED protein to rebuild damaged cells.</p>
<p>it's likely that Jesus could have literally fasted for 40 days and lived, but he would have been in rough shape at the end. </p>
<p>there was a very large 400+ man who fasted for over a year with very little vitamin supplements under strict medical supervision. it was heavily questioned if he even needed the supplements by the doctors. I've only read about it from a metabolic stand point (which amazingly pointed to no decrease in metabolic activity in relation to his size... you hear about people saying your body goes into starvation mode and burns less calories when you fast, but this seems to question that) so i'm not sure what other side effects he had... i'd imagine he wasn't able to maintain nearly any muscle mass unless they were also giving him protein </p></div>		</li>
