			<div class="markdown"><p>A neutron star 1.4 times the mass of the Sun with a 20 km diameter has a gravitational pull of 1.87x10^12 m/s^(2) at the surface.  To cancel out that pull it would need a rotational velocity of 1.37x10^8 m/s, or an angular rotation rate of 2200 revolutions per second.  To experience 1g (10 m/s^(2)) at the equator, it would need a rotational velocity 0.03 mm/s lower than that.</p>
<p>That would give you a 1g pull on the surface at the equator.  However, if you went 1 mm to the north or south of the equator, you would now feel a force of 1.02g downward and 50,000 g towards the equator.  If instead you went 1 mm above the surface, you would feel a force of 50,000 g upwards.</p>
<p>(these are all Newtonian calculations not accounting for relativity)</p></div>		</li>

<p>So then wouldn't this flatten you?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this one of those non-intuitive &quot;upwards&quot; really means the force of gravity downwards to the surface. Or, are you saying that at 1 mm above the surface the centripedal force of the rotation would have the force of 50,000 g flinging you away from the surface? Also can you explain the 50,000 g sideways at 1 mm north of the equator? No matter where you are on the surface, the resolved vector of gravity is going to be straight down into the surface. Moving slightly away from the plane of rotation, is going to reduce the counter acting force of the centripetal acceleration away from the surface; but the surface gravity from 1 mm away isn't going to pull you sideways. Can you explain your statement?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the abstract for your [1]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A method is described for levitating micron-sized few-layer graphene flakes in an electric quadrupole ion trap. Starting from a liquid suspension containing graphene, charged flakes are injected into the trap using the electrospray ionization technique and are probed optically. At micro-torr pressures, torques from circularly polarized light cause the levitated particles to rotate at frequencies &gt;1 MHz, which can be inferred from modulation of light scattering off the rotating flake when an electric field resonant with the rotation rate is applied. Possible applications of these techniques will be presented, both to fundamental measurements of the mechanical and electronic properties of graphene and to new approaches to graphene crystal growth, modification, and manipulation.</p>
