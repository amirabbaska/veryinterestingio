			<div class="markdown"><p>But why on the poles? Why doesn't it throw a disc at its rotational equator as you would expect from centrifugal forces?</p>
<p>Does it have anything to do with the magnetic poles and the gas being a plasma?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't actually know yet! The name for this type of phenomenon is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_outflow" target="_blank">bipolar outflow</a>, since the jets come from the two poles of the star. The best guesses are that the jets are formed by tightly wound magnetic field lines (like you guessed) or some interaction with a binary companion orbiting the main star. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It blew my mind. Alternating and stabilising like that on the rotational poles.</p>
<p>Or along the lines of Ampere's right hand screw rule, where the current flows through the rotational pole.</p>
<p>Annd now I'm reading about the Lorentz force...</p>
<p>I only just found out about gyroscopes a little while ago and all of these things I've arbitrarily listed with only the loosest associations with this topic... and including this topic, have shown me that I know absolutely diddly about how anything works once rotation gets involved.</p>
<p>I don't even remember what I was trying to say at the start of this comment. My head is spinning and my mind is blown. </p>
<p>I know nothing about what I thought I knew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah if anything I'd expect angular momentum to be flinging things off the equator, like Saturn's rings, not the poles.</p></div>		</li>
