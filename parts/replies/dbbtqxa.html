			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to piggy back on this by highlighting the inherent difficulty of getting 'solid' (i.e. double-blind) clinical research done on acupuncture. </p>
<p>in ideal situations, no one directly interacting with the patient, or the patient his/herself, knows if they are receiving 'real' medication or placebo. </p>
<p>in the case of acupuncture, however, this becomes exceedingly difficult. unlike administering, say, a pill, the content of which can be easily modified, acupuncture is based on physical phenomena -- the act of placing needles into the skin at certain points. </p>
<p>if the drug is poking needles into your body, what would the placebo be? the most obvious one would be &quot;not having needles poked into your body,&quot; but then all parties involved with the study would know who was in the placebo group and who wasn't. </p>
<p>the alternative is to have someone place needles into the 'incorrect' part of the body, but then you have two problems: 1) the person administering the 'incorrect' acupuncture <em>knows</em> they're administering it incorrectly (assuming the person administering the acupuncture is licensed), and 2) you're still poking needles into someone, which could very well have an effect (possibly via local endorphin release, etc.). </p>
<p>tl;dr: it's a tricky thing to design a study for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do it one of two ways.</p>
<p>Sticking needles in randomly can investigate the so-called chakra points. And has regularly found they don't exist.</p>
<p>The second is retractable needles. The patient thinks they are being inserted but they aren't. Again, no evidence that it works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I've read is that the effect is not due to acupuncture itself, but to the fact that you required to stay still and relaxed for some time, which may help to relax some of the muscles, etc. that cause you pain. Or something along those lines. In other words, it's no better than a massage or a hot tub </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is acupuncture just massage with needles or are you saying that poking people with needles anywhere gives the same effect as poking them at specific chi points?</p></div>		</li>

<p>to quote:</p>
<p>&quot;Although acupuncture was found effective for chronic low back pain, tailoring needling sites to each patient and penetration of the skin appear to be unimportant in eliciting therapeutic benefits.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
