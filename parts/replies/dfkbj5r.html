Unfortunately, not all of a species is in its most popular environment at any one point in time. When a thunderstorm shows up, surely some Brachiosaurus(es?) might be wandering a clearing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of would just depend how quickly the charge could find earth and if any vital organs are in that path, especially the heart. To be able to just internalize a lightning strike would be like shrugging off a 250kg blast of TNT, there's a lot of energy involved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine that what would matter to survive would be how large the animal is, so the the eletric current has more space to be dissipated, and how large it's feet aren't(the less contact to the ground, the less potential energy[sorry for the layman terminology, I'm rusty on my basic physics]). So the better fit to survive lighting would be giraffes, ironically enough.</p>
<p>Well, technically the whales, because not only they have the size, they have an entire ocean to dissipate the energy... but that's just a plain unfair advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very much a generalized, self-referential answer, but: </p>
<p>The evolution benefit of being as tall as they are (access to food sources unreachable by others, farther vision, etc.) may outweigh the detriment (in this case, being killed by lightening), if giraffe population height isn't changing due to lightening strikes over time.    </p>
<hr />
<p>We have to keep in mind that &quot;reproductive fitness&quot; does not optimize for a single variable, characteristic, part of anatomy, or behavior, other than overall successful reproduction itself, which is a multi-component thing.  </p>
<p>In almost all cases, multiple evolutionary pressures are happening simultaneously, and sometimes these pressures even conflict with each other (higher height = more access to food, but higher height also = possibly more chance of being killed by lightening, more energy expended to grow to that height, etc.).  </p>
<p>To see whether the benefit is outweighing the detriment, or whether lightening strike deaths are a limiting factor on giraffe height, or other conclusions, we would need some hard statistical data on the subject, something like: how often giraffes of different heights, at what age and with how many offspring, etc., are dying from it.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that given how uncommon and difficult to observe the event is (a migratory animal that exists in relatively low numbers, interacting with lightening), no one may have collected this type of data yet.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, it's generally considered that giraffes don't have long necks in order to eat from very high trees, but rather in order to use them to fight each other in order to determine who gets to mate with the available females. Just look up giraffe fights to see what I mean.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ledder said the lighting struck while visitors were in the park, but she did not know if anyone witnessed it. The cause of the giraffe's death was determined by a necropsy.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if that line was included almost as a &quot;despite&quot; thing. Like, &quot;Despite many (potential) witnesses, the cause of death wasn't determined until a necropsy.&quot; I've seen a close lightning strike in-person, before, and to be frank, it's so bright you can't quite tell where it struck. Just resembles &quot;sheet&quot; lightning when you're that close to the strike point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know man... Must be depending on what it hits. I was on an island in the Chesepeake when a tropical storm swept in and watched lightning hitting all around me and my Boy Scout troop at distances of less than 100ft. One hit a tree that couldn't have been more than 30ft away, and it split explosively. I clearly saw the lightning hit. </p>
<p>Saw multiple strikes his the ground, with explosions of leaves and other detritus, as well. It was crazy. In about a five minute period I saw something like thirty or forty near lightning strikes. All we could do was huddle and ride it out. Soon as there was a let-up the whole troop bolted for the bridge across the island, gambling more potential strikes against the rapidly 'shrinking' island as the water level of the bay was visibly rising.</p>
<p>But like I said, there's probably a lot of factors.  I saw ball lightning once, and that was super weird. All wobbly and slow, and then it took this looping dive into the ground fastfastfast and there was this weird silent WHUMP and a whole bunch of leaves just kinda exploded into the air as the plasma-pink 'blob' flashed out.</p></div>		</li>
