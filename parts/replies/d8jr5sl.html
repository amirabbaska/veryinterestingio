			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't you look at the gif, and calculate which side it will be on? Surely you have information about spin etc from it, and the motion of the hand and coin. So if you see it spinning in a certain way, falling in a certain way, and the hand moving in a certain way at a certain angle etc., you could calculate what side the coin would be on when it contacts the hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just another way to see how the coin landed. That doesn't change the probability of anything. You're basically saying &quot;what if I peek at the coin, then is it still 50-50?&quot; No, of course not, you know the answer. Before you do those calculations, it still is 50-50. Might as well skip the math and just open your hand and look at the coin.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your calculations are imperfect, you could just increase your chances of being correct. If you can calculate correctly 3/4 times, then your probability of being right is 3/4. You can change the probability, but you still won't know the outcome.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But you can't get one ticket, go to the clerk 100 times, and hope that one of the 100 time you'll win. </p>
<p>With the video, you basically have one ticket. </p></div>		</li>
