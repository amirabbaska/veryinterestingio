			<div class="markdown"><p>Where do you buy plastic bottles? Commercial plastic bottling uses <a href="https://imgur.com/WVq3nzl" target="_blank">uninflated bottles</a> which are inflated at the bottling plant then filled and capped. Canning is easier, they come a can bottoms and tops, you fill and crimp the top on. The crimping tool is relatively expensive. Glass bottles just need the cap pressed on, the tool is $20 and the bottles can be filled from a keg. There is even another style of glass bottle that's even easier, they have a marble in the neck, you flip them upside down,  pump soda into them, and they self seal.</p>
<p>Plastic  bottling tends to be very expensive to setup but makes very cheap bottles, glass is very cheap to setup but requires expensive bottles. Cans are in the middle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of the time I was in the hospital and I had to drink canned Gatorade.</p>
<p>It was so weird and off-putting. Mostly just because my brain did not expect Gatorade-taste when my lips touched a can.</p>
<p>Gatorade is flavored, though, so I guess this is only semi-related to your comment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further on the beer subject... &quot;Worst&quot; way to store beer is in a green/clear bottle. I say &quot;worst&quot; because they let in the most amount of light that causes the oils in beer to break down causing that skunky flavor. Most of the time this a flaw, but to an extent it can be a desired flavor for certain styles, especially German Lagers. Your next step up a brown bottle. It blocks more light keeping a somewhat cleaner taste but after longer exposure will still begin to get skunky. This can be prevented by leaving it in the box. Obviously you see many supermarkets where it is out under bright lights. A lot of those lights are special and don't emit the wave length that breaks stuff down. As air tight as a bottle seems, some air will get in under the cap which will hurt the beer faster, but the light is more apt to destroy it sooner. This really only becomes an issue when cellaring,, but in that case, a little air can be a desired effect. For the longest time, draft beer reigned supreme and still is quite nice because it is a closed system that doesn't allow light in. However if you have a party and are pressurizing the keg with a normal tap or you have a cask that relies on gravity, you will be pumping air into the keg causing the beer to quickly oxidize and get a wet cardboard flavor after a short time. If the keg is emptied in a few hours no big deal, but more than a day and you are gonna have trouble. Canning really is the &quot;best&quot; way. Modern cans have a food safe lining so you aren't getting that old metallic taste people talked about. It's air tight and light proof. You will get maximum lifespan out of your beer this way. Oils from the hops will still break down naturally over time so especially in ipas you are going to want to drink it sooner than later. Very few beers are really made to be stored so unless you really kinda know what you are doing... Drink the freshest canned beer you can get for best results. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That clear bottle is pointing out to you the cheapness of the product.  In the event I'm in Mexico, yeah, I'll drink a Corona with a lime, but I can get a bucket of those for $5 so at that point you are going for quantity and the experience of getting totally shitfaced on cheap Mexican beer.</p></div>		</li>
