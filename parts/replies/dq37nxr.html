			<div class="markdown"><p>So when I catch a fly with my hand, and throw it on the ground, why is it seemingly KOed for 10 or so seconds. They always get back up and fly away after that. What's happening? </p></div>		</li>

You can cause nervous system damage to an insect without killing it. You would just have to give it a different name and definition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry little friends. You should stop landing on me, and I wouldn't do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of stuff for invertebrates is like that. They also have ganglia instead of brains, and statocysts instead of otoliths. It all seems pretty anthropocentric and unnecessary to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I read that since insects are so small and light, you'd need a pretty strong got to kill one, way more than what a human can endure.</p>
<p>It's that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insects being small and light means they have less inertia, so speeding up and slowing down requires less energy to do. Hitting a fly really hard <em>can</em> cause structural damage, but where instantly launching a human at 60mph would liquify your organs and most definitely kill you, a fly can likely survive it as theres less force impacting them to make them move.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to note you can get concussions from landing on your tailbone as well. It's not just upper body or head hits.</p>
<p>Very fast spinning can also be another cause. Usually in contact sports.</p></div>		</li>
