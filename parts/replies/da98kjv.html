			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand the cause of SSRIs changing regulation of sexual function has more to do with the fact that they alter concentrations of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in the brain. Since a lot of libido is related to dopamine systems, changing the rate limiting step in dopamine production is what causes this alteration in libido (and for the unlucky, enzyme levels change permanently causing SSRI induced sexual dysfunction)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right on, I thought it was directly the response at serotonin transporters. I admittedly don't know anything about the dopamine mechanisms behind libido - do you have any reading material?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, with the proven fact that SSRIs lower libido and can also make maintaining an erection and ejaculating difficult, I wonder why MDMA turns ... other people definitely not me ... into nympho's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's an interaction between different neurotransmitter systems. MDMA also activates Norepinephrine and Dopamine transmission, so they probably counterbalance the inhibitory effects of serotonin alone. Just spitballing, of course - more topics on the reading pile for the future...</p></div>		</li>
