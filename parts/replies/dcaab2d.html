			<div class="markdown"><p>One moral argument is this.... we live in a time of mass biodiversity loss. Between 30 and 150 species go extinct every day. Current extinction rates are 1000 times higher than during pre-human times, so this is our mess. We made it. We're responsible. If we accept that, and if the technology is available, maybe we have a moral obligation to undo some of the wrong we have done.
Could they survive in today's world? It depends on the animal, how long it's been gone and whether or not a suitable environment exists for it to live in. We're not talking about making lonely zoo exhibits here. We're talking about make healthy, genetically vibrant populations of animals that would be released into the wild. The tasmanian tiger, for example, went extinct comparatively recently around 80 years ago, but in that time, it's native woodland has stayed more or less the same. Maybe a de-extinct tazzy tiger could survive. But there's another animal I investigated called the Christmas Island rat. It also went extinct at the beginning of the 20th century but it's homeland is now riddled with invasive species. Were we to bring it back and set it free on Christmas Island, it more than likely wouldn't survive. It's home has changed too much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your answer, and I can see why it would depend on the location and species. </p>
<p>Now, about reviving people: if we were to do that, how close would we get to <em>Clone High</em>? (/s)</p>
<p>In all seriousness, what species would be the easiest and which the hardest to bring back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Seems like the moral question is one for the philosophers and not scientists.  I'll add an additional question to this for Doctor Pilcher, then, about how scientists and philosophers would work together on this subject, especially if it means bringing back people from the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Done! I think the moral questions are for everybody. De-extinction has the potential to profoundly alter the fate of life on our planet. It's something that anyone with an inclination should be invited to think about.
In my book, I talk about the possibility of de-extincting Neanderthals or Elvis Presley, but I stress these are thought experiments only. No one is seriously considering de-extincting people of any kind. I was merely interested to see what the limits of the current technology are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the Neanderthals make a lovely analogy for what you were saying in other comments about environment and nurture -- after all, it would be hard to argue that they would do well in the modern world. It's quite a bit of food for thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extinct animals don't necessarily mean the animal can't survive in our world, but that circumstances denied them a suitable environment during their time. Dietary issues aside, our planet seems to be fairly well developed to handle most species of the past except the giant insects (outside of pressurized oxygen chambers).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some de-extinct animals almost certainly could survive in our world, but there are plenty that wouldn't. There's no point bringing back the Yangtze river dolphin, for example, because the rivers that it swam in are far too polluted to provide it with a home.
Add to that, that all living things belong to ecosystems; biological communities of interacting life forms and the space they live in. When ecosystems are healthy, they are beautifully balanced. Chuck in a species that's new or that's been gone for a while and it's like chucking a spanner into a car engine. If you're lucky, nothing much happens and the engine ticks along. But if you're unlucky, the whole things grinds to a halt. With this in mind, the later stages of de-extinction, where animals will be released into the wild, need to be very carefully thought through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ecosystems getting upset is a natural occurrence on a regular basis (mind you, not as fast as what humans are doing), so species come and go all the time over the course of earth's history. It's just a matter of achieving equilibrium with the environment itself. But we need not try to put them in a place where nature and man have already taken hold, but rather to seek a third option. While a recently extinct species does have the potential to upset an environment, that doesn't preclude an ability to create an ecosystems for them in the coming future. It would just be a matter of when and how because if we could bring dinosaurs back to life, I'm sure science would have marched to the point where we can build large scale terrariums. </p></div>		</li>
