			<div class="markdown"><p>You're welcome! The crux of the issue is effectively that average folks who own and control their own computer and practice decent computer security don't really have to worry about this issue (just don't run unknown software from sketchy sites or torrents). People who are potentially targets of nation-states, or whose employer/school exercises deep control over their computer, should be very worried. This is why you see Mark Zuckerberg covering his laptop camera (and microphone) but even mid-level employees of Facebook don't bother.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, anyone with an accessible camera is at risk.  If a certain laptop has entry to be webcam, then so do all laptops of the same model.  Companies do release software to fix these entry points, but people rarely bother with them, leaving webcams open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Average folks don't practice decent computer security. I have a few security certifications, and this is the first lesson you learn on entering the field. :)</p>
<p>Though you're right about the second bit. Most hackers have no interest in flipping on your webcam to watch you as you play Overwatch.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Additionally, audio could be much more sensitive than video data</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More to the point, the few people I personally know who do cover up the camera (one of which actually did it in a permanent, non-reversable way on a MacBook) usually do not bother with disabling the sound in any way or form. If someone really wants to hurt me by techniques like this, I personally find sound way more invasive than video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take this &quot;real world&quot; example with a grain of salt. Yes there ARE a few proof of concept attacks out there that theoretically could disable the light on CERTAIN MODELS OF CAMERAS. The models of cameras that ARE vulnerable may all require a DIFFERENT method of attack (the same exploit won't work on every camera.)</p>
<p>Note that I didn't say ALL cameras. Many of the recording lights are hard wired to the recording function of the camera and can't be controlled independently of the camera.</p>
<p>Also, the proof of concept attacks frequently involve physical access to the machine to gain the desired access, or at the very least they have to have pretty nasty rootkits installed.</p>
<p>An attack like this can take an extreme amount of time and effort. VERY few hackers in the world have the ability to pull off such a feat. Most of us don't know someone smart enough to maliciously target us as individuals, and there isn't really a lot to be gained by some random person off the street hacking a random citizens webcam. What would they gain? Pics of me in my underwear? Of my dog running around like a huge derp? There isn't really a viable reason to perform such a hack if you aren't doing some sort of espionage.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, yes CERTAIN webcams can THEORETICALLY transmit data without the light on, but the feasibility of doing so is so unlikely that I consider it to absolutely be an act of paranoia. (I work in IT, I've studied the likelihood of this exact thing happening.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's cute, everyone's an infosec expert all of a sudden.</p>

<li>
<p>Most cameras still control the light with vulnerable software because it's cheaper than an inline LED.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You aren't specifically targeted, but you don't need to be.  Compromising your typical user is done in bulk and then control of your computer is used or sold (<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/rat-breeders-meet-the-men-who-spy-on-women-through-their-webcams/" target="_blank">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/rat-breeders-meet-the-men-who-spy-on-women-through-their-webcams/</a>)</p>

<li>
<p>Even if the light isn't bypassed, taking a picture would only flash it and the user probably wouldn't notice or think anything of it</p>

<li>Collecting embarrassing webcam footage is a popular scam.  They will blackmail you for money or threaten to send it to your facebook friends/contact list</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted this in a similar thread but it got burried.  I have experience with designing  electronics with camera systems.</p>
<p>While there cant be a unified software &quot;spyware&quot; that can access any webcam on command without the light on. If you know what laptop the user in question is using, you can target the chips controlling the camera feed. </p>
<p>So this would be possible if someone really had a motive and some serious time and backdoor information.</p>
<p>The light in question is cotrolled by firmware in thr chips vs any software on the computer os. But the programming pins of many chips are used as duel purpose Input/output so the datalines in the motherboard. So with certian protocols you could theoretically reprogram the chip with deep complex spyware, to ignore the light in certian instances.</p>
<p>This would not be something any manufacturer is really aware of or protects against but its possible in certain cases.</p></div>		</li>
