			<div class="markdown"><p>Great examples, though I have one question about how the relationship applies in finance, (this might be either gibberish or off topic, if so my apologies). It might just be easier to ask for more detail or some examples, in fact. I know that there are  mathematical ways in which exponential functions operate in finance, but I'm fairly dim in both finance and maths. </p>
<p>At forest I thought, well, compound interest -but is that less to do with the rate of change as it relates to the amount of something at a point in time, and more about the type of change? Interest accrues at set, repetitive temporal points, after all...</p>
<p>Does this query make sense? Its in articulate I know, but that's why I'm asking!</p></div>		</li>

<p>You brought up compound interest, which basically means the interest for an entire year is &quot;divided&quot; and then applied at certain points over the course of the entire year. You could compound twice a year, or four times a year, or even every single day, or even every minute of every day.</p>
<p>Assume you have a fixed interest rate, and you compound at different rates. As it turns out, the more often you compound during a year, the more money you'll end up with at the end. For example, suppose you have a 100% interest rate (not realistic obviously, but it makes the math easier) and you invest $1 at the beginning of the year. </p>
<p>If you compound once over the whole year, you'll end up with $2.</p>
<p>If you compound twice over that year, then you'll apply 50% interest ($100/2) twice, so you'll end up with $1<em>(1.50)</em>(1.50) or $2.25.</p>
<p>If you compound n times over that year, you'll end up with (1+1/n)^n. As n goes up, this value goes up.</p>
<p>But, the value doesn't go up forever, it levels off. Try plugging really big values of n into this equation, and you'll see it won't go higher than $2.71...This value is exactly $e. In fact, one way to define e is in terms of this limit, as n approaches infinity. So, if you compound continuously, which is like compounding every single second throughout the entire year, the exponential function pops out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a metaphorical 5 years old when it comes to maths so bear with me please</p>
<p>So in compound interests, if the annual interest rate is 100% and is applied twice to my balance, does this mean it would be 50%  + 50%? So if in year 1 I have $10, by June I would have 10 + ($5 from interest of 50% * $10) = $15, and then by december of year 1 I would have $15 + (50% * $15)? </p>
<p>I totally understood the approaching infinity = e part though, I think. </p></div>		</li>
