			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your willingness to play devil's advocate here but the fact is that the data the administration has deleted relating to climate change hasn't resurfaced. Very quickly and quietly they removed data on global climate statics. Were they to be interested in just moving the funding around the data would still be available. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at NOAA. They are experts at analyzing remote data, but not at building or launching satellites. It makes sense that any funding related to the manufacture and launching of earth observing satellites would go to an agency that knows how to do that, NASA.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It wouldn't even necessarily be NASA. The Navy and Air Force are really concerned with oceanography and meteorology and have launched countless satellites over the years too. I know NOAA has used many Navy and Air Force assets for gathering the data to be analyzed</p>
<p>That said, I have my doubts that's the thinking behind cutting the funding from NASA in the first place</p></div>		</li>
