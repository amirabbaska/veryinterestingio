			<div class="markdown"><p>Except at below freezing temperatures, once you break up the ice to single water molecules, it'll freeze back into ice once the molecules come in contact because it doesn't have enough energy to overcome the attraction of the hydrogen bonds. You'd need very low concentration to keep the molecules gas-like. </p></div>		</li>
