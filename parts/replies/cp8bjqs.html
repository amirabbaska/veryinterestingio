<p>Let us have a piece of steel which we have managed to get all the electrons out of.  It is now strongly positively charged. </p>
<p>All those positive charged atoms will repel each other causing a Coulomb explosion.  </p>
<p>However, getting that piece of steel to be only positively charged is difficult and it will grab electrons from nearby materials as you try to eject electrons and they will grab from other nearby materials until everything balances out.</p>
<p>So the answer is no in pretty much every scenario where there are adjacent materials that will give up their electrons (which is almost all scenarios).  It is yes in any scenarios where you can stop the metal from pulling electrons and can positively charge it enough to go boom.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And how would one do this, other than by hiring Maxwell's Demon?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The answer is that the question is too vaguely worded for a simple yes or no. Things like the size of the metal sample matters: are we talking two atoms or two kilograms? Are we using a laser or can we throw whole hypothetical stars worth of energy at it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coulomb explosion is an interesting phenomenon, but for those that don't have a feel for these things, it is important to realise that the conditions required to trigger a Coulomb explosion are extremely unusual.  In 99.999999999% of everyday situations, a metal that loses many electrons will get some back somehow, because it will become highly charged and start stealing electrons from its surroundings, by arcing or by other means.</p></div>		</li>
