<p>Logical fallacy: appeal to authority.</p>
<p>If you're gonna call someone out, at least give evidence. Don't just hit back with another fallacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having studied a field does lend more credibility in said field than someone who has not studied the field at all. You wouldn't call a plumber to fix your wiring, would you?</p>
<p>If I had made a claim on my own, then you could expect some evidence to back it up. I simply stated that there is no evidence supporting any other claims made here (at the time of my posting), and that there is no credible scientific evidence explaining the phenomenon that OP was asking about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That said, Mr Doc here, having his superior doc knowledge by just being a doctor, should be able to easily disprove the point. No one else was claiming to have any more than anecdotal evidence.</p></div>		</li>
