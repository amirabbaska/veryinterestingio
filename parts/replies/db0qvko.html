			<div class="markdown"><p>Is is possible to say that the path is effected/skewed by your hydration? If your skin is well hydrated it's conductivity will be higher, thereby causing the current to travel through the skin, leaving severe burns, as opposed to traveling through the body and hitting vital organs. </p>
<p>I have no idea about the elemental makeup of skin, so if it has many alkaline elements more water may actually reduce it's conductivity. Sorry for rambles hah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could play a role, however, there are so many variables to consider when you go beyond just the human anatomy. Clothing, level of saturation (remember water by itself is only conductive through it's very slight polarization, it's the salts and metals in the water that actually transfer electrons).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make it sound like being shocked is a common occurrence for an electrician. Not being an electrician myself, is it actually common and, if so, why don't you take more precautions to prevent it?</p>
<p>EDIT: also, what's the source of the shock? Live electrical components, or from stored energy, like in capacitors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does affect it.  As does many other biological factors, where it enters, it's path to ground through your body etc.    If you happen to be cut or pierces into the blood stream, your resistance can be as low as 300 ohms.  In perfect conditions, as high as 100000 ohms.</p>
<p>Another thing people haven't mentioned as much above this is that it is current that kills you, not voltage. When lightning bolts have a relatively low current considering the resistance of air, which is why you can be hit an electric fence for example, or a tesla gun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but like you said it flows proportionally and the vast majority of current is going to flow down the low resistance paths</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's what path of least resistance leads you to believe. A lot will also go through you (not nearly as much though) and you'd still be cooked.</p>
<p>There is something called a Faraday cage that works a lot like that though </p></div>		</li>
