			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to undergo random polygraph tests, conducted by the AFOSI in order to maintain my security clearance while I served in the Air Force. Some of the questions seemed rote, and repetitive, but they would toss in random questions as well, to gauge the reaction. So no, it’s not evidence, but it can certainly lead to people asking questions you may not want to answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Its the psychological impact on the people being tested that they are after.  Same with police.   If you think those readings on the machine might out you you are more likely to not hide anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well of course. Then again what's politically expedient for one side isn't for the other, so if you reverse the results you're just reversing who's grandstanding it as fact versus suddenly caring about the scientific reliability.</p></div>		</li>
