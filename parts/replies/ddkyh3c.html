			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good overview of what physicists call the &quot;Free lunch hypothesis&quot; (more on that later). But please allow me to correct some mistakes you made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matter can actually be created spontaneously in our universe, but only if it is immediately destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Matter can be created spontanously, but there's no physical law that says it has to decay instantly again. I'm sure you know the famous relation between Energy and mass, E = mc², that says that a tiny amount of mass equals a huge amount of energy (because c² is a <em>big</em> number).</p>
<p>Well, just like we can build devices that turn matter into energy (nuclear bombs), we can build devices that turn energy into matter. Particle accelerators like the LHC function based on that principle.</p>
<p>As to what you initially referred to with that statement (virtual particles), you need to be careful with that too. When taken literally, &quot;Particles popping into and out of existence&quot; cause a huge problem, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant_problem" target="_blank">Vacuum catastrophe</a>, where Theories predict a physical value that lies 100 orders of magnitude (A Googol, a number so big that some ambitious people named a company after it) above the actual, observed value. This isn't just some rounding error. Saying you are about as big as the observable universe would be a better approximation.</p>
<p>As a consequence, virtual particles are only really a mathematical tool that help us figure out how certain interactions happen (and they're very good at that!), nothing that really has any physical meaning to it.</p>
<p>However, - and now back to OPs question - your conclusion is spot on. The universe &quot;springing&quot; into existence doesn't necessarily have to violate the conservation of energy if it pays back that energy eventually.</p>
<p>Other theories take a different approach and claim that we live in a Zero-Energy universe where (negative) gravitational potential energy and (positive) energy in the form of matter cancel each other out exactly.</p></div>		</li>
