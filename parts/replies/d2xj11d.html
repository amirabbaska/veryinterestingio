			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_broadcasting" target="_blank">AM radio uses the amplitude of the radio wave to vary the output</a>. So a spike in this wave will be treated like a normal signal. The radio doesn't know it just heard a lightening strike, it just knows it saw a very loud sound and propagates this to the rest of the radio</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I drive by a business on my way to work and i always get interference on my AM station when i am in front of it. I have listened to FM at this same location with no distortion whatsoever. Is it possible that there is an illegal broadcast coming from the building or are their electronics more powerful than my am radio?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup lightning is pretty messy, radio spectrum wise, and can produce some very low frequency radiation. Low frequency radiation travels around earth rather well, it turns out. So much so that the project <a href="http://en.blitzortung.org/whats_new.php" target="_blank">Blitzortung</a> uses low frequency detectors placed around the world to report timing information that is used to calculation the location of lightning around the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha this is kinda what I did for my lab project, which I'm typing up right now. Check out this graph, it's a waveform of the EM interference of a spark gap. </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QcD4gkz.jpg?1" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/QcD4gkz.jpg?1</a></p>
<p>This was at 10 cm across a 43 kOhm resistor. The spark gap was only supplied with 5 V (stepped up to 50 kV). The interference was measurable up to like 1 m. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its weird but I love that sound.</p>
<p>Sitting in a car when you are almost home, the rain starting to come down, pitter patter. Lightening in the background, and the crackle of the radio...</p></div>		</li>
