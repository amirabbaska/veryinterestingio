			<div class="markdown"><p>There probably isn't an end of the universe, it just loops back to itself, sort of how if you travel on a straight line around a cylinder, you end up where you started, as the cylinder is 3D. If you go to the edge of the observable universe, you just find more universe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no edge. There cannot be an edge. The universe is infinite, it is compromised of everything that is, everything that was, and everything that will ever be. If there were an edge to the universe, that would mean that there is something beyond the edge, which would destroy the definition of everything. </p></div>		</li>
