			<div class="markdown"><p>For avocados, the oil content keeps increasing while it is on the tree , up to a year or more for some varieties. That provides the creaminess. The dry matter (starches, etc) increases as well, and water content goes down. During the last stage, usually after it's picked, some of the dry matter is converted to simple sugars.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Avocados flower in Feb-March. Some types will ripen that summer, others won't ripen until the following summer. I planted a Reed this winter. Fingers crossed it will set fruit six months from now, and I'll get the first avocado off of it another ~ 14 months after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would be my assumption. Frozen and canned vegetables have a higher nutritional content than your local grocery store raw veggies. This is because they can be picked closer to peak ripeness prior to canning/freezing whereas raw has to be picked early so they will still be in sellable condition at the store. I would venture a guess that farmers market produce grown locally has a higher nutritional value than store bought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think store bought would be about as nutritious, so long as you get one that ripens correctly. Hass avocados last pretty well once they have been picked and keep ripening off the tree - that's one of the reasons those are the ones that you see in stores. Home grown are nice because you can get different types of avocados with different flavors and textures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean enzymes denaturing proteins into smaller proteins and even single amino acids right? Amino acid chains and proteins are the same thing technically.  I didn’t know that was a big part of fruit ripening either, I thought it was 99% the first part, starch being converted to mono and disaccharides.  Makes sense that proteins are denatured and clipped too though with the pH changes and such.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Technically yes, but a functioning protein has tertiary and quaternary structure which gives it function. A protein that loses this structure and has become a loose chain of amino acids is no longer a functioning protein. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be some hearsay I'm recalling from ten+years ago, but the understanding I had is that raw meat had some advantages with usable complex proteins being readily available. The person who said this was also statin siting the cooking process is more for making safe food.</p>
<p>Reflecting on that statement, to my knowledge, stomach acid would also denature a protein structure, generally causing it to break or unfold. Ultimately this could be an all science questions on it's own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, hope I’m getting this right.  A proteins gotta have 3 or 4 levels of something and when it’s only got 2 or 1 it’s an amino acid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice catch, what I really meant by proteins to a.a. chains was the denaturing of proteins that occurs  via heat when cooking meat, and to some extent over time in ripened fruits, probably via pH and other changes that occur as the cell walls become more permeable. I wanted to give an intuitive explanation, but you are more correct. </p>
<p>And i think most of the changes in taste do occur because of starch breakdown, but I thought OP would wanna hear about proteins, too. The breakdown of structural proteins is a big reason why ripened fruits are usually softer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes actually, cooking eggs causes the proteins to denature and actually tangle up, causing that delicious egg white consistency. Same thing happens with gelatin, also a protein, as you heat it up and let it cool. </p>
<p>Please don't eat newly hatched chicks lol. </p></div>		</li>
