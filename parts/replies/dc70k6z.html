</blockquote>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p>At the point where any further temperature changes in the two objects in OPs scenario are insignificant we would say that they are in (dynamic) equilibriumâ€”but they continue both to radiate and absorb energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Continuing the sun-earth example, radiation equilibrium is actually the crux of climate change. The Earth absorbs and radiates but carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases absorb some frequencies better than the atmosphere on average, thus increasing the temperature at which the Earth reaches equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. </p>
<p>As a bit of a further clarification for those to which this is new, the frequency of emitted radiation of any object is determined by the temperature of that object. Since the earth is cooler than the sun, it emits a different frequency. Because this frequency gets absorbed better by greenhouse gasses, less energy ends up leaving the earth. </p>
<p>For the earth to remain at a balanced temperature, it needs to have as much energy going out as is coming in. Both of which are almost entirely done through radiation coming in/going out. Because we now have less energy going out, it must heat up to a new, higher temperature where ingoing/outgoing energy will match up again.</p>
<p>The problem here is not in the radiation/light that is reflected off of the earth (as is sometimes mistakenly stated), but comes from the (black body) radiation emitted by the earth itself, which has a different (invisible) frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's completely accurate. It might be an additional cause of warming on the earth. However, the main reason that the earth is warming is that carbon dioxide acts as a barrier which causes less heat to radiate from the earth into space. This effect is similar to why wearing a down jacket in the winter keeps you warm. Because the earth is radiating less heat, its equilibrium temperature rises. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other responder says they both continue to radiate but they remain at the same temperature then it is an equilibrium. This is really no different than if you take two objects and touch them together, there is constantly energy being transferred between them even if they don't change temperature, in which case there is no net flow between them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fun fact, the space shuttle was difficult to cool, and as such those bay doors we're largely radiator. Once closed they had a very limited window to get back onto the ground before the equipment started to overheat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more about thermal emissivity and unobstructed paths out. The fins of a computer heat sink are closely packed because your forcing air through them with a fan so all surface area that allows wind flow is good surface area. With radiation you have a random direction picked to radiate. Surface area in the middle of a traditional fin would be more likely to hit the next fin and be reabsorbed then radiated away.</p>
<p>Here is a good look at the ISS radiators. </p>

<p>As you can see they don't look like a traditional radiator and are much more open. They've got a high emissivity coating and ammonia is used to carry heat into them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surface area, infrared emissivity, and operating temperature.</p>
<p>Thermal conductivity is useful but it isn't the most important property because there are other (more efficient) ways to make heat flow into the radiator: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pipe" target="_blank">heat pipes</a> for small satellites or active thermal loops (basically a pump forcing the fluid to flow) for large spacecraft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there is a possibility of rotation most spacecrafts go for the BBQ roll that is 1-2 RPM rotation that allows for equal heating of the entire surface.Most upper stages provide the rotation before the payload separation and it is different from spin stabilisation that is done to provide boost SRM like Star48B used as a third stage of Atlas551 on New Horizon launch and many other deep space missions they usually require 10-15 RPM rotation for stability.</p>
<p>Apollo SM and CM were in fact a gigantic radiator and that was a problem in Apollo 13 because the spacecraft was so efficient in cooling that temperature dropped too fast without heating.</p>
<p>Radiators like on ISS use liquid cooling and are tracking the sun just like the solar panels but for obvious reasons show their least area toward sun rays.</p>
<p>ISS cooling and air circulation is a very complex problem and the station has returned plenty of good data on how to design such systems in the future.</p>
<p>Other systems related to heating/cooling would be the heating elements in electronics and fuel tanks on deep space probles that are there to allow for optimal operation in deep space or allow for liquid form for different storable propellants like UDMH MMH or Hydrazine and NTO because all these melt at -60 to +2 deg C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothetically, couldn't one technically cool using phase changing?</p>
<p>Hear me out. I've made my own ghetto dry ice by flipping my propane torch upside down and having it release liquid propane under pressure. As it is above its phase change pressure once out of the bottle it rapidly cools to a very chilly temperature as it expands and loses energy. SOOOO. Hypothetically one could have a radiator alongside this and remove heat, no? </p>
<p>Think of it as RCS cooling? As a closed loop wouldn't really work as you still have to radiate the heat away like a fridge (Or your computers heatsink). Buuuut. If you just go psshhh pshhh, you could give a short term blast of chillage.</p>
<p>*Note - I am aware the ISS uses liquid Ammonia closed loop cooling, but that is neither light nor compact.
Obviously not shuttle material no?</p>
<p>I mean, obviously NASA would have thought of this already and said no because weight, but does it have any technical merit in terms of actually being a cooling technique?</p>
<p>**Note 2 - Sorry if my sciency talk is a bit dumb. I have a high school education consisting of the most basic of science classes, as I was rather lazy. I've learned almost all my scientific know-how (No matter how limited) from the magical internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you could cool stuff down by using phase change to pump heat in something that you then eject outside (gas, solide, whatever).</p>
<p>However for spacecraft you really want to limit your launch mass as much as you can and maximize the lifespan. Having some consumables is not good for either. Usually heat is not big enough of a problem for your system to be useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you should mention that.  I had a situation years ago where I was removing acetone from an extremely porous medium in a vacuum oven.  The material was in a glass jar on top of a thin wire shelf.   The oven was at a toasty 85C or so.  I put the material in, pulled vac and walked away. </p>
<p>Came back an hour or so later and the medium was frozen.  This was caused by the evaporation of some of the acetone, which removed heat at a much faster rate than the radiant heating (and limited conduction from the wire shelf) could add it back.</p>
<p>And that's how you freeze something in an oven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd suggest you look up the space shuttle's <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/shutref/orbiter/eclss/overview.html" target="_blank">flash evaporator</a> system.</p>
<p>The shuttle used radiators on the inside of the payload bay doors, but when those weren't enough, or when the doors were closed they let pumped the heat into water then let it boil off.</p>
<p>Note that the water used was &quot;free&quot; since the shuttle used oxygen, hydrogen fuel cells to produce electricity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly, yes, although if objects are really close together (less than the wave length of IR radiation) you can get energy transfer through <a href="http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v10/n3/full/nnano.2015.34.html" target="_blank">near-field</a> effects as well. It's mostly the same thing (i.e. electromagnetic radiation), but near-field radiation works a little different from the far-field radiation we're typically used to.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the electromagnetic waves don't just add energy to the system they enter, but they also add energy to the vacuum between the systems. So the temperature of the vacuum (which is determined solely by the number and energy of the photons inside it because there are no particles in there) will also equilibrate with the temperature of the objects.</p></div>		</li>
