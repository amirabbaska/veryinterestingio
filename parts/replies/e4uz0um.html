			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a dull, nagging and slowly increasing pain, sort of, that starts to travel from the balls to the stomach. Also, there is a significant delay, about 10-20 seconds, where you can panic about the pain you are about to receive, and ponder about your poor life choices that led you to that exact moment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This one. It's an existential pain. Part of you feels like the pain will never go away, and you wish you had never existed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would describe it more as intense and screaming but whatevs.</p>
<p>Edit: But yeah, that 10 seconds or so where you're trying to gauge exactly how hard the hit was and how horrible the pain is about to be are some of the worst moments of dread you'll ever experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why the tap is so scary. You don't know how intense the pain will become. Was it just a soft bump that may ache a little ? Or was is the crack of the whip that will send you into an intestinal rage plagued by fire and thorns and strip you completely of all sense of self as your entire existence becomes pain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain is subjective however I can try to expand your understanding with my personal experiences. It’s a cold sharp pain that knocks the wind out of you. It radiates to your stomach causing you to hunch over. This generally is at its most intense (1min) and then it can be anywhere up to half an hour as you writhe around on the ground moaning as the pain slowly abates. Once you are able to walk it’s straight to the bathroom to check for bruising. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I don't think I have seen mentioned and is one of the weirder parts to me, is on top of the pain is this sensation of pressure, and I know this is weird way to describe it but it's almost like really needing to pee, but as if the only way you could relieve that pressure is to pee out of hole that doesn't exist, like there's a phantom pee hole in the testicle region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you can have a group of a hundred guys, and the moment they witness one guy take a shot, they will all, in unison, go &quot;oooooooo&quot; and cringe and kneel over. One mans pain is felt by every man in a 10 yard vicinity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate: it's a cold sharp pain <em>initially</em>, in your ballsack. That pain is like stubbing your toe very hard, and dissipates about as quickly. The pain that radiates to your stomach is a <em>deep, aching</em> pain that last for ages, and often causes men to throw up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a sharp pain, it's a dull ache that starts shortly after getting hit in the nuts that goes up into your entire groin and internal stomach area.  </p>
<p>It's like trying to describe a color... Very difficult.</p></div>		</li>
