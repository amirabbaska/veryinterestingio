			<div class="markdown"><p>its a simple answer that isn't easy to do in practice.</p>
<p>make sure you recognize when you're doing it, and tell yourself that this isn't what you want to be doing, and stop doing it when you catch yourself doing it. Over time you will condition yourself to recognize it as bad behavior. But you have to recognize that you are in fact doing it and it is in fact bad behavior you dont want. Until you can accept that its a problem and being honest with yourself that its happening, there's not much you can do.</p>
<p>Thats the simple answer. The more complex answer is why you do these things you do, and thats why people go to therapists. They delve into how these things manifested themselves and try to fix them at the root, and I am not a therapist so can't do much for you there. If you can't condition yourself or it feels too deep rooted to do on your own, you gotta talk to a professional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard because self destructive behaviors just feel good. Even though you can be ruining your friendships, family, or life in general, it's almost comforting. Just letting yourself sink into it is awful but so much more relaxing in a way. It's a dangerous and vicious cycle</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is good advice. I just wanted to add that the type of therapy that focuses changing these types of ingrained bahaviors is called CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). When looking for a therapist to work out these types of problems with it's good to look for that under their specializations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also not enough to simply know that you have problem behaviors. You have to constantly monitor and prevent them.  And even that is often a struggle</p>
<p>I've always had a problem with procrastination. I can find any activity preferable to the task at hand. I know how much stress I subject myself to when I choose to put a task off. I recite to myself that I can either desk with the unpleasant task once, and do it, or deal with the unpleasant task several times, prolonging the unpleasantness until I actually get the thing done. </p>
<p>I still almost uniformly choose to prolong the suffering. It makes me feel like a crazy person. </p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>recognize your emotion or behaviour that is destructive </p>
</li>
<li>name it  , be really descriptive you might need to expand your vocabulary from just sad and lost , i did </li>
<li>
<p>now ask yourself why do i feel this way , an ishikawa diagramm may help , its a really simple tool for finding the roots of a problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now logically argue why your feelings are unbased in reality, or your perspective on things is skewed ( this is the most important part )   </p>
</li>
<li>repeat , after a while healthy thinking will be the norm , dont expect too much progress in days </li>
</ol>
<p>for example : i feel sad and hated because i think a person (or people in general) hates me / counter argument : why should he hate me i have never done anything that would upset him , infact i have been always nice to him.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also seeking professional help is never a bad idea</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much.  </p>
<p>My Wife's mother messed her up pretty bad emotionally (cut ties with her years ago), but the residual effects remain.  My Wife is getting therapy help, but as a husband I have no idea how to help and when I do try it is usually met with her emotionally destroying herself (&quot;I'm such a terrible person&quot;, etc) which is the exact opposite of what I intended!  </p>
<p>Anyway, you offer some good suggestions, I will pass them along.  She does recognize her behavior matches some of her mother's emotionally abusive behavior...she really doesn't want to be that way and is trying to adjust to a more positive and constructive response to stresses, etc.</p></div>		</li>
