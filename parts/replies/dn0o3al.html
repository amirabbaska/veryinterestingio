			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case Japan are trying to be the more mature nation by not really responding to it. Yes they could up the ante by shooting down the missile, but they are proving their willingness to talk the problem away by not reacting to it with means other than words. Good work Japan</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, they probably couldn't shoot down the missile. If it's cruising over Japan, it will be <em>waaaaaaay</em> out of range of any of their missile defense systems. Even the US wouldn't have the tech to shoot it down, since it's basically in the upper atmosphere.</p>
<p>And IIRC, Japan's constitution prevents them from declaring war without actually being <em>attacked</em> first - That was part of the treaties they signed after WWII; It was meant to curb any future ideas of invading other countries, because their &quot;army&quot; is just a small force meant for self defense, and isn't actually allowed to be large enough for a foreign invasion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not <em>entirely</em> true. We've got the tech to certainly attempt it, after all we have shot down satellites. The odds of success with so little preparation are astronomical, but it is possible.</p>
<p>You're right though, normally ballistic missiles are intercepted on the way back down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically the Passing Lane Principle - Everybody hates the asshole who cruises in the passing lane. But the people (cops) with the power to do something about it don't bother. So people continue cruising in the passing lane. But if a cop happened to want to pull someone over already, they could easily use &quot;cruising in the passing lane&quot; as an excuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that; rules have tremendous social value. They are a signaling device which provide some sort of guidance as to what sorts of actions are likely to incite retribution. They formalize agreements between parties. The aren't imaginary, they are artificial, made by people and they are only important insofar as people choose to use them.</p></div>		</li>
