			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this sounds weird... but it is as if we have an inner eye closing as well as our outer eyes (eyelids).</p>
<p>When I close my eyelids tight ... no sound.</p>
<p>When I close these imaginery inner eyes, the muscle mentioned by other posters, then the rumbling is always there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oh my god, i know exactly what you mean! I've never been able to explain it. it only happens sometimes for me, like sometimes if i try to do it it won't work but currently it is. it kind of reminds me of a closing sound too but I cannot describe the sound at all. i can do the sound with my eyes open better also. for some reason I always thought it was fluid in my ears, since it only happens sometimes. it's more frequent in mornings too. </p></div>		</li>
