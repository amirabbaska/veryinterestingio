			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know. It would be useful if Windows could point out to the curprit. Something like &quot;your computer just crashed. It's possible that the error is related to the drivers of your chipset. If the computer reboots, try updating them to the latest stable version&quot;</p>
<p>Or &quot;bcd error: That's an error with the windows boot record, possibly caused by file corruption. Get a windows installation disk. Follow these steps for automated repair, if that doesn't work enter these commands in the command line, if that fails, reinstall windows&quot;</p>
<p>To many people, that's as obscure as your typical Windows BSOD, but there are non software developers who would understand it and may be able to fix the issue</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some errors, the steps to fix them might not be known at the time of writing. </p>
<p>Honestly, a BSOD shouldn't even happen in the first place, and prompts an immediate reboot unless you explicitly tell Windows to display them. Writing meaningful errors for that kind of error is a waste of effort. </p>
<p>In most cases though, I agree Microsoft could do something about their error messages. I mean, even &quot;download failed&quot; is more useful than &quot;0x000000b4&quot;</p></div>		</li>
