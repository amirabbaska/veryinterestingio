			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently went to trade school and it took me an analogy similar to this to actually understand.
I always thought, with DC, the power has a source, but ac, where is it coming from?
But the electricity isint actually travelling. Similar to heat, it's the molecules moving in an object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more analogous to sound. The charge carriers (the balls in this analogy) are <em>vibrating</em>. While their total change in position is 0, the energy of them bumping into each other does in fact travel. That's the hole point of using electric power in the first place, we can take energy from one form and convert it to electric potential and then transmit it across wires by vibrating the charge carriers back and forth, then converting that energy into something useful. </p>
<p>Comparing it to heat is a bad analogy. Electric fields can exist and act on other charges without moving. That said, the study of heat directly led to some of the math behind our understanding of electric fields and systems, especially in radio communication. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically speaking, electrical, liquid and mechanical systems are analogous.  The easiest comparison to make is between electrical and liquid fluid systems, where voltage is equivalent to pressure, current is equivalent to flow rate and resistance is equivalent to pipe resistance/diameter.  You can literally describe these types of systems using the same equations, just changing out the units.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does a paint shaker mix up paint if the paint never leaves the small enclosure?</p>
<p>Just because AC current pushes, then pulls electrons 60 times a second in the US (50 times per second in many other places), it doesn’t mean there is no energy to do work with. </p>
<p>Here’s another analogy. You can light a match by running it along in a straight line against the striker (DC), or you could light it by scrubbing it quickly in one small place on the striker (AC). In both cases you are transferring energy as motion which becomes heat.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yet another analogy: The pistons in your car only travel back and forth a small distance (AC), so how can they possibly move your car forward more than that? Shouldn’t your car just shake in place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I'm having trouble understanding this.  All of this makes it sound like electricity comes in, makes a loop, and goes back to the wall or to the power source.  That sounds fundamentally wrong to me.  </p>
<p>Someone made a good analogy earlier about transferring energy by standing in a pool and walking back and forth, which transfers energy and creates waves, and somehow that's important because distance traveled ultimately ends up being zero. This is where I'm also struggling (I get the math, but it feels strange intuitively).  If I walked back and forth, I expended energy and it wouldn't have mattered if my travel is zero when I've walked a mile in true distance in that pool. </p>
<p>Moreover, I think it's also difficult to conceptualize what electricity IS.  It's so alien. </p>
<p>I read that the electrons want to travel through the cord  (I 'get' resistance), and leave their energy, but wouldn't it just get used up?  Moreover, with a/c how do we 'tell' the electrons to first go left, then right, if the scales are so small?  Does the electron just move so fast that it brings it's own heat, and the heat is how we power things?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How far does a given electron move?  That's always been something I've wondered.  It's probably in the realm of nano meters if not less right?</p>
<p>Edit:  I'm basically picturing either a bunch of electrons flowing back and forth like a liquid, with about a foot range (which I know is wrong but helps) or the possibly more accurate electrons vibrating at a about an angstrom per millisecond.  What's more correct?  I'm really wondering, does an electron move far from its &quot;original&quot; atom (Cu nucleus), and if so, how far (in atom lengths)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not a dumb question are all. </p>

<p>Yea that analogy is terrible. It's better said that cables are an <em>energy</em> hose. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>but if the electrons aren't moving</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are. Back and forth. Over time the average distance they travel is zero. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do they convince the machine to do work?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't convince anything. Charge doesn't &quot;think&quot; or make decisions. Engineers do. This is all manipulation of the physical phenomena that occur when charges move, don't anthropomorphize anything. </p>
<p>Simplest example: an AC generator plugged into an AC motor. </p>
<p>An AC generator has some physical mechanism like moving water, moving wind, or an engine spinning a coil of wire around a magnet and connected to power line. This will push electrons down the line, then pull them back. The electrons inside the power line push and pull, vibrating back and forth. </p>
<p>At the other end of the power line is another coil around a magnet. This is our motor. Pushing and pulling charge through the coil will cause it to spin, just like in the generator. This makes our motor turn. We can then make it do something, like say spin our closes in a washing machine or move an axle to do something in a factory. </p>
<p>Now we don't <em>need</em> electronics to do any of this. We could have a mechanical system that spins a gear controlling a really long crankshaft to spin our washing machine. The difference is we would need our washing machine to be super close to a river or engine to account for total losses in the system and how big our crankshaft needs to be. </p>
<p>The property of electronics that is useful is that we need far less material to transfer the energy over long distances, making it more efficient and economical. </p>
<p>And you may ask, well what about DC electronics? And the answer is we have some clever ways to convert the pushing/pulling of electrons into constant pushing or constant pulling in circuits called AC/DC converters. The mechanical equivalent would be bigass springs and crankshafts that only move in one direction. Those would be expensive and big, while the electrical components can fit in a tiny box. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent explanation! I have always had trouble conceptualizing how electronics work, particularly with AC. To your last point about converting AC to DC, the Wiki article on diode bridges (components used for this purpose) gives a good visual representation of how this actually occurs. </p>
<p>To me, it's pretty fascinating to somewhat understand how it all works!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One line of AC is neutral, the other oscillates between positive and negative voltage with respect the the neutral, causing the current to switch directions.</p>
<p>This is why AC absolutely has polarity and it matters which way you connect it.  The neutral line doesn’t switch voltage.</p>
<p>Edit: from a comment I made a while ago:</p>
<p>This is why it annoys me when people say polarity doesn't matter in AC circuits.  Only the live wire switches polarity.  The current changes directions, yes, but neutral is always neutral.</p>
<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/finehomebuilding.s3.tauntoncloud.com/app/uploads/2016/04/09121417/hb166QA02-01_lg.jpg" target="_blank">See this picture</a>.</p>
<p>With proper wiring, the center button is hot and switches polarity.  The outer casing is neutral, no voltage.  Current switches directions rapidly, but the outer casing also at 0V wrt ground.</p>
<p>Now if you have a non-polarized plug and switch its orientation, or wire an outlet/light fixture incorrectly, the outer casing is hot and fluctuates voltage.</p>
<p>So you're in your basement grabbing an overhead pipe to steady yourself while you screw in the new bulb, but you forgot to turn off the fixture.  Your finger grazes the now hot casing, your other hand is grounded through the plumbing, and you get the shit shocked out of you.</p></div>		</li>
