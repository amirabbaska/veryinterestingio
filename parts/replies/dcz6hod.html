			<div class="markdown"><p>Different pieces of the telephone system handle &quot;compatibility&quot; (analog to  digital and voice versa). There's no reason call quality has to be low. The true problem lies in the fact that the whole of telephony is based on century old technology. While it was revolutionary at the time, it is far behind now. The only reason it isn't normally better is the system in place has so much potental profit. Only as it all ages beyond use (read: breaks to bad to be fixed) is it really upgraded. </p>
<p>Unless there's sufficient pressure from consumers, there won't be a lot of change it the system. And since it works, and is so damn reliable, I wouldn't bet on change anytime soon. </p>
<p>It sucks to work on, though. It's mostly FM and duct tape. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have run broadcast quality audio for a radio station over RBOC copper that was probably 70 years old at the time. This was years before there was any consumer digital audio. Mostly controlled environment but it did work well (audio quality close enough to the limits of human perception as to not matter). </p></div>		</li>
