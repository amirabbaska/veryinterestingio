			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a little more detail;  it has to do with the number of muscle fibers activated when an action is preformed. </p>
<p>From what I understand apes and chimps by default activate a large amount of muscle fibers at once and humans can activate a smaller number.  The number of muscle fibers activated is what gives apes and monkeys an insane str/size ratio.  </p>
<p>As FrankManic said activating large numbers of fibers has the trade off of precision. It's hard to activate a lot of muscle fibers for short periods of time.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough adreneline gives humans the ability to contract larger numbers of muscle fibers at once. Ever heard of someone lifting a car off their child, or showing some feat of super human strength?    </p>
<p>The down side is you lose precision when you have adreneline in your system, next time you get a huge scare or shock of adreneline and you feel your heart pounding, try to sign your name on a piece of paper. It should be harder or messier than normal for most people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;I had to do an experiment about the relative muscle power of humans and other large apes. Look how messy my handwriting was!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this also the current explanation of &quot;noob gains&quot;?  I heard the theory that when a human starts lifting they see an increase in their lifts VERY quickly at the start because they are training muscles that they already have to fire more at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You must also consider mechanical advantage. Think of joints like levers. Most animals will have more efficient lever systems than humans. They are able to generate much greater force with much less effort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, humans are evolutionarily endurance hunters, we are able to run down almost all animals just by chasing them until they literally drop from exhaustion.</p>
<p>So I'm assuming slow twitch muscle also has more stamina and maybe more efficiency due to the finer motion control that makes this possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, we can run forever before we reach exhaustion compared to most wild life. </p>
<p>From my understanding fast twitch muscle fibers (type II fibers) rely on anaerobic energy systems, meaning they're use is typically high intensity and short duration. They also have a larger cross sectional area allowing higher force production. </p>
<p>Type I fibers, or slow twitch, are primarily utilizing aerobic energy systems, and will have more endurance.</p>
<p>As far as fine motor control, I am unsure if muscle fiber type plays a role in this. I think it may be attributed to the number of muscles and their placement, i.e. The intrinsic muscles of the hand and foot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another (possibly related) factor is that most animals have a few distinct speeds (canter, trot, gallop for a horse)  which take a lot of energy to switch between. Humans can easily adjust gait, so by running at speed in between the speed options for an animal, we can tire it out by forcing it to use energy switching between gaits.  </p>
<p>I would guess this is somehow related to muscle types, but also our general shape and two-leggedness. </p></div>		</li>
