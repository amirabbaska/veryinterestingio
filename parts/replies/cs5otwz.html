			<p>Yeah. You can't uninstall IE because it's highly integrated into the OS, just like the music app is with iOS. <br>Sounds like I could be wrong, but I thought because of the final ruling with Microsoft they had to split their business up a bit and pay some fines... or something like that. </p>		</li>

			<p>Actually I'm told that if you buy windows in Europe you get prompted at first login to install your choice of browser from a list.</p>		</li>

			<p>It is true, <strong>BUT IE IS still installed</strong>. It is just not the default browser.</p>		</li>

			<p>You can remove IE in the disable windows features panel though.</p>		</li>

			<p>I wondered if that was the case, so the only difference from the US version is the extra prompt, nice.</p>		</li>
