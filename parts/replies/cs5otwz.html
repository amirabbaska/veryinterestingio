<p>History has proven them right.</p>
<p>Every other major OS includes not only a default web browser, but also an HTML-rendering component (this is the part of IE that you can't uninstall).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people who are tech-literate, but not really intimate with how real-wold software is shipped, would be amazed at how often applications take advantage of system-level HTML rendering to display documents and interfaces.</p>
<p>Nobody would be surprised to learn that Adobe Digital Editions, Adobe's ePub reader, uses the local HTML OS rendering engine to render its ebooks (something to watch out for, because it can bite you in the ass), but that not only means books will render differently on Windows and OS X, but they will render differently <em>between versions of Windows</em>! But I remember when Gadu-gadu, Poland's most popular IM app (with like 10 million users in 2005), would stop auto-scrolling to new messages if you disabled Javascript in IE.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not Linux.</p>
<p>Most distros have a preinstalled browser, but it's uninstallable. And it's also just part of that particular distro, not Linux as a whole; there are many distros that have no pre-installed browser.</p>
<p>Then again, it's easier in this case since you don't need a browser to install software; almost all distros have their own software repos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but &quot;what is in Linux&quot; is a meaningless question, because it can be anything you want.</p>
<p>You could ship a distro without 'ls', if you wanted to.  You can uninstall the keyboard driver from Debian, if you really tried.</p>
<p>Show me a Linux system that consumers can buy that doesn't ship with both a web browser and an html rendering component.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. You can't uninstall IE because it's highly integrated into the OS, just like the music app is with iOS.
Sounds like I could be wrong, but I thought because of the final ruling with Microsoft they had to split their business up a bit and pay some fines... or something like that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you wish to know how it is integrated, I'll answer that more. But only if asked.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To start, the current Music app, and future Apple Music app is built on a framework called AVFoundation (which can be found in detail <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/navigation/index.html?filter=avfoundation#section=Resource%20Types&amp;topic=Reference" target="_blank">here</a>). The app's are shared through a framework built onto of the app called MediaPlayer (details of which can be found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Audio/Conceptual/iPodLibraryAccess_Guide/AboutiPodLibraryAccess/AboutiPodLibraryAccess.html" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>Apps, such as mine, take AVFoundation and use it to produce the sounds you hear. Other apps (and a planned feature of mine) allow you to play music from your music library. It's this integration that allows this. If it was removed, it would require MANY apps in the Apple App Store and ï£¿Watch Store to remove, rework, and 100% recode there audio. On top of this, it would require modification of majority of there audio frameworks (AudioToolbox, AudioUnit, AVFoundation, CoreAudio, CoreMedia, MediaPlayer, MediaToolbox, and many more).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, but what does that have to do with having Apple Music the Service be a component you download from the App Store rather than making it a part of Music.app?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's still unnecessary. There are enough ways around that, especially since they've got complete control. To build it in deeply has no technical reason.</p></div>		</li>
