<p>In fact they're starting to use &quot;VP9&quot; which is kind of the opposite of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VP9" target="_blank">&quot;proprietary&quot;.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think so. They also have techniques to adjust quality for available bandwidth, instead of big jumps from standard (poor quality) to HD (glitchy).</p>
<p>There was controversy recently when people found out Netflix was giving them lower-quality video to avoid &quot;wasting&quot; their <em>unlimited</em> cell phone data.
The part I thought was interesting was people didn't immediately realize this. The quality wasn't awful, and it wasn't a downgrade to a standard, lower quality setting like you'd see if you set Youtube to 480p. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_bitrate_streaming#History" target="_blank">This is and has been pretty standard for streaming video for a long time.</a></p>
<p>People's irritation with providing &quot;lower quality&quot; video to avoid wasting bandwidth is an example of how people don't understand why encoding standards and practices exist in the first place.  </p>
<p>Bandwidth will always be narrower than our desire to push a lot of something through a wire, or over the air.  This has been the case since the advent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon" target="_blank">telephones.</a>  </p></div>		</li>
