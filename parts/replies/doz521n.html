			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with zero gravitational radiation, (the schwarzschild solution of a black hole with a test particle), there are no stable orbits there.  Sean Carroll talks a bit about why this is here and it being due to orbits not being the minimum of potential energy. <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March01/Carroll3/Carroll7.html" target="_blank">THE SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION AND BLACK HOLES</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say that all orbits do this, even if insignificant. Does this mean that, given enough time, the Earth will fall into the Black hole in the center of the Galaxy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this theoretically is what will happen, depending on how expansion plays out. Eventually all mass in the universe will be in black holes. You might call this the black hole era, the lower bound is 10^40 years from now. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but black holes are constantly evaporating, no? (Hawking radiation). So isn't there some equilibrium of black hole/non black hole mass even then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in other words, no. A gravitational wave itself contains information. So gravitational waves must not be able to pass through a black hole's event horizon, right?... Right? </p></div>		</li>
