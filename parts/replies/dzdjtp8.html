			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithium is commonly used instead of tritium. Neutrons can split it, producing helium and tritium (plus a neutron for Li-7) - more fuel for further reactions which release more neutrons to split more lithium and so on. Unlike tritium, lithium is not radioactive, doesn't &quot;decay away&quot; and relatively easy to handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be a silly question, but would this mean that it would be better to have  the lithium distributed/shaped to have a high surface area? (Like a foil?) The idea being that you want as much lithium exposed as possible to make fission more probable during the initial reaction. I've only ever heard of tritium being used as a reactant, which doesn't have this consideration due to the whole gaseous thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first practically usable multi-stage thermonuclear weapon used lithium deuteride. It also turned out to be much more effective than expected - they hadn't bothered to separate the lithium isotopes, and lithium-7 unexpectedly contributed to the reaction.</p>
<p>Lithium deuteride has AFAIK been the standard fusion fuel for the secondary ever since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The process you're referring to is ordinary beta decay (or electron emission), in which the down quark in extra neutrons in ultra-heavy nuclides changes into an up quark, thus emitting an electron and a neutrino, and in turn changing the neutron into a proton.</p>
<p>Protons consist of two up quarks and one down quark with total charge:</p>
<p>2(+⅔) + (–⅓) = +1</p>
<p>And neutrons have one up quark and two down quarks with total charge:</p>
<p>+⅔ + 2(–⅓) = 0</p>
<p>/u/Rannasha was referring to <em>positron</em> emission or beta-plus decay, where the up quark in extra protons (usually in lighter nuclides with a shortage of neutrons) change into a down quark, hence emitting a positron and an electron neutrino. Positrons are simply the antimatter equivalent of electrons with same mass and spin but opposite charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I take it there's some sort of system that limits these decays? Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like given enough time a single proton (or neutron) could repeatedly go through beta decay and beta-plus decay (I assume over billions of years?) and make a seemingly endless supply of electrons and positrons... which could be annihilated for free energy?</p>
<p>Where am I going wrong?</p></div>		</li>
