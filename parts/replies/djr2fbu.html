<p>This is fantasy.  Go to any medium or large city in Canada.  The streets are just like any other American city.  And while the people generally will queue up for things, they're just as rude as anywhere else.  We just do it differently.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As for the clean street, it's not fantasy, I saw it everywhere I went in Canada. We probably just don't have the same standards.</p>
<p>I mean I lived in Paris where everything smells like piss and every surface is covered by shitty non-artistic graffiti.
I live in SÃ£o Paulo where... well it's Brazil, do I need to say more? It smells like literal shit everywhere you go, the country-side is covered in plastic trash, people don't give a fuck about anything, and queuing is a completely foreign concept.
I live in NYC where trash are spread on the sidewalk everywhere, dog shit covering sidewalks, smell of shit and piss everywhere, super rude people, subway tracks so full with trash there are at least 2 or 3 subway lines spontaneously catching fire every single day.</p>
<p>Canadians being polite is not fantasy. I'm sure some places are even more polite and respectful (japan?) but compared tot he rest of the world, Canada is paradise.</p></div>		</li>
