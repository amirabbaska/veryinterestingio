			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the most upvoted comment was informative and all that but 1) wasn't ELI5 material. The explanation needed to be simplified a bit more since he still used a lot of industry terms 2) didn't really address the simple question if the two were mixed or not, which sort of blows my mind because he put in so much effort in his post. </p>
<p>This one was a lot more simplified and actually addressed the question clearly and directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally on ELI5 the wordiest post gets the most upvotes even if there are better ones. People just see a wall of text and think &quot;oh this person knows what they're talking about because they wrote the most words&quot; and hit upvote, probably without reading it all. It's a product of our education systems which value quantity over quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 here for those wondering about silicone:</p>
<p>oils are hydrocarbons which are (mostly) chains of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms sticking out on every stub, and an occasional oxygen atom in between some of the carbon atoms and on the ends of the chain with other functional units</p>
<p>if you look at a periodic table, just below carbon is silicon. the periodic table tells us atoms in the same columns have (mostly) similar chemical properties</p>
<p>and that is what silicone is: instead of chains of carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms on all the stubs, it is chains of silicon atoms with hydrogen atoms on all the stubs and an occasional oxygen atom in between some of the silicon atoms (well not really occasional, more like repeatable units, but this is ELI5)</p>
<p><strong>edit, bonus science</strong></p>
<p>if you burn hydrocarbons you get water and carbon dioxide. like in your car's engine or a grease fire. if you burn silicone you get water and silicon dioxide. aka: sand, glass, quartz (please do not do this at home, breathing silica fume is not good for your health)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I own and operate a company that makes handcrafted, fair trade, organic soap, shampoo and conditioner products. You can use pretty much any oil you want and differant oils have different benefits and negatives. Argan oil, olive oil, palm oil, coconut oil, and few others a really good for your skin and hair.</p></div>		</li>
