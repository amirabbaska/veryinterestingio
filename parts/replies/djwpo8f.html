			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I'd say that's a big problem.  I too had a pin that was 5 digits.  I went to Europe and attempted to take money out of an ATM... and it would only take a MAXIMUM of 4 digits.  Major drama ensued.  I now have a 4 digit pin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah that's what i was thinking, don't most ATMs (at least in the UK) automatically take you to the next page once 4 digits are typed? you don't have to press &quot;OK&quot; or anything iirc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a bank, and the banking industry is moving away from that regarding deposits. My bank was one of the first to require ID when depositing cash, and also the requirement that cash can only go into your account, as a money laundering prevention measure. People generally get really pissy with me when they come in to put money in their kid's account and I tell them they can't, but according to my manager it's been wildly successful and other banks are starting to implement it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never tell my bank when I travel, and my card has never been frozen. Is this one of those things where if you ever tell your bank your travel plans they'll assume you'll do it every time and freeze your account if you don't, or does that happen to people who've never told the bank about travel plans too? If the latter, what sets it off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah. I had a bank freeze my account because I was traveling and didn't tell them. Wasn't a huge deal as it wasn't my primary card, but a giant pain in the ass because it worked once and then was locked. It's not a habit deal, and really banks should be freezing accounts if there is abnormal activity they can't verify. Better than letting your account get cleaned out before they take any action, especially since they will be liable for refunding the money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bank disallows debit card transactions outside of most of Europe as standard. If I go overseas, I can easily enable that temporarily for the period I'm away. (In theory I could disable the restriction permanently, but have never felt the need to.)</p></div>		</li>
