			<div class="markdown"><p>My shop never had an issue with money, to include ordering $10-$20k pieces of equipment on a whim when the money came down.  We did have an issue spending it efficiently.  Last few years I was in, we didn't need any equipment.  We would have liked to have hired a janitorial crew, or someone to fix our parking lot, or purchase an additional mobile storage unit.  We couldn't do any of that because the money could use be used for parts and equipment.  So instead I have my guys pushing mops and laying gravel in a parking lot instead of doing their jobs, all while we have an abundance of random electrical components and office supplies because that's all anyone could think to order and we don't want our allotment to go down next year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This really gets to me. Procurement in DoD has so much leeway on certain things; they can sole-source billion dollar contracts with almost no oversight or defined deliverables but God forbid you want appropriations for something that isn't big and shiny. Routine maintenance? Buildings that aren't infested in black mold? Nah, can't do that, but you can fill all of basement storage with office supplies.</p>
<p>It's a problem in civilian agencies too, but it's especially frustrating since the DoD gets so much money. We (congress, policymakers) need to think of a way to allow and incentivize agencies to use appropriations efficiently instead of this feast or famine approach we have going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SF has a ton of undocumented stuff. I was overseas and we were a jumping off point. I worked in the trauma center and we asked some SF guys if they had some different things. They brought everything we asked, and when we tried to do the paper work they just waved it away. </p>
<p>Maybe your old supply sergeant got in with some SF guys?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad they had the tools they needed. Most of the rest of it's couldn't get what we needed and Jess had to make do with what we had. We had to practically build our own Humvees to take to Iraq.  Got hand me downs from units leaving theatre and we had to find the parts to make them into running Jerry rigged up armors.  Talk about feeling safe on route Irish. Meanwhile reserve units show up with brand new fully decked out equipment, c asking is how to do a pmcs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's not forget how little goes to the military and how much goes directly to defense contractors. </p>
<p>Also, replacing old, used, reliable equipment with new shiny shit that didn't work from day 1.</p></div>		</li>
