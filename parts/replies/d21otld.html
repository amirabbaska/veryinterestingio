			<div class="markdown"><p>A much simpler proof is a proof by counterexample:</p>
<p>Hypothesis:  The cap of a ball-point pen is intended to prevent the pen from drying out</p>
<p>Proof by counterexample:  </p>
<p>1)  Not all ball-point pens have caps, some are click pens.  </p>
<p>2)  Click ball-point pens do not dry out faster than capped ball-point pens</p>
<p>3)  Therefore the cap on a ball-point pen is not intended to prevent the pen from drying out</p>
<p>QED</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Click ball-point pens retract the tip (and ball) when not in use, achieving the same effect as the cap.  That is- preventing external forces from acting on the ball.</p>
<p>However, without imperical measurement and analysis this is all speculation.</p></div>		</li>
