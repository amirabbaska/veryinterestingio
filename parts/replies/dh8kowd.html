<p>Their glow isn't a result of the mushroom​ absorbing​ light, they glow via a chemical reaction mediated between a class of substrate known as a luciferin and a class of enzyme known as a luciferase. This reaction type occurs in all kinds of organsism (jellyfish, deep sea shrimp, fungi, fireflies, etc.). The exact reaction varies between species, but the core physics is the same: the enzyme facilitates the reaction and spits out the product, but does so with the product at a high energy state, which relaxes to the ground state and glows. It has nothing at all to do with absorbtion of light by the mushroom (unless light is somehow necessary to generate the luciferin or if has some photosensitive protein/enzyme that controls a pathway to signal that it's dark, but I wouldn't know anything about those specifically, just speculating).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Also amazing that luciferase-based assays have become so pervasive as a method of identifying compound activity via in vitro assays. It was my basic understanding that the mushrooms had to be exposed to light for some period of time in order to exhibit luminescence (and for the record, this is something I do not study whatsoever). I guess I never looked into the exact mechanism through which these effects arise.</p></div>		</li>
