			<div class="markdown"><p>To add some additional context....</p>
<p>After the US took control of Iraq, the US govt made the fateful decision to disband the Baathist Party. Just to put this into context, this would be like if Germany - after reunifying with East Germany - made a rule that said anyone that belonged to the East German Communist Party couldn't work. Overnight, the US banned all members of the party's top four tiers from the new Iraqi government and from public schools and colleges - thousands of people were removed from their positions, including doctors, professors, school teachers and bureaucrats. And also of course Army officers. </p>
<p>Then the US installed a new govt which was dominated by the Shia branch, who had suffered under Saddam Hussein. Shia were the majority in Iraq, representing around 60% of the population. So they controlled the new government. This created a volatile environment - a newly powerful Shia, armed with US weapons and a disenfranchised Sunni population, angry, defeated and out of work. All the ingredients for an insurgency. And gradually many Shia tribal leaders, who have suffered under the persecution of Saddam for decades, decided it was payback time.  Shia Death squads, sometimes operating under the guise of  Iraqi Special Police Commandos, started picking Sunnis up off the streets, entering homes - torture and executions became common place. All this was happening under US control. </p>
<p>So many Sunni's became frightened. And they came to see the US as being sponsors of terror, that was carried out by groups connected with the Iraqi govt. So many Sunni's, terrified became to seek refuge and safety with the emerging Sunni militia units, that eventually formed into what we know as ISIS. In this context, many Sunni's in Iraq were forced into the arms of ISIS because they were afraid. And  ISIS came to be seen as the defenders and protectors of Sunni's in Iraq. And naturally it became pretty straightforward to recruit people into this fight against the US and against the Iraqi/Shia Government. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main difference between ISIS and the Taliban, and it's an important difference if you want to understand why we're negotiating with the Taliban instead of trying to 'eradicate' it, is this: </p>
<p>ISIS is an ideological/religious movement based on Salafi jihadism, and the Taliban is essentially a Pashtun ethno-nationalist movement.</p>
<p>Look at this <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/US_Army_ethnolinguistic_map_of_Afghanistan_--_circa_2001-09.jpg" target="_blank">map</a>, created in 2001 by the US Army, of the ethnolinguistic groups in Afghanistan, paying attention to the light green saddle-shaped area that includes much of Afghanistan's border with Pakistan: this is the Pashtun homeland. Now look at this <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/8%20DEC%2015%20DC%20AFG%20MAP%20with%20kt_22.png" target="_blank">map</a> showing the 'Afghanistan Partial Threat Assessment' as of December 2015. The zones of Taliban support and control basically correspond to where the Pashtuns live. Even the Taliban footholds in the north match valleys where Pashtuns live on the first map.</p>
<p>So, while ISIS may be hanging on because of their (limited) ability to provide infrastructure and basic logistics to the population under their control, the longevity of the Taliban is based on the existence of an ethnic group and its sense of solidarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the Taliban was a 'group' but it was more of a movement that every Pashtun man was seemingly apart of. Sitting around with an interpreter asking elders in Gulistan who the Taliban was made them laugh. It was pretty eye-opening and after that I realized how futile our efforts were there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is next to impossible for a conventional army to win an asymmetrical war. </p>
<p>Across history, smaller, irregular forces have fought much larger armies to a standstill. </p>
<p>Caratcus ran rings around the Imperial Roman army that was at a very powerful period in its history. Vercingetorix was the only Gallic Chieftain to give Caesar a headache. He lost when he went toe to toe against Caesar conventionally. Quintus Sertorious(sp?) Utterly vexed the Roman Republic. </p>
<p>Look at our own modern period, the VC troubled the US so much on Vietnam. The Mujahideen destroyed the much stronger Soviet Union. They then did it to the US.  The US spent a decade fighting the Taliban...and a trillion dollars, but the Taliban is stronger than ever.  </p>
<p>In the middle East itself, the Hagnnah and Jewish extremists nearly drove the British outside of Palestinian. Within a short period of 5 years, they totally sapped the British will to fight. </p>
<p>Guerilla armies like the ISIS (though they are fighting conventionally now), Taliban, Al Qaida, FARC (they are involved in the longest running guerilla conflict of our times, from 1968 on) etc etc all have a support base amongst the local population, or they simply extort what they need and use fear as a tool to keep local population in check. They don't have a target for the conventional armies to hit, and even if they do, they simply disappear into the local populace, wait the strike out and then hit back. Short of destroying entire countries, there is nothing a much superior conventional force can do. While they break international laws, the standing armies ultimately have ROE's, they have backlash at home and the best friend of a guerrilla...war exhaustion. </p>
<p>These are decentralised units for the most part, that live off the land. They require a minimal budget to keep them in the field. The the Soviet war in Afghanistan. It cost the US approx $ 300-400 million a year (average for the entire program-started low, went up to $ 700 million a year by 1986), even if you include the Saudi contributions, that was a total of $ 800 million a year. It cost the Soviets an average of $ 8-10 billion a year to persecute the same war. A bunch of Mujahideen bankrupted the Soviet state. </p>
<p>All that unconventional forces need to do is to wait their enemy out. As simple as that. </p>
<p>The times in history that they have been defeated, it's usually because they played to the strengths of their enemies and engaged in set piece battles. Like the LTTE, who persecuted a very very successful guerrilla war for a decade, but went &quot;conventional&quot;, and were crushed within years. Or the VC who went conventional with the Tet offensive as lost badly. It did also increase American casualties and caused immense discomfort in America causing troop reductions. Interestingly enough, it waa after the US started adapting unconventional warfare themselves (Op Phoenix) that the VC began to get very weakened. </p>
<p>In summary, fighting a COIN war is like fighting ghosts. You will eventually get tired and leave while all they need to do is to wait them out. </p></div>		</li>
