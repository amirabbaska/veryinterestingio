			<div class="markdown"><p>In Scandinavia we have some stuff that will kill you. The most frequent killer is the common wasp :(</p>
<p>The coolest animal that is likely to kill you is the moose. You see one of those and you're on foot you better get the hell out of there. Super aggressive and no fear of humans. Also not great to hit them with cars. They'll kill you then too.</p>
<p>We have wolves but there are like 12 left and they're badly inbred.</p>
<p>EDIT: So I got a lot of flak for the moose thing. <del>Apparently will only charge at you if you are close to their babies</del>. Moose are assholes and will ruin your life <em>only</em> when horny/drunk/threatened/startled/annoyed/asked to move but also for no reason. Also, for some other reason an enormously high percentage of the reddit population have problems with their sisters getting bit by them</p>
<p>Also I didn't mean literally 12 wolves (they totally are inbred though)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even where cats still reign, there's anecdotal evidence that they respond to human hunting behavior.  For example, one of the few foraging populations left in east africa routinely steal kills from big cats, even old ladies can do it.  East africa has a long tradition of big-game hunting and cats have apparently learned to give ground.  In southern africa the hunting has been comparatively less severe, and indigenous groups tend to think of big cats as terrors best given a wide berth.  This is hardly solid data but it's an interesting observation.</p>
<p>I hear tigers are somewhat more circumspect with humans too but that doesn't stop them from killing people.  I seem to recall they still get a good few hundred of us per year, way more than lions or leopards.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lions are den-keepers, so they usually kill people defensively. Generally, because of low population density of humans in their range, they are able to concede territory without compromising their ability to find food.</p>
<p>Tigers are the complete opposite: they have lost nearly all of their hunting ranges and are constantly short on their preferred prey, and they are solitary hunters stuck in areas with high populations of humans. They generally turn to preying on humans out of desperation - due to starvation or old age/poor health - but due to their ability to remain low-key because of their solitary nature, have also adapted in some cases to hunt lone humans purposefully.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This'll just show how little I know about them but I thought both of them just don't think of humans as food, but once they round that corner all hell breaks loose.  I seem to remember reading that when stressed, many have turned to humans, but that plenty of perfectly-prime cats have taken the odd person just because the situation presented itself.  And now you've got yourself a man-eater.  </p>
<p>Full disclosure: I know a lot about the human side of this equation, far less about the cat side.  My understanding is that one of the few animals who truly think of people as food is the polar bear, which gives you some idea of what the world would be like (or used to be like) when cats thought of us as a meal.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was some research done in India about 25 years ago where they found that they could almost eliminate tiger attacks in the villagers in the area of a large national park by having the humans wear a mask on the back of their head.   The tigers would only attack from behind and the masks fooled them.    So even when tigers hunt humans they still show a lot of caution.</p></div>		</li>
