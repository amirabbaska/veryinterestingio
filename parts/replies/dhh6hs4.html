			<div class="markdown"><p>I like it. I will never forget riding the chairlift with two women on a beautiful day in Oregon. Chatting,I discovered they both were from the east coast and were players with the Portland Symphony. I asked how they liked the west and they said they hated it because there was &quot;no culture&quot;. I pointed out that what they missed was 16th century european culture and they were missing the culture where they were.</p>
<p>5 years later I moved to upstate NY....</p></div>		</li>
