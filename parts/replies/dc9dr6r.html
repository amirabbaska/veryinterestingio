			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite sure.  It depends on when they die.  If they dont start maturing until they are a lot older, then the process of developing flanges will also be postponed, plus the fact that the development can be suppressed to up to 7 years.  So it all depends on timing and their life span.</p></div>		</li>
