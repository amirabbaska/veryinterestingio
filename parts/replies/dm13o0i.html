			<div class="markdown"><p>The beginning of that sentence from wikipedia being &quot;Unlike the other three muscles of mastication,...&quot; That partial quote alone makes it sound like the lateral pterygoid is the only muscle important in depressing the mandible, which is untrue. The other three muscles of mastication it refers to are the masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid, which, along with the lateral pterygoid are all jaw adductors, meaning they close the jaw and are responsible for masticatory movements in chewing. The lateral pterygoid, thanks to it's attachment on the jaw relative to the jaw joint, can aid in both adduction and abduction depending on which other muscles are being activated at the time. That does not mean it is the most important jaw opener, and is in fact in a terrible position to open the jaw all on its own, as opposed to the digastric. The other three muscles of mastication it refers to are not so useful in jaw opening, which is the point that sentence is actually trying to make. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lateral pterygoids don't depress the mandible.  They translate the mandibular condyle (and disc) anteriorly along the articular eminence of the zygoma.  </p>
<p>When fired unilaterally, this results in lateral movement of the mandible towards the contralateral side of the muscle.  When fired bilaterally, the resulting movement depends on the state of condylar rotation: </p>
<ol>
<li>If the teeth are together (0Â° condylar rotation or &quot;centric relation&quot;) bilateral LP firing would result in anterior mandibular movement</li>
<li>At maximum rotational opening, bilateral LP firing results in anterior-inferior movement of the mandible corresponding to the angle of the articular eminence of the zygoma.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the standard accepted function of the LPs in the current &quot;Theory of Occlusion&quot; (of the teeth).  It's also the reason why patient with sub-condylar mandible fractures will deviate to the ipsilateral side of the fracture on wide opening.</p>
<p>In reality, the function of the LPs are more complicated. They probably function more frequently then the simplistic model described above in various stabilizing functions that are not as clinically important or apparent.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, the definition &quot;Muscle of Mastication&quot; can be confusing.  Many facial muscles other than the nominal &quot;Muscles of Mastication&quot; are active during chewing.  The definition is an anatomic one, and describes muscles who derive their motor innervation from the Trigeminal Nerve (and not even all of them).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The digastric muscle only assists. This muscle is very small and doesn't elicit much force. In addition, patients who have had a laryngectomy don't have this muscle or at least it isn't attached to much and can still open their jaw quite well. It's primarily the lateral pterygoid. </p></div>		</li>
