			<div class="markdown"><p>Smoking DMT will have incredibly strong hallucinogenic affects as it enters the lungs and therefore is not broken down by the MAO found in the intestinal track. The plant will contain both N, N DMT and 5-MeO-DMT with concentrations varying depending on the plant used. Both are psychoactive but 5-MeO is considerably more potent per unit of weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have smoked DMT, it was the most intense psychedelic trip I will never forget (besides the memories being like slowly fading dreams) but I remember talking about it and what happened. But yes, you can definitely smoke it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally when someone talks about smoking DMT they're talking about 5meo, it's just kind of a mouthful to say the full name casually, or the person just doesn't know much about it and is unaware of the difference. </p>
<p>Also do you have a source for what you're saying? Specifically the part about DMT already being present in our bodies in really high amounts. I didn't know that, I thought it was present in trace amounts but you seem like you know what you're talking about more then I do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. 5-meo-dmt is actually much less common than dmt. Most smokable dmt is extracted from the root bark of the mimosa hostilis or acacia tenuiflora trees. The root bark in these trees contain around 1.5-2% dmt with only minor traces of nmt and 5-meo-dmt, as well as a few other analogues and isomers. </p>
