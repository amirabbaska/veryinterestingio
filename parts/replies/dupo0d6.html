<p>Just alone the maintenance cost for everything that is touching hydrogen is a no go. (Hydrogen embrittlement) </p>
<p>Also the fuel efficiency you can reach is limited. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not about to place bets on the progress of a maturing technology vs one that's practically mature as is.</p>
<p>That said, &quot;basic physics&quot; isn't how I would describe hydrogen embrittlement. That's more &quot;material science,&quot; which is an area in which improvements may still be made.</p>
<p>Also, hydrogen embrittlement only applies to hydrogen fuel cells. There are other types (for example methanol).</p>
<p>And finally, while the maximum theoretical fuel efficiency of fuel cells is somewhat inferior to the transfer efficiency of batteries, the refueling speed is much greater, and methanol has a much higher energy density than lithium ion batteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes fuel cell production is trending up

Take a look at the 2016 fuel cell technologies market report. You are right that a lot of resources are going into replacing platinum, but things developed so far have varying issues. </p></div>		</li>
