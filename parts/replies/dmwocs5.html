			<div class="markdown"><p>you're right. sometimes owning assets like this can provide negative real returns.</p>
<p>you can check out what current US bonds are selling at here:</p>

<p>there are other sources as well. but most of these yields I would expect to yield almost a 0% or negative real return if you guestimate inflation will be ~2%</p>
<p>this is also why a savings account paying let's say 1-2% is not something I would ever recommend as an investment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite possibly, but they will still beat keeping the cash in your mattress for essentially zero risk.</p>
<p>If you want to <em>beat</em> inflation, the idea (in a healthy economy) is that you would need to provide some kind of valuable service to someone else, in this case probably by investing in a business that does so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is EXACTLY the reasoning behind good debt. The government reasons we can borrow today at 2% over 20 years to build up infrastructure. This new infrastructure will net billions in return over that same period. By the time the notes mature you are repaying in a devalued dollar. Saving millions on the back end.  This is multiplied by projects saving billions. </p>
<p>In 20 years wages will be a lot higher so those projects will be substantially more expensive saving billions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the discount points reflect what you said (risk) and the return that money could get in a similar risk profile investment. Since the US Govt debt is zero risk you are willing to pay a little more for it and thus less return is acceptable. Risk equals reward is an old but very true saying for every investment but currency.</p></div>		</li>
