<p>Just for everyone: emphasis on &quot;developing&quot; - there are still a lot of challenges ahead for 5G - most notably proximity and line-of-sight limitations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Proximity &amp; L-o-s wont be the only problem, Shirley? i just had to do an essay on this exact problem (well, fttx vs 5g atleast) for my work/education, and the mayor problem i saw is how much space we have to devote to build fiber optical nodes, within cities and along roads.
If the madmen really want this crap for self-driving cars, i fear that we are going to have to rethink alot of things, how and who we let operate as netowners to the very least.</p></div>		</li>
