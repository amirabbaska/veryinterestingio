			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if the edge of the Visible Universe is 13.7 bly away (according to Google),</p>
<p>Does this mean that in order to see an object that is 13.8 bly away, we'd have to wait .1 billion more years for its light to reach Earth? It could be there, we just haven't seen it yet because not enough time has past (assuming that we have powerful enough telescopes)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Where did you get this number? It's more like 46 bly; are you conflating the radius of the observable universe and <em>age</em> of the universe?</p></div>		</li>
