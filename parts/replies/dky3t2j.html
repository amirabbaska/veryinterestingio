			<div class="markdown"><p>From wikipedia
The first people to use pillows were those who lived in early civilizations of Mesopotamia around 7,000 BC. During this time, only the wealthy used pillows.  </p>
<p>The ancient greeks and romans mastered the art of the soft pillow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the hell did they use before soft pillows? I just imagine a montage of two Greeks trying things out and failing. One lays down on a rock , the other one looks at him as if to say &quot;Well, how is it?&quot; The other Greek thinks for a moment and then shakes his head no. They repeat this same process with other things like  a log, a large fish, a pile of smaller rocks, an angry goat etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, anecdotal but when I'm doing fieldwork I make a nice pile with my boots and backpack/coat that is pretty comfortable. I think it's more about some kind of support than a perfect soft pillow. I'd guess ancient folks did the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, I actually put my head in a replica of one when Ramses II was at the Boston Museum of Science.  It was more comfortable than you'd think, it kept your neck at a good angle better than a soft pillow.  What was not obvious to me, at least at the time, was that you put your head in it sideways, not facing the ceiling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that. When you sleep sideways, it's not as great. Your shoulder lifts you up higher off the ground, so you're in this awkward position. </p></div>		</li>
