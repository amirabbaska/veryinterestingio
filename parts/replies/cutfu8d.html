			<div class="markdown"><p>As an addendum, the first photo you show is actually a diagram of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_tides#Newton" target="_blank">Newtonian tide theory</a>. In real life, the continents and bathymetry are such that tides form <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/M2_tidal_constituent.jpg" target="_blank">seiches like so</a>.</p>
<p>However, the more elementary concepts of netwonian tide theory should be sufficient to explain broad atmospheric effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there an animation showing how those seiches flow over the course of a day?  Also, is there an explanation for how the moon causes individual waves for each area?  Or is the idea of the moon effecting the tides directly outdated now? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the moons definitely affect the tides! So let me try to explain tide theory as an ELI5... Keep in mind that I am a biological oceanographer and marine physiologist by training, and not an expert on physical oceanography.</p>
<p>So in the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KN5bOrM.jpg" target="_blank">first image</a> on this parent post, you see that the moon pulls water towards it. At the same time, the moon and the earth are both rotating around the moon-earth system, so you get a bulge on the other side. </p>
<p>Think of this like... you hold hands with someone and spin around each other. If you are both of the same mass, you balance each other out and spin in a circle. If one person is heavier, they will be more stationary while the lighter person spins around them. This is how the earth and moon behave - the moon and earth actually both <a href="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-11c495320fc3275cfe5e928d8bd5d56a?convert_to_webp=true" target="_blank">revolve around a point inside of the earth</a>. This is what causes the &quot;bulge on the other side&quot;. </p>
<p>Now, if the earth were completely covered in water, this would cause two waves on opposite sides of the earth. They would spin around the earth with the moon. However, that's impossible for two reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>Continents getting in the way. a tide can't go through north america!</li>
<li>Tides are really big waves, so they are influenced by the sea floor topography (bathymetry). </li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_effect" target="_blank">coriolis effect</a> prevents waves from moving in a straight line because of the differential surface velocities at different latitudes.
These make it so that as a wave travels around an ocean, it gets turned around in circles as the coriolis force pushes it into a certain direction. Combined with the shape of the ocean basins, this causes the waves to instead swirl in circles. Think of it like sloshing water in a bathtub. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the interesting part of this is that these swirls can happen at different rates, and their interactions can cause interesting tide series. </p>
<ul>
<li>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#/media/File:Tide_type.svg" target="_blank">three principal tide patterns</a> that emerge from these ocean basin resonances. </li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#/media/File:Diurnal_tide_types_map.jpg" target="_blank">Depending on where you are in the world</a>, tides happen at different intervals (24h vs 12h), and  at different strengths.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your use of the phrase &quot;moon causes individual waves&quot; is not accurate.</p>
<p>The moon does no such thing.  If you have the term &quot;tidal wave&quot; in your head, erase it.   It is an antequated term, usually replaced by the word &quot;tsunami&quot;, and that has absolutely nothing to do with the moon.  (it is a large wave caused by a disturbance such as a landslide or earthquake)</p>
<p>Tides, however (the periodic slight rising and falling of the ocean) are caused directly by the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly it's less the &quot;pulling&quot; of the near and far points but more the &quot;squeezing&quot; over the whole ocean/atmosphere. More technically, it's transverse rather than radial components of the force differential that do most of the work, combined with hydrolic action. It's explained amazingly well in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwChk4S99i4" target="_blank">What Physics Teachers Get Wrong About Tides!</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually ties together fairly well with the concept of tidal locking - the forces perpendicular to the overall direction of gravity are important.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it effectively pulls away in the opposite direction</p>

<p>Nitpick: I don't think it pulls away, just is pulled less than those parts closer to the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The coolest way of thinking of it is like this:
There is a certain velocity at each distance from an object, at which you can orbit at a steady state. If you go faster than this, gravity alone isn't enough to hold you in, so you move out. If you go slower than this, you get pulled  inwards and start falling. Up to now I've basically just stated Kepler's third law. If these were just point-sized regular objects, once they start moving in or out they shift their energy around between gravitational and kinetic forms until they hit the right combination to settle down and do boring stuff.</p>
<p>Now, stand on the moon, so that the earth orbits around you. The middle of the earth is at exactly the right speed and the right distance, so that means that the earth, as a whole, is in a steady orbit around you. Because the earth is a single lump of material, it all moves at the same speed, but not all of it is at the same distance.</p>
<p>So what happens? The part of the earth close to the moon is moving too slow for a steady orbit, so the close half of the earth is falling into the moon. The far half of the earth is going too fast for a steady orbit, so it's trying to escape into space. The water in the oceans can move a bit, so the misaligned speeds manifest as tides - one on the side falling into the moon, and one on the side falling out of the moon. This also intuitively explains why strong tides can <a href="http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/glossary/roche_limit.html" target="_blank">tear an object to pieces</a>.</p>
<p>Mathematically, this is exactly the same as all sorts of boring stuff like <a href="https://xkcd.com/123/" target="_blank">centrifugal forces</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the clearest explanation here.</p>
<p>For an interesting take on tidal forces, try reading Larry Niven's novel (and series) based on the ramifications of living in a world dominated by tidal effects:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hence the &quot;effectively&quot;. But yes, in the straightforward way of looking at it (i.e. from an external inertial observer's reference frame), the water on the far side is pulled less than the water on the near side or the rock in the middle.</p>
<p>However, you can also look at this from a reference frame that moves with the Earth in its orbit around the barycenter of the Earth-moon system, and in that frame, it <em>is</em> true that the water is pushed away by centrifugal force.</p></div>		</li>
