			<div class="markdown"><p>That would make sense, because while I can totally see how being able to tell when people in your peripheral vision do it is just an evolutionary advantage, I couldn't wrap my head around being able to tell when people behind you are looking at you. So maybe you guys are right and there's some confirmation bias going on</p></div>		</li>

<p>Remember what OP said -- there are a <em>lot</em> of other cues that somebody might be behind you. A shadow, sound of a door opening, sound of breathing or footsteps, seeing a reflection, seeing someone in front of you look behind you, people suddenly getting quiet, etc.  Any number of these cues might not reach your consciousness, but nonetheless trigger an instinct to check your six.  And, if the person is truly behind you, it'll take a second to actually turn and see them; the act of turning around might even <em>cause</em> them to look in your direction because they sense motion, meaning they are looking at you once you turn, even if they weren't before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I noticed as a kid traveling in my parents car that when I looked at people in other cars <em>from behind</em> they would often turn around to look at me.</p>
<p>It kind of freaked me out, so I quit doing it, but now I wonder whether it actually was a majority of people, or if there was confirmation bias so that I underestimated how many didn't.</p>
<p>Please someone do this experiment of looking at people in cars and seeing how many turn around to look back and counting the results.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm not talking about the driver who sees you from a mirror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think we're discounting the fact that all this science we're espousing is only based on &quot;what we know so far&quot;. It's entirely possible that there are other factors, senses, or feelings that we can't quite account for yet but we're not able to measure it. Take for example, quantum entanglement and other things we're finding that go against what we thought before. The truth is we don't necessarily know the limits of what kind of data we process or what's there in the outside world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of the phenomenon where you anticipate the noise that wakes you up. The story of your dream has events that lead to and cause the sound (IRL) that wakes you up.</p>
<p>It seems like you're somehow clairvoyant while sleeping, when in reality you're just delayed in  reacting to the sound that has already occurred. It's cool that we can make a dream story that leads to something that happened a moment before. Always trips me out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any further discussion or research you can link to on this topic? From what I can understand/hypothesize, it has to do with how our memory works (being awoken from slumber causes us to consciously remember the last few minutes/seconds rather than just unconsciously processing it) but I haven't seen any other thought or research on explaining it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've kept a dream journal for almost 2 years. I've had several dreams where I am convinced I incorporated car horns into my dreams. For example, one time a friend opened his mouth and made &quot;beep beep&quot; noises like the roadrunner. I've had dreams where I've forgotten my clothes while in reality I've kicked my covers off and the fan is blowing cold air so I wake up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a little snip, but the whites of the eyes make a significant difference.  Humans have a lot more white area of eye than other species, and because of this it's exceptionally easier to tell what a human is looking at, compared to say, a dog or a cat.  Combined with the human brain MADE to notice human eyes, and it becomes easy to tell if someone is looking at you, or over your shoulder - or even if they're looking at your eyes or at that mole on your cheek.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun anecdote: I always look at mouths when I look at someone's face. One occasion I decided to look into a girl's eyes that I had known for years and she kept asking me over and over if something was on her forehead or if her hair was messed up. She got so used to me looking at her mouth, when I looked into her eyes it was strange to her</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have rather exceptional hearing, confirmed by clinical tests and such, though it's declining in my old age. The one thing I've noticed is that I can <em>hear</em> when someone is in the room. Specifically, because their body changes the way the room sounds. It absorbs sound in a certain way. I've also noticed that when someone is in the room and ignoring me, they move in a certain way, however, when they look at me and focus on me, they become still. So if you're directly behind me I can <em>hear</em> your movement even if you're not making sound because of the effect your body has on the rest of the noise in the room. And I can hear when you stop moving, and at that point I assume you're looking at me. To me, this is a 6th sense and how I know if an unseen stranger is looking at me. </p>
<p>I do not think this skill is unique to me. If you stand dead still like that behind someone else, they will turn around to see who you are almost every time. I think most people just aren't aware their brains are figuring this out for them, and instead think of it as an &quot;eerie feeling&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to mention this as well. It's tough to find a place that is absolutely dead quiet, outside of an anechoic chamber. Those little vacuums of sound created by unexpected bodies in a room are actually quite noticeable, but, as you mention, in a subconscious manner. It's pretty neat. </p>
<p>In other words, you know they're there because of the way that it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are spot on that we sense them with one of our other, numerous senses and confirmation bias makes it feel like we only get those feelings when someone is looking at us. </p></div>		</li>
