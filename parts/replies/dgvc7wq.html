			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a great answer. I appreciate the historicity you provided. Anecdotally, Einstein is lauded as a unique genius, which may be true, but it's nice to be reminded that he, too, stood on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. It's easy to give up trying thinking you're not Einstein. But there is a false implicit assumption here that Einstein just &quot;came up&quot; with all of it. Truth is he studied scientific literature carefully and systematically, and built on top of existing knowledge. This is how research works - through years of dedication and hardwork. In that regard, Einstein was no different than other scientists. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only for light! Gravitational waves also have constant speed. In fact, all particles can be split into two categories: massive and massless. Massive particles move strictly slower than the speed of light. They have an associated reference frame, rest mass, their velocities obey the relativistic velocity addition law which for small speeds reduces to Newton's velocity addition. Massless particles move exactly at the speed of light in any reference frame, and no reference frame can be associated with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer? Both. It exhibits both qualities, this is shown with the single slit and double slit experiments.  As does all matter. But once things get big and their speeds get higher they become more particle like. </p>
<p>Long answer: <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mod1.html" target="_blank">This</a> is a great website that explains it fairly well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither, it is electromagnetic radiation, consisting of discrete(at least as much as any quantum object can be considered discrete) photons.  It displays some characteristics of waves, photons can pass through other photons and they can interferre in a wave-like fashion, but they also have properties normally associated with particles, it can travel in rays, and can travel through a vacuum, it doesn't need a medium to exist in.  </p>
<p>There are lots of quantum objects that exhibit properties of both waves and particles, light just happens to be the one that was discovered and experimented with earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh yes I remember the double slit experiment. I couldn't remember the term photon. I do remember treating electromagnetic radiation as a wave in physics class. Am I misremembering? </p></div>		</li>
