			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the air not only raises faster because it gets hotter, but also because it picks up water. H2O is a lighter molecule than O2 or N2.</p>
<p>When you make the outlet smaller to condense water from the heated air, it will leave at or near is saturation point. The air outside the stack is, most likely, cooler than the exiting air, and the mixing would lower the air temperature under its dew point causing more droplets to form. The air is traveling fast, so the droplets are caught in the air rather than falling to the ground. </p>
<p>I like to call those towers &quot;Cloud Makers&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a follow up, in the vast majority of nuclear power plants we have an additional water circuit.</p>
<p>The first one, irridiated by the core never gets in contact with the turbines. Therefore, making changes to the generator and/or machine hall in general won't put you at any higher risk.</p>
<p>The second circuit is for transferring the heat from the first circuit into energy by powering the turbines as saturated steam.</p>
<p>After beeing blown through the turbines, the steam gets cooled down by condensers, which are cooled by a third isolated water circuit.</p>
<p>This third water circuit runs through those cooling towers, if the particular site offers the opportunity of having some. </p>
<p>As mentioned by others, there are plants which directly get rid off the heat by discharging into rivers. By using cooling towers, you are not bound to the temperature of the river for for getting your heat Off.</p>
<p>For instance, the cooling efficiency is reduced in hot Summers because of a smaller delta T between the river ans the discharged water. Adding cooling towers does not only positively affect the environment (not every fish can withstand increased temperatures of 5 degree C), but it also boosts your efficiency ans therefore increases your Money Output.</p></div>		</li>
