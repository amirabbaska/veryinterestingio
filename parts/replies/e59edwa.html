			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all instances of conquering results in the dominant population replacing the native language.</p>
<p>Other instances:</p>
<ol>
<li>English - When the Normans conquered England, they greatly influenced the language, but they definitely did not replace it with Norman French.  I would call the period Anglo Norman English, as opposed to the Anglo Saxon period before, which was also in flux with the influence of Old Norse, but Old English (Anglo Saxon) and Old Norse were so close linguistically, that the influence was much less noticeable.  However, a great deal of the loss of inflection in English was due to Old Norse as both languages had many common and mutually intelligible roots, but differing inflections... so they just dropped them, so the story goes.  The conquerors did not really adopt the language, but they were simply outlasted and the subsequent generations of the nobility slowly adopted more English and even used it to get native support with subsequent conflict with the French.</li>
<li>Norman French - The Normans are actually named for the North Men, or Vikings, that took over the area.  The “conquerors” adopted the native language (they weren’t really conquerors at all, they were vassals).</li>
<li>French - The Franks were a Germanic tribe (more like a federation/confederation) that spoke a Germanic tongue.  Over time when the Frankish kingdom split up, the western part eventually adopted the Vulgar Latin dialect of the peoples there that became known as French.</li>
<li>Irish - from what I understand, Ireland wasn’t really a place with towns and cities prior to Viking domination.  Dublin was founded by the Vikings as a slaver colony.  The Vikings that stayed eventually assimilated into Irish culture and adopted the language.  As a matter of fact, one set of my great-grandparents... one was Norwegian and the other Irish... and the Irish was from a family that was of the ruling class in a western Irish county that were there for several hundred years, but were also Norwegian, in origin.  I just find that somewhat humorous.  Eventually, much of Irish is being pushed aside for English.</li>
<li>Britton Celtic - When the Romans “conquered” Britain, the didn’t really replace the language.  There were also plenty of areas where the Romans could not make progress (see: Hadrian’s Wall)</li>
</ol>
<p>This mostly happens because the ruling class has far less population than the dominated class.  When we tend to see a dominant class replacing a language is when there are much more of their population.  For instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>English - When the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, etc came to England, they replaced a significant portion of the population and thus the language.</li>
<li>English - When European colonization occurred in North America, English (and to a lesser extend, Spanish and French) replaced the native languages because the colonizing populations outnumbered the native populations, specifically in the areas where they colonized, which became greater regions over time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Times when the dominating population were not as significant but still replaced the language:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arabic - most Arabic speaking populations had their native languages replaced with Arabic via conquest.</li>
<li>French - See many of the French colonies in Africa.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that the key is to understand that things don’t always happen one way or another.  There are many different factors that determine what happens, but it likely comes down to strength of both the culture and total population.  For instance, when the Vikings moved into modern day Normandy, they thought they were aspiring to something by adopting the language... seeking approval.  Another significant reason is intermarriage and breeding.  When you have this happen and the cultures mix, it is often times males from the dominant culture coming in and bonding with the woman of the subjugated population.  In these instances, it is likely (I am intuiting) more common for the native language to persist because the mothers typically had more time with the children and taught them their language rather than the fathers’ languages; this also tends to happen when the dominant cultures employs the natives to assist in raising children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing you forgot to add to the population vs. lingua franca argument is weapons: guns in the 20th century created ruling classes that did not outnumber their subjugated but it definitely played apart in their conquering. </p>
<p>The exception to overwhelming numbers is overwhelming firepower.  Not to deter the conversation because your points are impressive: just thought I’d point out the methodology changed in the 18th century and the why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Russians, or rather, eastern Slavs, were already there. The Rus (or Varyags, as the vikings were called in eastern Europe) didn't conquer with numbers, or really conquer much at all. They mainly assimilated into the local population and started some dynasties (like the first Tsar dynasty, the Ruriks). </p>
<p>Think of it like William the Conqueror in England. They didn't outnumber the locals, and didn't replace the local languages with French (which the Normans from France spoke). They simply defeated the local ruling faction, took over, and became locals themselves.</p></div>		</li>
