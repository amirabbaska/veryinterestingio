			<div class="markdown"><p>how far up from the bottom do geothermal vents have active convective flow in the water column?  </p>
<p>I realize it's pretty complicated since there's a lot of heat energy that's dissipating changing water density, and also the salinity is constantly equalizing and changing the density in an opposite way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The convective flow I am referring to occurs within the oceanic crust, and it can reach down 2 to 3 kilometers. In the thinner crust within an active spreading center, that's pretty much the whole thickness of the oceanic crust. </p>
<p>Within the water column, the behavior of the brines is constrained by the degree of mixing with seawater, it's teperature and its salinity, as outlined by Sato (<a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/shigenchishitsu1951/22/111/22_111_31/_pdf" target="_blank">SATO, T. (1972). Behaviours of ore-forming solutions in seawater. Mining Geology, 22(111), 31-42</a>). Depending on the resulting density, they may either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>flow directly on the ocean floor whey they may subsist in a brine pool without significant mixing for quite some time (type I brines);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ascend in the water column, whetehr a little or a lot, while turbulence induces sufficient mixing and cooling to reverse the density and induce collapse (type II brines);</p>
</li>
<li>ascend in the water column and disperse (type III brines).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these three sceanrios, the last two are potentially associated with significant mixing and, I suppose, convection. Most reasearch I am aware of, however, focusses on the behavior of the brine in terms of the precipitation of metallic complexes and sort of looses track of the effects of convection on the water column.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No (to your second question), but that wasn't always obvious. It was once thought that salinity would always rise, so you could look at how much salt is entering the oceans through rivers to <a href="http://apps.usd.edu/esci/creation/age/content/failed_scientific_clocks/ocean_salinity.html" target="_blank">date the Earth</a>. This gives you an age on the order of 100 million years, so presumably that's about how long it took the oceans to equilibrate. Salinity levels would change if more salt was entering, or the salt sinks suddenly changed, which (wild wild speculation) I'm guessing isn't super likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If lakes can serve as habitat for dissolution of ions under &quot;conditions conductive to chemical weathering&quot;, can't oceans do it at the same capacity? If yes, and if the capacity is close to rivers and lakes, that would have to mean most of the ions evacuated this way would just have come from the oceans' floors directly, right? Because there is more total ocean sea bed surface than there is flowing and lake water?</p>
<p>If no, how come lakes can do what oceans can't? Is it because lakes have more water-flow over their ground than I assume?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should have elaborated a bit more there - the weathering mostly occurs within the catchment basin. The resulting ions transit through runoff, streams and the aquifer into he lakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah. So the minerals need to already be soft enough, and hence there is barely any ion extraction in river and sea beds, but mainly in dirt/plants/wind-weathered mountain-tops?</p></div>		</li>
