<p>Sometimes you get too many answers in ELI5 that are basically &quot;it's bad don't it&quot; or answer the wording roughly without explaining why! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had naturally flat feet all my life.  So much so that when I take off my shoes and put my foot out most people get a great laugh.  Honestly, they look like cave man portrayed flat.  It has never caused me any problems.  Hiking distances of several miles and running though I am not a fan of running it was never because of my feet.  The only time it has ever caused me a problem is when people (adults) said my flat feet were a problem and I needed arch supports or they bought me shoes with hard arches in them.  I could not wear/use either of these because forcing the arch was very painful and I could not walk far with them.  Never had any problems otherwise so my feet must be adapted to work well without an arch.  I'm 70 now and it remains a non-issue.</p></div>		</li>
