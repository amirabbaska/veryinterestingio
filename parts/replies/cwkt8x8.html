Vacuum situation aside (probably not this much force) it would seem that this would be catastrophic to any volume or structure that couldn't normalize uniformly.  17k PSI is roughly equivalent to the pressure created by a .44 magnum round.  Any gradient at these levels and at this scale would be a lot of force.  </p>
<p>This isn't an argument just elucidating my line of thought here :)</p></div>		</li>
