			<div class="markdown"><p>AM has more range, which is why you are more likely to find it in rural areas where people are more spread out.</p>
<p>Also, once the radio signal gets too noisy due to distance, bad weather, mountains or buildings, etc. AM will simply sound shittier until you can't hear it anymore. For FM, the radio simply won't be able to filter out the right frequencies and will drop the audio altogether.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The frequencies commonly used for AM radio have more range than the frequencies commonly used for FM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason so many truckers used to listen to AM talk radio is because with the right atmospheric conditions you could pick up the more powerful stations (50K watts) 500+ miles away, especially at night. These days, of course, everyone has satellite radio.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Analog FM will act the same as analog AM, it'll just continue to get quieter and more noisy until it's just static. Digital radio, on the other hand, will act as you said. It'll just continue to work fine right up until there's too many errors in the data stream, then the audio just dies a usually-robotic-sounding death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A short abbreviated history:
Until 1967, the FCC allowed simulcasting the AM signal on FM. On 1 January 1967 the FCC banned the practice, forcing the owners to come up with new content. That led to the use of the spectrum by upstarts such as rock, such as KMPX, which started playing rock music, good rock, stuff you weren't hearing on AM. They played whole albums, they played the songs we played at home but weren't hearing on the radio. </p>
<p>FM, as you now know, affords much better quality, so music moved to FM. Then, a few decades later, the FCC changed the rules again, allowing the rise of talk radio, but that's another topic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this did a lot of good for rock music back in the day, and had a lot of good radio hosts/personalities, because they were mainly seen as cheap filler. Broadcasting companies didn't care.   </p>
<p><em>Then</em> they saw there was money to be made, and out the window went DJs picking their own music or having any freedom at all to run their own shows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh I remember a local rock station here doing simulcasts on am/fm in the late 70's-early 80's. I was grateful, as my parents had two care with only AM radios. We could still hear modern stuff, instead of big band, news, or gospel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, is an awesome non-technical description of AM and FM.  I say that as someone who used to repair broadcast AM and FM transmitters.</p>
<p>The only thing I can add is that another reason it sounds horrible, is because the audio bandwidth of AM stations is 5KHz as opposed to the  15 KHz bandwidth of FM.  And FM gives a left and a right channel, if your receiver is so designed.</p>
<p>AM certainly could have increased bandwidth, but a wider receiver passband just makes it more susceptible to noise, requires far more transmitter power and reduces the number of individual stations that can be on the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, while FM is less susceptible to noise and intereference, its range is far lower than AMs is.</p>
<p>This is why, in the US at least, they use both AM and FM. FM is typically for music stations, while AM is for talk shows.</p>
<p>This is because music sound quality matters a good deal, so FM is used for the ideal quality, while talk shows want more viewers and care less about having the ideal sound so they use AM to maximize their viewer range.</p></div>		</li>
