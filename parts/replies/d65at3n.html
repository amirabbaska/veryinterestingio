			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>Let's say for example there is a beach landing with air and naval support. If there is the army on the ground, the navy at sea and the airforce in the sky then who controls them all and reacts as the battle unfolds?</p>
<p>If an enemy squadron of jets come to bomb the ships landing and the soldiers landing on the beach, how do these branches communicate? Is there an overall command centre where the branches work together? Who is at the top of the pyramid?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The staff officers involved in planning the landing prepare a sufficient number of Combat Air Patrols (CAP) over the landing area and a sufficient number of AA assets both ashore and on the water, as well as a tactical command structure and make a lot of arrangements, such as corridors for bombers to go in to smash shore defenses and go back to the carriers without being molested by shipborne AA, &quot;boxes&quot; for interceptors to patrol in, orbits and escorts for tanker aircraft and so forth, really a very long list of things.</p>
<p>During the engagement, a naval radar, or one from an AWACS more likely, will find the incoming bombers and relay this info to the air battle control center, where a controller will pick some interceptors (missiles or planes) and sic them on the bogeys and manage the engagement.</p>
<p>Some things (such as terminal defense guns on ships and guys ashore with IR MANPADs) will not be talked to at all - they will simply be waiting for anything to fly into their killzone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other people have answered on the organizational level. On the tactical level there are frequently members of other branches embedded in other units. An army company might have a member of the air force whose job it is to call in ground support aircraft, or to pass along warnings about air defenses that they have found back to the air force.</p>
<p>Sometimes flights will be preassigned to provide a unit with support, but more frequently the forward air controller will contact the radar support that quarterbacks the aircraft that they need support, and a flight that is available will be assigned. This same radar aircraft will also be monitoring for any incoming airstrikes and will both deploy aircraft assigned for defense and pass along the information up the chain of command. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's where the combat commands come into play. So Centcom (US central command) was responsible for the entirety of ground operations for both Iraq invasions and Afghanistan. And the cheif of staff for those combat commands coordinate their efforts.</p>
<p>For example, General Norman Schwarzkopf was commander of all forces during Desert Storm. Once he got the job from the president to attack Iraq, he and his other advising generals came up with a general plan of attack and then sent it down the chain like what is explained in the main comment.</p></div>		</li>
