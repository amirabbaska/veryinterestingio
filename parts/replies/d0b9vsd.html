I mean maybe you don't understand that money decreasing is a bad sign. But still there's no way you could think you were living frugally if your money is decreasing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't look at their money. If they do they think&quot;oh I still have plenty left,I can get x&quot;, and spend and spend until they find out they have nothing. This doesn't only apply with the rich, but all classes. Just replace x with whataburger and bars instead cars and vacations at luxurious resorts.</p></div>		</li>
