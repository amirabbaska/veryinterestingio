<p>Many of the plugs that USB replaced were not even hot-plug especially under Windows.</p>
<p>This means that if you plugged something in you would sometimes have to restart the computer.</p>
<p>Some really old computers would not allow you to plug in a PS/2 mouse while it was running.</p>
<p>When they designed the replacement for that they did not anticipate that frequent plugging in of the devices would occur. Stuff like USB-sticks were not something anyone foresaw.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've never encountered a computer that would allow hot-swap of PS/2 devices. What wizardry is this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trick here is that many newer computers use a built in ps2 to usb converter essentially, ps2 itself, older ps2 essentially connected directly to a processor, hot swapping could produce a variety of effects from crashing the pc, ruining the motherboard or just not working. If the two keyboard were similar (same drivers essentially) and the swap didn't crash or freeze the pc then it would have typically worked. </p>
<p>I'm a bit rusty on my ps/2 knowledge so it might not be 100%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. How is it 'weaker'?</p>
<p>and why is it that USB-C has evolved? I have a USB-C port on my laptop but it doesn't work as a headphone jack (USB-C headphones), merely a data connection device. Is this a software upgrade or a change to the USB-C?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's physically weaker just by matter of its size. The smaller the metal and plastic the more likely accidental force could snap something. The original USB standard was designed thinking that the smallest thing it'd go on would be a laptop. It was WAYYYYY smaller than a serial port at the time, and intended for devices like mice and printers. Making it even smaller woulda been harder to engineer for (then) little payoff. </p>
<p>(skipping the headphone question for now since Im not sure hopefully someone else chimes in) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on the fence with USB C's connector design, especially the female connector which has a tongue design, like Micro USB Type B. Makes the thing snap easily. Apple nailed the design of the Lightning port (found on iPhones and iPads): it is completely metal, and the female port has no tongue so it's easy to clean and maintain. However the female end pins have a slim profile and can easily be scratched, but regular maintenance should keep it working for ages. Sucks that the Lightning cable frays easily, and Lightning is proprietary, licensed and an older technology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll chime in on the headphones thing: essentially, yes the support of headphones is a software thing. It’s built into some phones and maybe even a part of the new android builds, but the USB-C port doesn’t inherently support audio. Audio is just another form of data, but it’s a specific type of data and needs to be changed into a format that would push out audio into your headphones. If USB-C just automatically assumed everything passing through it was audio then it would send everything to your headphones, which would probably end up sounding like one of those old modems you see in old movies.</p>
<p>EDIT: right, you said laptop. Windows would likely handle that port, which might need a driver to push out audio, but might also be set up to only be for data and power. It’s still a fairly new spec on laptops, so there’s not as much standardized treatment of its feature set just yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>USB-C is just referring to the <em>physical</em> connector, the bit of metal and pins at the end of your cable. What protocols and data transfer methods the port supports is dependent on the USB module that the port is connected to. Some USB-C ports support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface\)" target="_blank">thunderbolt</a> for things like high-res video and GPU tethering, while others just don't support this protocol.</p>
<p>It's possible that your system doesn't support the specific protocol that your headphones use, although I'd wager it's more likely that something is malfunctioning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>USB-C is merely a connection type. Audio playback or data transfer capability is determined by an USB controller chip inside your computer. Most USB-C equipped phones can do both data transfer, charging and audio using this single port, but it's not always the case for computers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The people behind the standard also needed to keep it as simple and cheap to implement as possible. OEM's were going to have to be convinced to add USB connectors while still having the legacy keyboard, mouse and printer connectors.  Connectors, gates and pins cost money OEMs were loathe to spend. Any OEM that immediately tried to drop the legacy connectors would be asking customers to buy new peripherals along with every new pc. Not exactly a strong selling point. The easiest way to accomplish an inexpensive design was a simple master-slave design that pushed complexity into the software.</p></div>		</li>
