<p>Some interesting things </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if continued unhindered, the earths rotation would continue slowing until the moon orbits the earth at the same rate as the earth orbits, around a month and half. This would happen in 4.5 billion years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>however, in 2 billion years, the suns increasing energy output would have since boiled away all of earths oceans, negating a large portion of the moons tidal pull on earth. So earth wouldn't slow its orbit early as fast after this. Additionally even if you didn't count this, the moon and earth would likely be destroyed by the red giant sun before 4.5 billion years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dinosaurs in the Mesozoic era evolved under a 21 hour day, as evidenced by corals that show a roughly 385-day year. This is because each day was shorter, so there were more days in a year.</p>
</li>
<li>it will take 150 million additional for the day to gain another hour.</li>
