<p>If the jury finds the defendant guilty despite overwhelming evidence that he is not guilty, the judge can overrule the jury.  The other way does not work: if the jury finds a defendant not guilty, that's it.</p>
<p>I've never actually looked up how often this really occurs, but I've always understood it to be rather rare; a judge would be staking his career that his decision to overrule the jury holds up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Check the actual law in your jurisdiction before maintaining this belief.</p>
<p>I'm aware of a case in England &amp; Wales where a judge directed a jury to return a guilty verdict to a manslaughter charge as a formality base upon the plea agreement between the Crown and the defence in a murder case. However, the jury, having heard the full background and facts to the offence refused to return a guilty verdict.</p>
<p>The jury kept repeatedly returning a not guilty verdict even though they were repeatedly directed to return a guilty verdict even under threat of prosecution for contempt. Eventually, the court accepted the juries decision to acquit although the point still stands their conduct constituted contempt for which they could be prosecuted.</p>
<p>It simply isn't the case in every jurisdiction that a juries conduct is always unimpeachable. Check the laws where you live before going down such a route if called to serve on a jury.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Of course, if you live in Libya, YMMV.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought that was settled in English law way back in 1670.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never seen an episode of Law and Order. </p>
<p>It's just one of the things a judge can do.  It's called either a judgment of acquittal or a judgment notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Incidentally, a judge can also change the money awards in a civil case if he feels it's excessive.  I'm not sure what that's called, but it's also pretty rare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The judge is the finder of law. His or her job is to answer the legal questions posed by the situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This leads me to an extra question, since U.S. citizen elect their judge, how do they ensure that they have sufficient legal knowledge ?
Can anybody run for judge or is a master/doctorate in law requested ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most states have laws requiring you to be a member of the bar (pass the bar exam) or be a practicing attorney before you can be a judge. You have to file as a candidate before you can be elected to any post, and that's when your eligibility is checked. I only say &quot;most&quot; states because I haven't bothered to check the law for every single state to make sure they have this provision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other poster's explanation, not all (or even most) judges in the US are elected. All federal judges are appointed. On the state level, twenty states choose their trial judges through partisan elections. In other states (like mine) the judges are appointed and must be confirmed by the state legislature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to testify against someone (sexual assault, guy was a predator, 15 charges, one was mine) and I was so relieved when I found out that I didn't have to speak in front of a jury. I felt safer. </p>
<p>Also, when the predator asked for changes in the bail agreement, each victim had to be called to be asked if we agreed to it. After we all said no, he had to speak to the judge, and got turned down, every time. (My phone rang off the hook for weeks, until he was told he couldn't change conditions)</p>
<p>Stuff like that, the judge has to deal with.</p>
<p>A jury seems like it would be incredibly difficult, cost more money, more time, drag it on longer, and there would be bias.</p>
<p>I also learned that having a damn good defense lawyer is good if they are proven guilty. Less change of an appeal. </p></div>		</li>
