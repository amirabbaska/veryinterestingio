			<p>&gt; this is often the reason why some otherwise random effect gets highlighted so much - without the effect you don't notice that the character is holding that object or whatever<br><br>Mjolnir feels heavy because of the weird whirring sound it makes whenever Thor is holding it.  Otherwise it would absolutely obviously be a 4oz foam prop.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes yes yes! And it's now a recognizable sound effect you can use to show, for example, that the hammer is approaching from behind an enemy at breakneck speed. It's a character in and of itself! Iron Man's palm guns have the same effect.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not a weapon, it's technically listed as a prosthetic, thank you.</p>		</li>

			<p>Alternatively, make the prop weigh 25 pounds by making it out of cast iron. Method-act that shit.</p>		</li>

			<p>That would be a problem, since the hammer isn't heavy to Thor at all.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hm!  Good point.  I noticed the use of sound in this way in the first Robert Downey Jr Sherlock Holmes movie - there's a piece of razor wire, or a thin blade, presented to the audience and the audio that goes along with it is the sound you'd expect it to make very very quietly.  <br><br>It sort of brings the object to life.</p>		</li>

			<p>To me, poor or unrealistic CGI takes me out of a movie faster than almost anything else. Pretty much any movie with heavy CGI makes me cringe. Things like Iron Man and The Avengers just kill me. It really bothers me if I can tell something is CGI. I can't even watch Star Wars.</p>		</li>

			<p>I have a question for you - how come a lot of recent movies seem to do this thing where they go from whispered dialogue that I can barely hear to the most insanely loud sound effects that leave my poor speakers nearly blown?<br><br>I've seen many recent action movies where I strain to hear the characters talking but the explosions and gun fights are so over-the-top loud I want to throw my speakers out the window.<br><br>Am I just getting old, or has anyone else noticed this?</p>		</li>

			<p>Two things here:<br><br>1) Movies are mixed for the theater. If you are watching on your computer or home system, even with great speakers the dynamic range isn't what a theater space can do. More and more mixes are accounting for this though.<br><br>2) There is such a thing as bad mixes. And its often not due to the mixers ability. There are some ace mixers out there. They're like the NASA steely eyed missile men (and women) but the director just wants the big sounds louder and louder or they want the music pumped up high or whatever. We do what the client wants.</p>		</li>
