<p>this is often the reason why some otherwise random effect gets highlighted so much - without the effect you don't notice that the character is holding that object or whatever</p>

<p>Mjolnir feels heavy because of the weird whirring sound it makes whenever Thor is holding it.  Otherwise it would absolutely obviously be a 4oz foam prop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes yes yes! And it's now a recognizable sound effect you can use to show, for example, that the hammer is approaching from behind an enemy at breakneck speed. It's a character in and of itself! Iron Man's palm guns have the same effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm!  Good point.  I noticed the use of sound in this way in the first Robert Downey Jr Sherlock Holmes movie - there's a piece of razor wire, or a thin blade, presented to the audience and the audio that goes along with it is the sound you'd expect it to make very very quietly.  </p>
<p>It sort of brings the object to life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fascinating how the audio tropes can shift or evolve over time.  </p>
<p>I was watching some old war movies over the holidays, and was amazed at how many of the gunshots were accompanied by the &quot;Pteeeeeeeeeeeer&quot; sound of a ricochet.  At the time, it was common practice, but sounds weird and outdated now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was watching some movie the other night with my wife, and there was a scene with a knife fight. I got really annoyed with the &quot;schwing, schwing, schwing&quot; sound every time they stabbed at each other.</p>
<p>As if their knifes were being stabbed so fast that the blades were parting the air. </p>
<p>I hit mute for the scene, and found it even more off putting without the sound. I mean, the scene had no grunts, music, sounds, anything, just &quot;schwing, schwing, schwing&quot; and as much as I hated it, it was better with the terrible sound effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be because they're not actually hitting each other. In a lot of modern movies at least, shitty choreography is hidden with shaky camera and sound effects. Pretty sure this video explains what I'm talking about nicely and adds some contrast with impact done correctly: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ</a></p>
<p>Anyways, when they're not actually hitting each-other properly, either by perspective or some other trick, like arresting the momentum of their punches before they hit, it can come off as offputting, especially if you can't exactly pinpoint what's wrong with what you're seeing. It just comes off as unnatural. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of those sounds were because they were created in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_\(filmmaking\)" target="_blank">foley</a> (coconuts for horse hooves, slapping wood together for a gunshot, etc.)</p>
<p>Now it's largely prerecorded in sound libraries by specialists who offer a dozen (or a hundred) different &quot;realistic&quot; gun sounds, so you have the opportunity to hear an actual gun being cocked, or an actual bullet hitting concrete, instead of a live instrumental imitation of it.</p>
<p>Edit: of course foley is still in wide use. I just meant that now we can get actual recordings of explosions or horsehooves or tires screeching if we want, in addition to whatever foley artists are doing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I upvoted this because I want to emphasize to everyone else the distinction between sound effects and foley that you're making here.</p>
<p>Sound effects, or &quot;Hard effects,&quot; are things you cut from libraries. Gunshots, doors, cars, explosions, etc. You sometimes record these effects yourself as well. You place it in sync with picture and cut it up to match, that sort of thing. Most of a sound editor's work is placing these hard effects and layering them. So a gunshot might have a ton of different elements - the gun, the explosion, the hit, the ricochet, the casing falling to the ground, whatevs. </p>
<p>There are some effects that that doesn't work for, though. Little things. Footsteps. Small props like a set of keys that a character takes out of their  pocket and they jingle just so. It's impractical to cut all that stuff in step by step, jingle by jingle. It is actually faster and more practical to play the movie and match the recording with a performance of the prop for sound. That's foley. So a foley artist will recreate the steps, recreate the props, also do a cloth rustle pass, a hand pat pass, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Why would you cover all this if it's already present in the sound recorded on set? A few reasons: </p>
<p>1) For international release the English is eliminated and redubbed in foreign languages, and the foley provides the crucial movement sounds to fill in the emptiness of the missing production. </p>
<p>2) Many times the production sound just isn't all that great. It's loud, the background stinks, and you end up re-recording the dialogue through a process called ADR. You need to bring in the foley to fill in the holes for that as well. And most importantly...</p>
<p>3) The production dialogue, if done well, is done to maximize the quality of the dialogue recording, and thus is done with an eye to minimizing all that extra sound. If you re-record it in foley, you can then control it. You can decide you want it to be noisier to emphasize the chaos of the scene, or maybe this is a really intimate moment between two characters and you don't want all that clothing rustle getting in the way. The important thing is that unlike before where the production was married to the movement, now you can control how much movement sound you want in there. </p>
<p>Anyhoo, the difference between hard effects and foley.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing how many of the sounds I hear in modern movies/shows/commercials I first heard in 90's video games.  Particularly &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Command and Conquer&quot;.  I've lost count of how many times I've heard grunts and guys screaming when they get killed that came from those games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was super surprised a little over a year ago when I heard a bunch of rifles actually making a similar sound as the bullets skipped up the side of a hill. It wasn't constant, but bullets do sound like that sometimes.</p>
<p>It happens when a high-powered rifle or machine gun shoots bullets at supersonic speeds that glance off the ground, rather than impacting. After the bullet's trajectory is modified, sometimes it begins to tumble through the air super fast, causing a high-pitched buzzing or screaming sound. Also, you only really notice it as the bullet passes by you, not while it's going away from you or coming toward you.</p>
<p>No idea why it was exaggerated to the point of being a movie trope, but there you go. At least it was based on reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider that in the 1950s heyday of this kind of thing an enormous chunk of the audience had actually been subject to real gunfire in WWII.  That has never happened since. The zaniness of it may also have served a very real need for separation from the true sounds of battle which those men knew all too well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer in the thread. I find sound design fascinating and your comment provides a really interesting perspective. I always thought the unrealistic gun handling sounds on screen were ridiculous, but your explanation really makes sense.</p>
<p>What's the deal with the Wilhelm Scream? I understand some of the sound effects you mentioned add to the art of a scene, but this scream always seems to do nothing but break my suspension of disbelief. </p></div>		</li>
