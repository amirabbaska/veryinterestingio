<p>The famous bassist Victor Wootin, recommends practising known content while watching TV. This is to get you from step 3 to 4.</p>
<p>From step 2 to 3 takes intense concentration. What is every muscle doing, how does it interact, how hard am I playing, is there any tension. </p>
<p>In the book &quot;The Inner game of music&quot;, they talk about a pilot flying through a big cloud and landing with poor visibility. How does he do it when he can't see? By concentrating intensely on his instrument.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is fantastic advice. I do this. I also practice while listening to other music because I am insane and think it's &quot;good excercise&quot; to be distracted. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I feel like I'm one of those dudes who has unconscious competence but no conscious competence. I can make the random throw to the trash can every single time I spontaneously think to throw something to it.
But If I try again and put effort into it, I'm terrible. </p>
<p>I've always been naturally good at things, but when I get in to things and learn the nuances and &quot;meta&quot;, I end up doing terribly.
It's like im always overthinking.</p>
<p>Now im sitting here overthinking my overthinking. great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're doing is actually called &quot;unlearning&quot;, going from unconscious competence to conscious incompetence. This is how habits are broken. When we first learn a skill we usually go through all those steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Can't do it and I don't even know how.</li>
<li>Can't do it but I know what to do.</li>
<li>Can do it and I know exactly how</li>
<li>Can do it but couldn't tell you how.</li>
</ol>
<p>You're using your conscious mind to try and relearn the task, even though your unconscious knows how. The ability to switch between the stages is not easy, thus sporting games are very mentally challenging.</p>
<p>Start with getting rid of the limiting belief &quot;I'm always overthinking&quot; and &quot;I always end up doing terribly&quot;. If you keep believing these things they will be true, but know in your mind that you are capable of anything, including not overthinking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's a boiled down version. Basically when someone learns a new skill, especially as a child, they will be bad and not really know it. Then as they get more exposure to the skill and see how it's supposed to be done they realize how bad they are. Then after practice they can perform the skill with some conscious effort. With enough practice the skill becomes second nature. An athlete who is competitive in his or her sport doesn't need to think about the basic skills (dribbling a basket ball, passing a soccer ball accurately etc) and can therefore focus more attention on the strategic and predictive elements (setting up plays, deeking, seeing a play develop before it happens). Unconscious competence is the end goal of any learned skill.</p>
<p>What you're describing is something that affects everyone. A golfer who over thinks their swing won't be able to perform the way they want to. You're trying to take conscious control of a movement or skill that is better left to you subconscious which has been trained to do the skill without thought.</p></div>		</li>
