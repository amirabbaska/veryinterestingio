			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, the smell comes from microscopic particles that whirr around in space that are similar to certain chemicals that occur in cooked beef... This also happens to EVA suits working on the ISS because the particles impact the suit and stick to it... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I can't find any references to that. According to this nasa article, they are stating it smells like spent gun powder.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong... I learned it a long time ago in an article about spacewalks, it may be the moon dust itself that changes the smell if I'm not wrong...
<em>edit</em>
Finished the article, I believe the smell has to do with ionic bonds from solar wind ions creating smells similar to the theory about the crushed moondust creating the smells... not sure about that though...</p></div>		</li>
