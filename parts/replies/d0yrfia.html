<p>There's still a &quot;mystery&quot; spray paint wall stain, a &quot;mystery&quot; section of cut carpet, and a &quot;mystery&quot; chip in the kitchen tile in my parents' house, and I left for college ten years ago. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Heartburn for you is vomit for a kid.</p>

<p>I'm skeptical of this. Is there something you can point to which says that the mechanism for heartburn has a biological distance it travels? It sounds like you're implying that the acid from heartburn travels a set distance from birth, and I just don't see how that can be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no set distance. The acid will travel some distance based on the forces acting on it, including the tightness of the sphincter, the pressure within the stomach, and gravity depending on your body position. What I said is just that it takes less force to get the stomach contents to travel shorter distances. Kids can still have heartburn, too, it's just that it's easier for that reflux to make it all the way to the mouth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So eating waaaay too much and getting heartburn = a kid eating too much pizza and ice cream and tossing his cookies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You eat too much and you feel shitty and guilty. A kid eats too much and then launches it right back at you. It's even more exaggerated with infants. Have you ever fed an infant and then &quot;burped&quot; it? What a euphemism that is. They should call it puking the baby.</p></div>		</li>
