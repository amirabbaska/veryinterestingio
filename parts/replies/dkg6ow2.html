			<div class="markdown"><p>I always have trouble pouring homemade broth from the pot (with a pour spout) into a jar or measuring cup. Because it's liquid gold, it naturally spills all over the damn place. I've tried speeding up,  just to have it spill all over the place faster. My natural conclusion is that cohesion and surface tension are affected by temperature, which makes sense to me when considering the effect heat generally has on molecules. I haven't tried this myself yet, but my hypothesis seems to be backed up by Google. If you don't want to spill try letting it cool first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this frustration - I got a large ladle with a pouring spout and that is good to transport liquids and stews to storage containers. Ladle it down about 3/4 of the way down, then the angle will be right for it to pour neatly the rest of the way. </p></div>		</li>
