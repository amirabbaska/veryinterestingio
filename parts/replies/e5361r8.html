			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up: How does healing work with areas that are often in contact with filth IE the anus, the nose, the ear canal? All I know is that there's something about a mucous discharge with the anus but beyond that I have no idea how the body goes about ensuring wounds in those spots don't get infected</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First: We have in those places a ton of normal bacterial flora which is mostly harmless (ofc in the blood they are all bad) but that is blocking out a large chunk of more dangerous bacteria, second: You will most likely get some bacteria into the wound but these are in small quantities, so your body shouldnt have an issue taking care of them. However it is possible to get a serious infection due to a small lesion. because sometimes its tol much for our bodies to handle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question. Since you seen knowledgable about the digestive system, I'll use this opportunity to ask: why aren't fences really considered toxic until they exit the body? If I were to drop a log then immediate eat it, why exactly would I get sick? what sort of chemical changes has it undergone that make it so toxic? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The venous blood of the GI tract also drains into the portal vein, which goes to the liver. The liver filters it and kills most bacteria before it is recirculated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your immune system is very well aware of bacteria that live on/in your body and maintain active defenses targeting them since they often end up in any little wound. </p>
<p>Its the bacteria your body has never seen before that can take it by surprise and cause massive infections before your immune system knows how to fight it.</p>
<p>The existing bacteria on us also help prevent any other new bacteria from being able to colonize by out competing them, so your immune system does not have to learn to fight new bacteria as long as wounds (open wounds have no existing bacteria to fight new bacteria) don't get fresh bacteria (ie: from dirt) introduced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;never seen before&quot; is kinda innacurate. Any one of your normal flora can grow to a problematic level if they are left unopposed (in a simlar way to what you said... that new bacteria can be problematic if unopposed by your own flora and immune system) or work their way into your system, e.g. Some Viridans Strep species just chilling in your mouth until some dental procedure leads to a patient getting endocarditis.</p>
<p>edit: Nevermind... i just realized you noted that they often interact with the your immune system. I don't know how i missed that. Sorry. lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, maybe you know it but didn't express it correctly (for my way of reading it). The platelets are responsible for the primary hemostasis and activate secondary hemostasis, of which clotting factors are responsible (and are the ones that end up creating the ultimate clot)</p></div>		</li>
