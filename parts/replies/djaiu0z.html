			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is the most correct answer. If we were willing to risk overcharging the cells, we could charge the battery as fast as we wanted, and had power to spend. The best analogy is not compressing a spring or stacking bags of flour. It's trying to stop a speeding car right on a line without overshooting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there is more than a &quot;risk&quot; of overcharge or wear. Batteries will certainly be damaged if exposed to voltages above 4.2v (with some, but not much, wiggle room). Voltage is the &quot;force&quot; that makes current flow. So once you're putting (for example) 1 amp into the battery and 4.2v is required to achieve that, you <strong>cannot</strong> charge faster (or continue charging as fast for longer) because this would require (for example) 4.3v. Again, you physically could, but this is less of a &quot;overcharge if you aren't careful&quot; situation and more of a &quot;guaranteed firey death&quot; situation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Top answers basically just restated the question with an analogy. The others taught none of the voltage stuff which would explain WHY this happens.</p></div>		</li>
