			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally agree with what you're saying, however I have another possible approach as to how OP 's daughter can distinguish a sad song . It may have to do with culture, but here me out. Scientists, two of whom I'm very close with have ran tests similar to that of this post. Children are psychologically more open to emotion than us adults are so when they hear a mellow tone, it'll perhaps trigger a part of their brain with a suppressed emotion</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I think that’s true and that might actually be “innate” or biological. It’s a bit different from understanding minor=sad and major=happy. I think what you might be referring to is our natural predisposition to calm and our natural aversion to loud/unpleasant/discordant sounds. So both major and minor scales should have a calming effect on the child assuming what they’re hearing is not loud or striking. Whereas blasting some death metal will create an unpleasant or fear response. So I’m in agreement with you! My post was more about understanding musical choices in scale or mode and how it appears to us that minor songs are intuitively, almost innately, sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a long time ago, I think daughter was like 1 or 2. I was watching a movie on a laptop and it was ending. I was wearing headphones. I don't remember the movie, but at the end you can see the guy either walking away or riding on a horse, think it was the horse. No way the daughter could have known it was a sad sending, but she walked up, watched the laptop for like 30 seconds, and started crying.</p></div>		</li>
