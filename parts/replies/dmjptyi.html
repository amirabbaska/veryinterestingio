			<div class="markdown"><p>A battery is a power source in itself, so it might sound weird, but we're not using the battery's power for energy, only to say if it's a 1 or a 0 we want to store as information (if you want to store a 0 as data, you can have an empty battery, then you have no power source!). This &quot;memory&quot; will keep it's memory even if it's not connected to a power source, but you need to connect it write to it, charging it up or depleting it, each time you want to read from the memory you may also want to charge it back up if it was a charged, otherwise it will eventually get depleted and show a 0 although it should be a 1.</p>
<p>So, every battery you have at home is a digital memory, able to store 1 whole bit of memory!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What exactly are you having trouble with? The reason why the battery setup could work as a memory, or how having only 2 states(1 and 0) can save data?</p></div>		</li>
