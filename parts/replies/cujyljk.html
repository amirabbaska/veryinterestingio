			<p>Ally with?  No.  Have business deals with?  Probably.  Yakuza do seem to employ Korean descendants born in Japan, who have to deal with some institutionalized racism.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are many korean yakuza.  One of the known God fathers in yakuza history was a korean named hisayuki machi known as the Ginza tiger.  <br><br>Zainichi Koreans fit well into the yakuza because of the racial discrimination in Japan.  There are many high ranking koreans in the yakuza.<br><br>The korean mafia are allies with the yakuza.  Yakuza refer to korea as a second home due to hisayuki having ties with the government in korea.  </p>		</li>
