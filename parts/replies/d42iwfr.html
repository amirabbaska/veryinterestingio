			<div class="markdown"><p>Does granulation of the glass come into play? Meaning, when the glass breaks into a million tiny shards, do those shards then pack together infront of the bullet creating a very dense area infront of the bullet, that is larger than the bullet itself, increasing the surface area (dissipating force), and then that along with the bullet push into the plastic to stop the momentum? </p>
<p>I feel like the entire mechanic does not just depend on several sheets of glass breaking, if you spread apart each pane of glass / plastic so there was space inbetween, the bullet would probably go right through all of them, meaning that it's because they are sandwiched and some phenomenon happening because they are sandwiched is what is stopping the bullet. Not just because it is going through 5 panes of glass/plastic. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bFW7VQpY-Ik" target="_blank">Here is a video</a> demonstrating this effect with a robotic grip. The beanbag is filled with tiny granules, after the bag is pushed onto an object, the air is sucked out, the granules bunch together very tightly and the bag becomes rigid, allowing it to pick up pretty much anything. They even made some toys in the 90's on this premise, but I can't remember what they were called. This should be why sand bags are so effective at stopping bullets too, and glass is made of sand so maybe this is one of the reasons why it works so well. </p>
<p>It's like if you replaced the panes of glass with tempered glass that breaks into bigger chunks, then it wouldn't be able to stop a bullet. I would love to see a comparison of say 5 layers of glass with a plastic backing, versus 5 sheets of tempered glass with a plastic backing. I'd also like to see what happens when you shoot a bullet straight down into very thick ice on a lake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chobham composite tank armor has tough ceramics that is meant to shatter the penetrator. The ceramic particles will dull and abrade the penetrator as it travels through the armor. The elastic backing of the ceramic is meant to expand away from its backing so the penetrator has to travel through more material to defeat the armor. The ceramic plate is also moving as the penetrator is travelling through, which might snap the penetrator.</p>
<p>That's one reason why Americans use depleted uranium in their anti armor rod penetrators. The uranium is pyrophoric and will sharpen itself as it travels through the armor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laminated tempered glass is used in bulletproof glass.</p>
<p>Tempered glass increases the toughness of the glass and the lamination keeps the glass together after breaking. This is why bulletproof glass can stop multiple shots as tempered glass will completely fracture from one impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like the entire mechanic does not just depend on several sheets of glass breaking,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not just the glass breaking it's the combination of two materials to get the traits of both. Elasticity comes from the plastic and hardness comes from the glass. The two of these together are what stops the bullet not just the glass breaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I friend of mine used to have a strange object.  It was a solid brick of some transparent material about three inches thick.  In it were two bullets that look like they had been dropped into water kind of like this: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2STyBcC.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/2STyBcC.jpg</a> It wasn't fractured.  It looked more like it was melted, but they had definitely been fired into it.</p>
<p>The bullets looks like they penetrated no more than an inch.  And this material was a solid uniform chunk of...something.</p>
<p>Any idea what it was?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost certainly a ballistic proof test of polycarbonate.  The material will buckle and the bullet will embed in it.  There will probably be a raised &quot;ripple&quot; around the hole due to the material displaced during hole formation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And shine you have!  After building and operating a ballistic testing lab 30 or so years ago to characterize the impact resistance of various composite sandwich structures, I love your tile and trampoline metaphor.  </p>
<p>Our goal was to build a floor material for for an open top trailer that could handle the impact of big chunks of concrete with rebar sticking out of them; i.e. demolition waste.  Add the that the constraints of low weight and low cost.</p>
<p>The winning combination was a sprayed on, very hard urethane coating over several layers of triaxial glass boat cloth, a foam core, and a final layer of that same glass.  The simulated load would crack and/or chip the urethane, but spread out quickly through the glass fiber/epoxy composite layers below.</p>
<p>So, a stiff layer for abrasion and impact, followed by several layers of glass fibers in stiff epoxy, would spread the impact energy out super fast with minimal structural damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We were building a composite trailer and some truck components, using aerospace technology and design but substituting cheaper materials from the boat building industry (fiberglass racing boats).  The idea was to lighten up the empty weight of commercial trucks. </p>
<p>The boat industry held that end-grain balsa wood was wonderful for impact.  Super light as a core material.  We got some flexible sheets of this balsa wood (think of a 2x4 stud cut into one inch chunks and one end grain surface glued to a mesh).  In boating applications, this was good enough; boats were mostly bumping into stuff in the water and a little dent was easily repaired. But the boats were heavy because they were overbuilt by design.  There wasn't any emphasis on lightweight for its own sake.  </p>
<p>Our test rig consisted of a section of steel I-beam cut into a 1&quot; square contact point, dropped from 20 feet onto the test article, a 1 foot square sample supported on two beams. </p>
<p>The balsa wood with glass fabric skins was destroyed.</p>
<p>IIRC, a soft, dense urethane rubber with a glass cloth backing that could be glued to another structure was the best in terms of energy absorption, but was heavy.  No damage to the glass fibers underneath the urethane.  Also expensive.  Also tough to cut into shapes.</p>
<p>We tried pour-in-place urethanes and they were OK for smaller parts, but didn't scale up to large trailers very well.  Also expensive.</p>
<p>We tried Kevlar fabric; it absorbed a lot of energy but deformed too much.  It's stretchy.</p>
<p>The rigid urethane coating came from the oil industry.  Their application?  Coating the pipes that pipelines were built from.  The purpose?  Building pipelines was 'harsh' on materials, meaning the pipes would be dragged all over the Texas desert and this coating prevented the ends of the pipe from getting gouged up before being welded together.  </p>
<p>The urethane was toxic and had to be applied with a waterfall background to catch the overspray.  I asked the application tech what happened to the urethane when the pipes were welded.  He said something like 'It hasn't come up'.  This was the late 80s.  </p>
<p>So the really impact resistant composite sandwich in tests was a foam core, a heavy layer of tri-ax glass cloth, a layer of glass mat, in an epoxy matrix, vacuum bagged to perfection and then sprayed with sexy, oil industry rigid urethane.  </p>
<p>This combo never went into production; the urethane costs and toxicity were too high.  Instead, we found that adding several layers of glass mat gave an acceptable cost/weight/durability combo.</p>
<p>In my home shop a few years later, I was interested in making a composite spring.  I had learned a lot from dropping a chunk of steel while hanging onto a 30' ladder.  Some combos broke, some boinged. </p>
<p>I was a composite mold and tool maker, not an engineer. But I called a bunch of aerospace sales reps from some engineering journals (no internet then) and requested samples, which they happily shipped to my 'shop' address.  The magic words in the late 80s were &quot;commercial application&quot;.  Every supplier knew that the military market was stable and growth would come from non-military markets.</p>
<p>I wanted to characterize all of the samples of materials that were sent.  My home test cell consisted of a 10 pound sledge hammer, safety glasses, and the concrete floor of the garage.  Test samples consisted of a fixed amount of epoxy mixed with various fibers and fillers in various percentages of fill relative to the epoxy.  The test samples looked like hockey pucks.  They were made in paper cups.</p>
<p>There was a Kevlar product that looked like golden wool.  It was likely made by accident when trying to make a sexy thread.  It had the look of something that had gone wrong.  The randomness of the direction of the fibers turned out to be ideal for impact strength.  </p>
<p>Baseline was no fill.  The epoxy puck shattered just like glass.  Powdered fillers actually increased the impact strength, but still shattered (I remember being surprised by this).  Steel shot fill broke into larger chunks. Chopped glass was better; with a high enough fill, breakage still occurred but the puck remained mostly together.</p>
<p>The Kevlar wooly stuff was magic; a little went a long way.  I don't recall the percentage of fill, but very quickly I reached a point where I couldn't even fracture the surface of the puck and the weight of the sample was the least of any filled sample.  </p>
<p>BTW there used to be a wonderful book by a Chemical Engineer about compounding putties and other related stuff for all kinds of applications.  It had recipes for making putties with fillers ranging from walnut shells to titanium dust to metal chips from the machine shop floor, and many different matrix materials from exotics to polyester.  Wonderful bedside reading.</p>
<p>THE engineering resource for composite materials is SAMPE.  Google them.  Very welcoming and expert membership.  I attended a few of their conferences in California and had a ball on the exhibit floors.  Some of the old timers are an excellent resource for learning how to get things done on the cheap.</p>
<p>Another great resource is EAA, the Experimental Aircraft Association, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.  If you ever want to spend a hot and humid week crawling under homebuilt composite airplanes, and every other kind of airplane, AND talking to the builders and designers of those planes face to face, AND getting some hands on training with the materials, their fly-in is the place.</p>
<p>Andy Marshall's book, 'Composite Basics', is also invaluable for learning how to get stuff done on the cheap.  </p>
<p>The best source for buying small amounts of high grade composite materials is Aircraft Spruce and Specialty.  Another source I've used is Tap Plastics.</p>
<p>I changed careers 20 years ago and don't play with composites anymore.  Turns out my immune system doesn't play well with amine cured epoxies.  So now I play with computer programs.  I do miss the tactile satisfaction of building and breaking stuff.  Crashing a server just isn't the same...  ;-)</p></div>		</li>
