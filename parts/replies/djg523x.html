			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not necessarily true. Most standing desks are for people with back or neck pain. Sitting is really bad for us unless you are in the proper position with the correct chair, which is pretty rare. Standing is a much less straining position for your back in most cases.</p></div>		</li>
