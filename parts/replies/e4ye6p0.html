			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends how often you get rain, if it hasn't rained in my area for months then the first rain is awful. But if we are getting weekly storms then there usually isn't enough oil building up to make it noticeable. Tar snakes and any markings on the road though become perilous even if there is a light drizzle so watch for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it rained so infrequently when I lived a little east of San Diego that when it did there were times I'd have to sit in the side of a freeway onramp because it was too slippery to drive on.  No matter how lightly I would let the clutch out my back to would just spin.  So, I'd let it spin and push my way over to the side and just sit there in the rain.  After just a few minutes I'd be on my way.</p></div>		</li>
