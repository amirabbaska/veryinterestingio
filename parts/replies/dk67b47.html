			<div class="markdown"><p>I read &quot;barn&quot; while nodding in quiet recognition that not all barns look the same. Your barns might look different from my barns, but in the end, which barn is the 'right' one? They both are. Our barns have equal claim to the title of &quot;The Barn&quot; just as we both hold claim to the title of &quot;human&quot;. We are all people and those are all barns.</p>
<p>After a moment of deep reflection, I decided it looked not like a barn, but more like a stomach. I came back to report my findings, only to find I'm an idiot.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It also states that the difference would be no more than 40 volts if they've been near each other for at least a minute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is also highly doubtful whether this requirement is necessary even for free–flyers because the plasma contactor holds the station structure within 40 volts of the plasma potential, which is acquired by any free–flyer within less than a minute</p>

<p>I still don't understand, though. Is this saying that each is held within 40 volts of &quot;space&quot; and therfor within 40v of each other as long as they are in a similar region of space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a static charge.</p>
<p>A car can be charged to thousands of volts from static.  It appears all the refueling fires are started by the driver picking up static when he slides across the seat, rather than a charge on the vehicle.  </p>
<p>Case in point, it almost never happens to older people, because they grab the door frame on the way out, draining the charge.</p>
<p>If a &quot;zap&quot; is undesirable, you lead with a probe with a 1-100 megaohm resistor to equalize the charge.  The net charge is quite low.  It takes only a few milliseconds to drain. </p></div>		</li>
