<p>Long term, exposure radiation (of all types, alpha, beta, and gamma) more or less translates into DNA damage. DNA damage can sometimes be repaired, although generally the damage builds up over time. Most cells are actually pretty resistant to radiation, but the build up of damage eventually causes the loss of function or viability from stem cells, or even cancer.</p>

<p>You have been exposed to alpha, beta negative and gamma radiation since the moment you were born. Likely you've been exposed to beta positive emissions as well.</p>
<p>Radiation exposure != DNA damage</p>
<p>Large amounts of ionizing radiation will certainly cause all kinds of damage, not just DNA. </p>
<p>Eating a banana exceeds the IAEA's limit for safe exposure to radiation. But the IAEA holds the idea that any radiation is bad radiation, which is false. Taking two breaths of air exceeds the IAEA's suggested limit of radiation exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I put 'more or less.'  Most places subscribe to the 'safe dose' style of thinking but personally I follow ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principles and a linear no-threshold dose level of personal safety.  Despite working in 'the industry' I get more radiation dose from having to drive by a hospital on the way to work than I actually do at work, which is pretty impressive considering the amount of nuclear material stored and worked with there.</p>
<p>Also, hormesis hasn't been proven in vitro in humans unless I'm mistaken at which point feel free to correct me!  I could stand to get a tan...</p></div>		</li>
