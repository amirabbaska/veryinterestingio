<p>Edit: also cool, relevant video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>If you are on the surface</em>, gravity acceleration would point mostly 'vertically' (radially?) into the surface (depending where on the torus you are). Just imagine that increasing the major radius you can approximate the planet to a infinite cylinder.</p>
<p><em>If you are far away</em>, the planet is just a dot located in its center of mass and we can use Newton's gravitation law for a point mass .</p>
<p>However, <em>if you in space near the planet</em>, you'd need to input your current position to know exactly where the acceleration of gravity is pointing (and how strong it is).</p>
<p>So basically, the acceleration of gravity does not point to the center of mass, and if I understood your question: yes, to a point located on the <em>surface</em> of a big enough ring, the pull towards the center of mass of the ring would be tiny.</p>
<p>EDIT: the calculations should be done with a modification of Newton's formulation that takes into accound a <em>distribution of mass</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_gravity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law_for_gravity</a></p></div>		</li>
