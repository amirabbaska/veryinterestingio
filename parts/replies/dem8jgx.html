			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be the case for something like a laser, but a flashlight would have a beam wide enough to cover a sufficient swath of the sky to not need such precision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A laser would disperse greatly at that distance as well though. (I don't know much about the subject but I also assume there are lasers that exist that have extremely focused beams as well) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand; the flashlight isn't a laser, it illuminates a broad area, especially at that distance. Which is another reason why the energy actually hitting its target is so astronomically small, it just goes all over the place</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I wasn't accounting for the planets being at separate points in their orbits, now I feel silly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies depending on the location of Earth and Mars in their orbits. On average, it's 12.5 light minutes. Sometimes were close, sometimes were on opposite sides of the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just copied from Google:</p>
<p>Mars is on average about 225 million km from Earth (the distance varies greatly, depending on both planets' position in their orbits). That translates to an average distance of 12.5 light minutes. It can vary from about 4 minutes to 24 minutes, depending on Mars's current distance from Earth.</p>
<p>I remember with the rovers they can't just send commands to them due to how long the signal takes to get there and then the image to come back, so routes are planned carefully.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>225 million km is the average distance, the closest approach is about 50 million km.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity: Let's take the lunar laser ranging laser and shine it on Mars. The <a href="http://www.physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/apollo/basics.html" target="_blank">Apache Point laser</a> has a divergence of about 1 part in 200,000. At a Mars/Earth separation of 100 million kilometers (chosen to have some reasonable angle between Earth and Sun as seen by Mars), that leads to a spot 500 km wide. Narrow enough that we have to aim for a specific point on Mars. It has 3E17 photons per pulse. Let's build an identical telescope on Mars, with a diameter of 3.5 meters. Neglecting atmospheric absorption, it will receive <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3E17+*+(3.5m%2F500km\)%5E2" target="_blank">15 million photons</a>. It is sensitive to individual photons, so we'll get a massive signal.</p>
<p>What about a human eye? In the dark, human pupils have a diameter of about 6 mm. We get 45 photons. That is visible as brief blink of light as well! Unfortunately, the human eye does not have a world class spectrometer and nanosecond timing resultion - it will also see all the other light from Earth. But if we could switch off the sun, we could see this laser blinking with the naked eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Optical laser communication has been tested in space and indeed was planned by NASA to be tested between Earth and Mars, but the mission in question (Mars Telecommunications Orbiter) was cancelled. Of course, they wouldn't have used humans as receivers...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a dedicated receiver: Easy.</p>
<p>With a human eye it doesn't work, the rest of Earth is way too bright.</p>
<p>We have multiple satellites in Mars orbit. Multiple independent communication items at the surface to talk to the satellites wouldn't be too problematic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which makes sense, I guess, when you think about the fact that we've been able to reliably send and receive radio signals to/from our landers on Mars. </p>
<p>Granted, the equipment involved is more sophisticated than a handheld flashlight, but the Viking landers' transmitters were only 30 watts. Not terribly far off from a flashlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but on the other hand it beams back to 30m radio dishes. You need a lot more power to get a signal back to its much smaller receiver.</p></div>		</li>
