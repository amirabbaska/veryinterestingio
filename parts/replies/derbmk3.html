<p>It is not a fringe belief to believe God to be genderless, but pretty normal theology, at least in every church I have ever been too. Calling God the Father is more of a comparison than a literal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet because God is referred to as &quot;Father&quot;, he's often called a &quot;He&quot;. He certainly does not have a gender as we perceive gender, but it would be a lot more impersonal in prayer to refer to God as &quot;It&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We call God &quot;he&quot; because in the English language, when the gender is uncertain (but implied to exist), we use the masculine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually he is called the Father because he is our literal Father in the divine life.</p>
<p>When Christians are born again of the Holy Spirit they receive the life of the Father and become sons of God. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it would also be fair to call him/her/it our Mother, and all of us to be daughters of God. The use of a masculine term is a mixture of grammar and metaphor.</p>
<p>God is not &quot;literally&quot; our father because literally being a father is a physical/genetic condition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's really not possible to ELI5 a doctrine that is acknowledged to be something beyond human understanding. A major point of the doctrine of the trinity as it is formulated within orthodox (small &quot;o&quot; orthodox) Christianity is that the relationship between the persons of the godhead is inexplicable. Reducing it to an ELI5 level may be helpful for a newcomer to get a rough idea, but they will probably walk away with an understanding closer to modalism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mormons also reject the Trinity notion and suggest is simply is three completely separate entities. A Mormon was trying to convert me and said if you look at the Bible, there is never a single reference to the Trinity.</p>
<p>So I opened a student Bible in front of him, lookup Trinity and found something like 150 references.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh? There's not a single reference to the trinity in the Bible. And yes, the trinity states there are three hypostases that are distinct and fully God. It's polytheism paying lipservice to monotheism.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, definitely the Trinity is not mentioned anywhere in the Bible. Definitely made up later from whole cloth.</p></div>		</li>
