			<div class="markdown"><p>Just making the panels bigger is a pretty simple and robust way to deal with the dust buildup if you have a finite amount of time it needs to work for. Any kind of panel-cleaning equipment would add complexity and weight. Simple and light are good things for spacecraft.</p>
<p>If you're getting at why they didn't add some kind of panel-cleaning mechanism so that the rovers would last longer than 90 days - well, that wasn't the mission. </p>
<p>There are always tradeoffs in engineering - time, cost, mass, durability, power and so on. You have all these different budgets to balance in order to meet the specifications and spending more on one thing means spending less on something else. For spacecraft mass is always a huge factor, because there is only so much stuff you can stick on top of a rocket and send across the solar system.</p>
<p>Adding a system to keep the panels clean would add mass and that mass would have to come from somewhere else - like removing some of the science capability. But lasting longer than 90 days wasn't the design brief, so why reduce the ability of your science robot to do science just so it lasts longer than it needs to last?</p>
<p>The mission was designed to last 90 days because they figured that would be long enough complete the primary mission, which was to look for evidence of past water on the surface of Mars. And it was: Opportunity landed on 25 January 2004 and evidence of water was <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040323a.html" target="_blank">confirmed from its observations by 23 March 2004</a>. Even if the dust hadn't been blown off and it shut down due to a lack of power after a few months it would have been a successful mission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like What? Assuming It involved a Fan, it would need it's own gas of some kind to blow off the dust, since the atmosphere is very thin, perhaps there simply wouldn't be enough atmosphere to operate without it.</p>
<p>Another possibility might be some kind of electrolysis or polarization effect to repel the dust from the panels, but then you have to think about what a field like that would do to the panels or rover even if you could manage it.</p>
<p>So I imagine logistical issues and a spartan budget would be the probable answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit some research on my part: </p>
<p>wipers apparently aren’t good for the Martian atmosphere, the rubber doesn’t hold well.</p>
<p>Second the super fine dust particles aren’t good for being wiped off by blades.</p>
<p>Since budget was tight, money was spent on doing just the bare minimum for the panels. The cheapest solution was simply a larger panel rather than cleaning</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking making the panel vibrate, like a cell phone to knock off all the dust.  It could also do the same thing with ultrasound.  It wouldn't require a lot of power and as long as they could tilt the panels, the dust would slide off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This discussion seems to have petered out, but what about some ultrasonic transducers stuck to the undersides of the panels? Relatively simple, solid-state, electrically powered, and able to vibrate the panels at different frequencies to shake the dust off. Shake shake shake it off (couldn't resist).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>any mechanism would add weight and therefore cost money. they did what they needed to do in those 90 days that they gave themselves, anything else they are getting is just a bonus so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not aware of them doing that, but they did take advantage of sloping terrain to tilt the panels towards the sun to maximise power during the Martian winters.</p></div>		</li>
