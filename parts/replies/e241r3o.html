			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, some of the people who survived had recognized this as a warning sign of a tsunami. Unfortunately, others saw it as an interesting opportunity to film or take pictures and stay put.</p>
<p>Now the question is, is it better to run away, or run to high ground if it's available? What about to a high level in a tall building? Not sure how far you'd need to be from shore to be safe </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's my question, surely at some distance away from the shore you would be safe. How far in do tsunamis go? Just in case someone lives in a flat area without being able to reach high ground. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Up you need to run up. A sturdy building is acceptable, but up a hill is the best. There is a National Geographic “witness to disaster” which is the best documentary I’ve seen on the japan tsunamis, it’s basically just a bunch of clips shot from news and people. There is video of people that ran very far inland but not up, they didn’t make it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often times the actual wave / wall of water is only a few feet high, right?</p>
<p>What if you took a jet-ski, or even a paddle board, and punched over that wall? Obviously the jet-ski would be easier to keep going away from land, but could you just float with the tsunami?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, any retreat that doesn't match the tide should be a cause for concern... the ocean is quite regular when there isn't a tsunami coming your way. And a tide takes about 6 hours from high to low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again it depends on what phase the wave is coming in at, but I think tsunami waves are on the order of minuets (or more) in wavelength so half that. Really if you ever see water retreat in any fashion, and we are talking meters of water here, you have to be thinking what’s behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The old seaman’s tale is to try to get out to deeper water to save your vessel. Certinatly the vessels that made it out of the harbor(s) during the japan tsunami were in far better shape than the ones that didn’t. I’d say if you already see the retreat of the water it’s probably too late. If you can react fast enough right after the earthquake (and on these big fishing trawlers that would mean your engines are already running) then it might be a good idea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can get to deep water, head to deep water, fast.  If you're in shallow water and can SEE it coming, you're probably screwed.  </p>
<p>In the 2011 Japan tsunami,  there were videos taken from shore in which you could clearly see the crests of 3 waves approaching.  While it hard to gauge scale and distance for a video, I would guess they were a few meters higher than the water surrounding them (while still in deep water).  A section of the one nearest, but still well off shore was a bit higher and was beginning to break.  These three waves were separated by several minutes, and as they can onshore, the water didn't recede between them. Each just piled more water on top of the previous one.</p>
<p>For some sense if scale, there was also a video a Japanese patrol vessel of some sort crossing one of the waves in deep water.  It was a significant wave relative to the boat, but posed no danger.   However those same waves in the shallow harbors tossed boats of any size around like toys.</p></div>		</li>
