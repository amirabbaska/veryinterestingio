			<div class="markdown"><p>It may well have if it happened early enough in it's history.  It would then reform rotating in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Like what is theorized for the Earth and Moon formation.  The Earth was basically completely liquefied when the impact that spun off the Moon hit the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can believe that. A planet's spin is there from its formation. It's almost inconceivable that an impact could not only stop the rotation but REVERSE it!?</p>
<p>Surely it's more likely that an impact simply flipped it on its axis? Therefore it retains its original direction of spin, but it's effectively upside down...</p></div>		</li>

<p>That takes exactly the same energy as reversing the spin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope - angular momentum is conserved, so any such impact would simply cause gyroscopic precession.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if the asteroid hit Venus in such a way that the axis of rotation was flipped i.e. the planet rotated 180 degrees about the solar plane, south to north and north to south. This would make venus rotate in the ‘opposite’ direction but would require much less energy than changing the spin direction via lateral impacts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please explain.</p>
<p>If the planet was spinning at 1m/day east to west, wouldn't it require less energy to spin it the other way than if it was spinning much faster? </p>
<p>If so, wouldn't it take a diff about of energy to change the spin direction depending on how fast it was spinning in the first place?</p>
<p>Does it take different amount of energy to rotate the planet on its vertical axis if it's spinning at different rates?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems crazy (in a cool way) that it's possible to hit it in a way that didn't break it apart, but reversed the spin. I'm imagining a baseball pitch, and shooting the ball mid-pitch in such a precise way that it just starts spinning the other way, but continues on a trajectory. </p></div>		</li>
