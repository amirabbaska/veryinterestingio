			<div class="markdown"><p>And it works by the same mechanism - the large amount of salt/sugar (and, in making jerky, also the drying) means that what water remains in the product is at a very high salt/sugar concentration. This means that if any living cells touch that product, their internal water is quickly pulled out via osmosis, which kills the cell. And that is why things like honey, if stored properly (mainly covered in a dry place, to prevent water from getting in, as it will also pull in water from the air), will never go bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the real answer to the question, IMO. Cake frosting, for example, isn't cooked, and is made from milk (or eggs in the case of royal icing), yet it won't go bad for quite a long time when left at room temperature. The reason is exactly what you said - the sugar acts as a preservative. </p></div>		</li>
