			<div class="markdown"><p>The simple tube counts don’t actually need to differentiate between cars, bikes, trucks, and buses. </p>
<p>When we need to know vehicle types, one way is to lay down two sets of two tubes that can differentiate gaps between axles versus gaps between two cars at a set speed. </p>
<p>The other way is by video counter at an intersection that can differentiate turning vehicles by type.</p>
<p>These data serve a different purpose - like when you need to design pavement life cycles on highways or address residential complaints about truck infiltration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two tubes at a set distance give you the speed and, knowing the speed, you can tell how far apart the front and back axles are. Trucks and such with more axles are identifiable through that as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do work with big data (phones, gps) but they’re expensive to buy and are blackbox data that only capture a sample of whats going on. With privacy constraints no one can access to the raw data from Google and Apple. Hence big data are less reliable in a local scope but good for city-scale analysis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggy-back off of u/Maxventurix's comment. My company has been doing a study on a major city highway and phone GPS data was used to create Origin-Destination maps to show what percentages of the highway's overall traffic originated from areas 1, 2, and 3 and what percentages exited to areas X, Y, and Z in the city during the AM Rush hour and the reverse for the PM Rush.</p></div>		</li>
