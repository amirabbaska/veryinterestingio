			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, the stomach will be fuller if you drink water, yes. And cold water will take longer to pass. But it's not that simple once you add food and hunger to the equation.
First, the food you are eating is likely warmer than your body, so when mixed with the cold water, both will countereffect each other.
And, more importantly, how much you want to eat doesn't only depend on how fast you fill up your stomach. It depends partly on how your body interprets what it is eating/drinking. It is a very complex process that involves taste; your brain; the fat, protein, and starch content of what you eat; the spiciness of the food, what foods are available, etc. It's very hard to predict whether drinking cold or hot water is going to make you eat more or less without actually studying in different conditions.</p>
<p>Edit: it turns out that it's not even clear that cold water takes longer to pass. Some studies show that cold water at 4C (close to ice temperature) can pass faster than water at 20C (at room temp).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I would like to note a psychological aspect of fullness.</p>
<p><a href="https://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/JACR/Small_Plates_Lose_Weight" target="_blank">Meta-study by Cornell on decreasing plate size to decrease</a> <del>plate size</del> <a href="https://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/JACR/Small_Plates_Lose_Weight" target="_blank">food intake.</a></p>
<p>(TL;DR: The research found two important factors that amplify the effectiveness of small plates in reducing consumption. The first is that smaller plates reduce consumption best if diners are self-serving their portions. That is, if diners invited to serve themselves are provided with smaller plates, they serve themselves less, and by extension, eat less.</p>
<p>The second factor is that the smaller plates work best if consumers are unaware that their consumption is being monitored. That is, modifying the plate size appears to have no effect on consumption if people realize that they are being watched. Â This helps explain why so many studies conducted in food laboratories have not found an effect of plate-size on consumption.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a minor difference in caloric expenditure when drinking cold water vs warm water? (eg assuming you drink a liter of water at 50 degrees, would it take your body about 48 Calories to get it to body temp, vs 80 degree water only 18 degrees? </p>
<p>(if not linear and 1 for 1,is there any relationship at all?) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other answers, a big part of the feeling of fullness is a hormonal response that's released by the GI tract once you've eaten. It takes like 30 minutes for that effect to set in, so sometimes just eating slower means you eat less in the end because you've given time for that to kick in. That's also why if you have a long gap between appetizers and entrees at a restaurant, you may feel too full to enjoy the entree like normal. </p>
<p>I don't believe water alone initiates that hormonal signaling well, but drinking water while eating definitely helps you eat slower, and in the end eat less over all. </p></div>		</li>

What about if one was exercising, if we drink it all in one go wont it sit in our body and make us feel bloated? Isn't it better to drink it intermittently?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't bloating primarily about gas? Afaik it's about avoiding to chug air down with the water which is of course easier if you do it slow and controlled which also gives room to let gas escape vs quick in one go glukglukgluk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly what I'm wondering. Chugging a few times during an intense hour or so routine seems to just fill my gut up and make level changes uneasy. If it's all the same to wait till the end, I'll happily avoid chugging fluids during and just make sure I've hydrated before I begin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The range given is 10-40 minutes, probably when the body is seriously in need of water, you'll see uptake time close to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>And these ranges are &quot;averages&quot; in &quot;average&quot; conditions, so it of course can vary. (So it can be 8 and a half minutes or maybe 56 minutes if you are already full.)</p></div>		</li>
