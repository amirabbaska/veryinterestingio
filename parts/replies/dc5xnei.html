			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been studies which show that the more educated a person is, the more they can compensate for Alzheimer's. Eventually everyone with that disease gets to a point where they can't compensate anymore, but the more educated you are the longer that will be. I'll look for a source.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This means that the less-educated are more likely to notice signs of Alzheimer’s and get help because more-educated people use additional brain pathways to compensate for their cognitive slide.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with crosslateralization of the brain. </p>
<p>I specialize in Psycholinguistics (psychology and linguistics) and learning a second language (including those who are already bilingual) actually lowers the chances of developing dementia and alzheimer's because of this neural connection development across hemispheres. It also doesn't need to just be language - anything new!</p>
<p>By using a part of your brain where you don't have set neural pathways (i.e. when you learn something new) you create greater neural structures that use more of both sides of your brain offsetting the damages which can occur from those two diseases (which are essentially neural deterioration).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To OP's point, education level does <a href="http://www.prb.org/Publications/Reports/2013/us-educational-attainment-mortality.aspx" target="_blank">affect life expectancy</a>, so in a way, yes, it could increase chance of developing a neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Above the age of 65, a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia doubles roughly every 5 years. It is estimated that dementia affects one in 14 people over 65 and one in six over 80.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there could also be some other factor connected with education that lowered it. Healthier lifestyle, less sunshine or who knows. Can't really make any conclusions just from the life expectancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be spurious. Higher education likely means better jobs, therefore healthcare (in the US) and better medical care. Outside of US, higher education probably means better area of the world and potentially better lifestyle choices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or higher level of education could imply greater weath and better access to hygiene, clean water, nutritious food, etc.</p>
<p>There would likely be stepped effects or diminishing returns on education: the difference between dropping out at grade 8 vs grade 12 might be more/less significant than the diff between MS and PhD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Point being you would have to demonstrate that it's either the longevity leading to the dementia or the education. Good money is probably on longevity. Not sure if there's actually a study done, though. In that case, education wouldn't be a direct cause.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Neurocognitive disorder – (mild or major) don’t affect or affect daily functioning. </p>
<p>Significant decline in at least one of cognitive functioning, such as memory and learning, attention, visual perception, planning and decision making, language ability, or social awareness; personality changes—may behave inappropriately—and their symptoms worsen</p>
<p><strong>Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer’s Disease</strong>- Individual displays the features of major or mild neurocognitive disorder. </p>
<p>.   Memory impairment is a prominent feature. </p>
<p>.   Genetic indications or family history of Alzheimer disease underscore diagnosis, but are not essential to diagnosis. </p>
