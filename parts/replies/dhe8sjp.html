<p>A &quot;bait car&quot; is indistinguishable from a regular car as far as any passer-by can determine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Career criminals are another matter.  I saw a video on Youtube not too long ago where some guy tried to jack a bait car, <strong>realized it was a bait car</strong> and remembered not to close the door, and drove far enough down the block to ditch it and the police staking it out.</p>
<p>Not to invalidate your point.  They would be as indistinguishable to me as to any other law-abiding citizen.  But prior offenders with experience with bait cars may be wise to them before or during the theft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just &quot;a bait car&quot; but indeed the very same bait car they'd used to catch him previously. (At least in the story I remember reading, googling crook same bait car twice there are several different cases of this.)</p>
<p>So it's not that there is some way to tell the bait cars are bait cars.</p>
<p>It's because this guy went and tried to steal the same bait car twice.</p></div>		</li>
