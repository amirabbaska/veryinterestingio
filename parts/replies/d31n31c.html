			<div class="markdown"><p>It does look like that, but it's actually clouds of dust in the galaxy.There are stars there, loads of them, but they're hidden by the dark streak of galactic dust. The stars that you can see are outside the dust - in front of it,  from our perspective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago people looked at that part of the sky and thought it looked milky, so they called it the milky way.  They didn't know what it really was, but the name stuck.  When we figured out that it was the edge of our own galaxy, we just kept the name and call it the Milky Way galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard it differently.</p>
<p>The Milky Way has its name today because of Greek Mythology. The ancient Greeks said that the milky appearance was because the stars were the milk from Hera's breast. Even &quot;galaxy&quot; is derived from the Greek <em>galax√≠as</em> , &quot;milky&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_galaxies#Naked-eye_galaxies" target="_blank">very few galaxies can be seen with the naked eye</a>, and the ones that can tend to look &quot;fuzzy&quot; and distinctly un-star like</p>
<p>with an extremely high-power telescope, there are definitely distant galaxies that appear star-like. however, to the naked eye, in binoculars, and with most consumer telescopes (even the really nice ones), if it looks like a star, it is a star.</p></div>		</li>
