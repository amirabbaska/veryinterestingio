			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually two types of pigment in the hair: eumelanin and pheomelanin. Eumelanin is responsible for black and brown hues while pheomelanin is responsible for red hair. The black eumelanin is slightly different from the brown eumelanin but the amount of them is what causes the different levels of brown or black, ie, a small amount of black is gray hair and a small amount of brown is blonde hair. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I learned in school is that pigmentless hair is white, small amounts of Pheomelanin and very little to moderate Eumelanin makes blond hair (of varying shades), large amounts of Pheomelanin and little to moderate Eumelanin makes red hair (of varying shades), large amounts of Eumelanin regardless of pheomelanin makes black hair and a moderate mix of both makes browns. When matching hair as a forensic science it irrelevant because you can see the colours and match the morphology regardless, but what's interesting is that you can also see the effects of dye/bleaching on the outer layer of the hair, but the pigmentation leaves traces that can let you figure out what the hair colour used to be, as well as looking at what it is dyed to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, definitely. Only thing is that if there is a lot of eumelanin, there is almost always going to be a lot of pheomelanin, but covered. That's why when bleaching hair, from the sun or chemicals, it turns red, red-orange, orange then yellow. Some people are luckier and have less warm undertone, but it's not at all likely to have dark hair from eumelanin without contributing pigment from pheomelanin. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The underlying color or undertone of dark hair when lightened is primarily warm tones all the way to blond so it's red then orange then yellow. </p>
<p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/63/a3/be/63a3be58c323e57bc01b95b8fecff2c0.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/63/a3/be/63a3be58c323e57bc01b95b8fecff2c0.jpg</a></p>
<p>That's why when lightening hair, you must go through the warm phases to get to blond from black or dark brown. Both black and brown will fade or lighten to warm. All hair has all the pigments, just in different amounts. </p>
<p>That's just how color works. It's not degradation as much as it's how pigment is removed and that when you start removing pigment from the hair, whether slowly from the sun or quickly with chemicals, the cool tones are the first to leave. Eumelanin covers up the contributing tones of pheomelanin but pheomelanin is harder to remove than eumelanin, so you are left with the red and red-orange contributing pigments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting to hear about hair analysis from a forensic scientist, given that much of forensic hair analysis has recently been debunked:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/FBI-Admits-Pseudoscientific-Hair-Analysis-Used-in-Hundreds-of-Cases-180955070/" target="_blank">&quot;Over the past few years, advanced understanding in the science of hair types has left hair analysis, as a forensic tool, in tatters.&quot;</a></p>
<p>I was wondering if you could elaborate a little on your experience with hair analysis training and what value hair analysis still has for forensics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hair is not used as individual evidence outside of the states, the science that was used before there (That was bad) was because they were trying to match hair samples with the idea that it'd be special for a individual person. This is bad science. The rest of the world doesn't use it that way, instead using it as a a class evidence.  So, basically you can't look at hair and say &quot;oh this belongs to Amanda&quot; like a finger print, but you can say &quot;this hair belongs to a person with curly hair, naturally black but dyed blonde, and had a hair cut within the last 6 weeks&quot; and you can use that to help eliminate options, or to add along with other evidence to make for a damning case. So, lets say we test do a toxicology test, and determine the person had constant cocaine use that stopped 2 months ago, and we do a mitochondrial DNA test (hair has mitochondrial DNA but no nucleus so no regular DNA), and determine the person's maternal line. So we can say, well the hair is from someone in Amanda's maternal line, and Amanda is the only one who dyes her hair blond, she started going to rehab two months ago, so it's probably Amanda's hair. The hair was found on a knife, with her fingerprints and the victims blood, so it's likely she stabbed him. Remember no one gets convicted on one piece of evidence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except in double blind studies most forensic &quot;scientists&quot; have been shown to be unable to tell the species of a hair sample. That's saying nothing as to their abilities to make accurate determinations as to who the hair belonged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've not seen these studies, but would love a link. And were the studies done while allowing the scientists references or were they expected to do the testing on memory alone? Now, hair is not used as identifying evidence to say, oh this hair belongs to Steve, but as a way to exclude people or to use in conjunction with other evidence. For example, you can do mitochondrial DNA testing on hair to determine a matrilineal line, and use it with that. I'm the only one in my matrilineal line with brown hair so that'd be pretty definitive evidence on me. Remember no one goes to prison on one piece of evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good overview of some of the issues <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScmJvmzDcG0#t=3m40" target="_blank">here.</a>  Watch for about two mins.  </p>
<p>Additionally, your statement that, &quot;Remember no one goes to prison on one piece of evidence.&quot; is really not accurate. I work in criminal defense and it happens quite frequently. DUI convictions, for example are often based on breathalyzers, which have significant accuracy issues and are based on a theory that doesn't hold up well.   </p>
<p>Additionally, the Supreme Court has empanelled a group of federal judges to look into the validity of forensic sciences and make recommendations as to the evidentiary validity of various methods going forward.</p>
