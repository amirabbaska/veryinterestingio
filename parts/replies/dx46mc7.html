			<div class="markdown"><p>I was expecting a strong fortified &quot;fuck it&quot; but &quot;fucky&quot; seems much more endearing. It's like the evolution of Fuck and it's phrases. An F grows and evolves from infancy to a Fucky where it exists only until it's ready to fly from the lips of frustrated individuals. At which point it sheds its &quot;y&quot; and wonders the innear ears of humanity as a grown Fuck waiting for it's final evolution into a FUCK or perhaps even a MOTHER FUCKER. </p>
<p>... I've been on a David Attenborough docu-binge, sorry. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And here, finally, we see inside the amazing world, of a bunch of Fucks. </p>
<p>The Motherfucker has toiled endlessly to provide for her one and only Fucky, and now she lays down, completely spent. She has no more fucks to give.</p>
<p>But all is not lost.</p>
<p>Her Fucky has sprouted it's wings, and can finally leave the nest. It is now, truly, a flying Fuck.  Magnificent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I'm getting a lot of answers that lead to oxygen not getting to the brain.  I'm looking for an answer to the last part.  Why can't we just live 'forever' (or seriously extended) by forcing oxygenated blood to the brain?   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Shock” is, by definition, when organs aren’t properly perfused (i.e. not enough blood is flowing to them for them to work properly). It’s certainly possible for blood not to have enough oxygen but as the issue isn’t with <em>perfusion,</em> it’s not classified as “shock.”</p></div>		</li>
