<p>&quot;Aether sits between hydrogen and Helium on the periodic table taking up positions # two and three in “atomic weight”. One is called dark energy and the other is called dark matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The word particle means inadvisable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gravity is based on this oscillation. The square root of 9.81 meters per second is PI.or 3.13 hertz. Gravity is the earth’s angular velocity due to rotation. In order to create anti-gravity or to cancel gravity you simply push out the magnetic field lines using plasma. This is called positive buoyancy. Just like in ships and hot air balloons. Hot air is a plasma. This is how UFO’s work.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just spent about 30 min on that article and the comments. I felt like a rubbernecker driving past an accident. Serious question, what's even going on there? Each paragraph had nothing to do with the last. Each sentence seemed to almost go somewhere then slice wildly. Truly fascinating.</p></div>		</li>
