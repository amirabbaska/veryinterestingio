			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh, it turns out someone <em>has</em> done that experiment - albeit not with crustaceans, but with the characteristic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvinella_pompejana" target="_blank">tube worms</a> that fringe the vents in enormous colonies! Though water temperature erupting out of the vents themselves can reach some 464°C, the water directly surrounding them is significantly cooler. We used to think the hydrothermal tube worms could live permanently in temperatures of 60°C or so - the highest for any animal - but it turns out we now know their proteins unravel and 'cook' at such temperatures, just like runny egg. They clearly can't survive in water that hot, so what is their limit? When do they start to cook?</p>
<p>To test it, scientists popped a bunch of these worms into pressurised tanks and brought them to a lab at the surface to undertake two heat tests. They first ramped up temperatures from 30 to 42°C, and then again from 50 to 55°C. The worms could tolerate the lower temperatures quite happily, with little to no apparent tissue damage nor heat stress. When hitting 50°C or more though, within about 10 minutes, the worms started to, well, sizzle. </p>
<p>It would appear then that the highest temperature these fellas can tolerate permanently is around about 45°C, occasionally being able to dart through patches of hotter water - just like how we can put our hand under a hot tap for a few moments, but have to move away after a while. Beyond 50°C they cook just like anything else.</p>
<p>I suspect the crustaceans will follow a similar pattern. There's superheated water around, sure, but they don't live anywhere near it - rather mooching about in the cooler waters nearby. As such, their proteins will denature and cook at similar temperatures as their shallow water counterparts.</p>
