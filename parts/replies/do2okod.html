<p>Smoke gets into the tube and absorbs the radiation, causing the alarm to go off. Steam can certainly do the same thing, but it may be less effective as the steam could absorb less radiation or condense before entering the tube. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, the radiation creates ions, which carry a small current that is measured. Smoke particles neutralise some ions and reduce the current. Steam is electrically neutral, therefore does not have this effect.</p>
<p>But only ionising detectors work this way, which have become rare, at least around here. Nowadays detectors which measure optical absorption are more common, and they have a harder time distinguishing smoke and steam.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The fire department threatened to fine us for too many false alarms. </p></div>		</li>

It doesn't really pose a health risk as it's not much radiation, but people freak out about radiation regardless. The thorium is sometimes replaced with yttrium. </p></div>		</li>
