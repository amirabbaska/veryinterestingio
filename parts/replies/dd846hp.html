			<div class="markdown"><p>I apologise for not knowing the exact answer but you're right that there is a trick to it. Remember the 80s/90s when stereograms were all the rage? Some people naturally managed to lose focus, some (like me) taught themself (the concept was described as trying to look at the reflection in a mirror, then let your eyes slip and look through it) and others could never do it despite trying. A bit like Spock's V hand gesture. </p>
<p>Once my IT teacher realised the Head couldn't see them, he made and printed out slightly rude stereograms about him for school noticeboards... Ostensibly to show what could be achieved by computer :) </p></div>		</li>
