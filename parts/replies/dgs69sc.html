<p>You can't go to jail for unpaid tickets, but you can lose your license. Also, they can suspend the registration if it goes past-due. If you're caught driving in California without a license, it's a mandatory 30-impound. Without registration, it's another ticket.</p>
<p>Certain type of illegal parking (handicapped parking without a permit, parking in a lane of traffic, blocking emergency services entrances/exits) can escalate to misdemeanors with expensive fines and even jail time. That's not a ticket, though. That's a cop towing your car and showing up at your house or arresting you when you go to the impound lot.</p></div>		</li>
