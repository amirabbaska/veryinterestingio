			<div class="markdown"><p>This question may ask for a lot of breadth on the subject but...</p>
<p>How does a birthmark, freckle, etc. stay with you for extended periods of time? Your skin is constantly regenerating and shedding itself... how do spots near the surface stick around? This question is pointed at adults who have &quot;stopped&quot; growing, but is more pertinent for infants. How does a spot &quot;in the middle of the upper arm&quot; continue to be in that location as the arm triples in size?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have multiple types of cells that comprise what we think of as &quot;skin&quot;.  The layer that sheds and regenerates are squamous cells, which begin to mature at the base, form keratin as they move from bottom to top as the nucleus shrinks and the cell dies.  Spending on location, this area may be very thick (soles of feet) or very thin (eyelid).</p>
<p>Melanocytes, which are a frequent component of dark skin (moles, melanomas, etc) are at the basal layer (the bottom) and don't move up (it disturbs us when they do because melanoma does that).  As such while your skin is in a constant state of regeneration, sloughing and death, your melanocytes don't replicate as often (thankfully) and don't go through the same cycling.  When they proliferate, whether via a benign nevus (what you'd commonly just call a mole) or melanoma, they tend to go down into the dermis.  In most of your common moles, it's a little nest of melanocytes down in the dermis, which doesn't mature up and shed.  Some of the congenital nevi can be quite deep.</p>
<p>The blood vessels of hemangiomas are even deeper and again, blood vessel cells (endothelium) certainly regenerates but doesn't migrate to the skin surface and slough off.  So it remains.  Or sometimes regresses.</p>
<p>Different types of cells also explain the different types of skin cancer.  The usually less offensive &quot;basal cell carcinoma&quot; is neoplastic growth of the basal layer of those regenerating squamous cells.  Squamous cell carcinomas are made of those migrating squamous cells and melanomas are proliferative melanocytes.  Angiosarcoma is malignant proliferation of blood vessel lining cells.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know whether this is too offtopic, but I just tried to google this and didn't really find the answers I was looking for: </p>
<p>How do freckles actually develop? I know (from Wikipedia) that it's pretty much just „melanocytes that overproduce melanin granules”, probably triggered by UV damage or whathaveyou, but could not find a description of how this development looks like. Say you have a patch of uniform looking skin and something triggers the formation of a freckle. How does this process look like? Is it just that a small part of the skin goes darker, say from „white” to red-brown over time, i.e. gradually, until it reaches a certain threshold? </p>
<p>I'm asking because I remember that as a child I once noticed that my forearm (the inside that usually doesn't get too much sun exposure) suddenly was full of tiny black speckles (like someone drew spots on you with a super fine black fineliner), and I tried to wash them off (I thought it was dirt). Of course they didn't come off, but after awile (I can't remember how long it took) they sort of „exploded” into what looked like freckles. Is that how freckles develop, or was that something else? I never experienced anything like that again (or didn't notice), and these spots are almost invisible now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the same way that scar tissue remains in the same place over time and through many generations of skin cells.</p>
<p>With your arm example, your upper arm is growing at both 'ends'. Imagine drawing a dot in the centre of one side of a deflated balloon. When you blow the balloon up, the dot starts in the centre because the whole balloon is growing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can look like bruises and CPS has been called on parents for this. If you have a baby with a Mongolian spot, it's a good idea to have their doctor photograph the spot so it's documented as a birthmark and not a bruise. I had one as a baby (my dad is part native and they're very common amongst people with native ancestry).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some Mongolian spots look similar to venous malformations. One is a condition of the pigment of the skin, and the latter is a malformation of the veins, so subcutaneous. Both appear light blue, but Mongolian spots typically appear on the butt, whereas venous malformations can appear anywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you talking about vitiligo? It's a condition where the pigment in your skin dies so the hair no longer produces colour as well. It's similar to albinism but in confined areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In vitiligo, you make antibodies to your own melanocytes and destroy them. In albinism, you are born with defects of genes that act <em>within</em> melanocytes, which disrupts melanin synthesis to varying degrees based on the type of albinism you have. </p>
<p>I think u/TheExter was probably asking about the white forelock of piebaldism, a condition where you are born with patches lacking melanocytes. As far as I understand, the difference between piebaldism and vitiligo is that piebald spots are more like birthmarks while vitiligo is a progressive autoimmune disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it's not piebaldism just because the hair is white in patches. </p>
<p>It's poliosis. It's only piebaldism if it causes a white forlock on the forehead. </p>
<p>It's poliosis if it's just a random patch of white hair with no underlying genetic condition. </p>
<p>Poliosis is just the decrease or absence of melanocytes in the fair follicles in a localized area usually around the eyes, eyebrows, or head hair. Many men have white patches on their beards. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just small white patches of hair is a result in the decrease or absence of melanocytes in the hair follicles. </p>
<p>It is called poliosis. </p>
<p>Piebaldism, Waardenburg syndrome, vitiligo, and any other genetic condition resulted in discolouration of the hair or skin is related but when it's just white patches alone it's poliosis. </p></div>		</li>
