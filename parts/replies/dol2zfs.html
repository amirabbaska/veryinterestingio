			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. Lots of technics in addition to just talking, but just talking is great in itself. Brain scans show verbal information almost immediate diminishes the power of negative emotions, improving well-being and enhancing decision making skills. Research by J Zweig. These scans show that by talking about things we move the thoughts from the emotional lambic system to the more rational prefrontal cortex.  Richard Davidson was one of the psychologist that studied this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wowzer. That is so reassuring to learn. I'm currently at the beginning of psychological therapy. It is mind blowing and MEGA difficult. Hopefully it will be like rehab &quot;the harder you find it the more it's working&quot;. Once again I had totally underestimated the power of therapy. </p></div>		</li>
