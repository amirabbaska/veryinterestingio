			<div class="markdown"><p>There are limits, but they are way larger than we can conceivably reproduce on Earth. A first approximation to the limit of the field strength could be calculated by pretending that all the electrons in the neutron star were moving around its equator at nearly the speed of light. This upper limit goes down as you require the electrons to spread out over the surface, or if you suppose the system rotates at more realistic speeds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>14 solar masses is the commonly accepted supernova break point for a star, but there are always weird exceptions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes can be charged and can rotate.  As i understand the electric field of a charged black hole can be felt from outside it.  Can a black hole have a magnetic field then?  I would think so, in which case there might be no limit to how strong a magnetic field it child have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Magnetars have their insane magnetic field because they are spinning insanely fast.  They got their spin from the initial spin of the star that formed them.  If you think about it, there must be a limit due to the fact that if the matter that formed the star were spinning fast enough then it would never have formed in the first place since most of the matter would be at exit velocity.  So clearly there is at least a limit even if it's a ridiculous limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does a magnetic field contain energy per volume in some sense? could we say that the absolute limit of the strength of a magnetic field is where the energy density becomes larger than the schwarzchild limit?</p></div>		</li>
