<p>my blood has my brother's DNA and the rest of my body (for example a cheek swab or my skin cells) have my own DNA</p>

<p>That would make a great plot twist for a detective movie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, there is basically no chance for me to have kids due to the chemotherapy, so if my potential partner ever finds herself pregnant and the kid passes blood test, I know who to blame!</p>
<p>Seriously though, I think my sperm still has my DNA, since it has nothing to do with my blood, so a theoretical paternity test (if done via a cheek swab on my part) would point to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I don't appreciate what I have in life enough. And it times like these where I run into people with a rough patch that puts me back in my place. I won't say I'm sorry that you have to go through with this, that would be lying. Honestly I don't know you, but as a human being to another human being. While you're fighting through this and are able to keep a clear mind, you are a tough sob. Stay strong. </p></div>		</li>
