			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taking A&amp;P and our prof used the example of when the arctic fox pokes its nose out of the grass next to the nesting Canadian snow goose the goose has to decide between a) try and fight the fox or b) flee and survive but lose the investment of her eggs. Instead of the limbic system being able to decide between the two monumental decisions it opts for option c) the goose puts her head under her wing and takes a nap. And the fox gets both the goose and the eggs. </p>
<p>Regarding op: the freeze option may be the brain's equivalent to a computer's hourglass/pinwheel while it tries to free up some processing power. The freeze option also could be considered when you've got house chores, a ton of homework, bills and errands all to get done by the afternoon and it's got you stressin- granted, probably it won't signal as large of a catecholamine dump as other stimuli- but suddenly a nap sounds better than anything. Classic path of least resistance/scumbag brain working against you.</p></div>		</li>
