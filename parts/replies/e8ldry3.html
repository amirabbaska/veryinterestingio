			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a wife swap episodes many years ago. One of the participating families lived on a farm and only ate fresh raw meat that they killed. Something about it &quot;being the way were supposed to be&quot;. Anyway, the swapped mother was appalled, refused to eat it and took the kids to the doctor. Doctor was very concerned, told them it's extremely risky, did some tests. I believe he found out all of them had a bunch of worms and were malnourished. </p>
<p>Also the mom from the raw meat family tried to force the other family to do so and the dad told her to fuck right off. </p>
<p>Man that show was pretty fucked up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What’s interesting about this topic is the evolution of humans and parasitic worms. Thousands of years ago it wasn’t about if but when you got worms. And since our immune system doesn’t deal with these anymore some theorize that some autoimmune disorders (Crohn’s, Lupus, etc.) could be treated with certain worms as to take the immune system off hurting itself and deal with them. Honestly it’s the most interesting thing I’ve come across in years of medicine IMO </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She was a Breathairian. They only need the magical energy from the sun and pure, unpolluted air, living out in nature away from cities. But... you know, sometimes they have to eat food when the environment is corrupted, especially when they have to travel into towns for speaking engagements, and when they are around other non-Breathairians who might see them eating food.</p>
<p>No joke. That was an explanation I have heard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a perfect answer, archaeologists have found evidence of simple bread-like foods dating back tens of thousands of years and evidence of cooking going back hundreds of thousands, and not just limited to homo sapiens, but homo erectus and homo neanderthalensis.</p>
<p>A lot of anthropologists now believe that cooking was as important for human development as standing up or the invention of hunting tools. Also the social event of cooking and eating as a tribe or as a family was a really important ritual for encouraging language development. </p>
<p>We have evolved to be coctivores, that is we eat mostly cooked food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also means more time to do the most important human activity: play.</p>
<p>Playtime is the time we do things like create symbolic representations of idea that can be passed along to the next generations via dance, song, pictures, or language. There's a great book by Robert Bellah that argues play was critical in humans developing religions which in turn allowed us larger and larger social units and refinement of our language and ideas.</p>
<p>Being able to cook food would have been pretty important in all this and it's interesting to note all religions have rituals around food and feasts. </p></div>		</li>
