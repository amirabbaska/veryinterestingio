			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the solar system tied with KOI-351 for the most planets then? With 8 (and with a dwarf planet (Pluto))?</p>
<p>Edit: There are other dwarf planets in the solar system, I just pointed out Pluto because it was considered a planet before (or still is for some scientific communities I have been told).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_10180" target="_blank">Wikipedia page for HD 10180</a> lists 7 planets as confirmed, but the exoplanet catalogs I mentioned all list only 6 as confirmed. I haven't been following the literature on this specific system, so I'm not sure where the discrepancy has come from.</p>
<p>KOI-351 is Kepler-90. 'KOI' means 'Kepler object of interest'. If something has a KOI number but not a Kepler number that means the planets in the system are all planet candidates which should undergo additional vetting. When the planets have been vetted the system gets an official Kepler number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strange because it is the databases which suggests it is confirmed.</p>
<p>edit* in fact the NASA database explicitly splits into confirmed and Kepler objects. Kepler-90s planets are all in the confirmed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our knowledge of planetary systems is still incomplete. With the Doppler / radial velocity method or the transit method (the two methods that find the most planets), it is easiest to find large planets close to their star. With the direct imaging method, you can most easily find very distant planets that are young (they are still hot, so they're relatively bright). Planets like Uranus and Neptune are really hard to find with current technologies. So, we can't really say yet if systems like ours are common or not. We also don't have many constraints on more distant planets (at several astronomical units from their star; Earth is at 1 au from the sun, Uranus is at 19 au, Neptune at 30 au) in the systems we know about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The smaller a planet is, the harder it is to detect. If we were to look at our own solar system from the kinds of distances we view other systems we might only be able to detect Jupiter and Saturn. We definitely would not be able to detect Mercury, Mars, and I don't think we'd be able to detect Venus and Earth either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the way we are view other systems, our system would appear to have 2 to 4 planets, putting it at the average I'd bet.</p></div>		</li>
