			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, remember that they were originally developed to power military &quot;centimetric&quot; radars in World War 2. They had no way of tightly controlling a frequency that high back in 1940, but neither did they care for a non-communications application. After the war, some clever guy (at GE? or was it Honeywell?) got the idea to use the surplus of magnetrons as a cooking device. Genius.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easily, no doubt!</p>
<p>1000W = 60dBm.</p>
<p>60dB of isolation from the microwave = 0dBm of output power leaking out of the microwave.</p>
<p>0dBM is actually a ton of power and would easily be picked up by an antenna.  Cell phones can receive signals as low as -100dBm (or lower!).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To bad you can't get a Licences frequency any more.  FCC sold all the good bands. The only way to get one now is to buy it off another Licence holder. There are other unlicensed that are not as flooded as the 2.4 that you can use but is in no way practical.  I have build a 900Mhz network before but I then had to buy expensive cards or adapters to attach anything to my network.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's plenty of licenced spectrum available such as 3.5, 6ghz, 11ghz, 24ghz, 38ghz, you just have to be oddly specific about where to use it...  one site/area at a time.</p>
<p>The fcc sold whole chunks of spectrum to the wireless providers on a large scale, so you're correct that there's no more large scale type licences available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3.5 and 11 are licence, but multiple people can have the licence, it is just used to keep those bands from flooding.  There was a push to open 11ghz but I don't think it went anywhere.</p></div>		</li>
