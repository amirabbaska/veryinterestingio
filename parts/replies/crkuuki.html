			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you. Also, helps the fact that many redditors are from temperate zones where most trees are coniferous that grow almost the same way and captures sunlight using similar methods.</p>
<p>Tropical forests have more diversity, so different species can grow more than others.
So, if 1 tree grows taller to get the advantage of being the tallest around, sometimes others can't grow to catch up to it because they are incapable to do it</p>
<p>You can see this happening in <a href="http://api.ning.com/files/p1hCpNEYWCJ2n2V7JmAjgBC3cYJABeArqsZ4x-vZ95qMY4x1L*0qwC6oDsrC2xsdYqy6doxbHhmDABYKMccMwry*SRbUBelH/mataatlantica.jpg" target="_blank">this tropical forest</a>, where palm trees can grow higher.</p></div>		</li>
