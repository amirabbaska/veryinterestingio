			<div class="markdown"><p>but it says they turn into graphite (in absence of oxygen) at 1900C, so it's not really diamond anymore.<br />
that is still above the usual temperature of lava though</p>
<p>Also, it doesn't say anything about sublimation. It says oxidation. aka burning</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually at room temperature and pressure, your diamonds will turn into graphite spontaneously. </p>
<p>....it's just that the reaction rate is ridiculously slow. But still, graphite is more favorable than diamonds by a little bit of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They burn at about 1400F (in the presence of oxygen), which is what it says in your link. Not sure where you got the 4000C figure from, or sublimation.</p>
<p>E: the phase diagram for carbon does show a graphite to vapor transition at about 4000K at 1 atm (from extrapolation). Diamond, of course, is only metastable at room temperature so it's not obvious to me whether the phase change would be at the same temperature as the graphite to vapor phase change.</p>

<p>Just because something is flammable doesn't mean it can't change states at a higher temperature than it's flame point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually really important because the diamond would probably sink depending on the lava. It might take some time to sink but once it sank it should be safe from burning.</p>
<p>But if you throw it onto a very viscous part it might burn so quick that it has no chance to sink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diamonds are routinely exposed to molten metal by jewelers who cast them in place.  Gold is cast around at tempratures 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  The cast in place technique is used mainly for small stones in mass produced pieces.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.riogrande.com/content/stone-in-place-casting-pdf" target="_blank">It is necessary to protect them from oxygen during the period when the mold is preheated</a>  I seem to recall reading that they would vaporize if a jeweler attempted to cast them into platinum, but platinum casting isn't commonly practiced.  </p>
<p>I recall a forum post somewhere where a jeweler named Hans Meevis tried to burn a cheap diamond with a jeweler's torch, I can't find it on google right now.  It was possible, but not easy.  Jewelers  have to protect stones from thermal shock during soldering, but vaporizing a stone is more of a theoretical danger than a practical one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is magma or lava hotter?
Bright red lava flows in Hawaii can get as hot as 1,165 F, with the glowing orange flows getting hotter than 1,600 F, according to USGS. And when rock is seriously melting, such as the magma within the Hawaiian volcano of Kilauea , it can reach 2,120 F, according to USGS.Jun 10, 2010</p></div>		</li>
