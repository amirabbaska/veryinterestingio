			<div class="markdown"><p>Experiment time!!</p>
<p>Get yourself a bottle of heavy whipping cream.  Most stores carry it.  </p>
<p>Pour some into a jar with a lid.   </p>
<p>Shake like a madman for minutes.  </p>
<p>You will notice it goes from liquid &gt; whipped cream &gt; sorta sloppy cream &gt; clumpy sludge &gt; butter and buttermilk.   </p>
<p>Taste the buttermilk that has separated.  </p>
<p>It’s very seeet and creamy. It taste like the bottom of a bowl of cereal.  </p>
<p>Taste the butter.  It’s butter.  It isn’t sweet at all. </p>
<p>Now add some salt and herbs to your butter and roll it all in </p>
<p>Put the butter in fridge to harden and enjoy herbed butter for supper on a nice steak   </p>
<p>You scienced today !! Sip some bourbon and make notes.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>and the percentage of lactose in buttermilk is higher than in cream</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So,is it the same for kefir and buttermilk,or is it less depending on how long kefir ferments?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kefir and cultured buttermilk (the kind you can buy in a store) have much lower concentrations of lactose than cream. The process of making these dairy products involves using bacteria to ferment the sugars (ie. lactose) in milk to form lactic acid, which is why they taste sour. Churned buttermilk, which is leftover from making butter, is quite different from the cultured stuff because the bacteria haven't had time to ferment the lactose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I make my own kefir. I got the starter OL,which is why I asked. I should have clarified that.</p>
<p>So,if I bought buttermilk, and left it sitting out I'd get the equivalent of kefir,or something different? </p></div>		</li>
