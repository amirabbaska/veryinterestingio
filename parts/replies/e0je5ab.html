			<div class="markdown"><p>Styrene plastic actually contains a lot of energy in weak bonds- it is great fuel to burn in high temp incinerators, one reason why Sweden buys our trash. When it is blown into styrofoam (not at all the only use for styrene) it is not economical to ship it to incinerators. </p>
<p>Luckily those high energy bonds break down easily in sunlight or exposure to ionic salts or ph fluctuations. So styrofoam breaks down in a few months in sunlight or ocean or landfill. Did you ever pick up a discarded styrofoam cup by the road and it looks oddly browned? Disintegrating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but yes. Plastics lower in quality when recycled and styrofoam is the bottom of the list. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be and in some places is but usually into other items, not back into the cup process. It's also very very light weight which means a large bag of Styrofoam cups would compress it's a very small block of solid plastic, so you get very little out of processing a lot. On top of that virgin material is cheap. </p>
