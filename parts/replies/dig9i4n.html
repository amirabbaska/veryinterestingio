			<div class="markdown"><p>I never though about it, but throwing objects (rocks, spears, etc) as a method of hunting does seem uniquely human. I know some primates use basic tools like sticks to get ants out of an ant hill, but do we know of any other animals that hurl objects to hunt?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some other apes throw stuff, but it's usually as a defense mechanism rather than hunting. And none can throw things anywhere even close to as accurately as a human can.</p>
<p>So if you're tired of hearing that animal X can do Y better than a human: that's our big physical talent. We can throw things <em>really</em> well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, we <strong>run</strong> better than most animals, too.  And we have that whole 'dealing with internal body heat&quot; thing down pat--very few other animals sweat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Throwing and running. It's kind of funny to think that we still set up these huge global celebrations every few years where everyone gets together to celebrate our best throwers and runners. We like to think we're past all that but it's still right there on the surface really. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>you're really discounting our ability to sweat. Its one of the biggest and best physical adaptions that is fairly unique to humans and part of the reason why we are such great hunters.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how flexible you are on 'object', Archer Fish hunt by shooting their their prey with spit (insects outside of the water) - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archerfish" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archerfish</a></p>
<p>It's not an external tool though if that's the criteria.</p>
<p>(Spitting cobra also came to mind as I was typing but I'm almost sure that's only done in self-defense)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, there exists a spider that hurls a thin string of spider silk with a sticky drop attached to its end towards insects flying by. It's not really comparable to throwing a rock; it's more like swinging a bola since one end of the string doesn't leave the spiders &quot;hand&quot;.  </p>
<p>Edit: They are called Bola Spiders and here is <a href="http://makeagif.com/gif/bola-spider-fAtJfH" target="_blank">a nice gif of one in action</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only counter I can think to this suggestion is what I learned in neuroscience. It is the speed at which our eyes <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" target="_blank">saccade</a>.</p>
<p>Saccades are one of the fastest movements produced by the human body (blinks may reach even higher peak velocities). The peak angular speed of the eye during a saccade reaches up to 900°/s in humans; in some monkeys, peak speed can reach 1000°/s.[citation needed] Saccades to an unexpected stimulus normally take about 200 milliseconds (ms) to initiate, and then last from about 20–200 ms, depending on their amplitude (20–30 ms is typical in language reading)   </p></div>		</li>
