			<div class="markdown"><p>In a vast majority of cases yes. Heat transfer increases with how molecule packing and density increases with molecule packing. In some metals electrons can also effect the heat transfer speed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you perhaps know of a minority case? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally yes. However, one exception is sapphire (also known as corundum). It is incredibly hard, almost as much as diamond, but has abysmal thermal conductivity. </p></div>		</li>

The material was used on the space shuttle because of the properties. Specifically that it is not dense at all, the outside cools so quickly it is safe to the touch in seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't graphite's basic structure layers of graphene (hexagonal bonded carbon) stacked on top of each other, with the stacks of graphene loosely bonded to each other?</p>
<p>It seems to me, this would have an inherently insulatory effect, like a blanket, trapping heat and slowing its transfer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really the right way to think about it on a molecular scale. Heat at that level is like a vibration. If you have several sheets on top of each other, shaking one sheet isnt going to affect the others as much. On the other hand, diamond is like a cage. If one part of the cage starts vibrating, the other parts will feel it too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That contributes to it. The insulation is due to spacing/the layers not being closely packed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The conductivity of graphite depends on the direction of the current flow in relation to the orientation of those layers.</p>
<p>It conducts along the individual grapheme layers, but not much between the different layers.</p></div>		</li>
