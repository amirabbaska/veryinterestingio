			<div class="markdown"><p>This concept is embedded in classic American literature also  (Emerson, Thoreau, Hemingway, Steinbeck, Kerouac, Melville).  </p>
<p>Also the whole &quot;go west young man&quot; echoed throughout the late 19th century (a quote, I believe, attributed to an editor at the NYTimes). </p>
<p>Safe to say that it is in our DNA. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, moving out of your parents' home early is not a uniquely American thing in any way.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/24/in-the-u-s-and-abroad-more-young-adults-are-living-with-their-parents/" target="_blank">according to Pew research</a> around 32% of American 18-34 year olds live with their parents. In Denmark, however, this number is only 19%, and <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/familiesandhouseholds/2016#percentages-of-young-adults-living-with-their-parents-have-been-growing" target="_blank">in the UK it's 25%</a>.</p>
<p>If you look at the Pew article you can see that this percentage is pretty low across all of northern Europe. However, it's much higher in southern and eastern Europe, as well as the Baltic states, with Macedonia clocking in 73%. Areas that share similar cultures have similar rates of young adults living with parents.</p>
<p>For example, in Australia - which has strong cultural ties to northern Europe - the figure is 29%.</p>
<p>So is it 'Rugged Individualism'? Perhaps, but it seems that it's likely this is only in the sense that the US understandably owes a lot of its culture and attitudes to settlers from northern Europe.</p></div>		</li>
