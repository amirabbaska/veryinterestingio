			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question, is there a difference  in the interstellar vs intergalactic medium as far as diatomic or single proton? It makes sense that the cold regions where stars form are molecular H2 but I have no idea what the dominant type of hydrogen would be in intergalactic space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So most galaxies live in clusters, and the gas that surrounds them within the cluser is mostly hot, low density, ionized hydrogen. This might be due to stuff getting churned up by gravitaitonal interactions between the galaxies, supernovae within the galaxies, or especially supermassive black holes ejecting hot material into the intracluster medium. This is a big topic of research right now because people are trying to figure out why star formation is so slow and inefficient. One thought is that supermassice black holes can churn things up so that it takes a longer time for material to collapse down into the colder, denser states. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Stars form in the coldest, densest regions, but as soon as they turn on they start heating their surroundings and will blow away the molecular cloud they formed from. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds as though it answers OP's question with <em>&quot;yes, areas near stars have lower density&quot;</em> - but others in this thread say the opposite. </p></div>		</li>
