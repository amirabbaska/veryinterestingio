			<div class="markdown"><p>What I still don't understand is why the cost is so astronomically high in the US as compared to Europe. Here's my experience outside of the US: I arrived in the Czech Republic with a broken bone (long story...), which was deemed a pre-existing condition by my private Czech insurance (don't qualify for free state health coverage as a foreigner), meaning I would have to pay full price for any treatment. </p>
<p>In the US, I'd seen several doctors, paying $50 co-pay per visit, $150 for the initial ER visit, and almost $300 for an out-of-state specialist visit and x-rays while in-transit. Those were all just my co-pays with my insurance paying much more.</p>
<p>In CR, I paid  $40 for an initial specialist consultation, then $45 each time I visited the hospital for x-rays + specialist visit. Each visit to the hospital, I went in and met a nurse who took my ID, found my chart, gave me paperwork and sent me to an x-ray tech. Then I went to get x-rays, always done by 2-3 people. Then I went to see the orthopedic specialist and his nurse, sometimes accompanied by another orthopedist. Then, I'd go to the billing department for foreigners, speak to someone in English, and pay. The first few times I visited, I also had a hospital staff member take me around in a wheelchair. The total bill for each visit was always the same, roughly $45 with the exchange rate at the time. This was with NO insurance whatsoever and was still less than my insurance co-pay in the US.</p>
<p>How can the bill be so drastically small compared to the bills for the same thing in the US? I could understand some difference based on differing wages and costs, etc, but this is dramatic - like add a couple zeros for the US version of the bill. There's definitely more going on than just the various people involved in treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an outstanding answer. Others have given good answers about about hospitals eating the costs of the uninsured (very true), but the operating costs of a hospital are tremendous. They don't just pay doctors, but all of the other security, janitors, assistants, administrative staff, etc. that support those doctors. Those people, effectively, generate &quot;no&quot; revenue since they don't provide direct services to clients. Therefore, the markup for their salaries, benefits, and the overhead of keeping them as employees has to be factored into the costs of goods and services. </p>
<p>This is important for any employee to understand: take your salary and add at least 25% to it. That number is, at the very least, what it costs the company to employ you. They have to pay for your tools and equipment, training, workman's compensation insurance, managing you, doing your payroll, etc.  Hospitals, like all business, have to find that money somewhere. Like all business, they find it in mark-ups on goods and services. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every other business has these overheads as well though. Every business has janitors, secretaries, and others that add no revenue. These other companies don't have 1000% markup on products and services like hospitals. It's just that hospitals have no real market competition to keep prices low. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a non-partner lawyer in a biggish law firm, I am notionally charged out to clients at roughly 10x my hourly pay rate.</p>
<p>Yes the bigger clients get discounted rates, and not every hour gets billed, and there are lots of other costs in the firm.  But I can totally see where hospital admin costs add up.  Even in the US most hospitals aren't profit-making entities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you understand what goes into medical care?</p>
<p>If you hang a bag of morphine, or saline, or what have you, and only a quarter of it gets used, then the whole bag is still considered gone. It can't be given to anyone else. </p>
<p>If you drop something on the floor, it's gone. </p>
<p>Linens get changed at about the same rate as a hotel, or higher if you luck up and get an incontinent or bleeding patient. </p>
<p>Patients are tended by an average of 10 medical professionals per hospital stay. So, ten hourly rate salaries. </p>
<p>Add this to a giant threat of malpractice. Healthcare is now at least 70% paperwork; documenting every single interaction with a patient just to keep from potentially being sued. </p>
<p>Hotels don't operate under that shadow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude.... A chest CT in freaking Switzerland (<em>super-duper</em> high cost of life, 4,000$/month salary for a janitor) costs about 400$, the US average actually paid is 600$. With some hospitals asking as much as 5,000$. So no, the costs are high but by far not that high.</p></div>		</li>

<p>most of the time the hospital isn't paying the doctor. that bill is probably the facility fee, and there will be a separate professional fee sent by the doctor or her/his group/company</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that this doesn't explain the situation at all. </p>
<p>I am a veterinarian. If a dog comes into my office the owner sees my receptionist and has to be registered into the computer. They are then seen by my exam room technician who gets the history and vitals. Next they are seen by me. I have to sedate the dog in most cases (which is an extra drug humans do not need). I have to block the incision with a local anesthetic just like a human doctor. I clip and clean the wound with antiseptic scrub. I suture with the same brand suture. My surgical tech helps me with my procedure. A give a second injection to reverse my sedation and send the pet home with antibiotics and pain meds as they are checked out by my receptionist. There were, at minimum, 4 people involved in a simple stitch job. I have operating costs just like a hospital. My bill? Probably around $180 bucks and I'm not the cheapest in town.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also risk to deal with.</p>
<p>Dogs are not humans. Their worth is considerably less. Thus, there's a lot less bureaucracy, checks, standards and routine around treating them. In a hospital there's more regulation, and that equals more overheads. Doctors are more expensive.</p>
<p>Also, hospitals are much larger businesses, larger businesses tend to have more process &amp; overheads and are generally less agile than smaller ones.</p>
<p>Also, malpractice lawsuits, insurance... If a dog dies under anesthetic I doubt there's as much fuss as a person dying.</p>
<p>Lower risk = lower costs.</p>
<p>But yeah, it doesn't explain why the prices are <em>that</em> inflated. There's plenty of other reasons (insurance haggling etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I know one thing that explains the difference between a vet and a doctor, in terms of pricing. A vet lists his prices, and unless he wants to make an exception for a poor family who takes in strays, the prices are the same for everyone.</p>
<p>But hospitals -- they have a different set of prices, for every procedure and product they provide, for every insurance PLAN. Not every insurance company, but every plan.</p>
<p>This pricing structure comes about after negotiations that involve well-paid doctors and lawyers.</p>
<p>And then the pricing structure is so complicated that billing is a nightmare. I've read that 20 percent of the US healthcare dollar goes to billing companies. It's a specialty skill just to sort out who pays how much! And they're not even that good at it!</p>
<p>So, what if it were against the law for insurers to make deals with providers? The providers just name their prices, and then everyone shops around. (In small markets with only one or two providers, there would have to be oversight to prevent gouging.) But then, the hospital could save the 20% it usually pays to a billing company, and spend maybe 5%, tops, on a few clerks and some off-the-shelf software.</p>
<p>That would make a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good luck.  The vet's insurance won't cover it when you sue them into the ground because you sucked at keeping your sutures clean, and if it came to light that they were providing services to people they'd probably lose their license to treat animals.  Treating you would be a huge risk for the vet.</p></div>		</li>
