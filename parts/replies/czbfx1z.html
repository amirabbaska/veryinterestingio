			<div class="markdown"><p>Now let's look at the effect that the recession had on wages. There's two things going on here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Having lots of unemployed people drags down wages, because there's always someone willing to do it cheaper. But that's not the main thing going on here, because (if you look at other numbers) lots of the not-employed aren't out there looking, they've given up. No, the bigger deal is:</p>
</li>
<li>Almost everybody who graduated from college since 2008 has had to start their career in menial jobs rather than professional jobs, and every raise they ever get in their life will be lower because of that.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's what the actual numbers look like: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ps6iRu9.jpg" target="_blank">Real Median Household Income in the US, 2007-2014</a>. The median household is the one where half the people make more and half the people make less, so solidly middle class. Before the recession, that household brought in $57 thousand and change a year; the last available year, it was $53 thousand and change, a $4 thousand a year, or $300 a month, pay cut.</p>
<p>This is what <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I2WNYJW" target="_blank">Thomas Picketty's last book</a> was about: showing that for most of the history of capitalism, &quot;the market&quot; (shareholders) makes money whether or not &quot;the economy&quot; (wage earners) does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't disagree with you on #2 except that I don't believe the recession has had anything to do with wages.</p>
<p>Yes, more unemployed people equal lower wages, but if people aren't looking for work and have given up then that should result in an inflationary pressure on wages. It certainly isn't going to drive them down.</p>
<p>Downward wages have been a trend for more than a decade. In fact, the Clinton era was the last time we saw wages increase significantly. </p>
<p>Businesses are still profitable and some are wildly profitable. However, it's no longer taboo for corporations to give those profits to their shareholders while demanding more and more concessions from employees. </p>
<p>There is a simple metric to understand an economy. In the most simple terms an economy requires the transfer of goods and services from one person to another. The more that happens the better the economy is. </p>
<p>However, our economy is squeezing the majority of working US citizens into lower wages. Less money in their hands means less money in the economy. </p>
<p>Having a few very wealthy people does not help the economy. Sure they can build factories and invest but they won't do those things if no one has money to buy their goods and services. </p>
<p>As the rich continue to take a bigger slice of the pie, the economy will continue to suffer. </p>
<p>Already, governments around the world are taking steps to control their populations and ensure their continued power over their citizens by offering a basic income for everyone. </p>
<p>As more and more people become dependent on that basic income they also have a greater investment in a governmental system which controls them and privileges the wealthy. </p>
<p>If you want to see what happens when a government suddenly cannot continue to offer benefits to its citizens then just look at Greece. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but during the recession, potential raises went down to about 2%(if you got them at all- as you said, many people got their pay cut)- that set a precedent for particularly cheap employers to keep that same raise scheme, meaning that workers have absolutely no protection from inflation.  This is part of why you need to switch jobs to get ahead in the market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you don't say is that even before the collapse of 2008, with a massive bubble in housing, with a huge credit-liquidity bubble, we didn't have wage inflation.  </p>
<p>In other words, I was at the party doing all the drugs &amp; alcohol I could and I still wasn't high.  There's a problem with that...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, five down from the top... you deserve fifteen hundred upvotes, but oh well.  Better luck next time.  But it would be a better comment if you emphasized weak wage growth as better evidence of anemic demand for labor.  The official unemployment rate is a better measured than the employment to population ratio because the latter has seen a secular increase over time.  Things like more poor people going to college, more middle class people going to grad school, and more retirees being able to stop working at 65 or even earlier all affect the emp:pop ratio.  The argument that we need more demand to see a real recovery is strong, but the argument that there is a better measure <em>of unemployment</em> than the unemployment rate is weak.  The emp:pop ratio, if the pre-2008 trend holds steady, will never get back to the level of 2008 (and it wouldn't be a good thing if it did).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I know. But the &quot;official&quot; unemployment rate (E3) and the &quot;broader&quot; unemployment rate are, in ELI5 terms, attempts to decide which people who don't have jobs &quot;count&quot; because they &quot;should&quot; be employed, and that's such a complex and political value judgment as to be politically worthless.</p>
<p>So here's how I approach it. We know that in 2000 we had a level of unemployment  that &quot;feels good&quot; to people without producing a wage-price spiral, without producing runaway inflation. We know that people want to think of that time as normal. So I tend to treat an EMRATIO of 65% as &quot;full employment.&quot; And that's my justification for calling the 5% of all Americans aged 18 to 65 unemployed whether they're reflected in the U3 or the U6 or not at all.</p>
<p>But where the &quot;broader unemployment rate&quot; succeeds and the &quot;civilian employment population ratio&quot; falls down, I admit, is that the EMRATIO counts people as &quot;employed&quot; even if they're part time or even if they're PhDs working as WalMart greeters. Right now the U6 is sitting at 9.9%. But, again, let's look back at that year 2000 baseline, which is what people think of as &quot;a good economy&quot; -- it was 6.8%. So subtract the two, and you get ... 3.3% of the US population, age 18 to 64, who are trying to support themselves and/or a family, and either can't find a job or at least can't get enough hours.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> No matter which measure you use, we're somewhere between 3% and 5% of the population who would have jobs if we were at full employment and now they don't. 1 out of every 20 or 30 people. So (by Dunbar's number) the average person knows about a half dozen of them. And that, combined with the fact that the rest of their friends who do have jobs are making about $4k less than they &quot;should&quot; be, is why wage earners (and want-to-be wage earners) are unhappy no matter <em>how</em> happy lenders and shareholders are right now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's politically meaningful because it <em>should</em> be the right standards to use for macroeconomic questions about how many more jobs the economy can create without accelerating inflation.</p>
<p>My reply also originally had a whole addendum about discouraged workers, part-time workers, mismatched workers, hysteresis, and the difference between the long-term damage from the recession and the possibility of recovering from the recession ... I'm sure you can guess what the content of that would be, with the upshot that if &quot;underemployed&quot; people <em>are</em> hidden throughout the employment data, they aren't the reason why the economy would &quot;feel like it's in a recession&quot;.  That would be a new normal of permanently lost GDP, which wouldn't prevent us from getting to a boom where that PhD Walmart greeter finally gets a raise (one not offered philanthropically by the Waltons, I mean).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thing is, we can't expect there to be as many jobs as there are people, not even as many jobs as there are people capable of working.</p>
<p>There's no reason why those two numbers should be the same.</p>
<p>We're in the age of automation, we need an economic system that will deal with this fact.</p></div>		</li>
