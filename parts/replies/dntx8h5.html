			<div class="markdown"><p>How is the atmospheric pressure from above, pushing up on the bottom of your feet? </p>
<p>I can't wrap my head around it. I can picture air pressure in a balloon or inner tube, pressing on all surfaces equally. But I can't understand how weight from above you, can press up on the bottom of your feet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that the earth is inside of a giant balloon. It's right smack dap in the center with all its atmosphere around it with an invisible force (gravity) as the latex around it all.  You are inside this balloon standing on a marble getting pressed on on all sides. Much like if you were completely submerged in water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can picture that. Thanks.
Is this an accurate picture....if my feet are dangling 1 foot into a pool of water. The water above my feet is pushing down on the water below my feet. In response, the water below my feet is pressing back up against the water pushing down on it?</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you put your finger down in a glass of water, the surface level rises, right. So you're pushing down, yet your force is also pushing the water upwards. </p>
<p>Same thing all over in the atmosphere, the pillar of air above is pushing down, but if there wasn't forces all over countering that pressure, that pillar of air would fall down to even out the pressure differences!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To offer another explanation:</p>
<p>Think about what individual air molecules are doing. At any given moment, air molecules are hitting you from all directions and bouncing off. Each collision exerts a little bit of force on you, and added together across all of the molecules, the total force per area is what we call atmospheric pressure. There's no reason to expect that air molecules should hit you from any particular direction; they're just flying around randomly bouncing off of solid surfaces and each other, so the pressure on any side of you should be the same, because its getting hit by air molecules just as often from every side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same is true with containers of liquid. If you pour water into a bowl, the air pushes down on the surface of the water, which then in turn pushes outwards in all directions against the container (in this case a bowl).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's an explanation of how people's body's maintain shape. Our internal organs are pressing out, atmosphere is pressing in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes, but also touches on how pressure is exerted in all directions - sideways, downwards, and upwards. </p></div>		</li>
