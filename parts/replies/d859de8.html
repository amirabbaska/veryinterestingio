			<p>It is not refractive index which creates a rainbow, but dispersion - the change of refractive index with wavelength. <br><br>If the refractive index of a material for all wavelengths was the same (zero dispersion), all light would follow the same path through it, and would not split into colours.<br><br>It is specifically the fact that water refracts blue light more than it refracts red light that splits the &quot;white light&quot; up into its constituent colours.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, the degree to which the light is refracted depends on the energy of the light. Blue has the most energy, red has the least.</p>		</li>
