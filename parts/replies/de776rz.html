<p>Can you help me understand which assumption about rational numbers this contradicts, and why?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when you express a number as a fraction, you can do so in many ways.</p>
<p>for example, the number 0.2 can be described by the fraction 1/5, but also by 2/10, 3/15, 100/500, and 10000/50000, etc.</p>
<p>the way you &quot;pick&quot; the fraction 1/5 from the rest, is by saying &quot;hey, lets look only at the way of writing it as a/b where a and b don't have factors in common&quot;.</p>
<p>so 2/10 is basically (2 <em> 1)/(2 </em> 5) and 3/15 is (3 <em> 1)/(3 </em> 5), etc. <em>all</em> of the fractions that describe 0.2 have factors in common, except for the &quot;smallest&quot;, namely 1/5.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, all fractions have this property. you can write it in an infinite number of ways a/b, but only one of those ways has no factors in common between a and b.</p>
<p>So we start out by saying, &quot;okey, lets say sqrt(2) is a fraction a/b, and of all the infinite ways of writing this fraction, lets pick out the single one that does not have factors in common between a and b.&quot;</p>
<p>Then we do the rest of the thing, and we find out that a=2c and b=2d. so even though we started by assuming a and b have no factors in common, we just figured out that they do have them in common. Thus we get a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that Sqrt(2) is rational, was wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right but then he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously we could keep repeating this. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>rather than &quot;oh look, there's a common factor which contradicts our axioms&quot; so its a bit confusing. I agree with your explanation though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if the other explanations helped you yet, but the crux of it is that the end of the proof isn't really complete (or explained perfectly). When you initially write sqrt(2) = a/b, it should be stated that a/b is the &quot;simplest form,&quot; or that a and b are integers with no common factors and the fraction cannot be reduced any further. </p>
<p>But remember, you are ASSUMING sqrt(2) can be written this way. In the event you come to a contradiction with this assumption you can conclude the assumption was wrong.</p>
<p>At the end of the proof, OP shows that with this assumption you can prove that a and b share the common factor of &quot;2.&quot; This is a contradiction since a/b is the simplest form which by definition means they cannot have any common factors. With this contradiction you conclude your original assumption was incorrect and sqrt(2) cannot be written as a/b where a and b are integers. This means that sqrt(2) is irrational by definition.</p>
<p>(Sorry so wordy. Assumed you had never taken proof based math)</p></div>		</li>
