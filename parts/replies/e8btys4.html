			<div class="markdown"><p>Compressions are the most important and I think people (not medical professionals) are more likely to perform CPR if it doesn’t involve mouth to mouth and swapping bodily fluids. </p>
<p>I honestly don’t know for sure if that’s the specific reason but- I’ve heard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct. There'll typically be sufficient oxygen in the blood from BEFORE the person arrested so providing quality compression to circulate that is better than trying to get breaths in every cycle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even medical professionals are not required to provide mouth to mouth because it goes against universal precaution guidelines and the situations most medical professionals would be in that would require it (i.e. not a hospital) would cover them under good samaritan laws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The instructor at my class said adults who become unconscious are more likely having a cardiac event where compressions are vastly more important to survival. </p>
<p><em>Children</em>, however, are more likely to become unconscious due to a respiratory event, so he said it was more crucial to give breaths to children during CPR. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just learned the 30:2 technique for adults, and 15:2 for children and infants. That being for every 30 or 15 compressions, give two breaths. But the instructor did say a survey was recently conducted where some place in Europe determined that nobody wanted to give a stranger mouth to mouth “unless they were attractive”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly correct! The majority of pediatric arrests are from respiratory causes. Still, good compressions are very important for them as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here. Chest compressions force air in and out of the lungs almost as effectively as mouth to mouth. Also in cardiac arrest in a large number of people the esophageal sphincter at the top of the stomach relaxes meaning that what ever they have eaten recently will be pushed out of their stomach by decent chestcompression.  Not something you would like to taste.</p></div>		</li>
