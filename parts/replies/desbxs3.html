			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's digital, it will most likely already be shot at 23.976.</p>
<p>If it's film (true 24), it will be converted to 23.976 by a third party/network, with cadence issues (frame blending and artifacts) being dealt with during a QC process. Most likely a frame will be pulled out here and there automatically, then moved if it causes a jump.</p>
<p>If any conversion is needed for broadcast, it will happen at the network level. They will need to reformat for time and commercial, as well as other things. Not reason to convert beforehand</p>
<p>For a DVD/Blu Ray release, the manufacturing studio will handle the conversion as well. Always best to work with the native raw video when mastering.</p>
<p>However, you are thinking correctly when it comes to PAL (Europe+), 25fps. This is converted as 'a frame is a frame,' meaning, the first second consists of 24 single frames plus the first frame of the next second. The result is slightly sped up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, that's what was my main concern. 24 to 23.976 is just asking for trouble.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I wonder if this is the primary cause of some wide panoramic scanning shots of some landscape appearing &quot;jittery&quot;. The camera pans from left to right, and you can clearly see that the motion isn't smooth. I never notice it in regular scenes (dialogues, action scenes, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They just slow it down. Nobody will notice.</p>
<p>In PAL regions where they use a 25fps TV standard they usually just speed it up a little. This does give noticeable differences. Some peope say they notice the music is at a slightly different pitch. And a 1 hour 40 minute movie well be 1 hour 36 on the PAL release.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trained as a musician as a kid, and I'm actually quite pissed at distributors for this. Thankfully, it seems to begin to disappear, but in the DVD era, most American movies (US to Russian) had their music and voices half a tone off. It's very bad for music, the composer chooses the key because of its (slight but existing) emotional coloring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a little detail; the tune has no effect on us... So that half note drift does nothing emotionally. We can have our entire scale be from tuned several notes off without any apparent emotional or physiological changes. You basically have to start hitting half an octave.. When playing and composing, this is different as we can compare notes with each other. Even with perfect pitch, the effect is still the same (unless you are injecting this thought since you KNOW what tune it is...)</p>
<p>Placebo is a hell of a drug.. And seriously, i think pretty much all musicians have run into this same idea. I certainly have. It takes several transposition mistakes (forgetting to reset your synth..) to realize we have no idea what key is &quot;sad&quot;.. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, 24 to 25 fps is considerable difference, yes. You and /u/AyeBraine have an interesting discussion below along the lines of what I wanted to respond with (before I saw your comments, that is). I agree that base frequency tuning doesn't really affect the perception of music, but you'd definitely notice it if you're already familiar with the music piece that is playing. It's 1/17 of an octave! And same with bpm - 140 to 146 bpm (24 to 25 fps) is <em>very</em> noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding that discussion, I'd still say tune / key influence on music perception, and its extent, is an open question until proven otherwise. BTW, where does the 1/17th come from? There are 12 halftones in the octave, and I'm almost sure the recoding speedup is around a halftone (to my ear). And yes, BPM is almost ridiculously obvious, in oldtime music there were separate names for playing tempos, and they were most definitely granular to at least +/- 10 BPM, with optional modifiers! Hell, basically the most fundamental trait of disco and its vibes is that it's 110, not 120!</p>
<p>Oh, and we discussed it with another, commissioned squid, with the rank of Captain! haha!</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, there were much worse sins committed in the early digital film encoding. Like those horrible &quot;slower-faster&quot; microstutters when someone did the pulldown (or deinterlacing or whatever that was) wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is 0.1%. Over a three hour movie it's <em>eleven seconds</em> of time. If the soundtrack pitch is changed by the same amount that's 2 cents, which is similar to instrument tuning error. Consider that for PAL viewers, showing the 24 fps film at 25 fps for TV, a speed increase of 4%, has generally been considered acceptable (although complained more about for the audio, which is sometimes separately pitch-corrected).</p>
<p>It's nothing. The 3:2 pulldown to convert ~24 fps video to ~30fps TV is rather more noticeable in terms of impacting the quality.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, for 24 to 23.976, I'm absolutely in support of just playing it slower instead of doing a messy interpolation.</p>
<p>For 24 to 25, it's noticeable in the audio (not so much in pitch as in speed of music, mostly), and 24 to 30 should be pretty terrible, I imagine.</p></div>		</li>
