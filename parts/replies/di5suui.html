If the wall is more massive then the person, or the person in the car, then should the more massive object have more force when it hits?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all comes down to how quickly and how much your velocity changes. However you do it, if your rate and magnitude of velocity change is equal, the effects are equal. If you impose constraints so that you have different delta v, you have different effects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the change of velocity depends on the mass. The moving object with more mass has more energy to transfer than the other object. </p>
<p>Driving into a massive wall with good foundation causes way more damage than this wall hitting a car. Consider that the car is unfixed and a wall fixed on the ground. A modern, robust car without activated breaks or gear would be less damaged than it driven against a wall, because it simply moves backwards or the crash has energy wasted into the backward movement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>instantly decelerates you to 0mph</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it actually did that, the effect would be none. Real trouble starts when it only decelerates part of you, while the rest of you keeps moving at 100mph towards it.</p></div>		</li>
