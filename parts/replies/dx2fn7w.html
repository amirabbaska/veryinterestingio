			<div class="markdown"><p>But you avoid hepatic and gastric first pass metabolism. A quick look at <a href="http://gut.bmj.com/content/43/5/612" target="_blank">this study</a> seems to say that the peak blood alcohol is about 45% more in women and 33% in men when alcohol is given intravenously compared to oral administration. Assuming no alcohol dehydrogenase is present in the lungs that's only 50-70 breaths. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that liver damage is from chronic not acute alcohol consumption as acetylaldehydes, the intermediate metabolite, cause oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver (and most of your hangover). I don't think the enzyme that degrades acetylaldehyde is expressed in the stomach so the liver is still doing the same amount of work. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edite: adsorption -&gt; absorbtion.
Thank you, ProfessorElm.</p></div>		</li>
