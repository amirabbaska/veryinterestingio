			<div class="markdown"><p>Dim Sum places usually serve something like a &quot;Beef Stick&quot;, a piece of steak threaded on a skewer and stuck in the deep fryer. It's frequently overdone which gives it the texture of shoe sole leather, but it's more proof that humans will deep-fry anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Millard reaction has nothing to do with airflow I believe. It's the caramelization of carbohydrates in the food created by high heat cooking combined with the &quot;caramelization&quot; of proteins in the food. Only meats and starches are affected by the Maillard Reaction. Steak cannot be &quot;baked&quot; the way breads are. Well, I suppose they can be roasted, but that's a whole other debate between the differences between what is &quot;baking&quot; and what is &quot;roasting&quot;. Meats are roasted and starches are baked I guess.</p></div>		</li>
