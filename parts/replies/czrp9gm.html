			<div class="markdown"><p>Recently scientists have theorized that humans started wearing clothing about 100k years ago based on the DNA of lice.</p>
<p>There are three species of lice that infest humans: hair lice, pubic lice, and body lice (body lice live solely in our clothing). After sequencing their genomes, we found these species split from one another 100k years ago. This implies that as humans lost body hair and started wearing clothes, these species were forced to differentiate.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  That's roughly when the human diaspora out of Africa occurred.  Perhaps colder climates necessitated more clothing.  Still, I'd be surprised it anatomically modern humans weren't wearing <em>anything at all</em> for the first ~100,000 years....</p></div>		</li>

<p>That doesn't account for the hairless humans who never left, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not? Bear in mind 100 thousand years ago we were Homo Sapiens, in other words exactly what we are today. Just as intelligent, just as curious, just as fond of making jokes and checking out the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Clothing most likely evolved from wearing animal skins as bragging rights for good hunts, Sabre tooth tigers and Paleo Cave Bears were formidable opponents, and wearing their skin must have been the coolest thing ever. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, you know how your fingertips get wrinkly when they're in water for a while? Well, that reaction is regulated by your nervous system, and is not a direct effect of wetness.</p>

<p>I have never heard this before. Does that mean you can have a brain injury that leaves your fingers unable to get wrinkly in water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool, I also found <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2464382/" target="_blank">this pubmed article</a> in the meantime:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, in addition to the disabling motor and sensory deficits, [the patient] had noticed a curious phenomenon that occurred when his hand was immersed in warm water—that is, the fingers “did not all go wrinkly”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Includes a picture of how only some of his fingers wrinkle when exposed to water. This is a localized nerve injury rather than a brain injury, but very interesting nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>
