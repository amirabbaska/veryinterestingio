			<div class="markdown"><p>But that doesn't change the fact that, before matter had even condensed into atoms, when the universe was merely a quantum soup of quark-gluon plasma, time was equal everywhere because the universe was, for all intents and purposes, completely gravitationally uniform, meaning there was no time dilation. In fact, at this point, time had not even existed in the form of a construct. Everything has existed since before time began, in one form or another.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You know this how? Physics does not predict this. This is completely unknown. You state it as fact, when for all we know, the big bang was the beginning of everything that has ever existed.</p></div>		</li>
