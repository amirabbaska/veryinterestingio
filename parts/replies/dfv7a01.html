<p>In the UK at least, university sports are taken more seriously, and facilities are often very good, although large scale stadia as in US college football are unheard of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Closest comparison must be Leeds Becketts involvement in Rugby?</p>
<p>For the unaware, Rugby League in Europe is probably the closest competitor sport to the US set up, although they change it every few years. Promotion/Relegation is limited to between the top two tiers, although between 2012 and 2015 it was completely on a franchise application basis like most US sports. But they have salary caps, marquee players and the current set up also has play offs to decide the ultimate champion. Like in the MLS or NHL, entry is also not only limited to teams from England - the only current one in the top division is from the south of France but teams from Paris and Wales have been in it before. There's even a team from Canada coming into the lower league this year.</p>
<p>At least one of the clubs, Leeds Rhinos, has financial links with a University - Leeds Beckett, who basically own one of the stands in the stadium and have the naming rights, they even were the major shareholder in the other team that plays rugby (union, a different code of the game) there for a few years. Not only this, but they run a scheme for budding young rugby players to get an education on scholarships for sports and leisure related courses around their training.</p>
<p>So in the UK, the closest you would get to the US College/Southern High School football scene would be the varsity Rugby match at Headingley stadium in Leeds, which attracts about 15,000 spectators to the ground (which holds about 21,000). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that a lot of professional Rugby Union is fed into by the private school circuit.</p>
<p>I went to a private secondary school in Northern England, and over half the year was either in the first or second string ruby team <em>all</em> throughout school.</p>
<p>Hockey (the real kind, not that ice skating kind) was also massive for girls - 3/4 of the year were on a team.</p>
<p>That's fairly typical for <em>lots</em> of traditional public schools in the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>It's also big in a lot of state grammar schools.</p>
<p>So yeah, for a small subset of the population, sport is an <em>enormous</em> part of secondary education in the British Isles.</p>
<p>Saying that, school football (the real kind, not the eggball kind) is fairly popular in most state schools - I'd say the majority have regular inter-school fixtures. Although it's only played by a small portion of the yeargroup (unlike in the public schools).</p>
<p>Talking to French and German friends, this is a lot less common for them. People play in teams <em>outside</em> of school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny you say that. I'm german but educated (well, secondary and university) in the english state system. And I attended a comprehensive school in a very poor rural area which had only a couple of years undergone a change from being a grammar school with boarding to a comprehensive school, a couple of the old guard staff were even there, relics of a time long gone.</p>
<p>So I actually got to see the demise before my very eyes. The day I started the sports dept had, on paper, great facilities. None of which had been maintained for at least ten years, pre Thatcher this place would have rivalled most private schools I've no doubt. We had an outdoor swimming pool in my first year, that never got filled again, we ran out of serviceable hockey sticks by year eight, by year nine the cricket nets and screens were beyond repair and no-one wanted to play cricket anyway, they basically ended up letting us play football all the time with cross country whenever we needed punishment.</p>
<p>I moved back home in my twenties and signed up to the local sunday league style football team, expecting northern english style facilities and was absolutely blown away by what we had access to, local club football is serious here, never again did I have to put nets up myself or change in a shipping container. And most of the guys on my team had been with the squad since they were 6-10 years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not remotely pal. football (soccer) players tend to get picked up early. Rugby union tends to be a bit different and there may be early links but not a guaranteed career so a lot of people still do uni. Look at the likes of a few of the welsh unis or hartpury for rugby. Also if you are looking at 2 unis close by you would always pick the one that has a better rugby tradition if they are similar. </p>
<p>Loughbrough is the top performing sports university in Europe. Oxford and Cambridge are odd as they do their own sports thing and dobt really go for BUCS. this is probably more to do with the fact they have a lot of post grads who are older. i also think they wouldnt want to be losing so they play a different set of leagues (for rugby they go straight into club rugby as opposed to uni leagues)</p></div>		</li>

Schools usually don't give a shit about sports, no matter how good the school is. The only superstars in Indian school system are the ones who score high on high school national level and competitive exams.<br />
Although, atleast for cricket the independent academies are really good. So most of the talented students join them and practice after school.  </p></div>		</li>

Some Indian universities do care about sports and actively hunt down talent but academics is always given more importance.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been like that at least 20 years. The good athletes play for AAU traveling teams to get good competition. Baseball and basketball especially. Football was the only sport i never saw much for AAU competition. In highschool kids keep playing with higher level travel teams in addition to their highschool team, and the super top-tier athletes sometimes go to academy type schools with top-tier programs. In the end it's all over the top because only a very small handful will play professionally, but honestly a lot of elite level athletes in baseball and basketball know they will be playing D-1 ball and will have a real shot at professional ball. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They aren't really footing the bill for pro teams.</p>
<p>Less than .01% of high school athletes will become pro athletes and it's even lower in sports like girl's softball. High school sports aren't a feeder for professional leagues. </p>
<p>That would be like saying we are subsidizing Hollywood by having a drama club at high school.</p>
<p>The state is mainly subsidizing activities that students play for fun and that spectators enjoy watching.</p>
<p>You might not enjoy playing or watching these activities but enough people do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what I'm saying.</p>
<p>In other countries, the main way professional teams find new talent is through their club programs, which the team funds.</p>
<p>In the U.S., pro teams get the benefit of having the schools run these programs for them. They can pick from a wide range of players without having had to invest time, effort or finances in that player's training.</p>
<p>We're subsidizing their talent pools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can suck for towns that front a professional teams complex because they can up and leave when ever. But it can be a great benefit for college towns that will be permanent. My school renovated our stadium a few years ago and now we have one of the largest football stadium in the country. </p>
<p>If you don't include the student body the town is a small podunk town. They were thinking about moving our games to Houston an hour and a half away because they were the next closest town that was at least our size. They didn't do this because most of the county would hurt because of the loss of business from football games. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a pretty uncharitable take, especially when you consider that 99% of child athletes are not going on to become pros. It also ignores the positive benefits that sports can have on physical, social and psychological development.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Totally agree here. Private/Public &quot;partnerships&quot; on stadiums are almost a burden. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about becoming pro. In Europe youth sports programs are run by the Teams.</p>
<p>And even then most people won't end professional athletes, but the burden of the cost is on the team (with some help from the state to incourage especially smaller less rich teams to  build youth programs).</p>
<p>School have physical and sport activities but are not usually cmpetitive in nature, they try to teach children about the benefit of a particular sport and help them get placed in the youth team of a private club.</p></div>		</li>
