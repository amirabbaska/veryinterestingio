			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not true at all. An object can rotate at whatever speed based on the forces acting on it. Different planets in our solar system rotate at different speeds or don't rotate at all, and it is not at all directly related to mass. Objects revolve around each other based on their masses and the distance between them. Everyone on this post is interpreting rotation as revolution of stars around the galactic core and that is not what this finding says. Our solar system does not take a billion years to revolve around the galactic core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm by no means an expert on Newtonian physics, but this question got me thinking/looking.  I looked at this article: <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/deep-space/a19433180/galaxy-rotation-billion-years/" target="_blank">https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/deep-space/a19433180/galaxy-rotation-billion-years/</a>
It states that the time measurement is at the very edge of the galaxy disk.</p>
<p>I think this has something to do with centripetal force/gravity and the mass of the galaxy.  If there was an unbreakable tether between the center of the galaxy and an object on the edge of the disk prohibiting it from flying away, then yes, I would agree that they follow different rules.  But when I think about it, it all kinda makes sense that galaxies rotate at the same speed regardless of mass.  If smaller galaxies rotated faster, they'd throw off all of their mass from overcoming gravitational/centripetal force.  This is all just my thoughts and by no means do I think it's right.  </p></div>		</li>
