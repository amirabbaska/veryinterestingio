			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that supposing the amount of time it takes to repay your debt in taxes is 12 years? Or are you just saying at some arbitrary point it should stop? Shouldn't we look at how much was spent vs how much was owed, considering inflation, difference in cost of goods and services in the school system, as well as complicate things by adding in that people who can better afford it pay more?
If you mom pays a shit ton to the public school system in property tax and its an issue, how did she afford the expensive property to begin with?
Is this scenario just for people that could afford very expensive houses that they paid off during their career, who barely get along once they retire? So a tax cut that targets people who didn't plan for retiring or save well?</p></div>		</li>

<p>So when do the parents of those kids start paying the system back for their public school education - &quot;their&quot; meaning the parents, not the kids?  I don't mind paying for public schools but the issue here is that parents end up paying less taxes than everybody else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean in the sense that, if we consider a person paying taxes out of school to be paying for their own schooling, they pay less if they have kids? </p>
<p>Hmm, I suppose that nullifies that perspective, but there is a different point I didn't make that is more significant. The tax cuts people have for children are in income taxes. Aren't public schools largely funded through property taxes? Wouldn't families tend to have larger, more expensive houses, as a result of having multiple children, while singles would live in smaller homes, possibly even renting and avoiding property taxes altogether? </p></div>		</li>
