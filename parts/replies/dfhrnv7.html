			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, most systems hang up for &gt; 30 minutes when you enter wrong password ~5 times in a row, so guessing is much more difficult, and nobody ever is hacking by password guessing, real hacks are going around passwords and skipping them, there are pasword guessing &quot;hackers&quot;, but its not like they use random passwords, they use common passwords list.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of systems can't do that anymore, particularly anything public facing.  It would be pretty easy to write a script that would intentionally lock up people's accounts, that could be pretty disruptive to something like gmail or Facebook.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you can still guess passwords, just at a slower rate, or manually. And guessing passwords in a massive automated way is part of hacking. So it was to prevent easy type of hacking. You just cant prevent me entering your username and correct password on first try, and that would not prevented guessing.</p></div>		</li>
