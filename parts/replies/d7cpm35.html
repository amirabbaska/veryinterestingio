			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  The default sex for humans is essentially female.  There is also a really interesting case called 5-alpha-reductase deficiency that is found mostly in the Dominican Republic.  Referred to colloquially as 'Guevedoces' (penis at 12), young children born and raised as females suddenly transform into males when they hit puberty.  They develop a penis and testicles drop while their former vagina fuses (so they have a seam).  Nature is fucking crazy.    </p>
<p>The locals consider it good fortune and celebrate when their daughters transform into sons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the answer to the question &quot;why do men have nipples?&quot;.</p>
<p>Basically, making nipples is near the front of the &quot;instruction set&quot; where deciding the sex is a bit later on, so we all start out with nipples in case &quot;gender_variable=female&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
