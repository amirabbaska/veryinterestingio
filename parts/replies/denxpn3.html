<p>Thank the maker we all take care of each other.  I appreciate every day I'm alive because everyone in Canada put their money together so I could have two brain surgeries, radiation, 6 months of chemo and nearly 10 MRI'S in the last 3.5 years for a brain tumor. </p>
<p>Getting through each day is enough to worry about on its own without having to worry about selling everything I have or go into ridiculous debt for the rest of my life just so I don't die in my early 30's.</p>
<p>It makes me so sad how brainwashed they are in the US to think that it would cost them more or why should I pay for other people (the poor, the people who may not be taking proper care of themselves, people who don't work).</p>
<p>They're your countrymen.  How dare you call yourself a patriot and a good citizen when in your head you're thinking <em>screw them, mememememe</em>.  Sure, you're paying for people who don't take care of themselves and people who don't work... but you're also helping that family out west whose child desperately needs a heart surgery and would otherwise be unable to afford it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;why should I pay for other people&quot; idiocy crops up everywhere but is particularly common in the US it seems. I'm curious about how they see insurance as a solution to that, since &quot;paying for other people&quot; is exactly how medical insurance works. 10 people pay into it so that when one of them shoves his arm into a wood chipper, the insurance company has the money to pay for it. </p>
<p>Except of course the lust for profits somewhat ruins that. The insurance company has the incentive to avoid paying whenever possible. The medical professionals have incentives to gouge on prices. And as mentioned elsewhere, the entire system is such a clusterfuck that there's millions to be had by just shoving yourself into the process somewhere. </p>
<p>Just build a public health system already and stop worrying about imaginary people &quot;freeloading&quot;. You pay for Netflix and Spotify every month without a single moment wondering if the people who use it an hour a week are paying for the people who use it 24 hours a day. </p>
<p>And to me (in a country where I don't have to check my bank balance before going to hospital), that's what paying taxes is -- a yearly subscription to government services. The more useful services the government can offer me (such as healthcare, education, public transport, communications infrastructure, etc) then the more comfortable I am paying taxes. </p>
<p>It's a vastly better use of money than paying the government to figure out sneaky new laws to further line the pockets of them and their friends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well said. It's such a joke that insurance is basically doing what so many of them object to, i.e. paying for their fellow Americans. In fact it's probably worse, because health insurance introduces a middle-man, a third-party whose interests are not just based on the wellbeing of citizens but on making a profit.</p>
<p>My US friend's parents are very anti-government  and very anti-socialist, and work on the basis that &quot;we're living good, Christian lives and working hard, and we shouldn't have to pay to support those who dare to reject this way of life or don't otherwise want to work to support themselves, because we would be doing them a disservice to allow them to continue not contributing to their society in this way...&quot;. When I (British) try to advocate for universal healthcare, saying &quot;I don't like it any more than you do that taxes go up because some people smoke or get blind drunk every weekend while I'm trying to be a good boy and take care of myself, but surely it's better than the alternative?&quot;, but all they come back with is how much their own personal premiums and those of their friends have gone up under 'Obama', i.e. focusing on the micro rather than the macro... </p>
<p>It's infuriating! I mean, our NHS here in the UK is in shambles and is only a shadow of its former glory, BUT if given the choice between this or US-style health insurance, I'd choose the NHS every time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a difference between &quot;pool of risk&quot; and &quot;everyone in a plan pays&quot; and what &quot;gubmint&quot; proposes is that Lazy Welfare Queen who DOESN'T pay for anything: free housing, free food, free toilet paper, gets more and more and more gibs.</p>
<p>&quot;I and Bob pay for something which I or Bob may use&quot; is one thing, &quot;I and Bob pay into it, Shaniqua takes something out of it and says &quot;thanks suckah&quot; and when we need it it's not there because the freeloaders took it all&quot; is how some people think of it.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are rich people who think &quot;fuck 'em, memememe&quot;. That's fine, you'll always have selfish assholes.</p>
<p>The problem is this mentality not only rubd off, but the average American is living with a low income. They don't have a whole lot of money to spare, so they're scared and read into the anti-socialist propaganda.</p>
<p>I get frustrated when I read an article about a neighborhood in America pooling together to pay for a kid's cancer treatment, then they all pat themselves on the back. Oh, so it was OK because he was your neighbour and he's a kid? But it's a crazy socialist idea for the country to do the same thing...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to point out that the first government healthcare plan was passed by Bismarck, a hardcore conservative monarchist. His reasoning? It helped protect against the (in his view) dangerous socialists, by basically taking away a lot of the reasons people had for supporting them (while at the same time he outlawd dozens of their newspapers and arrested their leaders, just in case anyone might think he was sympathetic to the), and <em>because it was the Christian thing to do</em>. </p>
<p>This is one of the things that makes the US selfish approach to healthcare outright bizarre from a European point of view: The reason universal healthcare gained traction so quickly here was that even while they hated each other over other issues, the left and conservative Christians in Europe realised that they largely agreed on one thing: Letting people suffer when you can help is immoral. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American here. I really wish my fellow citizens would lose the &quot;every man for himself&quot; mindset. It's frankly un-American.</p>
<p>There are many situations where pooling together resources is a good idea...economy of scale! When the scale of coverage is extended to include <em>everyone</em>, risks and costs are spread out uniformly and the pool can easily cover expensive rare treatments for the tiny subset of people who need them.
And when health care is nationalized, whole industries built around managing a variety of financial transactions are no longer needed because the whole system is uniform. This drives even more cost reductions.</p>
<p>I hope that this change happens sooner rather than later.</p></div>		</li>

The US could implement an NHS type system with an opt-out that means that everyone who didn't want it could have the insurance they have at the moment. The socialised system would be cheaper and more efficient. They ones that say they are not paying for other people would then realise the benefits</p></div>		</li>

<p>5- Health Care is a human right. This is how other countries look at health care. We all gladly pay so that we are all protected cradle to grave and it's cheap.

<p>This seems to be the major trip wire preventing Americans from accepting this type of healthcare.  There for some reason is this sentiment that A) We are failures if we have to rely on the government for any help, and B) The conservative sentiment that &quot;We aren't payin' for no one elses health care but our own&quot;   It's an extremely naive and selfish point of view</p></div>		</li>

<p>I used to really buy into this line of thinking. I have begun to change how I think about health care and move away from it very rapidly, especially the more medical research I read and the more I get involved with the system here in America.
These two lines of thinking both stem primarily from fear and greed. Fear on the part of the public that the government is totally inept and incompetent and can literally handle nothing correctly and that people will only abuse the system. Except for perhaps getting us into conflicts and wars?
Greed on behalf of the politicians who take campaign money from a lot of big insurance firms and lack a motivation or sufficient motivation maybe to change how the system works. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And like you said fear on both sides: those for socialized medicine are scared of corporations and business putting money before people's health. At the same time, the health care sector is almost 20% of our GDP and we wouldn't have nearly as a robust economy without it. </p>
<p>They're both valid concerns. However, health care cannot be seen as equivalent to other sectors of our ecnomy;  we should care more about the health of our neighbor than we do about consumer spending. </p>
<p>Until 2010, you could be denied health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, because nobody was telling insurance companies they had to, so why do it? Plus, what if they're not as profitable, that'd be bad for our economy, right?</p>
<p>If insurers weren't raking in record profits after the ACA was implemented, I'd believe that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While Steinbeck likely didn't actually say &quot;Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat, but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires&quot; but the statement is largely true. Being poor means, at least according to this American worldview that you are lazy, you didn't try hard enough or somesuch. Certainly there is a specific someone at fault for that and that someone is you. </p>
<p>There is no place for even the possibility of systemic inequivalence in the American worldview. Everyone can live the American Dream should they just try hard enough. <a href="http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate" target="_blank">http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate</a> you can't get this cartoon through to a lot of americans. It just bounces off as a story and not a cut-in-the-flesh-hard-truth.</p>
<p>Edit: and that cartoon, you know, there's something people will say about it and it's true -- that Richard is not slacking off, he probably worked very hard, looks back at his life and rightly says, I worked hard. What he doesn't recognize is that he was put on a path which simply allows for an easier climb. To speak of video games, the game of life was on a &quot;normal&quot; setting for Richard and &quot;nightmare&quot; for Paula. Doesn't mean you do not need to exert yourself or even that Paula couldn't get just as high but what is merely a commendable effort from Richard is an inhuman miracle from Paula. And this is often where this discussion breaks down because Richard and so many will misinterpret this and be offended that they worked hard in their life for their success and they presume it's all there is. But that's where they are wrong. You know how I know this? Because I am close to Richard but I am less blind perhaps because I was born and raised behind the Iron Curtain, I was 14 when the Berlin Wall came down. I saw the darkness and the light that my family was, my grandparents absolute and unflinching love and demand for knowledge and learning and not everyone had that light so yes ever since I am an adult I always was less blind to this difference. When I started writing articles as a side job while going to the university and my editor lived with his mother. He is still an editor at a Hungarian magazine and I am a senior software developer with an apartment in a Vancouver high rise with some of the best views in this world.  I've visited someone who was writing music for video games and he was an absolutely brilliant kid but never got the world wide fame he deserved because his family was living in a rotting apart gypsy shack. This cartoon, man.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the one that drives me absolutely batty, because it is completely ignorant of how health care works. Under <strong>any</strong> system, we all pay for each other's health care.</p>
<p>Under a private insurance system, we pay for each other's health care. That's literally the way insurance works--it pools people's money which is used to pay out benefits for those who need it. </p>
<p>Under a cash system, those who  get treated in ER's and hospitals but cannot pay are paid for by the rest of us in the form of higher insurance premiums and higher medical bills so the health care providers can offset their losses.</p>
<p>Anyone who makes the argument that they don't want to pay for other people's health care is just plain ignorant, because no matter what, they already are. It's just a question of which system is the most cost effective with the best results for the most amount of people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>6-The major reason that health care is expensive is that there are literally hundreds of thousands of people that work at the hospital processing insurance, at the insurance company denying claims, staff at the hospital to collect cash payments, checks, billing, accounting.

<p>This is A HUGE factor. </p>
<p>Single payer systems, like Canada, UK, and, you know, Medicaid and Medicare and the VA... They all spend about THREE percent on administrative overhead. </p>
<p>Private insurance companies in the US spend, on average, <strong>THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT</strong> on overhead, which includes things like <em>advertising</em> and <strong>profit</strong>, but mostly billing and collections. </p>
<p>That's over a quarter of &quot;healthcare&quot; money going to things that are not even closely related to healthcare. </p>

<p>I think you forgot the /s? (Poe's law is too strong these days, and sarcasm already doesn't come across that well in text). </p>
<p>You're pretty much there on that point though. To refine it; the primary idea that you should focus on with someone who is looking at healthcare from an economic standpoint is that te primary economic measure of a good healthcare system is efficiency, not profitability. </p>
<p>A good healthcare system can't be profitable, and a profitable one can't be good. But the best systems are good and efficient. The current US system is shit, and exceedingly inefficient. </p></div>		</li>
