<p>I wonder if it would though. Appetite is a multi-faceted thing.</p>
<p>There are multiple cues for hunger. Stomach expansion is certainly one of the &quot;stop eating&quot; cues, but so is &quot;okay you've had enough sugar (<em>sugar</em> not corn syrup or artificial sweeteners), &quot;you've had enough fat&quot;, and &quot;you've had enough protein.&quot; So you would be missing three of those four cues.</p>
<p>Additionally when you're short of necessary nutrients your body tells you to keep eating until you fill those requirements, despite the unnecessary calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure this. From what I understand, hunger isn't just how full your stomach is, but is highly dependent on things like blood sugar levels. I drink <a href="https://www.soylent.com/" target="_blank">Soylent</a> for lunch most days, but I don't feel hungry despite not having eaten any solids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like you are missing one big factor; <em>psychology</em>. If you eat because you are bored, depressed, etc; then a zero-calorie food would fulfill that requirement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, in most people with bulimia, the feeling of hunger goes away because they binge eat and fill their stomach (which is how your brain knows you're full). Then they purge their stomach contents before it reaches the absorption part of your GI tract, so they get no nutritional benefit from the food (caloric or otherwise).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are all &quot;zero calorie&quot; in the legal sense of &quot;less than 5 cal per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving&quot;. They're made with artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols, defatted powders, and various gums, gels, and thickeners. Splenda is also &quot;zero calorie&quot; but actually contains about 3.4 kcal/packet because of the bulking agents.</p></div>		</li>
