<p>I think Quebecois and french are on the tipping point before it becomes a separate language</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eh, being a fluent speaker of both English and French from Quebec I don't think this is the case.  Having spoken to a lot of people from France as well as Brits and Aussies, I can say that the difference between Quebec French and France French is about the same as between North American English and any other Anglo country.   </p>
<p>Of course if you consider Scottish and Australian English to be separate languages then sure I suppose you could consider Quebec French and France French to be different languages. </p>
<p>Also one thing is that I think Parisians in particular enjoy looking down upon everyone (Or perhaps it's just the French habit of pointing out differences and discussing/arguing about eevrything) including other people from France and also from Quebec and that includes pointing out how differently we speak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite this, and despite having a lot of differences ( Quebec says &quot;char&quot; french say &quot;bagnole&quot; ), people still say it's the same language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of the time I told an Algerian that I had a &quot;char&quot; and he opened up his eyes wide in surprise because for him &quot;char&quot; means tank!</p>
<p>Btw, I find that among all French speakers Algerians have the most neutral and understandable French.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I side with /u/linux1970 when it comes to French and Québecois being at a fork. I have lived almost 20 years in Canada and I clearly see the languages are drifting apart more, but more importantly, like one of the OP's response pointed to, the <em>acceptance</em> that they are different languages and are treated as such.</p>
<p>It's not a slight toward Québec nor France. Simply the realization that it has grown to become its own language (vocabulary, grammar, syntax) so it might be time to consider them separate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you fluent in French though?</p>
<p>I'm fluent in Quebec French and can easily understand the vast majority of France French and I liken it to the difference between American English and British English.  There are some weird terms here and there but overall, and I mean like 95%+ of words I understand.</p>
<p>If I compare French to Italian and Spanish which are accepted to be different languages, the difference between Quebec French and France French is no where near as large.  </p>
<p>You might be comparing Quebec working class French with Parisian high class affected speech in which case the difference might be quite large but have to compare apples to apples and compare.  If you listen to the news in Quebec French and compare it to the news in France French you will find a much smaller difference.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would suggest that Quebecois French is beginning to resemble Parisian or continental French. The French being spoken today is quite different from the French from twenty years ago, as socioeconomic progression proceeds; the joual spoken by the blue collar is still present, but is fading slightly. That, in addition to the influx of French citizens immigrating to Canada...</p>
<p>It may be simply the places I've worked, but it really feels different from what I grew up with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Official&quot; Quebecois is quite French. But as it is spoken by Quebecois (expressions, accent) it's sometimes hard to understand for me yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most French don't understand Quebecois because they have rarely encountered them. By contrast there are a lot of French people in QC so most people have at one point or another worked with one. The language differences are fundamentally slangs or phrases or cultural words. Take those out, the french is 90% identical. </p></div>		</li>
