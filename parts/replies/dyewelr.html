			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your metaphor. It's rather the atmosphere is like a sponge. To everyone else who don't like this metaphor as much as I do, a patch of air can hold water. Florida summers can attest to that.</p>
<p>The thing that squeezes the water (or pulls water from the sky?) is colder temps making the air more dense, and the density is slowly drawing water molecules together and create rain. Like a million million tiny sponges... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some justified critics because it's the condensation and not a kinetic squeeze that causes droplets to form, which I said I appreciated the correction, but then some people felt they had to keep telling me I don't know shit so I ignore them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add: a storm system is like those sponges are on a conveyor belt - going over land, cooler temps, and higher elevations are like squeeze points on the belt. The sponges get squeezed and continue moving as new sponges are delivered, creating a continuous downpour so long as the belt is supplied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No matter your education or experience, I always appreciate a good metaphor. Great way to quickly convey a complicated concept. Good one, u/Holgrin! ELI5 pro level. </p></div>		</li>
