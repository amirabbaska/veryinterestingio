			<div class="markdown"><p>I had about $6k in stubhub and ticket master charges on mine few weeks back. The scary part? I get an alert text when they suspect its fraud. A min after the alert I got a &quot;thank you for verifying your charges&quot;. So whomever got my number also called the bank. </p>
<p>But tickets would be good. You can resell those on CL or wherever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Literally anyone can find out your birthday with minimal effort. For most people, it's on their Facebook profile, as well as almost every other online account. There are also birth announcements, if they're willing to hunt those down (which still isn't particularly hard, especially if you're under ~20). Plus most people celebrate their birthday every year, so if there's anything <em>anywhere</em> about you're 30th birthday party last April, there you go.</p>
<p>Social is a little trickier, but considering they make us use it for everything from college applications to bank accounts to insurance to phone bills, there's plenty of ways to get at that, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my card fraudulently used once, they purchased $1600 worth of flights. As far as I am aware all flights are non refundable, and even if it were it would be to my card. You couldn't use the flights because if you turn up at the airport they would know who stole the card. What would be the point of this? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The airline may not be wiling to refund the money, but will often allow the ticket to be exchanged for credit after deducting a change fee.  The credit can then be sold at a discount on the grey market.  The fraudster buys $1600 worth of airfare and ends up with $1400 worth of airline credit, which he then sells for $700 - $1000 cash on Craigslist.  &quot;My girlfriend dumped me and I can't use these tickets anymore&quot; or some other barely plausible cover story.</p>
<p>It's a good reason to beware of anyone selling large gift cards or other cash substitutes at a steep discount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How exactly would this work? Every airline I have ever heard of requires airline tickets and credits to be under someone's name (and often times your birthday as well) at the point of sale to prevent 3rd market selling. So unless you found someone with the same name and birthday as you, you couldn't sell it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, with credit card, the flights are often last minute. So the fraudster buys at midnight for a flight at 6am. By the time you realised you have that charge on that credit card, the guy is already long gone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are refundable flights and even if there isn't, there are ways to transfer tickets to other people, usually it has like a $100 or $150 change fee. </p>

<li>Scammer buys $1600 in tickets.</li>
<li>Scammer then asks for the refund on those tickets. </li>
<li>Scammer buys tickets for other people's accounts. </li>
<li>As far as the airline is concerned, the tickets were bought with credits. </li>
