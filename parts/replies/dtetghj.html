			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer.</p>
<p>Coptic is to ancient Egyptian and modern English is to old English.</p>
<p>We know how ancient Egyptian sounded because the language is still being spoken today, in an evolved form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern English sounds <em>very</em> different from middle English, much less old English, thanks to changes like the Great Vowel Shift and H-dropping, and that's from only 700 years ago in a language that has many living speakers, whereas Coptic only really survives in Coptic church liturgy.  </p>
<p>Trying to understand Demotic (Roman-era Egyptian) through Coptic (&quot;modern&quot; Egyptian) is like trying to understand classical Latin through church Latin.  And that says nothing of trying to figure out middle Egyptian or ancient Egyptian, which had some mutually incomprehensible dialects, according to ancient writers.</p>
<p>We know almost <em>nothing</em> about how ancient Egyptian was pronounced, and the answer to that question would have almost certainly changed many times over the thousands of years that various Egyptian dynasties stood just as it did for different, far-flung regions of the kingdom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to quibble with the part about not being able to pronounce Demotic by means of Coptic, since that’s exactly what my dissertation research is about. We actually have a pretty solid grasp of the pronunciation of Coptic near the time when Demotic was still in use, and there are later Demotic texts that contain subtle indications of specific vowel sounds (esp. verbal morphology), which makes it possible to identify dialectal variation known from Coptic in Demotic. </p>
<p>I also don’t think the dialects were as different as you claim. I suspect that you’re referencing that line in Anastasi I, but that could easily be an exaggeration. The evidence from Coptic suggests that the dialects would have been mutually intelligible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coptic is one of the coolest languages I've ever studied. The Copts do still use it, and they certainly are proud of their language, meaning it will likely be around for a long time. It's relationship to Middle Egyptian isn't quite strong enough for definite pronunciation rules, but we have a little guidance from it.</p></div>		</li>
