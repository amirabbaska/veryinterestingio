			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the brine issue, would this create a bi product of salt. Could this salt be used for food industry or for animal feed?
Can the salt gathered be used in some other form rather than pumping it back in? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a big issue with mass quantities of desalination; what do you do with all the leftover salt? Dumping it in the ocean is no good, because not only would it probably kill a whole bunch of stuff, but you would have to spend even more resources separating it out again. If you could get it ultra pure to the point of food grade, you could sell it. I think the cheapest and easiest solution is that they just store it for the winters and use it to melt ice (in the US).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Creating a desalination plant that also produces food grade salt would be prohibitively extensive. It may have potential as deicing fluid though. </p></div>		</li>
