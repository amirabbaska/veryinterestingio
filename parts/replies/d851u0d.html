			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such an important point. The only reason light is visible at all is because our eyes evolved to interpret photons within a certain frequency range as meaningful information. Light, as a thing of luminance, does not exist apart from an observer's ability to see it. Sort of like the question &quot;if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around, does it still make a sound?&quot; Photons certainly would still exist but without eyes that can see them, they're nothing more than bits of energy oscillating at vastly different frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.
Refractive index is important, size of droplets, and the light source all have an influence on the rainbow. </p>
<p>Ever seen a white rainbow? It exists. Even here on earth. </p>
<p>Here's world famous MIT physics professor, Walter Lewin, on rainbows:

<p>Keep in mind, the vid is like two hours. It's a lecture, but I like to think of it as a small budget educational movie. Grab the popcorn or whatever and enjoy the rainbows. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a shame that such an enthusiastic talented teacher ended up having all his work overshadowed by controversy due to his recent inappropriate behaviour regarding online female students. I believe MIT removed all his online material to distance themselves from the drama, which I understand, it was just so well done.</p></div>		</li>
