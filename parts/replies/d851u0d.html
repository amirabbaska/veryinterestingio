			<p>That's crazy that whatever planet you could ever be on in the universe, visible light would always have the same wavelengths so the rainbow would be in exactly the same order as on earth</p>		</li>

			<p>But what determines which part is &quot;visible&quot; light is a feature of your eye, which you've taken to that planet with you.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is such an important point. The only reason light is visible at all is because our eyes evolved to interpret photons within a certain frequency range as meaningful information. Light, as a thing of luminance, does not exist apart from an observer's ability to see it. Sort of like the question &quot;if a tree falls in the woods and no one is around, does it still make a sound?&quot; Photons certainly would still exist but without eyes that can see them, they're nothing more than bits of energy oscillating at vastly different frequencies.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think this comment misses the point that rainbows are real, objective measurable phenomenon. Not all photons are refracted by water droplets but the ones around the visible spectrum (and a few others too) are. <br><br>This isn't just perception. <br><br>On another planet it would depend a bit on the atmospheric composition of which wavelengths are refracted. <br><br>The refraction happens even if no one sees it, forever altering the fate of those photons. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well it obviously still matters, we as humans only have 3 color receptors in our eyes, the primary colors we learnt of in school.<br><br>A mantis shrimp tho has 17 color receptors, so their rainbow would be a mindfuck number of colors we couldn't even begin to imagine how they looked like.</p>		</li>

			<p>Radiolab was kind of misleading on this point, when they talked about rainbows as if they contained every color. <br><br>Rainbows are made of monochromatic light. Orange in the rainbow is made of just orange wavelengths (not a mix of red and green, like a computer screen). <br>The colors you could distinguish with more than 3 color receptors, and not with 3, are colors that <em>aren't</em> monochromatic.<br><br>We have non-rainbow colors like white, magenta, and beige; a mantis shrimp would have more of them, like yellow-blue or something. </p>		</li>

			<p>Technically all photons are refracted. It is wavelength dependant, so different photons are refracted differently, which is what causes the splitting of the rainbow into the seperate colors. But even IR and UV photons are refracted.</p>		</li>

			<p>I can't be certain, but I doubt high energy photons would be refracted by a water drop. Gamma radiation can pass through concrete! <br><br>I'd love to know for sure if there's an expert about. </p>		</li>

			<p>Refraction is a product of light waves travelling from one medium to a different medium. It doesn't matter what wavelength of light or what medium. The speed of light in vacuum is <strong>c</strong> while the speed of light in water is ~3/4 * <strong>c</strong>. I have no idea what the speed of gamma rays in concrete is but it is certainly less than <strong>c</strong>, therefore gamma rays are refracted by concrete. Snell's law of refraction is a law of physics. </p>		</li>

			<p>No, because you can still only see those colors. You have to remember that your eyes only detect a very small part of the entire spectrum of light. Rainbows would look different if you were a mantis shrimp sine they can detect light further into both IR and UV and so can see more of the rainbow than we can. </p>		</li>

			<p>Sort of. <br>Refractive index is important, size of droplets, and the light source all have an influence on the rainbow. <br><br>Ever seen a white rainbow? It exists. Even here on earth. <br><br>Here's world famous MIT physics professor, Walter Lewin, on rainbows:<br><a href="https://youtu.be/6QVbE_tU2sA" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/6QVbE_tU2sA</a><br><br>Keep in mind, the vid is like two hours. It's a lecture, but I like to think of it as a small budget educational movie. Grab the popcorn or whatever and enjoy the rainbows. </p>		</li>

			<p>Such a shame that such an enthusiastic talented teacher ended up having all his work overshadowed by controversy due to his recent inappropriate behaviour regarding online female students. I believe MIT removed all his online material to distance themselves from the drama, which I understand, it was just so well done.</p>		</li>
