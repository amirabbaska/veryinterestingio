			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about the maximum distance in the shortest time (we'd be dealing with planck units there)  but approximately 186000 miles is the farthest that anything (energy and information included)  can travel in one second <em>of externally observed time</em>. </p>
<p>An interesting effect of relativity is that the thing doing the travelling will experience less time than is being externally observed,  with this effect increasing exponentially to infinity as C (the speed of light)  is approached. </p>
<p>If light could be said to &quot;experience time&quot; it would appear <em>from its own perspective</em> to arrive at its destination,  no matter how distant,  simultaneously to being created.  Meanwhile,  we see it travelling at a mere 186,000 miles per second from our external vantage point,  regardless of our relative speed or distance from its source. </p>
<p>This is because light (in a vacuum,  because when it interacts with matter other stuff is going on) ,  does not have a &quot;speed&quot;  as we conventionally think of it,  in terms of relative motion.  It propagates at a fixed rate irrespective of the movement of observers,  departing and arriving with exactly zero elapsed time from its &quot;own perspective&quot; (it can't actually have one under relativity,   but that gets a little complex), and propagating at approximately 186000 miles per second relative to every other point of reference in the universe ,  whether &quot;fixed&quot;  or &quot;moving&quot;. </p>
<p>This also means that traveling at  the speed of light would require infinite acceleration (so as to arrive without the passage of time),  which of course would require infinite energy,  which makes actually doing it inconveniently problematic to the point of being theoretically impossible. </p>
<p>Edit:The following part was wrong... Dropped three zeros off of the size of the galaxy,  but thanks to the weirdness of relativity,  it will only take me about 24 years at 1g, not 10... But,  at home,  100-150 <em>thousand</em> years will have passed... And we'll be going so fast that the microwave background radiation will be a ridiculously huge impediment. </p>
<p>Fortunately,  travelling at significant fractions of C does seem to be <em>theoretically</em> possible,  so even though it would require enormous energy,  it might be someday possible to cross the Galaxy in about <del>10</del> 24 years (your time,  accelerating at 1g).   When you got there 100-150 thousand! years would have passed on earth though (depending mainly on the actual size of the milky way,  which is variously considered to be 100-150 <em>thousand</em> light years across).... So there's that.
.. And,  the cosmic background radiation would basically make it like trying to fly through the sun,  only much hotter and denser.... So,  there's that too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your way of explaining it!</p>
<p>So if a space pilot manage to accelerate very close to the speed of light, he is traveling at close to infinite speed (arrive the same time as he left) from his point of view. And an observer not moving would see him traveling at close to 300,000,000 m/s. </p>
<p>Where does the ratio between these perspectives come from? Why not 10 times more or 10 times less? What would have to change to change the speed of light?</p></div>		</li>

<p>To travel across the Milky Way galaxy in 10 years, we would have to travel 10,577 times the speed of light, because our galaxy is 100,000 light years in diameter, not 100-150. Or maybe I misunderstood you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well for a &quot;thing&quot; to travel 186,000 miles in one second, it cannot have mass. Light has no mass, therefore it can. You have mass, and the shortest amount of time it would ever take you would ever be able to travel 186,000 miles would be 1 second plus one Planck time(10e-43 seconds).</p></div>		</li>
