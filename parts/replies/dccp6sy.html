			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my god I've been showing that video to my science classes for several years now and just NOW realized that he did the reddit thing - using a banana for scale. </p>
<p>I feel so dumb now. </p>
<p>On an unrelated note, everyone should watch that video. Its fantastic. Especially if they know someone who is a smoker - get them to watch it without telling them really what its about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it makes you feel any better, the banana being used for the scale of radiation pre-dates reddit's use of them. The idea was to show the public that radiation wasn't all that dangerous by comparing the amounts to something that people thought was healthy. People naturally get scared by the idea of any amount of radiation, but they aren't scared by eating a banana. </p></div>		</li>
