			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man. One summer at boyscout camp we played the game &quot;Gestapo&quot;. We were 11-12ish. Too young to understand how fucked up that game name <em>really</em> is. Basically hide and seek in a big field plus tag once you're found. Sprinting through chest-height grass. Omg the <em>itching</em>. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It teaches you <em>how to run from the gestapo</em>.</p>
<p>An important fucking skill. Learn it. You might need it soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes I see people talking about tics like they are common, and I don't get it because in my experience (and where I live) I've never encountered them.  And I actually go outside.  Are tics everywhere?  </p>
<p>Edit: According the the CDC there are some ticks where I live, but fewer than many areas. Still don't know why I haven't heard of them being a problem here though. </p></div>		</li>
