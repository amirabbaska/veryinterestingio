<p>The real issue is slowing down the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question he's answering doesn't ask anything about &quot;successful fusion for energy production as we see it at sub planetary scales&quot;. It's asking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has it been scientifically proven that Nuclear Fusion is actually a possibility...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is yes and the Sun is certainly the most familiar example.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All nuclear power plants are fission reactors. Uranium breaks into smaller atoms. The Thorium-salt reactors many are excited about are also fission.  </p>
<p>Fusion reactors would fuse hydrogen (the smallest atom) into helium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the human glow <a href="http://www.livescience.com/7799-strange-humans-glow-visible-light.html" target="_blank">is in the visible spectrum</a>.   </p>
<p>Are you saying heat/infrared energy isn't useable? </p>
<p>In any event, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dfK9G7UDok?t=22" target="_blank">fission reactions can be bright</a>, as well.</p>
<p>(My point is merely that &quot;shining&quot;, in and of itself, is not proof of nuclear fusion.)</p></div>		</li>
