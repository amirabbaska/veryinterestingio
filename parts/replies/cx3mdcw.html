			<div class="markdown"><p>Also should point out that the password requirements typically make passwords less memorable rather than more secure. It's the larger the password length that makes brute force and even dictionary attacks harder to break rather than the complexity of the password. RK7b!kL} is less secure than seventytwogolfbasketball by many magnitudes. But money says it's order of magnitudes easier to remember the longer password.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a decent analogy, but it isn't exactly relevant for brute force attacks. Brute force attacks are exhaustive key searches, not exhaustive id searches.</p>
<p>In your case, you're describing a single outfit (the password) and searching for users that match that outfit. A brute force attack would be selecting a single user, then trying all outfits until it matches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really true. </p>
<p>While what you describe (find a user name, try passwords) is indeed a brute force attack, it's far from the only (not even necessarily the most common) way that logins are brute forced.</p>
<p>You're making the assumption of a targeted attack, where someone has a particular person whose login they want. While this certainly happens, more often the goal is to find any login not just a login. This means the easiest way is to try a lot of known user/pass combinations, because it uses a degree of confidence that they will be linked to substantially cut down the time to access. It's sort of counter intuitive, but it's like not actually needing to have a username and password, it's like a single key authentication.</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to mention the other key part of this point is that since just about everything under the sun locks out a given account after a few attempts against it, hitting lots of user/pass combos from different IPs and not the same user makes a lot more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that even though you added more combinations, you effectively narrowed the choices by taking into account human nature. You can do a safe guess on the maximum amount of clothing people would wear, and knowing exactly what type of items they had to use allows you to build a exact table of combinations ahead of time rather than do it on the spot. The better choice would be to just put a constraint on the minimum amount of articles of clothing contestants had to wear, as well as a blacklist that prevents easily guessable combinations, such as &quot;jeans and a solid black T-shirt, black shoes, white socks, no hat and no jewelry&quot;, that way you make the guess work astronomically harder, since the bruteforce ApparelGuessâ„¢ player would have to include every single combination that could exist in the game.</p></div>		</li>
