<li>long answer = pointing </li>
<li>short answer = throwing</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also</p>
<ul>
<li>long answer = long duration  </li>
<li>short answer = short duration, but trajectory likely thrown off</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, the best answer would be to flash the light at the ship in the hopes that someone onboard will see you and come to your rescue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Throwing the flashlight means your ejecting more mass at once, thus you'll start your trajectory with a faster velocity. Opposed to where you have the flashlight turned on, which will increase your acceleration very very very slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, just pointing it in the opposite direction of the spacecraft wouldn't always get you back. It depends on where you are. If you are in orbit your local reference frame is rotating and accelerating with respect to the orbit inertial frame and you need to take that into account.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is that your maneuvers in your local frame of reference are also changing your overall orbit, so as you and your spacecraft move in your orbits of the central body, you will drift apart.</p>
<p>You need to use something like <a href="http://www.ae.utexas.edu/courses/ase366k/cw_equations.pdf" target="_blank">the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations</a> to determine how you want to maneuver in your local frame.</p></div>		</li>
