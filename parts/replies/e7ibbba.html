<p>Edit: Yes, I'm aware that cooked McDs burgers don't spoil (I've seen super size me) I just wasn't aware that it was due to salt. I also thought that OP meant before cooking, not after. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Iceland they have a small museum and one item in there is a McDonald's burger under a glass protector. It was the last burger produced before the islands only Mcdonald's closed down due to low profits. They used to have a webcam stream for it but I looks to of been taken down recently. see below:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but in the process of becoming a sun dried tomato the bacteria have a feast too correct? You ingest them too, correct? Are the dead bacteria harmless because the living ones are bad and the dead ones harmless? Do they not leave traces of toxins making you ill? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that sun-dried tomatoes dry out much, much quicker, due to some combination of slicing, salting, and a very sunny, well-ventilated environment.</p>
<p>So the window of time for the bacteria to multiply and produce toxins is much smaller.  It’s nothing to do with living vs dead bacteria; it’s that the total population of bacteria that’s lived there, and so the amount of toxins they’ve produced, is several orders of magnitude smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also want to add that UV light damages microbes, just like it does your skin cells, but a little cell damage is more fatal when you only have a few cells, and you don't regenerate damaged cells.</p>
<p>The glass in your car also blocks most UV. So I wouldn't recommend salt curing anything on your dash - especially fish.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In addition to disease caused by direct bacterial infection, some foodborne illnesses are caused by enterotoxins (exotoxins targeting the intestines). Enterotoxins can produce illness even when the microbes that produced them have been killed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness" target="_blank">Source</a> </p>
<p>Basically if you leave food out and it gets overrun with bacteria, those bacteria can produce enough toxins to get you sick, even if the bacteria is eliminated before you eat it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, if hamburger goes bad, cooking it to sterilization won't keep you from getting food poisoning from it.</p></div>		</li>
