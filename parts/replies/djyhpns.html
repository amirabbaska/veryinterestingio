			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people forget that if you want to make something colder, that means you have to make something else hotter -- and since no process is 100% efficient, the 'wasted' thermal energy is always greater than the amount of cooling you achieve. That's why the back of your fridge is actually pretty warm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>air conditioner takes air, compresses it to heat it up to a very high temperature.  It then cools that super-heated air to the ambient temperature.  then that high pressure, somewhat cooled air is decompressed so it is much colder than the ambient air and release it back.</p>
<p>(actually it compresses something else (called a refrigerant) and uses heat exchangers to actually cool the air.. but that's not really that important).  A heat pump is the same thing, it just runs in reverse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you elaborate more on what makes an AC unit become dramatically less effective as the outside temperature surpasses 100 degrees?  Is there a point the temperature may be too high for an AC unit to be reasonably effective?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat transfers more efficiently (faster) when there's a higher temp difference. Your AC works by collecting heat inside and taking it outside, but if it's hotter outside, it's harder to get rid of the heat when taking it outside. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no such thing as cold...only a scale of how much heat. So for your AC to work it has to take heat from inside your house and move it out. This process is more difficult when there is already a ton of heat outside as all energy flows from high to low. So putting heat into an already heat rich environment (outside your house) is harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AC units are rated in BTU's per hour they can cool, most areas don't reach over 100F so they don't install AC units that are rated for cooling that much. Arizona does get that hot, so they buy units that are rated higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is harder but they can still do it... it just takes more energy and usually means the unit runs more often or longer. </p></div>		</li>
