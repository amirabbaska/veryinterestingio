			<div class="markdown"><p>Sending multiple signals over one wire (or radio frequency, or any other medium for that matter) is called Multiplexing.  Wikipedia can do a far better job than I can of describing it:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruplex_telegraph" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruplex_telegraph</a></p>
<p>Telegraphs went from being able to send a single message at a time to being able to send two messages at once (duplex), to being able to send four messages at once (quadruplex).  Research into more advanced multiplexing technologies resulted in the invention of the telephone.  </p></div>		</li>
