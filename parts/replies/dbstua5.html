			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say universe is expanding at an ever increasing rate, have we caught any object (i.e galaxy or others) increasing its acceleration? If not, wouldn't it be that the objects 90 billion light years away were only moving away in that speed 90 billion years ago, and we don't know if they slowed?</p>
<p>If we have found these objects actually accelerating, is that found across the sky or only locally? and how did we determine the acceleration? I understand that one can use the Doppler shift to determine the velocity, but how do we determine acceleration?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah good question. So the measurement is made with type 1a Supernovae. We use them because their brightness is very well understood. Then the distance can be extracted by comparing how bright they appear to be with how bright they should be. </p>
<p>Basically Supernovae far away are moving away from us less quickly than we expect. And since looking far away is looking back in time, this means things were moving less quickly in the past.</p>
<p>This assumes that the universe is the same everywhere in Space and direction independent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We know, for example, that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. So a star 90 billion lightyears away from us today we'll be further away in the future. </p>

<p>I get that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate - but how do we know that the star is moving with the expansion? And is the expansion only at the edges or is all of space expanding, even here on earth? And if that star IS moving, why can't it be moving towards us (away from the expansion - assuming space expands only at the edges)? I'm very confused - but it is a fascinating subject - and thank you for your explanation - it really made me think.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, the way we figured out that the universe is expanding is by looking at distant stars. On average, distant stars are moving away from us. And the further away from us the star is moving, the faster away from us it's moving. There are two explanations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Earth occupies a special place in the universe. Everything is moving away from us and far away things are moving faster.</p>
</li>
<li>Everything is moving away from everything else at a (roughly) constant rate. Imagine a bunch of dots on the surface of a balloon. As the balloon inflates, nearby dots move away from each other a little. More distant dots move away from each other more quickly. For a three-dimensional analogy, imagine raisins embedded in bread that's rising. As the bread rises, it expands and the raisins move away from each other. </li>
</ol>
<p>Number 2 is the one people tend to believe because it doesn't assume Earth is special (which would be strange). I say roughly constant rate because we now know that the universe is expanding more rapidly today than it was in the past. The source of that acceleration is <em>dark energy</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And is the expansion only at the edges or is all of space expanding, even here on earth?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of space is expanding. However, Earth and our galaxy resist the expansion because of their gravitational attraction. So basically the result of cosmic expansion is that galaxies move away from each other, but the planets in our solar system are not moving away from each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if that star IS moving, why can't it be moving towards us</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so some distant stars and galaxies ARE moving towards us, just because they were given some velocity kick. But <em>on average</em> distant galaxies are moving away from us (and each other).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>assuming space expands only at the edges</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no edges that we know of. ;)</p>

<p>Hey, it's a confusing subject. I hope I helped! :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doughnuts are already three-dimensional. I think. Do you mean 4D?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No I don't. I mean the 3D version of the <em>surface</em> of a doughnut. Basically take a cube and identify each face with its opposite so that if you walk forward in a straight line, you always end up back where you started. It's a little different than the 3D version of the surface of a sphere, but that exists too (and it's not a ball).</p></div>		</li>
