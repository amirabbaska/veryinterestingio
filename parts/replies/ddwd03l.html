<p>You'll never find a system of racial classification that makes everyone happy, since race is a cultural phenomenon, not an objectively measurable biological one.</p>

<p>This is fascinating.  Can you provide some more information or perhaps some direction where I could read about this?  I always thought race was biologically-based as in Polynesians had specific biological traits different to say Micronesians or Melanesian and their biological traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to trace lineages of descent in various human groups through things like mitochondrial DNA and the Y-Chromosome. There are seven main Y-DNA haplogroups among Europeans and European-descended peoples, for instance, however, these don't line up with any 'races' as we understand them. While different phenotypic traits certainly do predominate in certain areas, there's frequently just as much (if not more) genetic variation WITHIN a 'race' than between races.</p>
<p>Here's a good introductory series of videos on how most modern academics approach the subject of race: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcg6jyg3zk&list=PLtKNX4SfKpzXGvxcsF3mEy1-GgaxpdFT8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcg6jyg3zk&list=PLtKNX4SfKpzXGvxcsF3mEy1-GgaxpdFT8</a></p></div>		</li>
