			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I think I'm starting to grasp it now. So, if I'm picturing this right, you're standing in this spinning capsule, and you're spinning with it, and that force keeps you on that surface?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  So centrifugal force keeps pushing you outward, and the &quot;floor&quot; keeps you from going outward.  So if you floated into that room and had no contact with anything, nothing would happen.  You would just keep floating.  But if you are moving with the floor, the force moving you away from the center of the spin would be felt.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so you know, &quot;artificial gravity&quot; is not really a thing. It's more like a science fiction trope that in space you can generate gravity so it feels like on Earth, but current human technology is not there yet. The other explanations of a bucket with water or car turning on a curve deal with centrifugal forces. You could interpret that as artificial gravity but I personally would just say centrifugal force.</p>
<p>Any sort of attraction between two masses is &quot;gravity&quot; as defined in high school physics, but that is different from being able to stand and walk inside a spaceship, like it is typically depicted in movies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Required contact with the spinning surface to make it work.</p>

<p>That is not entirely accurate, the only relevant criteria is that you are rotating around the centre of the station along with whatever surface you're on.</p>
<p>You can jump and you will fall back down again, but if you run fast enough in the opposite direction that the station is spinning in you will begin to float even if you never left the floor with both feet at the same time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I was reading the earlier posts about buckets of water, and yeah, that works when gravity initially holds the bucket in place but what happens in space. </p>
<p>Thanks OP I'd never thought of how the 'spinning spaceships' from scifi movies/shows got to the point of having gravity! </p></div>		</li>
