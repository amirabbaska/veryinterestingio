			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does. Many areas have restrictions on anchor use due to this. I believe there was a big issue with cruise ships recently in Bermuda.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the sea bad is a desert because it's way below the are where any light can reach. No light means no plants (with the exception of very deep thermal vents which have sulphur metabolizing archaea) and hence none of the ecosystem around it. </p>
<p>For the shallow areas that do sustain life, there are very strict rules about where you can anchor, and often the local harbor will have guides to make sure you do it right. </p>
<p>More ELI5 version: very little of the Ocean floor looks like the shallow-depth coral + life that we imagine (ala Finding Nemo). Most of it is barren. Imagine dragging an anchor through rural Nevada, not really anything to mess up there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you’re dropping your anchor so deep that light cannot penetrate, youre gonna need a lot of line!!
And peak biodiversity in the oceans is actually deeper than the photic layer, so you’re certainly smashing animals. Odds are they’re mostly invertebrates, and nothing charismatic that people care about, but those inverts are incredibly important to ecosystem services</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the anchors and chains are normally insanely heavy. If the ships pull the anchor up too quick, and increase resistance, do they risk tipping the boat? Are there set speeds they have to return it at?</p>
<p>Or am I just overthinking this way too much? Lol </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking more in terms of tankers Yeah. The big huge ships. So I assume the ships are large and heavy enough that the weight of the anchor had little effect? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the boat was just sitting there then there’s 0 “drag”. If there was tons of wind and waves the anchor will dig in and there’s infinite “drag”.</p>
<p>Drag is the wrong word here in general.</p></div>		</li>
