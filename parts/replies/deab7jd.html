			<div class="markdown"><p>I can definitely relate to your explanation, anecdotally, of course. I can fall asleep very, very easily, and stay asleep, thus needing less overall time for sleep. My friend, on the other hand, has a hard time sleeping, and needs way longer to be able to have a solid day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just described me and my wife. When I hit the pillow, I'm out. When I'm out, I stay out. She, on the other hand, will toss and turn and wake up at the slightest peep. She's always much more tired than I am and I get significantly less sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I sleep 4-5 hours per night most nights. I generally go to bed at 4 and wake up at 9. I have a really hard time falling asleep (usually takes an hour, sometimes two). I function very well with this amount of sleep, albeit I prefer to sleep longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to bed at 10:30 pm trying to get a good nights sleep and woke up wide awake at 4:30. 45 minutes of trying to fall back asleep and here I am.</p>
<p>Whats weird though is this only happens like once a month</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get about six hours. I wake up and I'm awake til I go back to bed. It's just how I'm wired. Caffeine and sugar aren't really big parts of my diet - some days none at. Some people are just biologically wired to go on less sleep. </p>
<p>It's almost two in the morning. I have to be awake before 9. I'll be awake sometime between seven and eight, well before any alarm. </p></div>		</li>
