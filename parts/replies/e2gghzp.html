<p>Early-branching is a more acceptable term, but it has to be relative to some other species. In this case, I would assume you mean earliest-branching relative to humans, which is another way of saying the most distantly related species to humans. Does that sound like what you mean?</p>

<p>Yep that's pretty much what I mean, thank you. And thank you for your insect insight :).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he means is that in biology, every modern species is just as “intelligent” as the other in an evolutionary sense. Animals have all evolved and adapted to their respective niches. Humans aren’t more <em>advanced</em> than any other modern species. The term “intelligence” itself is hard-to define in evolutionary biology because it’s relative to the organism itself. When we talk about humans and their intelligence, it usually is referring to their cognitive ability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we were to change the reference from farthest from humans, to closest to the original life form, how much does this answer change?</p>
<p>Is that even an answerable question, what species have specificalized the least and just stayed how they are for the last who knows how long? Since that point of reference (the common ancestor to all life) isnt around to compare too. </p>
<p>Like, an octopus (random example, dont actually know) might be farther than a shark from humans, but they seem more specialized  than sharks and farther from whatever that super early common ancestor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people have an intuitive sense that the organisms they see are more evolved or less evolved, but this isn't really supported by evolutionary theory. The problem is that there's not really any way to quantify how specialized an organism is in a comprehensive way that would allow for that kind of comparison. How can you numerically compare the specialization of a shark's cartilaginous skeleton with the specialization of an octopus's tentacles, for example? And not just those two traits, either, but all of the traits of a shark against all of the traits of an octopus? That doesn't even make sense. How many traits does an organism have?</p>
<p>We can quantify how distantly related any two currently living organisms are from one another on an evolutionary tree simply by tracing their lines on the tree back to the point where those two lines meet (their most recent common ancestor). The deeper that point is in the tree, the more distantly related the two organisms are to one another. However, if you do the same, but start from the root of the tree (which is either the origin of life or the last universal common ancestor depending on how the tree is drawn), you'll see that every creature living today is exactly as far away from the root.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've all been evolving for the same length of time so we are all equally distant to the original life form. We can described things in terms of ancestral vs derived, so you can say that lungs are a derived feature of vertebrates, while gills are the ancestral feature.
You could potentially say that chickens have more derived features than a trout, since their last common ancestor, since the common ancestor was pretty fish-like. Its a bit arbitrary when you aren't looking at a specific features though, because it depends on what features you focus on. A good example is your octopus shark example. In what regard are octopuses more specialized than a shark? Or in what regard is it further from the common ancestor of all those species, which was probably something like a sea sponge or comb jelly? Number of legs? The way the embryo forms? The immune system? Neurology? How do you weigh up these different features? So its tricky, but species are sometimes described as living fossils iif they haven't changed much physically through the fossil record.</p></div>		</li>
