			<div class="markdown"><p>Also don't forget public <em>view</em>. If your bedroom window is on the front of your house, and someone takes pictures of you having sex with the curtains open, they very likely will not be guilty of voyeurism. (In fact you may be guilty of public indecency.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent point. Although if someone looked through the window and saw a couple having sex from an angle that wouldn't normally be visible from the front of the house, you're back to the paparazzi being criminally at fault.</p>
<p>Im not a lawyer however, so my answer really doesn't mean shit. From the arrest to the trial a lot can happen. What I would charge may be different than a sergeant, or a detective and so on the chain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voyeurism requires a lack of consent of the recording or an implied lack of consent. If they know the paparazzi are there and start stripping, it would be hard to argue for voyeurism</p></div>		</li>
