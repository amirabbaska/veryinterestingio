			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting theory... Being a Doctor, have you ever thought to test this hypothesis?  </p>
<p>I usually experience discomfort in my knees and ankles 48-72 hours prior to a Low/Cold Front moving through.  Not as much with a High; though I am in Arizona so we rarely experience long periods of lows.  I think their are a huge number of variables that impact or trigger these aches... Pressure, moon phase, alttitude, humidity, individual physiology, ect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never thought to test it, but most of my practice is focused on musculoskeletal injuries, so I often hear my patients complaining of increased pain when the temperature drops. People also complaint of increased joint pain after prolonged rest, such as sleeping or sitting for too long, which also makes the muscles tighter.
Movement and heat increase blood flow to the muscles, improving its function. That is why athletes &quot;warm up&quot; before strenuous activity. Being well hydrated is another important factor to improve muscle function and &quot;loosen up&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I meant warm weather. You are right, always use cold for injuries, however, warm compresses may help when applied to muscle spasms (not joints or injured areas). </p></div>		</li>
