			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, but in three lines or less what actually is calculus? I know basic algebra, plotting and such, but no clue what calculus is. I want to know essentially what it is, rather than what it actually is (which I could look at Wikipedia). I think this might help a lot of other Redditors out too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In one sentence: calculus is the study of rates of change.</p>
<p>With algebra you can plot the position of an item over time and try to find a model for it. With calculus you can find the velocity, the acceleration, and the total distance traveled all as functions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sums over time. ?</p>
<p>Edit: Though &quot;time&quot; is so confining. Over a &quot;range&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  It is about rates of change.  If your algebra teacher was like most algebra teachers they seemed to have an abnormal interest in slopes of lines.  The slope of a straight line is a simple rate of change.  Calculus is the reason textbooks and algebra instructors are so fixated on slopes.  In college algebra you are mostly concerned with straight lines, probably with some parabolas thrown in.  In calculus you will study rate of change along curved lines.  The notation becomes a bit different, but the concepts are the same.  </p>
<p>It is a shame that we do such a thorough job of traumatizing students in high school and college algebra courses.  Calculus is really a beautiful thing if you stand back and look at it on the big picture.  It is really too bad that most students don't want to go near another math course after finishing college algebra.  And it is unfortunately that so many students who do enroll in calc get so focused on the notation and memorizing proofs that they never get to step back and enjoy the beauty of mathematics at the calculus level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything I could tell you in three lines or less won't really give you the essence, which is why most colleges offer Calc 1, Calc 2, Calc 3, vector Calc, multivariable Calc, etc. Anything trying to sum all that up in a brief English language description will not convey much real understanding... but I'll try to give you the best nutshell version I can.</p>
<p>It starts with mathematics of infinites and infinitesimals; methods of working with infinitely big and infinitely small quantities.</p>
<p>With these methods we can exactly calculate derivatives and integrals. An integral is an accumulation of a quantity: a sum of all the values of a quantity as it changes with respect to some other quantity. A derivative is how fast a quantity is changing for each change in another quantity. Clear as mud?</p>
<p>A simple example: in physics, the independent variable is often the quantity of time. When you're in a moving car, your car's position changes with time, and the rate of change in your position is called velocity. If you step on the gas, your velocity will increase, and this change in velocity is called acceleration.</p>
<p>The derivative (with respect to time) of position is velocity, and the derivative (with respect to time) of velocity is acceleration. Velocity is how fast your position is changing over time. Acceleration is how fast your velocity is changing over time.  So if you have a device that records your position at every point in time during your trip, you can use calculus to easily figure out what your velocity and/or acceleration was at any point in time.</p>
<p>The integral (with respect to time) of acceleration is velocity, and the integral (with respect to time) of velocity is position. So if you have a device that records your acceleration at every point in time during a trip in your car, with calculus you can also figure out your velocity at any point in time, and how far you have travelled at any point in time, using only the acceleration data. </p>
<p>Along with trigonometry, these are some of the most useful tools in mathematics. It's where math gets really cool. Learning algebra is like studying grammar -- it can be tedious, but it gives you the foundation you need to appreciate poetry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Excellent analogy. I was not a fan of math at all until I learned calculus and it clicked with me. It was then that I realized the purpose of all of that other math I had been taught in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this wonderful post, and I humbly suggest streamlining it even further for laypeople like me to just:</p>
<p>Calculus is about <strong>derivatives</strong> (given a before-and-after situation, what changes got us there?) and <strong>integrals</strong> (given a bunch of changes, what was the situation before-and-after?)</p>
<p>The <strong>derivative</strong> of position is velocity, and the derivative of velocity is acceleration. Velocity is how fast your position is changing over time. Acceleration is how fast your velocity is changing over time. So if you have a device that records your position at every point in time during your trip, you can use calculus to easily figure out what your velocity and/or acceleration was at any point in time.</p>

<p>Further to this: algebra is an abstraction layer. It's a way of encoding many relations into a simpler statement. For example, you might notice this pattern:</p>
<pre><code>3 * 3 + 3 + 4 = 4 * 4
4 * 4 + 4 + 5 = 5 * 5
5 * 5 + 5 + 6 = 6 * 6
6 * 6 + 6 + 7 = 7 * 7</code></pre>
<p>and conjecture that it probably keeps working forever; this information can all be wrapped up in one statement:</p>
<pre><code>x * x + x + (x+1) = (x+1) * (x+1)</code></pre>
<p>and if you play around with this then you can find a simpler form -- which may well not have been obvious just looking at the original list of equations --</p>
<pre><code>x^2 + 2x + 1 = (x+1)^2</code></pre>
<p>One of the benefits of an abstraction layer is that you can manipulate the abstraction and then translate it back to a concrete result. </p>
<p>This is pretty similar to using an API or a programming language, instead of directly manipulating the underlying primitives, e.g. using C instead of assembly; or using Python instead of C.</p>
<p>The body of work of mathematics consists of many such abstraction layers, algebra is one of the earlier layers that get built on by further abstractions, with the end result that we can express what are extremely complicated ideas with just a few symbols (e.g. the Einstein field equation for general relativity).</p></div>		</li>
