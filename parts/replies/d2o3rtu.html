			<div class="markdown"><p>As a phlebotomist, butterfly needles are the most amazing invention. They give a flash and have a little extra maneuverability with the extra tubing. I mainly use them for pediatric draws and older patients with difficult to find veins. I would never fish with a straight stick or attempt a draw on a vein I couldn't feel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On our floor, the phlebotomists are given a limited number of butterflies per night. In our med room, we have a very healthy supply regularly. So I've made a habit of giving our phlebotomists a handful of them when they come draw for my patients or just for any time they are on the floor. That way, when I ask them to draw an extra tube or do me a favor, they're much more inclined to do so without any attitude. I'm basically bribing my coworkers with our own supplies. It's a win-win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh. I understand that they're more expensive than plain needles, but I wish more places would trust phlebotomists' judgment on whether they need a butterfly or not. Especially in hospitals there are a LOT of hard sticks. </p></div>		</li>

<p>As someone with little veins, who is always cold, and gets regular blood work, I agree! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked somewhere where we had to draw blood from veins in rabbit ears, which are very narrow and shallow. Options were straight needle or butterfly. The butterfly needle was like magic. You almost always got right into the vein with it, without going through. Not sure why it wasn't a standard for that procedure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be able to explain what happened during my first blood donation. It took quite a while to finish and when it did my arm was a bit sore...couple of hours later the elbow was really swollen and it stayed like that for weeks. Red Cross were fantastic with checking in on me and really look after me when I donate now but were never clear about what happened?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to tell, but from your description, something other than the vein wall was punctured during the procedure. Maybe they hit a valve? I always look for valves before starting an IV, so I can avoid them, but not all valves are visible or palpable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Phlebotomy like they do in the lab with a straight needle is a little different. With a straight stick, there is no visible flash</p>

<p>Where do you work? Because every single needle I've seen for blood draws still has a small flash (albeit smaller than an angio).</p>
<p>But this is a great answer. Most people do not realize that the needle does not stay in your arm and that the part that stays in is quite flexible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I make a point to tell all patients that &quot;the needle is out now, there's just a little tube of soft plastic there now.&quot; About half of patients are like, &quot;yeah I know,&quot; but half are like, &quot;ohhhh really no one ever told me that!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I carry several different types of needles, but the straight stick needles are old-school BD/Vacutainer needles with no flash. My company supplies these because, of course, they're the cheapest. I have heard that BD has released new needles with a flash chamber, but I have not yet seen them. I only use butterflies when the patient's veins are so small or crooked, that nothing else will work. I have found that butterflies clot rather frequently, due to their tiny gauge, so I only use them as a last resort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crazy. Even lab carries the Vacutainers that give a small flash back where I've been. It's not much, but it something. The IV Access teams are the ones that amaze me though. Like, how did you get a 20 in the forearm when I couldnt find a 22 in the AC? Or even a 24 in the hand! Wizards. </p></div>		</li>
