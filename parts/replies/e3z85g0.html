			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a metal teapot for making a large batch of tea at once for when I really want to drink a lot of tea. There's also this thing I have where you put the tea on top of it, and you put a candle in a holder inside of it, and light the candle to keep the tea in the pot warm. You'd be surprised just how effective a small candle like that is at keeping the tea warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re exposing your finger to the fire for an extremely brief amount of time, which means it doesn’t have enough time to impart a lot of thermal energy.<br />
Similarly, if you expose your finger to something that isn’t very hot for a longer time, you also don’t get burned.<br />
It all comes down to multiplication.<br />
Getting burned can be thought of as <em>exposure</em> X <em>temperature.</em> If either variable is very small, the actual amount of energy being imparted comes out very small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more to it than the other answer.</p>
<p>5 seconds of exposure to 1kg of 88 degree air will cause nothing more than discomfort.</p>
<p>5 seconds of exposure to 1kg of 88 degree water will cause at least second degree burns. Likely third degree.</p>
<hr />
<p>Rapid energy transfer occurs when you touch a significant mass of concentrated, high temperature material. </p>
<p>Boiling water, or molten lava, are particularly bad as they are hot, liquid (which allows them to remain dense, unlike gas or plasma, but have a higher contact surface than solids), and have a high specific heat capacity.</p>
<p>TL:DR - sticking your hand in lava is worse than sticking it in a candle flame even though the flame is lower temperature, because the lava is better at transferring heat to you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make this a little more &quot;LI5&quot;-ish, imagine you took a huge ball of steel the size of a bowling ball, and heated it to a few thousand degrees. Anything it touches is gonna start melting or burning, and if <em>you</em> touched it, its bye-bye skin.</p>
<p>Now, imagine you took a very teeny tiny piece of steel, smaller than a grain of sand, and heated it to the exact same temperature. If you drop it on the floor or even put it in your hand, its just gonna cool down almost instantly, and do basically no damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tiny drops of steel are noticeable, but barely hurt.<br />
Somewhere in between those sizes, it hurts a lot at first and smells like bacon, but heals quickly due to the superficiality of the burn.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.</p>
<p>I did a summer job years back, working a machine that reamed out and faced the tubular part of bicycle headsets after the bare metal piece had been brazed. It was hot work in hot weather, so although I wore protective gauntlets I worked in short sleeves. Every now and again, a piece of hot metal swarf would kick out and clip my arm. Mostly I'd barely notice - just a quick sting at most in passing, and no visible damage.</p>
<p>Except - just one time, a piece a bit bigger than the rest not only hit me flat side first but stuck until I reacted and brushed it off. It was painful for some days, and left me with a raised triangular &quot;brand&quot; on my upper arm that took about a decade to disappear.</p></div>		</li>
