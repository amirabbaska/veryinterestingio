			<div class="markdown"><p>You build a house of cards. You used blue cards but now you want the house to be red cards. You can either replace the cards one by one or knock the house down and build it up from scratch. Which one you choose depends on how many cards you're replacing and whether or not you value the existing card house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That analogy almost always favors knocking it down though, as there are few card houses that can stand when you remove one of the base cards from it.  So the decision you present at the end isnâ€™t really a decision at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just take his sentence of &quot;sometimes you'd just be reloading the entire thing anyways&quot; and ignore the rest. It's often easier (and less likely to crash) to restart the game with the new settings than to change them in game. It all depends on how the developers designed their graphics.</p>
<p>Also I'll say it again, this sub isn't designed for answers aimed at literal 5 year olds, read the rules. It's just meant to have answers without any technical jargon. </p></div>		</li>
