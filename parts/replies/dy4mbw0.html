			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult, because &quot;to illustrate&quot; involves a 2D screen or piece of paper.  </p>
<p>But assume that we could have a full 3D holographic display where we could then deform (for perspective) and add shadows (for light sources in the 4th dimension), it wouldn't look like much we'd recognize, because perspective and shadows are tricks to make the 2D image appear 3D, not tricks to make a 3D object appear 2D.</p>
<p>We need the opposite of &quot;illustrate&quot;, a way to make a 4D object appear 3D.</p>
<p>Look at a cube, it has exactly SQUARE faces.  Draw a cube with perspective and shadow, and NONE of the 4-sided shapes you're drawing (to represent the faces of that cube) is actually a square.</p>
<p>You have to be able to look at that tesseract, including those sides that look like semi-pyramids, and get the gut feeling of &quot;cube&quot; not pyramid when you look at it.</p>
<p>EDIT:  We actually do have 4D objects in the universe, everything is actually 4D.  A 1-meter cube that exists for 3.34 nanoseconds is in fact a tesseract (with its 4th dimension &quot;side&quot; being ct = 1).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While time can be used as a 4th dimension, it I prefer to imagine a spatial dimension that just happens to be perpendicular to 3D space. For one thing, tesseracts have all equal size and it's hard to compare time and distance. <em>Flatland</em> illustrates the ideas pretty well, despite being published in the late 1800s and having some weird world building thrown in.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I mean is a fourth dimensional  space in one dimensional time.</p>
<p>Flatland is one of the things that led me to this question. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time doesn't work the same way as the other dimensions though. </p>
<p>In euclidian (&quot;normal&quot;) space, you compute distances by taking the root of the sum of the squares, ie Pythagoras' Theorem. Thus r² = x² + y² + z². But in Minkowski Space, the geometry of special relativity, only the time component is positive, while the spatial ones get a minus! s² = c²t² - x²- y² - z². So I don't think it makes sense to speak of hypercubes in this geometry at all, those make sense in euclidean space only.</p></div>		</li>
