			<div class="markdown"><p>I also suffer from chronic intractable migraine.  It's basically a headache every day, all day, with the only difference is the severity.    I've told my neurologist that I'd try ANYTHING to have long lasting relief.   Have been on at least a dozen different meds that didn't work....my only choice right now is to track the severity and use a 'rescue medicine'  (or as I call it the &quot;holy shit&quot; meds).  This stuff only works if I catch the increase in pain early.   Meaning, it's a crap shoot.</p>
<p>But I digress,  no idea what really causes migraines and they are wildly different in everyone.   Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel you! First time I ever had one I was at school, imagine my surprise when I woke up in a hospital bed the next day and wasn’t even sure who my Mum was. </p>
<p>Turns out I’d punched an paramedic in the ambulance, kick a nurse numerous times for trying to take my temperature and I have never felt so drained in all my life. </p>
<p>I managed to apologise to the nurse because she was on shift the next time I came round and was myself but I never got a chance to apologise to the paramedics, still feel horrible when I think back to that. </p>
<p>Now if can catch them early enough I just take pills and water and make it through the day, otherwise I’m off to bed for 24 hours and truly a horrible bastard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I ended up in the ER with my first couple migraines, because otherwise I would have killed myself.   Honestly.  </p>
<p>Now I measure days with &quot;what level is my pain today?&quot;</p>
<p>Anything between a 2 and a 6, I'm going along my usual routine.  Anything above 6, don't talk to me.  Anything BELOW a 2 is a fricking miracle.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had chronic migraine pain for years, probably started around 17. Continued till about a 28. Not entirely sure  why it just ended but I went from &quot; 12/10 pain, holy shit I need to go to the ER for this blackout pain&quot; to barely noticeable. I'm 30 now, I can relate to this pretty heavily and I can only hope it ends this way for others as well. My go to thing was a pitch black bathroom, full tub (sometimes cool water or warm). Cold compress for my eyes, anti inflamatary and a quiet, scentless, dark room.</p>
<p>I tried many types of meds, chiropractic to dryneedle/acupuncture. Dead silence and dsrkness always helped more so , terrible way to live but it got me through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never had mushrooms.   My state (PA) is slowly legalizing medical marijuana, but will only allow CBD products, nothing containing THC.  I haven't tried the CBD products yet, but that's on the list of things I might look into.    I know, from personal experience, that THC/CBD does help a lot!  Smoking pot is a wonderful cure, and I don't need that much, so I'm not getting high, just feeling relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have chronic weekly migraines with auras about 2 hours premigraine. Sometimes I'd lose feeling on one side of my extremities thinking it was a stroke... Oh and this all began when I was thirteen. I began to use a lot of MDMA and psychedelics around 17 years old, to the point where I have permanent memory problems and stuff from daily drug abuse, but hey no more migraines. I'm not advocating drug use, I'm just telling you what worked for me</p></div>		</li>
