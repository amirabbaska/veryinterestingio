<p>10^11 T (upper range according to Wikipedia) corresponds to a density of 4*10^10 kg/m^(3). That sounds like a lot, but it is tiny compared to the density of a neutron star (~10^18 kg/m^(3)).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general relativity, both matter and energy distort space and cause gravity, as described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations" target="_blank">Einstein Field Equations</a>. This distortion is determined by the Stress-Energy tensor, which accounts for the collection (or <em>density</em>) of mass or energy in area, as well as how they move about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my layman's interpretation of the thread the answer is &quot;Yes but the equations that dictate the curvature of spacetime and mass/energy equivalence dictate that the mass of stars has a much greater effect than the negligible effect of observable electro/magnetic fields&quot;. Is that a fair summary?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, does this mean that a sufficiently powerful magnet would actually create a gravity well?</p>
<p>If so, how would the gravitational field and electromagnetic field interact, and how would it affect nearby objects?</p></div>		</li>
