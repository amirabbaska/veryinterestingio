			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the spirit of the question is more, &quot;are there consistent physical diffrrences between intelligent and nonintelligent people?&quot; So, like, could we sppliment neurotransmitter X and consistently raise a person's IQ, or is intelligence more complicated than that, and some smart people are high on X, others are low on X but high on Y, others lack both X and Y but have a structure that looks like Z, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All cognitive phenomena are the result of <em>something</em> in the brain--chemical, structural, whatever, but it can't exist if it's not physically explainable.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is still a big debate about this in the philosophical community, feeling the void that the physical sciences have not yet been able to fill. The debate has roughly three sides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dualists believe the mind is altogether different from the body, made of a different substance (mind stuff if you will). Many religious people, and famously Descartes, fall into this camp. A large problem with this view is that even though mind and body are made of different substances, they still seem to interact, i.e. your mind is still able to control your body.</li>
<li>Monists (or materialists) believe there is only one substance, and that our minds must therefore be made of the same physical matter that makes up our bodies. Most (physical) scientists fall into this camp. Materialism is often criticized as not providing a good mechanism for mind arising out of matter, crediting the relatively vague mechanism of <em>emergence:</em> complexity arising from simplicity.</li>
<li>Panpsychists are an altogether different breed. In order to not have to credit emergence with the creation of the mind, they believe that any tiny bit of matter is on some level conscious, and thus has a mind. They now have the problem though that they realize not every pile of matter is conscious, so it must be arranged in a certain way. The problem of what a good arrangement is is called <em>the combination problem</em>. In my eyes, panpsychists simply decided to not want emergence, and now have the problem of needing emergence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Monism or materialism is the most commonly held view in the scientific community. Ergo, most scientists will assume any process will have a physical manifestation, so too will be the processes in the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the reason scientists &quot;assume&quot; monism is that we have literally no reason to believe in the existence of anything else.</p>
<p>We've observed physical stuff. We have a basis to start thinking that stuff exists and causes things.</p>
<p>Anything beyond that is utterly baseless. You may as well claim magic is in there too. I kinda struggle to identify any difference between magic and non-physical forces or causes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These all assume there is a relation between cognition and cognitive ability. The question is asking about physical phenomenon in a specific organ related to cognition only. This is something that can be measured. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy that whenever I discuss this subject with someone  who <em>believes</em> in something about it, the burden of proof appears to always fall on science to prove that there <em>isn't something else</em>. <em>&quot;You never know&quot;</em>. No observation, no hypothesis, no test. It's like some people reverse the scientific method. Obviously we still don't know much about how the brain works, but that's a reason to work more on the subject, not an opening to cram whatever feeling/belief you have and raise it above all what is already known up to now.</p>
<p>/rant over. Sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These people need to be introduced to Popper's scientific principles. If a theory or concept can't be tested, it's not scientific and thus worthless from an epistemological point of view, e.g. I can maintain there is an immaterial, invisible garden gnome always right behind me, but because this can in no way be proven/disproven, it's a worthless statement with no bearing on consensus reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I’m right, most scientists/engineers go by the </p>
<p>“If it’s not measurable (as a inherent property; not because we don’t have the tools) then it doesn’t exist or it doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>point of view.</p>
