			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure about the L1 terminology?  For instance, my kids grew up speaking English and Japanese. However, their exposure to English has been limited to speaking with their dad, and a few weeks in the states every year.  They are for the most part fluent in English, but their grammar would never pass as &quot;native&quot;, and they struggle with vocabulary.  They certainly learned English at the same time as Japanese, but I would be reluctant to say they are L1 speakers of English.....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no official terminology, and many cases of inbetweeners. L1 is used because people get hung up on the definition of ‘native speaker’. In your child’s case, they may not have had enough exposure to be called ‘native’, but they will definitely display certain characterisics when speaking, which L2 speakers of English won’t. For example, I imagine their pronunciation is just fine.</p></div>		</li>
