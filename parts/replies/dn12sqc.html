<p>There's a lot of botched injection attempts and needing more and more doses to put people out who are naturally resistant to the injection. There's been people who have survived the initial injection for hours in excruciating pain.</p>

<p>This is important. First a drug must be administered to knock the person out, and another must be given to paralyse the muscles. If not enough of these drugs are given or something goes wrong, the third drug which is potassium chloride will make the person feel like they are literally burning alive from the inside throughout their ENTIRE body. Imagine like a salt burn on a wound, except the wound is the entire basolateral membrane of all of your blood vessels and capillaries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, I oppose the death penalty, primarily on the grounds that it brutalizes the groups and individuals who must do the killing. BUT if you're going to do it and you want a minimum of suffering and gore, why not use carbon monoxide? No struggle, no air hunger, no gasping - just gradually falling asleep while turning a nice pink color.</p></div>		</li>
