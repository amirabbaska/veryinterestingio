			<div class="markdown"><p>So to make sure I'm taking home from this the intended message, since this is indeed a wonderful scenario, the following are equivalences:</p>
<p>Cards = Stocks</p>
<p>Card Sellers = Stock Broker</p>
<p>Playground = Stock Market</p>
<p>Lemonade Stand = Employment/Rates</p>
<p>Promises/Up-Front Quarters = Housing Loans &lt;------ Here is where things get sticky for me...</p>
<p>Realization of Too Many Promises = Market Crash of '08-'09</p>
<p>Teachers = Government</p>
<p>Lunch Prices = Taxes </p>
<p>Free Quarters for Lemonade = Bailouts</p>
<p>Popular Kids = Banks and &quot;Too-Big-to-Fails&quot;</p>
<p>Buying of Cards Instead = CEO's and Such Getting Paid Big</p>
<p>I know this doesn't flow perfectly, and I know that every analogy is designed to get the big idea across so the minutia makes more sense/falls into place more readily, but I feel like I'm missing something here. </p>
<p>Lovely analogy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct! Except for Promises/Up-Front Quarters would bucket almost all bad debt that was going around at the time.  At the core of the debt problem in 2007/2008, it was the housing back securities (think Bonds, CDs, etc etc) that exasperated the problem and led to say companies and people feeling rich with money they didn't have that was backed up by bad housing loans. This in turn drove them to be more readily to lend out more dangerous (everyone was fake rich remember) business loans, auto loans, re-modeling home loans, credit card loans, etc etc which led to the huge crash when the housing loan world collapse.  This is what makes that crash unique in that there was so much bad debt in all sectors.  Everything just fell down like a house of cards in the financial markets.  </p>
<p>What makes this even more scarier is the fact that another one is coming in a few years b/c we never fixed the problem.  We've only put a blanket over the problem by pumping &quot;helicopter money&quot; to the big banks which in turn artificially drove back up the stock market while the economy is in shitters. </p>
<p>Don't believe me?  If you ever watch the Fed Statements and how they're constantly bullsh*tting about inflation not being where they want to be it, ask your self this.  Has a piece of ham, groceries, housing, clothes, etc etc costed more now than it did 10 years ago?  Do I truly have the same buying power I did 10 years ago with the same amount of money?  The fed as well as the financial markets are trying to buy time while they figure out a permanent fix.  Will they?  I'm sure they will like they always have we're not set for doom but at the same time, things are not as lovely and beautiful as the all time high stock market mirage makes life out to be.</p></div>		</li>
