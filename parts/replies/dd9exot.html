			<div class="markdown"><p>I would easily recognize Hitler from a picture, but if he shaved the moustache, probably not. His face does not appear in my head though. Any music in my head is just my own internal voice humming a tune. As for how it has affected me, the biggest impact is on my autobiographical memory. I know facts about my life, but if you read a book about me, you'd know more about me than I do about myself.  Check out the article on aphantasia by Blake Ross.</p>

<p>Aphantasia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wiki says this specifically deals with an inability to visualize, something I share as well (TIL there is a word for my condition). But this doesn't seem to cover any of the other senses. Personally, I have excellent ability to recall and manipulate sounds in my head despite my inability to recall or create even the vaguest of visualizations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The condition is currently newly identified, not a ton of study out there. Many people with aphantasia, though not all, report that this is the case with all their senses. It is in my case. Check out the article by Blake Ross on the subject, it's a great piece about his discovery and the condition. How's your memory by the way? Do you remember your childhood with the same clarity your friends do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So many people say this to me, but I didn't even know people saw ACTUAL PICTURES in their heads until well into adulthood. Now that I know, it kinda feels like everyone else has a superpower that I don't. On the other hand, my life has been pretty good.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I said imagine a blue square drawn on a white piece of paper. What is your thought process? I can't imagine thinking about a blue square drawn on a white piece of paper without visualizing it. </p>
<p>Can you recall what a piece of paper looks like? How do you do that without visualizing it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure I can recognize songs, but what about sounds? Sounds are a completely different thing to discern. Can you tell what is tapping on what without seeing it? It could be a pen tapping on a metal railing or a plastic spoon tapping on a copper doorknob.</p>
<p>People need to know music and sounds are treated as wholly different animals.</p>
<p>TO OP:
I can understand why you have a harder time on remembering taste because your vision and hearing intake more information therefore you practice using them more so than your taste sense, you don't eat everything in sight after all, it's not like you see a car or a lamp and you're going to lick it to remember what it tastes like.</p>
<p>Also for smell we're in a society where we don't go around sniffing everything in sight as that is considered uncivil and strange, if u look at dogs though they don't hesitate to smell everything so they collect information better with their nose than we do as they have more practice and aren't held back on it with social conditioning.</p>
<p>When we were kids we probably used are sense of smell more often though, for example I know this is weird but I liked smelling a fresh new book I got and liked that smell. That's just an example of how we cared more about smells when we were kids. I would say many people could still remember certain smells of their childhood as well because we practiced smelling more back then and as children we were not judged as much.</p></div>		</li>
