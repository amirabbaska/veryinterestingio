			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Most competitive eaters say they don't really get to enjoy their food. They still taste it of course so challenges with food they don't like are harder and foods they do like are better but it's gone so quick snd they're distracted focusing on their technique (not choking) that taste is a bit of a non factor.</p>
<p>It's a bit different when someone like Matt does one of these &quot;all about quantity&quot; challenges. In that case they're usually forced to slow down quite a bit at some point and the taste overwhelms them, potentially being the hardest part of the challenge - it gets really boring eating 4 litres of the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About the purging speculation; I understand it's not uncommon for the 'training diets' to be large quantities of low calorie food.  Like, fill up on cauliflower and celery, without butter or cheese.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I alluded to that. Not sure how it pertains to purging though - purging is making yourself sick, usually by sticking fingers down your throat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about regular people? The disparity can be quite mysterious. I'm 6'2, 260ish pounds. Yesterday, I had not eaten all day and I went to Zaxby's famished. I ordered a &quot;Wings and Things&quot; meal and I barely ate half of it. </p>
<p>My cousin is pretty much my exact build. 6'2, 260ish as well. He can and pretty much always does out eat me by double or even sometimes triple. We went to Popeye's the other day. I ordered a shrimp poboy combo. He ordered a chicken poboy combo with an extra poboy. Last time we went to Taco Bell, I ordered a grilled stuffed burrito combo with steak (And I won't even eat it all). He thought that sounded good, and ordered two of the same combo. At Huddle House (like a Waffle house) I can struggle to eat a steak and cheese omlet and hashbrowns, while he can eat the country fried steak, all the sides, a sundae, and then order another country fried steak entree to go. </p>
<p>It blows my mind. He may not eat it all in one exact sitting, but he won't let the leftovers sit more than an hour. There is a difference in our activity level (he works at a cabinet factory on his feet and walking all day, I am an unemployed full time student not doing a lot at the moment). That is pretty much the only thing I can think of. If I ate like he does, I'd be 400lbs, and if he ate like me, he'd probably go  from husky to malnourished looking. It has to be partly genetic and partly his increased activity level has his metabolism higher, therefore he has to eat a lot more to stay the same size as me. </p>
<p>It's slightly aggravating cause I'm the one with a little higher BF% and he's the one with a little bit more lean mass lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I eat bigger meals less frequently. I can definitely finish a wings n things myself. It just about yiur eating habits. The more regularly you eat more the more you can eat.</p></div>		</li>
