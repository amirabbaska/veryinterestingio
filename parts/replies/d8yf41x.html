<p>EVERY ONE of those polygonal bricks of high explosive must ignite at EXACTLY the same instant for a successful nuclear detonation. One of the most difficult items to collect-- <em>at least</em> as difficult to obtain as the uranium or plutonium itself-- is the detonator required to precisely fire these explosive polygons. There is no other reason to have one of these than to cause a fission explosion.</p>
<p>The explosions of the polygons drives the blast wave inward, compressing the nuclear material (plutonium in this case) into a supercritical mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The history of the shaped charge detonation trigger is interesting. Apparently it came out of experiments to photograph the shaped charge. The scientists involved were from MIT, and became EG&amp;G, working on nuclear detonators for a long time. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of non-nuclear reasons why you'd want an exploding bridgewire detonator - they have a very high firing current, and are pretty insensitive to stray currents or static shock.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't true. It was fairly easy to make a detonator for these weapons. It was not even remotely close to being as difficult as obtaining the uranium itself. </p>

<p><em>Over 90% of the cost was for building plants and producing the fissionable materials, and less than 10% for development and production of the weapons.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fascinating. Thanks for writing that up. Do you know why it's so difficult for other countries to develop this technology? Is it the materials needed or the explosions timing precision or something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do.  But rather than write it up, I'll let the soothing voice of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcgKDSwINOA" target="_blank">Bill Hammack: The Engineer Guy</a> say it for me (and say it better).</p>
<p>There is technical difficulty in precision machining and timing of the bomb and its conventional explosives.  But with enough money, and with modern technology, that is a fairly surmountable obstacle - see North Korea.</p>
<p>But the greater difficulty is in the logistics and precision involved in <em>enriching</em> the Uranium necessary for a bomb.  The precision needed on centrifuges is arguably greater than that involved in the bomb itself.  And no matter what, it will be massively energy-intensive, and massively expensive.  You need a very wealthy government with a lot of money and people to throw at the project.</p>
<p>I'll let Bill say the rest. It's an excellent video.</p>
<p>Side Note: Enriched Uranium can be used to make a Uranium-Bullet bomb like Little Boy, which is <em>much</em> easier to make.  The type of bomb I described above is a Plutonium bomb (Fat Man), but making plutonium is typically a hell of a lot more difficult than enriching Uranium (You need active nuclear reactors). So anyone looking to simply have <em>any sort of nuclear bomb</em> will likely go after Uranium.  The necessary precision of the type of bomb that implodes a plutonium core (maybe a uranium core works as well? I'm not sure) is part of what makes it so much safer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is however discounting another, easier design of bomb: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun-type_fission_weapon" target="_blank">the gun type</a>. While significantly less efficient than implosion bombs, gun types were a lot easier to make and kept the supercritical mass together by essentially ramming a tube of fissile material onto a spike of fissile material. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. In the Manhattan project, they made one gun-type uranium bomb (&quot;Little Boy&quot;, dropped on Hiroshima) and three shaped-charge plutonium bombs (&quot;Trinity,&quot; used for testing, &quot;Fat Man,&quot; dropped on Nagasaki, and another bomb that was never named or detonated.)</p></div>		</li>
