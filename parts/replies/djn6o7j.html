<p>Back in the days when the lead detective had nothing but a magnifying glass and maybe the ability to dust for fingerprints and flip through huge binders in his local fingerprint database, it was hard times for law enforcement. I can't believe they ever caught anyone back in those days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, the thing that scares me more is how many of those people they caught may very well have been innocent. DNA has been vital in overturning the convictions of many innocent people. Without that... ah, once you'd be convicted, you'd practically have no way of getting out again.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably happened way too often. And the idea that innocent people can get locked in jail makes me hope that people ease up on all the &quot;I hope so-and-so gets sent to prison and raped every day.&quot; That's not the kind of prison I want my society to have, even if just for that 1 person in a million that is sent there by mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DNA isn't that easy to get rid of. It's really, really hard to get rid of all the DNA you shed from your skin, hair, eyelashes, semen if the serial killer rapes them, under their fingernails as they struggle.</p>
<p>Furthermore they don't really need <em>YOUR</em> DNA in their database. Some 10% of Americans are felons, and most Americans will be arrested at least once in their lives. So the FBI has a DNA database of a good proportion of the American population. If one of those is the serial killer's cousin or brother or parent or 2nd cousin that will match as related to the unknown serial killer and the FBI can go in and start looking at that person's relatives. They've caught several killers that way - someone's 2nd cousin gets flagged as related and then they just follow around everyone in that person's family until they spit or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MOST Americans? I don't know of anyone among my friends or family with a criminal record!</p>
<p>...although come to think of it, my cousin did serve a night in jail for domestic assault (hit his then-wife when she told him she was cheating on him, after draining their shared account. They both made poor choices).</p>
<p>Never mind. Carry on.</p></div>		</li>
