			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, the distribution of weight across the remaining healthy legs can cause laminitis, a condition where the foot bone presses on and eventually pierces the hoof causing severe pain and preventing the horse putting weight on that foot. Barbaro, a famous racehorse, shattered his hind leg but was put down months later after extensive care due to laminitis in all three remaining legs. The break had almost healed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not entirely that either! (Vet student here) It's also partially due to the fact that they would develop serious problems in their other legs from keeping their weight off the injured leg for as long as it would take to heal. Horses are basically standing on the tips of their middle fingers and having such a tiny point for 1200lbs of weight causes a lot of other soundness/health issues. If you have the money you can theoretically have them in a sling for the healing process but they'll most likely end up as pasture ponies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In 200 years we'll have horse hospitals in space... but for now why can't we just chuck a waterproof suite on them and stick 'em in a big tank of water? Hey if you're going to spend a $1,000,000 on a horse it's worth a shot. (please msg me if you develop this idea vet student).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothermia I think. The cost of that. I'm sure there's a whole list of reasons why it wouldn't work mixed with the costs of researching on how to make it work that isn't worth it when there is a surplus of horses in the world. Any horse can end up a 50k dollar horse with good breeding and training. The problem is good horses are hard to find due to selective breeding (look up any breed of halter horse and you'll see what I mean) and &quot;trainers&quot; starting nicely built colts and ruining them. </p></div>		</li>
