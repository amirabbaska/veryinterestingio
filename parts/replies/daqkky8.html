<p>What about the lunar-lander-esque T4 virus? It does something, doesn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting structure, but all the same protein with a double strand DNA inside.</p>
<p>So the long legs on the lander virus get stuck onto long chains of sugar molecules (lipopolysaccharide) and tube like proteins found on the cell (E. coli) membrane.</p>
<p>This sends a signal (which means the leg membranes reconfigure itself and affects whatever it's attached on the virus, but no so much that it becomes useless) that starts to unravel the little legs to bind onto the membrane completely, and the base plate starts to contract the long tube letting the inner tube puncture the membrane, like a needle. </p>
<p>So the lander virus does do something, but when it attaches onto a cell. During it's free floating time in liquid space, the DNA inside it isn't being copied, no ATP is being produced or used. It does nothing compared to what cells do metabolically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It hasn't been pinpointed from where viruses come from, since they're so small no fossils are left, and their DNA is constantly being mixed with their hosts making it hard to track them. </p>
<p>I think it's pretty unlikely that a bacteria pushed to only reproduce would become a virus, since bacteria are already very good at reproducing. And when there is no nutrients, they shrivel up into spores to wait it out.</p>
<p>It's possible that they are as ancient as the first cell itself, since some viruses can have RNA, a molecule much simpler than DNA, and a proteic cover, and found it much easier to infect cells instead of finding random ways to have their RNA read. </p>
<p>Another possibility is that they came to be from proteic diseases, like prions (only a protein capsule, no genetic material). Only problem is that prions don't multiply from a genetic code, instead they deform other proteins around them into more prions. </p>
<p>Plasmids are another way viruses could have been created. Plasmids are usually circular strands of DNA that can be moved between cells, and sometimes be integrated into the main strand of DNA. They're usually found in bacteria and plant cells. </p>
<p>But yeah, it's just like the question of where the first cell came from. Lots of different theories, but nothing conclusive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That brings up prions. What the heck are prions? Are they the biological equivalent of radiation or something i.e. they mutate what they touch? Are they even farther from life than viruses, since viruses at least have genetic material but prions are just proteins.</p></div>		</li>
