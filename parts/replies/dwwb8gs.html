			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on this answer, regarding how it works it's a bit more complex but to put it on simple terms there are several techniques which have the goal of either taking the values that the pixels would have in the image if it was in a greater resolution and combining them, or blurring the actual pixels in the edges.</p>
<p>You may find terms such as SSAA, MSAA, FXAA and more, these are some of the techniques mentioned and they try to do one or the other through different methods with different advantages and disadvantages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In rough terms the first approach, increasing the sample rate, is more expensive because you're rendering an image in a bigger resolution then converting it back to your resolution. Between these techniques you will find differences in what parts of the image need to be rendered in this higher resolution and downscaled back to your resolution, so ones are more resource intensive than others but they're all both more expensive and generally give you a higher quality result.</p>
<p>The other approach is graphically cheaper and is normally what you use with lower end hardware. You work with the image as is, blurring the edges but this usually leaves a lower quality anti-aliasing, because it can leave more than just the edges blurred.</p>
<p>So in even simpler terms, and to tag the techniques I mentioned, from higher-quality/more intensive to lower-quality/less intensive: SSAA, MSAA and FXAA. The first two follow the first approach, increasing sample rate, and the later the second approach, blurring the edges. There are many more techniques that I didn't mention, but I'm not that familiar in the specifics.</p></div>		</li>
