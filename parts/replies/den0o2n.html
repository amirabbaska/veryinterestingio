			<div class="markdown"><p>As an ex psychologist, I can say that the answer is no. Usually. </p>
<p>Your inner monologue remains largely static through your life.</p>
<p>When you're a child your inner monologue doesn't &quot;sound&quot; like a child, it doesn't sound like anything, it's just a stream of thoughts.</p>
<p>If you try to picture it from memory, ie. what was going through your head when a particular event happened, you &quot;hear&quot; your inner monologue in the voice you associate with said internal monologue.</p>
<p>The thing is, what you perceive your voice sounding like and what it sounds like to other people is usually relatively different. Your perception of your own voice doesn't change in line with physical changes to your body, including aging. Ie. elderly people don't &quot;hear&quot; their internal monologue as coming from an elderly person. You generally complete your view of yourself as a person in early adulthood, and retain that self view for most of your life. Hence why elderly people often feel like changes to their person happen &quot;out of the blue&quot;. The changes don't happen like that, but once you notice them, you can't un-notice them.</p>
<p>It's all about physical aging versus mental aging. People generally don't age mentally beyond their early forties, but they do age physically beyond that. </p>
<p>As a result, many elderly people's self image is somewhere in their 40s if you ask them to picture themselves, while they may be well into their 70s or 80s. </p>
<p>People reach a point where their image of themselves lags behind what they see when they look in a mirror. They're fully aware that they're elderly, but their image of themselves doesn't match up. Inside they're a person in their 40s, but externally, they're an elderly person. The point at which people reach full mental maturity varies from person to person, and it can be anywhere in a range from the early 20s to the late 60s, but everyone reaches that point beyond which their self image ceases to change, and that is how they picture themselves on a sub conscious level forever. </p>
<p>Including their internal monologue.</p>
<p>If that thought scares you, I wish I could tell you how to make it not scare you, because it scares the hell out of me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before I was DXed with a bunch of autoimmune stuff, nobody knew what was wrong so I was suspected of being a hypochondriac and a psychological evaluation was recommended.  Eager to start feeling better,  I agreed. </p>
<p>When 29 year - old - me,  exhausted, and slightly overweight,  told examiner that I was sometimes surprised at myself in the mirror  looking like hell, (I said my default view of myself still as young and gorgeous), she told me I was delusional. Oh,  <em>and</em> a hypochondriac since &quot;there was no evidence of somatic disorder despite repeated testing by multiple doctors. &quot; </p>
<p>Nice to know that not only was I gravely ill but being told I was crazy, I was also completely normal in the delayed adjustment of my evolving self-image. Fuck me running.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is literally nothing unusual about the sensation you described; feeling unease that your physical appearance doesn't match your internal self image. It's incredibly common and not indicative of any underlying mental condition. It's just a normal sensation people get. Why this was taken as evidence of an underlying disorder with no other factors is beyond me. It's like telling someone they're bipolar because they told you they sometimes get a bit sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does scare me, but at the same time I'm kind of excited to see how this will work when I get older. My external body has never ever matched the mental image that I have of myself, even when I was a kid. I can't exactly describe what my mental image is, I just know that mirrors and cameras have always been very jarring to me. I wonder if it will be even more so when I'm 60</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a hard set &quot;static&quot; point at which it happens, it's just, more often than not, the case. Old people don't see themselves as old internally. They're aware they're old, but their internal self image is generally a younger person. For example, it's not uncommon for elderly people with grey hair to, when asked what colour their hair is, answer the colour it used to be out of habit.</p>
<p>Just like I, at 28, when asked my age, frequently answer &quot;19&quot; without thinking and then have to correct myself. I'm well aware that I'm 28, but since I don't think about my age all that much, my &quot;default&quot; answer is 19, because, I suppose, my internal self image is me at 19. When I dream, or picture myself in my head, I look a lot more like I did in my late teens and early 20s, too. It's not uncommon at all for someone's internal self image to differ from their actual self.</p>
<p>It's why people frequently say things like their age or weight or addictions &quot;sneak up&quot; on them. Your self image doesn't update every day, you just sort of notice you've changed, usually at formative or important milestones in your life, and your image updates then. After a certain age, there are fewer formative or important milestones to measure your changing self against, so your self image just kind of stays how it was. </p></div>		</li>
