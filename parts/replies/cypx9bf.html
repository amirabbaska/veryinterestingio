			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... I'm not going to read the whole thread, but in my opinion that's really just half of the answer.  The lesser half.</p>
<p>&quot;Bitrate&quot; is <em>sort of</em> the other half, but just saying &quot;bitrate&quot; gives an incomplete answer.  Fact of the matter is that &quot;video&quot; always has artifacts.  But if you take 4k-rendered artifacts and scale them down, that process carries the same kind of advantage as rendering a 4k game for your 1080p monitor.  In the latter case, it's a kind of anti-aliasing.  Similarly, in the case of compression artifacts, you're doing a pretty good job of smoothing those artifacts over - hiding them away.</p>
<p>Compared to that, the improvements inherent in effective 4:4:4 color are downright subtle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the bitrate can also be a very large factor in most practical situations, since many large video streaming sites such as youtube allow for a higher bitrate for higher resolutions.</p></div>		</li>
