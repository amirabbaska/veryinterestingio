			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. &quot;Moon&quot; is not a proper astronomical term. Natural satellite is the correct term for what many consider a moon. Moon (Luna) is only the name of one of earth's natural satellites. While the earth has many natural satellites, most are too small to be of significance beyond ensuring they are not going to hit one of our artificial satelittes. The term &quot;Earth's sole Moon&quot; is correct not because it's earth's only satellite, but because the satellites name is moon. Now in order for a natural satellite to have a natural satellite of its own, it must have more gravitational influence on an object than its host planet. This is possible but would be very rare to naturally occur. We can see it artificially whenever we put something in lunar orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although it makes sense to me that the earth might have natural satellites beyond the moon, I was actually not aware of them. Are any named?</p>
<p>Also, do you know if we have actually detected natural satellites of the moon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are temporary satellites occasionally, which get caught in unstable orbits around earth. </p>
<p>Such as this one: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_RH120#mediaviewer/File:2006-RH120-orbit.jpg" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_RH120#mediaviewer/File:2006-RH120-orbit.jpg</a></p>
<p>To see what such an orbit would look like in motion, here's another example: <a href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/j002e3/j002e3d.gif" target="_blank">http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/j002e3/j002e3d.gif</a> This was believed to be a similar meteroid to the one above, but is now thought to be a Saturn rocket stage: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J002E3" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J002E3</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth doesn't have any other natural satellites, but some objects do appear to orbit it from the Earth's perspective because the orbits overlap so much.</p>
<p>These are termed Quasi-satellites, Cruithne being one example.</p></div>		</li>
