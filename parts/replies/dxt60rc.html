			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to what he said, this is also why metal feels colder. Metal is great at conducting heat (that's why radiators are made of metal). Even if the metal is exactly at room temperature, the heat flows out of your hand into the metal a lot quicker than if you were holding a wooden or plastic object. Your hands are only capable of detecting heat flow, not temperature. So, if more heat is flowing you feel hotter or colder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on what both of you have said: both of you stated correctly that the heat flows from the hottest object to the coldest. Technically, cold is just the lack of warmth and because of that, the cold cannot disperse. It's always the heat (or for that matter: the thermic energy) that disperses to the colder area, lowering the average temperature of the whole system. So a warm seat warms your body, but you do not give cold to the warm chair.</p>
<p>Just a random fact that people seem to miss sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
