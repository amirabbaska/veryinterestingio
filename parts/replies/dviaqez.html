			<div class="markdown"><p>Capsaicin (the compound that makes spicy stuff spicy) actually activates your pain receptors, called nociceptors, which is why it feels like your mouth is on fire when you bite into a hot pepper. The capsaicin isn't actually harming your body any, but your body reacts as if it is being hurt and in danger.</p>
<p>By the way the theory of why plants produce capsaicin is that birds don't have the same pain pathway for it as mammals, and their digestive system is easier on the seeds of spicy peppers. So the seeds are more likely to be viable after the whole pepper is eaten by a bird than if eaten by a mammal.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you mean are there stinging pains that aren't immediate I'm sure there are. The receptors are just telling you something painful and sharp is happening. But it's not necessarily lifethreatening. It's just your body interpreting it that way</p></div>		</li>
