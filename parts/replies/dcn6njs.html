			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the left and right eye movement thing has been debunked. It was in the same boat as people being left brained or right brained. It was a dash of science and a dollop of arm chair science. The reducing stimuli is true though I think. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind our eyes see things upside down, and our right side of the brain takes care of the left side of the body and vice versa. To think we look to the side of the brain we want to activate makes intuitive sense, but not scientific sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grrr I always get the visual fields and sides of the brain mixed up. Now that you mention it I do recall the certain directions being linked to different mental tasks being refuted. My mistake. I also probably shouldn't have said &quot;more processing power&quot; it's more like there's just less interference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's whatever. It's what I like to call a &quot;blind spot&quot; you heard it somewhere and it makes intuitive sense, but you never had a need to re check it. I'd compare it to an old wives tale.  </p></div>		</li>
