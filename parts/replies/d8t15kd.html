<p>dumb question but does that include the bones and other inedible bits? Surely they don't expect people to eat bones, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not unless I'm process pink mush, which is one of the more disgusting things I've had come across the lab desk. I used to be a supermarket butcher and fishmonger, and I grew up on a livestock farm, so when we got in jobs like the turkeys, I was called away from my GC or other tests to process the meat, because I could debone and prepare faster than anyone else in the lab. </p>
<p>We used to get two, one to cook, and one to process raw. But in neither case was the bone used, though the bones were weighed and their presence noted for the customers own calculations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's exactly the difference. It lead to some arguments in the lab about what should and shouldn't be tested.</p></div>		</li>
