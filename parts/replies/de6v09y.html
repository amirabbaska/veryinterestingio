			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the demonstration.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, I loathe every single one of these demonstrations.  In particular, they all rely on our deeply rooted sense that things should fall or be at the bottom of a container.  <a href="http://askthephysicist.com/images/tumblr_mgle5zempq1qaphrco1_500.gif" target="_blank">The animated versions</a> all demand that fundamental association.  There's just no reason that those objects need to be on that plane.</p>
<p>I get that it's a simplification...I just don't like them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can alwas find a plane that contains both objects (such as both objects <em>are</em> at the bottom of a container, as you put it). For more objects these planes aren't necessarily identical but nevertheless still exist.</p>
<p>To really understand what's going on you have to take a look at general relativity and Minkowski space - which can get really complicated really fast - and it's more or less the higher dimensional equivalent of what's shown in the above video.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the stretchy 2d-plane is a great analogy and easy enough to understand for everybody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better analogy might be a ball of pizza dough that starts out as a ball, but then spins out into a disk as it rotates.</p>
<p>The spinning is what makes it a flat pizza sheet instead of a loaf of bread. Well, rolling, too, but the spinning helps a lot. And its hard to roll a gas cloud around with a rolling pin, much easier to spin it with its own inertia and gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that the gas clouds that form solar systems generally tend to be very slowly rotating (far slower than pluto's orbit). As gas condenses and falls towards the center, conservation of angular momentum increases the speed of rotation of the disk.
You can't really have another axis of rotation while the disk is still comparatively dense, particles that are moving in other directions will bump into particles in the disk.
Eventually the disk condenses to form planets and the leftover gas (which is far less dense) is blown away by solar wind.</p>
<p>I don't really like the marble analogy because by the time you have distinguishable objects instead of a gas cloud, (almost) everything's already rotating in the same direction.</p>
