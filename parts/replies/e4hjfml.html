			<div class="markdown"><p>To any aspiring or novice singers, I advise you take this comment with a grain of salt. It has been many years since my vocal pedagogy classes, but one thing was clear: if you are singing by thinking of laryngeal tissue mechanics, you will damage your voice. </p>
<p>To OP: I’m not sure if translate is messing this up, but your descriptions are weird. Smaller vocal folds doesn’t mean less tension is required to create phonation, it means they are thinner and need less measured force. Since the tissues and muscles are smaller within a female larynx, this should be a proportional tension and force to that singer’s register and individual instrument (our voices have unique timbres, which is why we can recognize each others by voice). </p>
<p>You can’t make your folds thicker and thinner (the measurement we use is tissue thickness, which determines your natural range. Bass is thick, soprano is comparatively thin). Your larynx alters the tension, which will stretch the folds. Think of a rubber band: it gets “thinner” when you stretch it, but it still is the same material and thickness when tension is released. Furthermore, if you apply tension improperly, you will damage the rubber band (or your voice). </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>If thinking of and imagining proper, healthy laryngeal action is somehow inhibiting your singing, I don't know what to say.  Singers absolutely should understand the science and mechanics behind it, and think about ot every time they practice. I studied for years with only vague technique and explanations, which limited my advancement.   Singers will just keep hearing people like us argue over technique on and on and become lost without a foundation of understanding <em>what's actually happening</em>.  Not that the mechanics is what you ultimately think of... Hopefully you eventually train the mechanics into a simple habit and muscle memory, and can focus on conveying text, drama, etc. while singing.</p>

<p>Sure, the measurements are proportional, not absolute.</p>

<p>I don't think you're disagreeing with me here...? Yes, what I mean by thinner is like a  rubber band. That's pretty much how vocal folds tissue gets thinner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feel is an inaccurate word to help describe, but here’s an attempt: sound is a vibration and your thorax from about sternum to the nasal cavity is a resonance chamber (like the hollow body of a guitar or the tubing of a wind instrument.)</p>
<p>Because of how we use our voices, the lower pitches in your range will resonate somewhere around where your throat meets your collarbone and the vibrations will be absorbed in that area. (Note: this and all of what I’m saying is natural vocal stuff. If you force it to do any of these, you could do damage). Lower pitches need a larger resonating chamber (tubas are big) and this space is well suited for it. Your falsetto, head voice, and general higher pitches resonate in your mouth and nasal cavity, which is much smaller but great for making a clear tone. </p>
<p>Last note: resonance is a natural mechanic of sound. You don’t really feel it in any one spot, as the only vibration is in your vocal folds. But it’s still somewhere in a spooky, timey wimey kinda way</p></div>		</li>
