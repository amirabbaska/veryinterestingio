			<p>Don't listen to horseradishking. You are correct but humans have a much thinner layer of it, and excess fat in humans dosent go into it (it does still provide some extra insulation). Also interstitial fat is not brown fat. That would be counterproductive because one, brown fat produces heat to keep core temp up so putting it where heat is lost is counterproductive, and two it needs a lot of blood (which you want to keep warm and away from the skin) for oxygen to burn that fat. </p>		</li>

			<p>Fat is fat, the original commentirnis just wrong.  All ruminent animals produce an excess of heat.  Their digestive system keeps them warm.</p>		</li>

			<p>Those adaptations also vary a lot by climate. <br><br>I recently moved from upstate NY  to Texas. When I hunted whitetail deer in NY, they would have a very thick fur and a dense, thick layer of fat under their skin (an inch or two thick in some cases)<br><br>I just butchered my first whitetail in Texas and neither of those things were the case. Much thinner fur and almost no fat under the skin. Texas whitetail are also about half the size of their NY counterparts.</p>		</li>
