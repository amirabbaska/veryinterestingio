			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you imagine the nature documentaries about deer with iron hooves? &quot;And there goes a herd now, running through that field. They till the soil with their sharp, metal hooves as they run across it, killing many hapless moles in the process. This species of deer are able to survive even the harshest conditions, in part because they can strip the bark from even old growth trees, with those hooves, and eat the living wood beneath. Oh dear god! There's a little boy with a BB gun! They're heading right for him! Someone call an ambulance, his rib cage has been smashed right in! &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the over population issues in the USA, Deer have issues finding food, no food, means that fat layer isn't there, which means it's a toss up between dying from the cold (Lack of body fat and steady diet = not enough body heat production) or just starving to death.  </p>
<p>This is a truth that a lot of animal lovers fail to recognize, while yes it's sad that these deer die, it is being done for their own good.  If we let the deer numbers get out of control, the available food gets split up into smaller portions, not enough food means that they're going to take risks, like coming closer to homes to forage for food, which means more deer near the roads.  Culling the population means more food, and fat deer are happy deer, deer that stay away from your expensive plants, and don't go out into the roads as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A legitimate critique of hunting policy is not that its done at all, but that its action is reversed with respect to natural selection; hunters take the healthiest, strongest animals, and not the weakest.</p>
<p>Culling animals for the greater health of the herd is what wolves do, not people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not as cold as you would think. They actually go into controlled hypothermia in the winter months to conserve energy. So they won't feel as cold because there's less of a temperature difference between the air and their body.</p></div>		</li>
