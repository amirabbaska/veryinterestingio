			<p>Don't listen to horseradishking. You are correct but humans have a much thinner layer of it, and excess fat in humans dosent go into it (it does still provide some extra insulation). Also interstitial fat is not brown fat. That would be counterproductive because one, brown fat produces heat to keep core temp up so putting it where heat is lost is counterproductive, and two it needs a lot of blood (which you want to keep warm and away from the skin) for oxygen to burn that fat. </p>		</li>

			<p>Those adaptations also vary a lot by climate. <br><br>I recently moved from upstate NY  to Texas. When I hunted whitetail deer in NY, they would have a very thick fur and a dense, thick layer of fat under their skin (an inch or two thick in some cases)<br><br>I just butchered my first whitetail in Texas and neither of those things were the case. Much thinner fur and almost no fat under the skin. Texas whitetail are also about half the size of their NY counterparts.</p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly agree, particularly with the last paragraph. Elderly obese simply may not have contracted the types of end-stage diseases that cause weight loss, thus accounting for their extra weight and longer life. So, the implication is that you just shouldn't contract diseases that cause weight loss, like cancer. Seems easy enough!</p>		</li>

			<p>Weight loss surgery also typically triggers a sudden and drastic reduction in weight, which is not healthy for a lot of reasons.  It's why modern weight loss surgeries are more focused on things like altering the stomach to reduce hunger and prevent overeating and liposuction has been mostly banished to the world of cosmetic surgeries and extreme cases.  Anything you can do to make the body more <em>naturally</em> lose the weight is much, much, much healthier for the body as a whole.<br><br>It's some really interesting stuff.</p>		</li>

			<p>With the over population issues in the USA, Deer have issues finding food, no food, means that fat layer isn't there, which means it's a toss up between dying from the cold (Lack of body fat and steady diet = not enough body heat production) or just starving to death.  <br><br>This is a truth that a lot of animal lovers fail to recognize, while yes it's sad that these deer die, it is being done for their own good.  If we let the deer numbers get out of control, the available food gets split up into smaller portions, not enough food means that they're going to take risks, like coming closer to homes to forage for food, which means more deer near the roads.  Culling the population means more food, and fat deer are happy deer, deer that stay away from your expensive plants, and don't go out into the roads as much.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>This is a confusing question to me, but I will try to answer it.<br><br>1) In the US (and most other places), wolves are an apex predator.  There are few animals that prey on them, and although we have Golden Eagles which are known to take down wolves, I dont suspect that happens enough to factor much into the numbers.<br><br>2) The US essentially eradicated the Grey Wolf (common ancestor to every breed of dog) and reintroduced Canadian Timber Wolves in their stead.  Canadian Timber Wolves are a larger predator....whether or not that makes them &quot;fiercer&quot; or &quot;more aggressive&quot; should be a no-brainer (size means a lot to a predator...if you were small enough, your house cat would snap your neck and eat you).  However, their size does make them more efficient hunters and gives them the need for more food than their smaller cousins.  So...if you had 25 Grey Wolves in a pack, that wouldnt be that much &quot;safer&quot; than 25 Canadian Timber Wolves....but they sure would eat less.<br><br>3) Im not sure to the degree that the Great Lakes region has seen the reintroduction of wolves.  Ground Zero for the project seems to be around Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.  The wolves have, of course, spread into neighboring states (some as far as California, it is said)...but I dont know as much about the wolf situation (past or present) in the Great Lakes area as I do in the state of Montana, and to a smaller degree, its immediate neighbors.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Since 1995 a number of wildlife biologists have accepted the determination by Nowak that five subspecies of gray wolf (Canus lupus) inhabited North America during the early 20th Century. There is also agreement that <strong>Canis lupus occidentalis</strong> (the large gray wolf transplanted to Yellowstone and Central Idaho by FWS in 1995) had virtually no opportunity to influence the genetic make-up of coastal wolves in SE Alaska and Yukon and portions of five other Canadian Provinces where it existed.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; For thousands of years the ice between interior Alaska, Yukon and British Columbia and the coastal area prevented the occidentalis wolves from mixing with the smaller wolves defined as <strong>C. lupis ligoni</strong> by Goldman in 1944. And the intensive efforts to kill all wolves in the early 1900s also left few of the large wolves alive in most areas where they might have mixed with the native wolves.<br>- See more at: <a href="http://www.skinnymoose.com/bbb/2012/07/18/dna-studies-smaller-native-wolves-existed-in-northern-rockies-before-canadian-wolf-transplant/#sthash.wWHytfXh.dpuf" target="_blank">http://www.skinnymoose.com/bbb/2012/07/18/dna-studies-smaller-native-wolves-existed-in-northern-rockies-before-canadian-wolf-transplant/#sthash.wWHytfXh.dpuf</a><br><br>PRE-INTRODUCTION RESIDENT WOLVES: WOLVES OBSERVED THROUGH “1995″ IN IDAHO.<br><br><em> Highly secretive behavior.

Small packs of 5 individuals are common as are large packs with over 20 members.<br><em> Pack merging, the condition of 2 or more packs combining is being observed in many areas in the west and is not uncommon. Merged packs of over 40 wolves have been observed in the Central Idaho Wilderness.<br></em> Females (breeding bitches) can be bred even at 1-year of age, and produce from 5-9 pups per season. The pups usually remain with the pack but can disperse or be driven off by other pack members.<br><em> All females of breeding potential in the pack are usually bred. There is absolutely no indication that any females are kept from breeding by the theoretical “Alpha-female.” Large packs are quickly produced and can disperse and merge several times within a week.<br></em> Canadian Grey Wolves show a diet preference for elk but will switch at will to a secondary prey species. Low preference is shown for rodent species, but wolves do sporadically hunt rodents.<br><em> Sport-Reflex Killing is highly developed in Canadian Grey packs. From observations in the field, 3-5 ungulates are killed for each ungulate consumed. This surplus killing is greatly increased if the pack size is large or packs have merged. Often small wintering herds of deer or elk are completely extirpated in one hunting event.<br></em> Body Size: Females 60 lbs.-85 lbs. Males 90 lbs.-120 lbs.<br><em> Competition with other predatory species is extreme and often fatal. Both mountain lion and bear have been impacted by attacks and from reduced available prey.

Coyote populations have been reduced by are persisting at lower than historic levels.<br></em> Canadian Grey Wolves have been found to utilize all available habitats, from high elevation alpine to sagebrush deserts. This has allowed this variety of wolf to be opportunistic in all ecosystems available to it.<br><em> Large mature male wolves remain with the pack threw out the year, sometimes dispersing for short periods of time.<br></em> The Canadian Grey Wolf is highly predatory on all domestic canines. Hunting hounds are especially vulnerable to attacks and are usually killed outright in a confrontation by wolves.<br><em> Canadian Grey Wolves have shown a preference for predating on domestic livestock even with abundant natural prey present. Beef calves are the most common victims of wolf depredation.<br></em> Canadian Grey Wolves show a high level of habituation to humans, and man-made structures.

			<p>Hi. This doesn't really make sense to me. If I jump in a large freezer naked, I will actually start to feel warmer as my body gets cooler because there will be less of a difference between my body temperature and the temperature of the freezer :/ ?</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FireHazard11" target="_blank">FireHazard11</a>
			<p>Yes. Eventually. If you started living in the freezer then your body would undergo several changes to adapt. Mild hypothermia is just one adaptation that happens, and it's pretty extreme one honestly. You'd need to be living in constant cold weather before your body decided that was worth the risk. But if you did start to have a lower body temperature then cold weather wouldn't seem as cold. <br><br>If you want a quick and easy demonstration of this you just need 3 bowls of water. Fill one with hot water, as hot as you can stand without burning yourself. A second with ice water, and a third with room temperature water. Put one hand in the hot water and the other in the cold for about 2 minutes. Then put both hands in the middle bowl. One hand will feel like the water is really hot and the other will feel really cold, but they're both sitting in the exact same water.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Maybe I'm assuming, but I think OP may also be asking &quot;Why?&quot;  Why aren't humans better equipped?  Could it be that years of evolution and the invention of clothing, and other means of staying warm have left our bodies more vulnerable to the elements?  It seems unfair that it's such a stark contrast between survival and pure death.  Why don't our bodies leave us <em>anything</em> helpful on this side of evolution?

			<p>Or more likely, the deer that randomly developed hollow hairs were able to move into colder climates, and the predators that normally would have snacked on them (say, lions) couldn't follow.  And it's not like this happened overnight, it would have been over thousands of generations - every once in a while the hair got a bit better at keeping out the cold, so they migrated a little further into the cold areas.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not like one animal randomly had hollow hair and had a great life. It's more like one animal had a mutation to have sliiiiiightly less dense hair and then reproduced. Multiply that by a zillion animals, and each one with slightly hollower hair having slightly better luck at reproducing and eventually over a long period of time you end up with hollow hair</p>		</li>

			<p>the point is that it does know.. mutations dont happen from the bodies of deer &quot;learning&quot; how to resist the cold, its just completely random genetic mutations that happen that end up either good or bad. if it is a good mutation, it may cause the deer to prosper and increase its input into the gene pool, which would lead more deer with that mutation to prosper. theres a saying about it that &quot;survival is the exception, not the rule&quot; when talking about evolution... because its not like species specifically develops mutations with the intention of using them to survive better, its just random mutations that increase the quality of life the animals end up surviving more often than those without.  most mutations end up being bad, and those just end up dying off and  not propogating.<br><br>as far as mutations go, its like a monkey at a type writer hitting random keys, not a writer developing a character... but given enough time even a monkey will end up typing up some words by pure coincidence</p>		</li>

			<p>If you have a thing, and you don't die, and you have kids, your kids have the thing. The longer your line has the thing, without dying, while making more kids, the longer that thing exists. So, if you get a hollow hair, and you don't die, and you make kids with hollow hair, then hollow hair is a thing in your line. If your line becomes the dominant line, hollow hair becomes the dominant thing in your species.<br><br>Also, the concept of hundreds of thousands, or millions, or billions of years is just so mind-blowingly huge that it's nearly impossible to conceive of it, so you just have to sort of take it on faith that, given enough time, you get some things, like hollow hair, that work well.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's actually incorrect.  Deer, and all other runinant animals, stay warm because they have a rumen, which is capable of producing tons of heat during their digestive process.<br><br>Predators need heavy fur coats.  Ruminant animals do not.</p>		</li>

			<p>Can you imagine the nature documentaries about deer with iron hooves? &quot;And there goes a herd now, running through that field. They till the soil with their sharp, metal hooves as they run across it, killing many hapless moles in the process. This species of deer are able to survive even the harshest conditions, in part because they can strip the bark from even old growth trees, with those hooves, and eat the living wood beneath. Oh dear god! There's a little boy with a BB gun! They're heading right for him! Someone call an ambulance, his rib cage has been smashed right in! &quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>I'd like to add that when it's really super cold, deer will forage to a lower (read: warmer) elevation. So they definitely feel the cold when it gets bad enough. Just like us, they will use exercise to warm up.</p>		</li>

			<p>indeed, OP is simply just wrong in the second half of the question:<br>&gt; but humans would die pretty quickly if they wore nothing but a deer hide outside in the same freezing temperatures? <br><br>As long as the deer hide would fit perfectly and not leak in any air it'd probably keep us warm too. <br><br>Except for the feet, our feet are way bigger than theirs and would probably leak a lot of energy to the ground even through a deer hide, especially since it's designed to hold air to insulate, which doesn't work very well id you step on it.<br><br>So on top of your explanation, I'd add it's also thanks to the cloven hooves - both because the part touching the ground is just dead material (like our nails) that doesn't feel the cold and doesn't need to keep normal body temperature and secondly because the surface area is much smaller than our feet.</p>		</li>

			<p>Deer are also ruminants, meaning their stomach(s) are large bacterial fermentation bags, as the bacteria grow they produce huge amounts of heat - same goes for cattle, and to lesser extent small ruminants</p>		</li>
