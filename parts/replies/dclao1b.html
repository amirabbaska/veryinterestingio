			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this question. I don't have a good answer for you. Do you have a context that's more specific? Maybe the spaces you are looking at are finite, or have a measure, or other structure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The specific space is informal, so I was mostly curious whether there exists anything rigorous in other contexts. What prompted it was thinking about applying mathematical theory to languages, and specifically the mapping grammatical strings to a set of meanings. There could quite conceivably be an informal (or maybe formal in limited contexts) measure space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, almost anything can be a function - it has to be deterministic (each input can only have a single output*), and it needs a domain (set of inputs) as well as a codomain (set of outputs) but the latter aren't really requirements at all since you don't have to know what they are beforehand, so they just kind of emerge naturally.</p>
<p>* If you want to convey more than one bit of information, the output can be a tuple or set of arbitrary size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could construct something like measuring at how many different points a string maps to one meaning vs at how many points it maps to multiple meanings. </p>
<p>I'm not sure there's any such structure in existence - if you define a grammar (in something such as BNF) and at certain points it is ambiguous (think C++) you could identify those on the grammar tree and identify the percentage of leaves which can be ambiguous, and calculate a percentage there. </p>
<p>Not all that useful for natural language, I'll grant - at the very least almost every sentence can be ambiguous if enough sarcasm is applied to it. </p></div>		</li>
