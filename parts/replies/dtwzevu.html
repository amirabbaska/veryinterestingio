			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you brought up the &quot;danger zone&quot; I'd like to add that food can remain in that temperature range for at most 2 hours before it's considered unsafe.</p>
<p>This is 2 hours on and off too. For example, if you left food out in the &quot;danger zone&quot; for 1.5 hours and afterwards cooled it to a safe temperature, the food would technically still be &quot;safe&quot; for a further 0.5 hours in the danger zone before you'd have to throw it out.</p>
<p>EDIT: Correction, it is 2 hours not 6 hours (I originally wrote 6 hours, no idea where I got that number from).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to slam your comment just curious, isn't bacterial growth exponential? As in wouldn't it be closer to like .4 or .25 hours left when you put it back into the danger zone? Or does removing it from the danger zone slow down bacterial growth that much?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really only applies in a situation where you have high turnover of food, e.g a restaurant. Sure, over the course of a week you might end up with a noticeable increase in bacteria. But after only one night (outside of the danger zone) bacteria growth isn't considerable enough to worry about.</p>
<p>Think of it as a rule of thumb for restaurants to prevent giving anyone food poisoning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I've always wondered about. Is there a big difference between 41 F and 39 F? For instance, if my leftovers stay good for 2 days at 39 F, will they stay good for 1 day at 41 F, 2 days, only a few hours? Is it a magic cutoff line where bacteria slows down dramatically or does bacteria growth slowly drop off as the temperature cools?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out this image link for a graph that should explain this to some degree... <a href="http://www.cell.com/cms/attachment/549851/3899556/gr1.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.cell.com/cms/attachment/549851/3899556/gr1.jpg</a></p>
<p>The growth rate doubles every 5'C or so, according to this graph. 41'F is 5'C and 39'F is 3.9'C... As that graph shows, there will be little difference in growth rate (%), slight changes in temperature can have very pronounced effects given enough time, as growth rate is exponential (1,2,4,8,16,31,64,128,256,512,1024).</p>
<p>Though a 1.1'C temperature change, at such a low temp, would translate to approximated 20% decrease in life span of food. So something that lasts for 2 days (24 hours), at 39F should last for approx 1.6 (19h 48m) days at 41F. although, I expect that my calculations are wrong, given that the &quot;Lag&quot; phase of bacterial reproduction may be lengthened, therefore giving less than 20% reduction of time the food remains viable. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_growth" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_growth</a></p>
<p>It will greatly depend on what kind of bacteria are present on/in your food also... &quot;Most are harmless&quot;... some are actually pro-biotic.</p>
<p>Read on if you wish...</p>
<p>&quot;Bacteria are the most important microorganisms to the food processor. Most are harmless, many are highly beneficial, some indicate the probable presence of filth, disease organisms, spoilage and a few cause disease. There are thousands of species of bacteria, but all are single-celled and fall into three basic shapes: spherical, straight rods, and spiral rods. To see them, you need a microscope that magnifies about 1000-fold. All bacteria reproduce by dividing into two cells. The two cells then divide to become 4, 4 become 8, and so forth. Under ideal conditions, this doubling may occur as frequently as every 15 minutes, so that within 5 hours there will be more than a million cells from the original single cell. If there are 1000 original cells instead of a single one, there will be over 1 billion cells in 5 hours.&quot; <a href="https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/food-technology/food-processing-entrepreneurs/microbiology-of-food/" target="_blank">https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/food-technology/food-processing-entrepreneurs/microbiology-of-food/</a></p>
<p>&quot;The average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6°F (37°C). Some studies have shown that the &quot;normal&quot; body temperature can have a wide range, from 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C)&quot; (Google reponse for average body &quot;temperature&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;By theta mode of replication an E. coli can replicate it's genome in 40 minutes. But the cell division takes 20 minutes.&quot; (<a href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-E-coli-divide-faster-than-the-time-it-takes-to-replicate-its-chromosome" target="_blank">https://www.quora.com/How-can-E-coli-divide-faster-than-the-time-it-takes-to-replicate-its-chromosome</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>40 and 37F converted to celsius is 4,5 and 2,8 respectively. Those seem like some low numbers to me. I've never come across a fridge that cold. Growing up, I remember 8c (46F) being the standard. I keep my fridge at 5c (41F) because I like my drinks cold, but lower than that is uncommon. Are you sure about the 37F number? Where are you getting that from?</p></div>		</li>
