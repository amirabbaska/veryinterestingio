If the sun stopped it seems logical the earth would continue moving forward with the same velocity but would loose it's angular momentum around the sun and continue straight on a tangent to path it was on as the sun stopped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point some people are missing and I am assuming from your post you are missing as well, is that gravity does not move at the speed of light. That's a misnomer. What moves at the speed of light is the <em>change in gravity</em>.</p>
<p>In other words the change in gravity propagates at the speed of light.</p>
<p>So no it would not lose its angular momentum. If the sun stopped dead it still has a gravity well and the earth is still inside that well.</p>
<p>If the sun suddenly vanished from existence, 8 minutes later the Earth would lose its angular momentum because the gravity well provided by the sun will be evaporating. </p>
<p>The suns gravity well would evaporate at the speed of light, which means the other further out planets would not notice and continue in their arcs until their local portion of the gravity well they are in evaporates as well. This continues outwards.</p>
<p>Conversely if the sun was to suddenly reappear in a different location in the solar system the planets would not notice until the new gravity well reached them.</p>
<p>I hope that further clarifies what is a hard to grasp concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Along the same vein but from a different perspective:</p>
<p>There is no absolute reference frame for motion in space so it's equally valid to say the sun is stationary and everything moves around it. In this frame it's obvious that the earth orbits the current position of the sun. Thus it wouldn't make sense for things to be different if you consider the sun as moving with constant velocity.</p></div>		</li>
