			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. When we think of &quot;average&quot; attractiveness, we think of someone in the middle of a <em>scale</em> of attractiveness. But being attractive just means that you have very average features with nothing extreme about them. Your nose is shaped the way people subconsciously believe a nose should be. Your eyes look the way eyes are &quot;supposed&quot; to look.</p>
<p>But outside influences also affect what the individual finds attractive regardless of these inborn preferences. It would take all day to go through all the details. The bottom line is that if you find someone pretty, that's your instincts telling you, &quot;they look like they have thoroughly mixed genetics,&quot; because that's what you, as a step in evolution, want: a partner whose genetics are a broad average from as far across the species as possible. That's what makes a sexually reproducing species so hardy, and why more closed-off bloodlines such as royal families can produce such odd-looking individuals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Photogenic is not a high standard. It just means you look good in photos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to be photogenic without being &quot;beautiful&quot; or even attractive in real life. Some people are stunningly beautiful when you see them in person, but come across as &quot;meh&quot; in photos. And vice versa: looks like nothing special in real life but &quot;wowee!&quot; in photos. The greatest models have this quality; think Kate Moss. She is actually quite strange-looking; for one, her eyes are so far apart she almost looks wall-eyed, yet in her model photos she is breathtakingly beautiful; I have rarely seen someone who can morph into so many looks, that many's the time I didn't even realize it was her; I just wondered &quot;WHO is that stunningly gorgeous model?&quot;- only to find it was Kate Moss at it again. She is the poster child for 'photogenic&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A symmetrical face implies solid genetics.</p>

<p>does it really though? I don't think the genes themselves encode for asymmetries. The genes encoding the shape of your eyes are the same for both the left and the right sides for example. I would suspect that asymmetries result from a harsh environment or bad nutrition during development. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, genes do encode symmetry, because they encode everything. You're right, other issues can cause disfigurement, but the results of such incidental and purely physical causes are offputting for a variety of reasons that would be difficult to list (for example, a face that was disfigured during in-utero development might trigger the human survival instinct to avoid anyone with a condition that looks like it could be caused by disease).</p>
<p>We're not talking about one side of the face having no eyelids, though. The types of asymmetry seen within the scope of healthy genetics are generally pretty subtle. Things like uneven pigmentation, that you would barely pick up on consciously but for which the part of your brain dedicated to reading the details of other humans would make you subconsciously rate someone as slightly more or less attractive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about creating symmetry but about preserving it.</p>
<p>When you randomly add information to a system, say strike the pool balls, knock the table or hit the piñata, most of the time the system becomes less usefully ordered and more chaotic; or to put it another way entropy increases.</p>
<p>So most influences on a system are going to disrupt it and reduce symmetry. Those influences might be a harmful genetic mutation, disease or parasitic infestation, and our sense of beauty helps filter those out.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think we are in disagreement then. Im thinking that the genes don't contain an inherent code for creating asymmetry - at least for facial features. The asymmetry comes from asymmetrical gene expression which is influenced by the relatively chaotic environment especially during development </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this answers it really well. Certain features that are mostly correlated with attractiveness are also associated with reproductive health, and that's the jist of it</p></div>		</li>
