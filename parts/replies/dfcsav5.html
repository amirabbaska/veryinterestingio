			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of Saturn, I found this cool article a while ago about Saturn's rings: </p>
<p>Dr Norman Bergrun, an American scientist and engineer, made a long and detailed study of Saturn's rings and came to the conclusion that they are not natural. He detailed his findings in a book, Ringmakers Of Saturn Bergrun is no amateur. He was a scientist at what became NASA's Ames Research Center, worked for Lockheed Missiles and Space Company and Douglas Aircraft, and established his own research and engineering company. Bergrun became fascinated by the rings of Saturn after studying photographs from the NASA Voyager I and II missions. They arrived at Saturn nine months apart in 1980 and 1981 and Bergrun saw blatant differences in the rings. &quot;That was the starting point for me. I've been researching this ever since.&quot;, he said. Images from NASA's Cassini mission, which arrived in 2004, confirmed all his conclusions. He said that some astronomers and physicists had speculated that the rings were much younger than the Universe and maybe about 100 million years old, &quot;but one pair of pictures shows a change in five minutes!&quot;</p>
<p>Constant change in Saturn's rings was revelatory enough given the belief in their permanence by mainstream science; but Bergrun went further. His long and detailed study of NASA images from three missions led him to conclude that the rings are made by what he calls 'gigantic electromagnetic vehicles'. When he says gigantic he is not kidding, with some of them estimated to be three times the size of Earth and more. Not possible? Consider the size of Saturn compared with Earth. We are not talking about the same relative perception of 'big'. Bergrun said of these electromagnetic vehicles:</p>
<p>&quot;Such an immense propulsive body implies a space engine possessing unheard-of capacity and capability.&quot; Or a completely different form of propulsion involving electromagnetism. </p>
<p>Bergrun noted how the electromagnetic vehicles could be seen where rings were not yet completed. He said:</p>
<p>&quot;On each extremity of Saturn's rings, cylindrical bodies have been photographed spewing emissions. These emissions assume complicated patterns while contributing compositional material for the rings. A time-varying appearance of Saturn's disc is a natural consequence of this process. The B ring and inner-and-outer A rings are separate entities because different vehicles fabricate these rings..... Presence of electromagnetic vehicles near other planets is intimated by a finding of rings, the signature left by exhaust and emission products persisting in orbit.&quot;</p>
<p>Bergrun refers to the substance making the rings as trails of effluent or exhaust discharged by the vehicles, but I would connect this to some crystalline or similar material related to the transmitter-receiver systems of Saturn. Bergun said of his findings:</p>
<p>&quot;These are not conclusions you ordinarily would expect from someone with such a traditional background, but upon applying scientific rigour to the study of Saturn, its rings and its moons, the facts keep pushing me toward some inescapable conclusions.&quot;</p>
<p>This all fits with my contention that we live in what is basically a computer simulation (that I call 'the Matrix', for short) and that Saturn (a computer system in effect) has been infested with the Demiurge virus and transformed into a colossal broadcasting system delivering at least part of the Matrix information source to human decoding processes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once a planet gets big enough, gravity will make it round. Asteroids are funny shapes because they're small and not as heavy, but the more mass you add the more force gravity is pulling everything towards the centre with. With a sphere, there are no corners, so every bit of mass is as close as possible to the centre.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Do you have any reference for this? I'd like to see the detailed analysis.</p>
<p>Imagine a spinning torus, spinning fast enough that the centrifugal force is enough to cancel gravity so it won't collapse into a sphere. Now add some asymmetry. Put slightly more mass somewhere. Obviously, you cannot keep adding mass, because in the end it would resemble a sphere with an adjoining loop, which wouldn't be stable.</p>
<p>TL, DR: If a spinning torus is stable, how much asymmetry can it have before it becomes unstable?</p></div>		</li>
