<p>The most common example are oil infused bronze bushings for rotating parts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To elaborate, this type of bushing is a porous cylinder sintered from powder, then filled with a wax/oil/mix.  Capillary action and heat draw the lubricant to the surface, but surface tension keeps it from actually going anywhere.  Wax and heavy oils are used to prevent evaporation.</p>
<p>And not only are they cheap, for high-force low speed applications they're straight up better than rollers.  They can take a much higher pressure over the same area, and the high quality ones are practically immune to contamination.  Unlike ball bearings there's no way for grit or dust to get into the tiny gap between the rod and bushing.  They can also be more accurate in some circumstances, but that varies.</p>
<p>In general when you're designing a part, the prime consideration for picking bearings is cost.  Sometimes the environment or space will dictate your choice, but bearings nowadays are incredibly good.  You <em>can</em> get most kinds of bearings to work for most applications, but there's an art to picking which is cheapest for all considerations.</p>
<p>Bronze is an excellent bearing material in addition to being quite hard.  When you need low friction and very high force, there are few substitutes.  Self-lubricating plastics have replaced some low-force bearings, but nothing lasts at high surface pressure like bronze.  Well, except for sapphire, but that's obviously a little pricey.  </p>
<p>Brass (copper + zinc) is obsolete as an engineering material, although I think it still has designated specs.  It's almost purely decorative nowadays.  Funny that bronze outlasted it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup!  And before we really got good at aluminum alloys, it was the go-to choice for making extreme shapes such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance#/media/File:Helmholtz_resonator.jpg" target="_blank">helmholtz resonators</a>.  It's about as formable as copper (and usually better, as well as stronger and lighter), so it's great for necking, deep drawing, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um-biLfru-c" target="_blank">metal spinning</a>.</p>
<p>The most important reason it's used over copper, particularly for cartridge casings, is that it doesn't rust.  It also isn't case expansion that's the issue, it's specifically the neck area.  Steel cases still have to be the same size, so they're stronger than brass cases, and allow more gas to blow past the neck of the cartridge.  It's not so much that steel doesn't flex <em>ever</em>, it's just not 100% legacy compatible.  you could fix the blowby if you made the cartridge too thin for brass to work.</p>
<p>Aluminum, AFAIK (have never shot it), doesn't have the neck blowby.  It isn't reuseable due to the way aluminum alloys and hardening work -if aluminum gets too hot or bends too much, it loses about half its strength for several weeks- but other than that it's pretty much as good as brass.  Brass has the advantage of reusability over steel and aluminum, but probably most importantly, it's legacy.  Brass is expensive and with the price comes the expectation of quality.  Plus for a very long time aluminum, steel and nickel cases <em>were</em> inferior or impossible to make.  Gun owners do not trust easily.</p>
<p>The real bottom line is that brass cases are expensive, and that forces steel and aluminum rounds to be the &quot;cheap&quot; alternative.  Since they're cheap they obviously don't put the effort in to maximize quality like you can with brass, and the cycle rolls on.  It's just very resistant to change more than anything.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;engineering material&quot; isn't a well-defined term, FWIW.  Engineering is of course used to working with non-engineering materials, they just have certain caveats associated with them.  It's nothing to do with how useful, modern or high-tech it is either.  Wood can be an engineering material; silver and tungsten are not.  Gold is iffy and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_plastic" target="_blank">PVC is certainly <em>not</em> an engineering material</a>, but ABS and nylon are.  I guess &quot;purely decorative&quot; was an overstatement though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aluminum will fill a chamber just fine as well. But the upside to brass is the same as for bushings-high lubricity. Brass is easy on barrels/chambers as it goes in and out of them, plus it's easier on extractors.</p>
<p>Also, brass, AFAIK, is the only material that can be reloaded with a bullet and powder again. Steel and aluminum don't have the ability to be reformed easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup!  And brasses are still used for some pipework and fittings because they're so formable (plus obviously brass musical instruments).  However for marine stuff I have always heard that aluminum bronze is much more common now.</p>
<p>Bronze is a superior material, but brass is sometimes cheaper to use because it's formable.  Usually in that case it's because it's being used decoratively, but for wood hulls it can still be important.  Free-machining brass is also (I think) used as a reference for how easy other metals are to machine!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on this. Bronze is also used as valves for pipelines with water just as brass. They don't rust and are easily produced. Using steel for your sink takes a lot more effort than simply using brass or bronze. </p>
<p>And as you said they have less friction when used with steel parts. Some nozzles are fully bronze while others use a steel piece to shut water off since steel doesn't rust and have as much friction when you spin it open or closed.</p></div>		</li>
