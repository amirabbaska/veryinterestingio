			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an extremely interesting debate, philosophically, because what we see is a comparison between the broker's right vs the individuals right.</p>
<p>In effect, the regulation decrees that the more pressing right is the average American's right to the lowest cost investment. However, as pointed out about, this presupposes that the IRA broker will charge you higher commission if given the opportunity. If he/she ever moves from a lower cost investment to a higher cost invest, he/she must now justify that move to you because the regulation says they cannot do this just because they want to. And so they've invented a disclosure practice. They must ask you each and every time and get your explicit approval. This is a pain in the ass, and in some cases, consumers may be led astray (&quot;well clearly I want the lower cost investment, not the one you're recommending, you crook.&quot;) when in fact the more expensive investment is (and would be) the better one for that consumer. </p>
<p>The broker, on the other hand, says they should have the right to recommend the best possible investments for their client, regardless of commission. They claim that as a broker, that is the entire ethos of their job. They serve you and your money; of course they're going to do what is best for you. And you can imagine, in many instances, where a slightly higher commission may be a much better option for a certain client. Now this process is excessively complicated as they must get your express approval for something that you, as their client, should trust them to handle. And in some instances it may actively turn you against them (and falsely).</p>
<p><strong>In effect, the administration has a pessimistic view of human nature.</strong> The regulation presupposes that somebody is going to break the ethical code. This is so bad that we must explicitly defend against it. Whereas the argument for deregulation, the free market argument, here is &quot;let unethical malactors run up commissions for clients; eventually people wise up and the bad guys lose business. This motivates them not to be bad. Ergo, in time, the market corrects itself.&quot; But the pessimistic view of human nature goes even deeper. It says not only are some investment brokers bad actors, but most regular people are simply not smart enough to even figure this out. The market won't just correct itself because the malactors can easily dupe their clients into following their unethical practices. And then the free market argument responds: &quot;Yes, that is true. But if people are so stupid, why do you think they're smart enough to carefully review and then approve or deny each of the disclosure agreements we send them? They have no clue what they're doing, just like before. And in some cases they believe the regulation favoring low cost investments can be taken itself as investment advice, and that is categorically false! Sometimes higher fee investments are better investments! It's extremely complex. That's why our profession exists. To help people navigate the complex investing world.&quot;</p>
<p>It's my opinion that both sides have a decent argument. </p>
<p><strong>So what bothers you more, philosophically?</strong> The government denying freedom to a certain class of individual who's in a position of power over consumers OR the government assuming you're not smart enough to protect yourself and avoid unethical or incompetent investment managers? Remember, this is America — land of liberty. If we're going to deprive a certain group of liberty we'd best have a good reason. </p>
<p>Bonus Round: There is an even deeper pessimistic view of human nature at play. And that view holds that even ethical investment brokers may be subconsciously swayed to select higher fee investments for their own best interests. The broker may be totally, honestly, and truthfully unaware of these forces. But it's possible that over time they will come to see high cost investments as better investments, or even in just one instance, slip into this thinking. Because none of us our Gods. Justice is not perfect. Human wisdom is fallible. And so: should government be the judge and regulate on this basis? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Here is where I think our outlook may differ. Let me make a sweeping statement: Liberals views on human nature are not pessimistic, they are <em>experienced</em>.</p>
<p>Humans can and will take advantage of others if you let them. This isn't some theoretical notion, it's observational. There's virtually no counter-examples. You need thorough, interest-disconnected regulation to prevent this. No society, anywhere and ever, is virtuous.</p>
<p>Sure, <em>a person</em> may be virtuous and do the right thing. But, this person will necessarily be outcompeted by those willing to exploit their customers more. </p>
<p>So, I take issue with your framing here. Humans are, deep down, greedy and bad. It's in our very natures to be so. I think this is one of those fundamental differences in liberal v conservative thinking. A conservative frames the world in a way that assumes the best possible motivations of participants. That we <em>live in a perfect world</em>. But we don't. Even a few bad eggs will have a spoiling effect, which is why we need powerful and thorough regulations.</p>
<p>As for:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I take issue with this framing as well. We're not denying a group of people liberty, we're telling them they must play by a certain rulebook in order to take others money and utilize it for them. </p>
<p>And my central thesis is clear: nobody has the ability to accurately gauge the quality of all work done for them. Nobody. The vast majority of people on earth do not have the tools to understand all the ins and outs of investments. A person with the commensurate time and education to audit their investor could <em>do the investors job themselves</em>. That is why the government MUST regulate it. I'd say most people are smart enough to eventually understand the quality of their investment advisor, but we pay them to do that work because we lack the time to do it ourselves. Just like the doctor, just like the auto mechanic, just like the thousands of others of professionals that we rely on.</p>
<p>That is how our current society works. Like, I am certain that you could not do my job, right now. Unless you have years of university level math under your belt, you would not understand what it is I do. You would not understand my outcomes.  You have to trust that what I tell you is correct. That trust that we give others in our complicated society is literally entirely founded on government regulation.</p>
<p>I think we forget that, because we are so accustomed to it. As an American, I am reasonably certain that all the food I buy in a grocery store is not contaminated. I know this because of regulation, and quick response should something BE found. I am reasonably certain that the car I am driving won't fly apart while I am driving it. I know this because of regulation. I am reasonably certain my doctor won't give me poison, and that when I DO pick up my meds they are real substances with proven benefits. This is, again, entirely due to regulation. Entirely. Roll back our regulated society and we'd be back to snake oil salesman and Chinese level food fakeouts.</p>
<p>To that I say no thanks. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This was already guarded against with regulation. The Fiduciary standard means that now if the $1000 fix will possibly work, and the $10,000 definitely will, the mechanic will do the 1000 first anyways to avoid legal trouble, since he assumes liability anytime he chooses a repair that's a higher cost than another option. The mechanic analogy breaks down here, since that's actually what mechanics typically do, especially with a wide price difference in options.</p>
<p>What the regulation means, is that in order to avoid liability brokers need to invest time in documenting that the higher commission choices are being made with the intention of making the customer more money, as well as the broker. Not a bad thing, but it raises the business costs without any guarantee of solving a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It wasn't. Currently, brokers were working under a suitability standard,not a fiduciary standard.</p>
<p>What that means is they need to give you something that's good (so they can't shove junk at you), but they do not need to give you an investment that is in their best interest. So they could give you something with a 5% return, and a $100 commission, or a 4% return, but $200 commission. Under the old rule, giving you the latter would be fine- under a fiduciary standard, you're obligated to give the former, unless you can reasonably prove that the 4% return is actually higher, say 6% (which is not easy, to be fair)</p>
<p>There is a higher cost now, because it's a pain in the ass to prove that something is the 5%- but currently they do not have to act in your best interest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It depends on how they deceive you you. Fraud is really weird. Like, if they ask a direct question &quot;how many miles are on this car?&quot; , if you lie, that's fraud. Or if they ask you &quot;what is return on this fund?&quot; and you tell them it's 100%, that's fraud.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they don't have to tell you everything, <em>especially</em> if you don't think to ask directly. So if they have two investment products, one earns you 4%, but they pocket 1%, the other earns 4.5% and them 0.5%, they're totally allowed to sell you both. They're also allowed to refuse to answer some questions, so you can't just always ask them what commission they get on each</p></div>		</li>
