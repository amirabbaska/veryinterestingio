<p>I was unable to find a chart that goes back much further than the 70's, if you find one please leave a comment.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not saying anything you've said is wrong, but salaries have crashed hard since the 90s. What's the explanation behind that? I'm nearly through an engineering degree, and 20 years ago nominal values for salaries could be twice as much as they are now. Add inflation into the mix and my buying power for the same position will be significantly less than half of what it was just 20-25 years ago. I don't understand why that is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's missing from the explanation is the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; which occurred as a result of increased intercontinental travel (as a result of technological advancements from WW1 and WW2) that led companies to wage-enslave indigenous communities in smaller nations, as well as the industrialized prison work complex gaining in popularity in the mid 90's. This is not entirely the fault of women, or robots, in the workplace.</p>
<p>RE: the 90's, Tom Friedman's &quot;Hot, Flat, and Crowded&quot; serves as a nice time capsule looking into that era. Lots of &quot;outsourcing&quot; as a trend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah my answer is really only half the equation - it explains why 2 people must now work where 1 did before. The reason the 2 cannot even equal the earnings of the 1 is because inflation has increased cost of living faster than earnings essentially. There are an absolute butt-tonne of reasons for this, many of which I barely even understand but lots of them are being discussed elsewhere in this thread. I wrote my answer to be taken <em>in addition</em> to other responses, rather than an attempt to say &quot;actually it's caused by this and not anything else&quot;.</p>
<p>Basically, had women never entered the workforce standards of living for your average family would likely be the same as they are now - only the wife would not have to work. The fact that standards are lower now than they were in 1950s by comparison is really a separate economic point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earnings should match inflation which they haven't, I'm not disagreeing with you entirely, just that you put the cart before the horse somewhat. Just a suggestion to phrase it as <em>earnings have not increased to match inflation.</em> Regardless of the reasons why earnings haven't kept up (automation, women in the workplace, corporate machinations from banks -  predatory loaning, housing loan inflation, to corporations reducing the rate that employees increase in salary and union busting, and free trade agreements) this is the terminus of the argument of &quot;why is it harder afford (some) stuff today than it was in 1960&quot;</p>
<p>It's also an important distinction that even with two incomes the combined wealth for two individuals doesn't match that of the years just after WW2.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure where you're getting your numbers from, but <a href="http://m.machinedesign.com/technologies/changes-engineering-profession-over-80-years" target="_blank">this article</a> says otherwise. I'm not going to try to get the real dollar value, but I don't think there's been a crash to engineer's salaries. <a href="http://ewh.ieee.org/cmte/pa/Status/salary/Salaries.htm" target="_blank">IEEE did an article in 2000 too</a></p>
<p>I think problem you're currently facing is that there are over abundance of new grad engineers entering the workforce, probably due to <a href="http://mobile.edweek.org/c.jsp?cid=25920011&amp;item=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.edweek.org%2Fv1%2Fblogs%2F59%2F%3Fuuid%3D45616" target="_blank">focus on STEM</a> education for the past 10 years or so. On top of that, most new grads stay in metro areas where the competition is heavy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pre-ww1 as you have observed, for most families the husband worked for money whilst the wife was primarily concerned with keeping the house in order and caring for their children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's really just not true outside of the upper classes. </p>
<p>For working-class urban families the wife almost always worked (usually in gender-specific employment, but still working fairly long hours regardless), or in rural families the wife would be equally involved in most farm work as the male members of the family. </p>
<p>The &quot;single earner&quot; model for most families (even then many still had 2 income earners) was extremely short-lived and centered around the brief post-ww2 economic boom, which was an anomaly in all of human history in terms of gender relations. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Machines and women entering the workforce increased the supply of labour and thus reduced its value, reducing wages and requiring everyone to work in order to maintain standard of living at pace with technological advancement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's just simply false. If anything, returning to the &quot;standard 2 earner&quot; model is simply a matter of most of humanity returning to the status quo that existed for most of human history. Machinery is having an impact no doubt, but that was true during the boom era (50s-70s) just as much as it is today (80s-present). </p>
<p>Work arrangements are a matter of social and economic factors, as well as political decisions that society has collectively made. Nobody would tolerate the sacrifices to living standards, restrictions of individual rights, or the increase in wealth redistribution that would be necessary to go back to a 1-earner model. </p></div>		</li>
