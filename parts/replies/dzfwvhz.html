			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I bet most people would be pleasantly surprised if they just played video games at lower resolutions. This allows textures to be rendered quickly, at the full potential of the resolution to display them, and equally across different objects. In other words (often) improves the quality in every aspect except resolution. DVDs are great quality rendered at a low resolution.  </p>
<p>I also expect people would be less impressed by traditional DVD resolution than stated here. Many streaming services, even for content from the &quot;DVD era&quot;, serve higher quality. And recent video disks are often Blurays. I'd assume OP and others realize when they're watching a Bluray rather than a normal DVD, but who knows?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One time I said essentially the same thing: that I would prefer high detail, high framerate 1080p vs low detail/low framerate 4k. </p>
<p>And people just downvoted me :/ it was in
r/gaming though.</p></div>		</li>
