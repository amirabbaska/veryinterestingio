			<div class="markdown"><p>Rods and cones are specifically adapted to capture light and transmit it to the vision centers of the brain and turn it into a perceived picture there. Cells that simply detect the presence or intensity of light don't have those capabilities, and don't send information to be processed in the same areas of the brain. So both the tool and the wiring are not correct for the photosensitive ganglion cells to turn blue light into a perceived picture. (I'm going off fuzzy memories here, if someone has more accurate info, please correct me)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would also depend on the cause of the vision loss. If a person has damage to their eyes that would prevent the signal from getting to the brain, it wouldn't matter what the ganglion cells do (retinal detachment, optic nerve damage, etc). </p>
<p>I'm not sure about the blue light specifically, but I do know when people lose almost all their vision, it very often messes up their sleeping patterns for a while. </p></div>		</li>
