			<div class="markdown"><p>I would encourage you to read up on communist Chinese history. The most famous case is the &quot;Four Pests Campaign&quot;, where peasants were rewarded by the state with every sparrow they killed. Unfortunately, the sparrows were natural predators of an even bigger pest, insects, so this policy led to enormous nation-wide famine that ended up killing tens of millions of Chinese. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, for the two examples listed, making quality iron/steel is not something done in a backyard forge, so the first plan resulted in a great deal of crap metal of no use to anyone.</p>
<p>The second policy of indiscriminate killing of pests led to them killing so many sparrows that insects caused the greatest famine in mankinds history, the ensuing starvation leads to Mao generally being at the top of the horrible people kill count lists. </p></div>		</li>
