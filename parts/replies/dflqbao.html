			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the best answer. Dividing is always best visualized with real objects (multiplying is really the only one that's a bit more of a leap when talking about real things). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well multiplication is best viewed as a chart.  Say you want to know how many blocks you have when you are 10 units high and 0 units wide.  A block would be defines as a 1 unit by 1 unit space.  You end up with 0 blocks because you have not pushed any distance to the right, but have only gone up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, grids seem to be the best way to visualize it. It's just harder to think of multiplying objects while division is easy and addition and subtraction my toddlers understand (you took my toy! I have one less toy!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I see it:</p>
<p>8 apples shared equally among 2 groups. How many does each (1) group get? 4 apples in each (1) group.</p>
<p>3 apples shared equally into 9 groups. How many does each (1) group get? .33333 (1/3) apple in each group.</p>
<p>So how about 10 apples shared equally in .5 groups? How many would each (1) group get? Well in order to figure that out, you'd have to extrapolate how many 2 of these half- groups would get combined to figure out how much a whole (1) group would receive. Based on the rate of 10 apples for every .5 of a group, an entire (1) group (.5 + .5) would receive 10 apples for each half of a group (10 + 10).</p>
<p>Therefore, an entire group would have 20 apples.</p>
<p>That's how I'd explain it to a 5 year old. I'd probably ask if they needed any further clarification or simplification after that. I don't remember much of what it was like at that age.</p></div>		</li>
