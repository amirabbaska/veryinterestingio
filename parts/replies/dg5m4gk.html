			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;if you went down deep enough there would be overlapping claims&quot;</p>
<p>I always thought ownership below ground was more like a wedge, and the farther down you go the less area you own. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This type of thinking would only really matter if the mantle had resources we actually wanted to extract. In the crust layer the distance at the bottom is almost identical to the distance at the top (around 0.5% difference). It's better to think of a country's land as being a curved sheet of paper than a wedge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel as if it'd be a bit much to calculate the exact latitude, longitude, depth, and circumference of what would be more of a many-edged cone than a wedge as they'd all end at a point at the center of the earth. If one were to do this, it'd be to decide who owns a pocket of oil, natural gas, mineral, etc in the overlapping zone. </p>
<p>The overlaps don't really matter as long as one isn't blatantly drilling underneath another country's land I'd imagine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Down&quot; means towards the Earth's center. Latitude and longitude are measured in relation to other points on the spherical surface of the Earth, so you would actually have to assume a wedge shape tapering toward a point at the Earth's center for the latitude and longitude of the borders to stay constant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My seventh graders were just having this conversation yesterday. That very idea is presented in Tuck Everlasting. &quot;The ownership of land is an odd thing when you come to think of it. How deep, after all, can it go? If a person owns a piece of land, does he own it all the way down, in ever narrowing dimensions, till it meets all other pieces at the center of the earth? Or does ownership consist only of a thin crust under which the friendly worms have never heard of trespassing?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure your seventh graders would care, but it used to be doctrine in US property law (and in its English predecessors) that an owner of land would own &quot;from the heavens above to the depth below,&quot; meaning you owned a big cone from the center of the earth to space. It's the doctrine of ad coelum, and I would highly recommend looking it up, it's fascinating.</p></div>		</li>
