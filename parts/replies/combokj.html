<p>It seems unlikely that a naturally occurring intelligent organism of a similar scale to use would perceive time <em>much</em> more slowly. If it did, its intelligence wouldn't be very useful, because things would be happening in its environment too fast for it to keep track of and respond to. In other words, an organism's speed of thought is simultaneously bounded above by the physical limits of the kind of brain it uses <em>and</em> subjected to selection pressure from below by the fact that it is more valuable to react quickly to events in its environment.</p>
<p>One possible scenario might be if the organism evolved in a very cold environment (such as Titan's hydrocarbon lakes, or similar sites elsewhere in the Universe) where <em>all</em> living activity occurs much more slowly than it does on Earth. However, life like this may not have had enough time since the Big Bang to evolve intelligence yet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How did we arrive at that belief? It seems like a matter of qualia to me, and so essentially unknowable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To some extent you can observe it in action. It is very difficult to surprise a small animal with your own movement. See a little bird sitting on a twig, try to grab it, and it's gone long before your hand reaches it. Not because it's physically faster (for instance, baseball pitchers can impart speeds of 150km/h or so to a thrown baseball with their hand, faster than the bird can possibly fly), but because its brain is able to notice your movement and begin its escape sequence so quickly.</p>
<p>There was some sort of study done on the matter recently. Check out <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/16/time-passes-slowly-flies-study" target="_blank">this article</a> for some details.</p></div>		</li>
