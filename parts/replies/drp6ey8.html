			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more the <em>temperature</em> that's stupidly high.  The particles in the plasma are very energetic on average, but there's not many of them, so the total energy density is not unreasonable. </p></div>		</li>

<p>here's the FAQ of JET covering this. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q: I am interested to know how the internals of the machine are not damaged from the immense heat of the plasma. I am aware that there is magnetic confinement of the plasma, but does it not radiate heat?</p>
<p>A: You are correct that the very hot (150 million degrees Celsius) plasma in JET is held away from the walls of the container using very powerful magnetic fields.</p>
<p>However, if the plasma becomes unstable it can break free from this confinement and hit the walls of the container, in the process doing a bit of damage. In this case, the loss of heat to the walls causes the plasma to collapse. So why does it not melt the walls? This is because of the relative masses of the plasma and walls. The plasma weighs only ~0.01g whereas the container is hundreds of tonnes of metal. So although the plasma is extremely hot, its thermal energy content is actually quite low â€“ as its mass is so low.</p>
