			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how the encryption layer works thus ensuring you and the remote server are the only ones that can see what is being communicated, what I believe OP is asking about is the SSL certificate process.</p>
<p>Assuming you're using SSL encryption you now have to know whether you can trust the remote server to be who they say they are.  For example if I setup a server that pretends to be your bank and then try to get you to securely communicate me your password or bank account info how do you know if you're talking to me or your bank.</p>
<p>The SSL Certificate process as described above by /u/orchlon tells how a chain of trust is established.  This process in reality is somewhat flawed because it requires you to trust the top level certificate authority.  It wasn't a bad idea at the time but is in need of improvements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the question is a little vague.  I guess I was answering the 'How do they encrypt the data exactly and couldn't eventually be &quot;crackable&quot;' part.</p>
<p>I always remember the explanation I was given over a decade ago and I really thought it was a clever analogy.</p>
<p>I'm in IT myself but networking isn't really my area of expertise.  Still, certificates are a yearly pain in the arse for me.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two lock on the same chest is a better metaphor for commutative symmetrical encryption (useful when two people want to exchange info without having any previous contact) - in the public/private key case, one party is distributing to everyone infinite locks, which only they have the key to.  So if someone wants to talk to them, they lock a new lock of their own choice and a key for that lock (and keep a key for themselves) as the CONTENTS of a chest that has the known lock on it. They send off the chest, the party with the infinite locks unlocks it, then they can use the new lock, which they both now have keys for, for future chats.  </p>
<p>I love the double lock metaphor, though.  </p></div>		</li>
