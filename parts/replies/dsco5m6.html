			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m no expert in any way, but isn’t the way light propagates not necessarily in a straight line, especially in stronger gravitational fields? From what I understand the curvature of space time causes light to bend in a way that can only be described in non-Euclidean geometry. Wouldn’t that make light be detectable not necessarily in a straight line depending on the strong gravitational fields it travels through until it reaches the observer? Not correcting in any way, I’m genuinely curious about this point </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you asked that question, as my own work is around gravitational lensing, which is exactly as you described! This bending of light by mass can have a few effects: It can make a source appear to be in a different position than it really is; it can distort the shape of the object; it can magnify and create multiple images. This can indeed complicate matters. However, where this phenomenon occurs it will be very local to a particular patch of the sky where the large, massive object is - the one that is causing the spacetime curvature. </p>
<p>Your question was about the sun, which is indeed a source of contamination as I mentioned about (for instance, if there is a full moon, reflected sunlight can contaminate your measurements), but that's generally easy to account for. Real day-to-day astronomy often involves working with images and spectra of very faint and far away objects as these are the ones where new, cutting-edge research can be done. This means looking at lots of faint, noisy blobs. Sometimes, knowing whether a source is contaminated by a nearby object in the foreground, or if there is some gravitational lensing going on that you can't detect directly, is very difficult. Even telling the difference between a star and a faraway galaxy is not entirely straight forward in some cases. </p>
<p>So perhaps the real answer to your question is it can be complicated and even professional astronomers have to do a lot of work to disentangle all the glowing things in the cosmos</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, very interesting. I imagined the overall consequences of this effect were pretty complicated. I did not know how relatively localized the effects were however. So what you’re saying is as light propagates it will be distorted by the strong gravitation of a large mass, but then afterwards it will continue on its original orientation and path from the source? Or can it act sort of like a mirror and reflect the light waves in an alternate orientation? Cause I’d imagine that would make it much more complicated to pinpoint where the source is relative to the observer</p></div>		</li>
