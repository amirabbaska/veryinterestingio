			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that’s because sour candy is made sour with acids, so eating a lot of it over a short period of time actually damages your tongue. That’s why eating a lot of Warheads makes your tongue start to bleed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Any sensation that is considered too extreme will irritate the tongue. Limits may vary from person to person and tolerance might improve. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait. Sweet flavour can also irritates? What's the underlying mechanism?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doctors are still working on determining the exact mechanics of why and how this happens. It's just consistently reported to occur after consuming specific foods, typically types that have a very strong taste like sweet, sour, or spicy.  </p>
<p>If I was to guess I would say that too many chemical reactions are occuring in the taste buds for one particular flavor and the bud is either physically overstressed or weakened by the excessive reactions and ends up splitting, which triggers the inflammation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The irritating mechanism of sour (acidity) and spicy (capsaicin) food are fairly well understood, sweet is new to me. Where did you get this 'doctors are still working' and its accompanying report, if I may ask?</p></div>		</li>
