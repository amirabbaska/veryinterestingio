			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note that some animals use stones or trees to tend to their claws. </p>
<p>Keeping your body in form, working and hassle-free isn't a exclusive &quot;human&quot; thing. Just watch a cat as it cleans itself, birds do it as well, all animals do it. Bears and basically all other creatures that hunt or dig clean their claws on trees and wherever. That goes far beyond, the mentioned bears rub their thick winter fur out on trees once they have woken up, they don't need to have invented combs for that.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the first instances of &quot;shaving&quot; - i.e. you always see in movies ancient peoples with partially shaved heads and so on, and I wonder how that would have even been possible with primative tools. I say that as someone who has an affinity for basic knife sharpening and honing, and I've tried to get normal tools sharp enough to shave head and face hair and it doesn't seem possible with what I have. </p>
<p>Edit: Not only primitive tools but even early metal tools too, knowing that the metal quality wasn't really so great I wonder how sharp they were able to get their blades..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is doing an injustice to stone tools and human ingenuity. </p>
<p>As I said, there is a huge amount of sophistication in human stone tools. Apes using 'stone tools' is them picking up a rock. They don't shape it in any way. They do shape sticks (e.g. chimps stripping down sticks to put in termite mounds to pull out the bugs to eat them) but use rocks as blunt instruments. </p>
<p>Humans select a stone carefully depending on available resources and what the tool is for (e.g. as a cutting tool like a knife, weapon, spear, hide scraper to make cloaks, etc). They then carefully strike the stone with another stone to shape it to the precise dimensions they need. This can involve chipping off tiny slivers to sharpen the edges and even deliberately causing the rock to fracture in specific ways to get a better edge (there are so many specialised ways to do this that each style has its own name - there are over a dozen of them). A stone tool is immediately identifiable from a rock on the ground because it is so clearly man made. It's a skill that takes hundreds of hours to learn and perfect. </p>
<p>Making stone tools is incredibly skilled work - we had to try in class and have so much appreciation for the skill of so-called primitive people who made them. It's also damned dangerous - you could lose an eye to flying debris. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only tools made of stone apes have ever been found to use are literally just hammer stones. Meaning they picked up a rock and cracked open a nut with it. They do however, strip twigs and alter them to fish for termites. </p></div>		</li>
