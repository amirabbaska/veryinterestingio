			<div class="markdown"><p>A good analogy I heard is that your kidneys clean your blood the way you clean your fridge: they take everything out, scrub the gunk, put everything back that's still good, and toss the waste in the trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, blood is filtered daily through the kidneys, so you could say that you're blood is in constant renewed, for example the kidneys filter out waste of metabolism, regulate electrolytes in our body and even regulate the amount of water in our system, this is done constantly. </p>
<p>The cells on the other hand are a different subject, red blood cells have an average lifespan of 120 days, while for example white blood cells have a shorter lifespan, so you could say that blood is &quot;cleaned&quot; constantly but the cells circulating through the bloodstream are the most long lived elements that conform blood itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation! I get it now. I just hear a lot of comments that those who donate blood have &quot;cleaner&quot; blood in their systems, which also goes true with women and their menstrual cycles. What can you say about that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People can actually love without a spleen, the thing is red blood cells can algo be destroyed or &quot;recycled&quot; in the liver (although less efficiently than the spleen) if the become too old they can also be destroyed in the blood stream so it's not too much of a problem.</p>
<p>Sometimes the spleen isn't actually completely removed and surgeons try to leave a part that's not compromised by tissue damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I'm just thinking of people I know who had their spleen removed after it rupturing due to mono. Didn't know you could potentially leave a bit of it behind. Cool stuff</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our kidneys are also important for telling our bodies when more red blood cells are needed! As they age they are destroyed as you said, but your body doesn't exactly notice until kidneys do. In response to lower levels of oxygen in the blood (from either too few cells or other reasons) the kidneys release a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) which signals your bone marrow to begin production anew. </p></div>		</li>
