			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely this. A robot solving a CAPCHA will move to each choice and instantly click, far faster than any human possibly could, and make much more precise mouse movements.</p>
<p>So in order to check that you're a human, it sees how long you take to move between each choice, the variation in your mouse movements, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The inputs to the touchscreen are complex, but yeah I don't know what would stop botters to just record human touches and just replicate them with few variations. No idea how it works there.</p>
<p>It's worth noting mobile use can be controlled in a tighter way, so you could easily identify a user on a real phone with some non jailbroken phone from one on a computer/server (as a bot would be), so that alone may be enough to make a decision before capcha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's still the process of reading and selecting the proper, or typing in the relevant information, before clicking the captcha.  Bots do it instantaneously and with zero variation so after a short while the Google algorithm can pick out which attempts are programs.  A gew might get through before google catches it, but not enough before the program would habe to be changed slightly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nah, surely this is just susceptible to a replay attack. You could record a person doing it once and then feed the same input into the device again. If you needed you could even add randomness into that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, to pass one requires a human-scale amount of time.  Since the usual goal of getting around a captcha with a bot is to do some sort of large-scale attack, just forcing the rate down to a few per minute is good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those algorithms have existed for a long time. That was how some old Runescape bots avoided cheat detection. But if they start to be commonly used against the captcha checks, then suddenly we'll be up against new captchas. And personally, given the choice between &quot;type the letters/numbers and pray&quot;, &quot;watch the video, type the phrase, and pray&quot;, and &quot;click the box and pray&quot;, I'll stick with the nice fast box. I'm sick of the &quot;find the squares&quot; minigame, but as long as it stays under 30/70 for me I'll take it over old-school captcha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot more money in self-driving cars than in human-like mouse movement. Things only get developed when there's a motivation to. We actually have fairly good human-like mouse movement from the arms race between video game hacks/bots and video game hack/bot detection software.</p></div>		</li>
