			<div class="markdown"><p>Campaigns have to disclose all income and expenditures. Somebody would notice if a candidate was enriching themselves or their family.</p>
<p>Usually candidates can loan money to their campaign, but that's different.</p>
<p>Edit: you can check federal and congressional campaign disclosures at <a href="http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/disclosure_data_search.shtml" target="_blank">fec.gov</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would notice if it enriched them directly, but of course it's always indirect. </p>
<p>Like, for your campaign you need to print millions of posters: ask a friends' company, or better yet, give the work to an unrelated company which in exchange will hire your niece as a well paid employee and will add you to its executive board with no work to do. Same for everything else, media, infrastructure, etc.</p>
<p>At least that's what we do in Europe, and I doubt your politicians wouldn't do it in the USA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The IRS-regulated groups, 501(c) and 527 groups, have the ability to keep donors and/or amounts secret. They can run independent ads, but not donate to or coordinate with a candidate or campaign. However, bc these are all run by a small group of friends/colleagues coordination is usually inevitable. </p></div>		</li>
