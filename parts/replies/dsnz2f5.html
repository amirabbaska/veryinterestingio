			<div class="markdown"><p>I research how scientists communicate with the public and you would be surprised how many scientists use field-specific words, which often excludes the public. Research suggests that scientists who can communicate their field of study in simple terms are perceived as more knowledgeable by their audiences versus scientists who use too many fancy words so people can't understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a physics student who does science outreach sometimes and that’s one of my biggest difficulties in communicating effectively. Many words get used so often they seem like common parlance, when they’re actually highly specialised. And many genuinely common words aren’t actually learnt until fairly late in school (like pressure).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't think of any readings in particular right now, but I would recommend using your university's peer-reviewed article access and just look up child development, and let the research pull you through articles that you find interesting. Also make sure you try to look at it from different perspectives- scientific, psychological, counseling, school, etc.</p>
<p>My undergrad was in psych with a counseling minor, and I was intending on adolescent counseling before switching career paths so it's a topic I love too. I'll try to remember to come back with some readings for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends what area/age of child development you would want dive in to. My suggestion would be to use your university database (EBSCO, ProQuest, JSTOR, etc.) as suggested below, and search for papers within the area that interests you the most. If you want some history on where the research started you could look at comparing the work of Jean Piaget and Erik Erikson and their ideas on stage development (development happens like a staircase), or Vygotsky, though I'm guessing you have seen those already if you are currently in a psych degree. A lot of the research overlaps with other theories in psychology since they are fairly similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question for you, child development person. Would it also be accurate to say that memories we may have from that time are harder to recognize as such because a lot of that age is pre-verbal thinking? Like now I process thoughts and memories largely through words but before I could really talk that wasn't the case. Maybe sometimes deja vu or something is a memory and I don't realize it 'cause I tie no verbal explanations to it? Does this make any sense lmao</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same person (though I do study brain development, and the first thing we learn is childhood brain development). I've been taught by an expert in autobiographical memory who mentioned that people who develop speech earlier tend to form memories earlier. </p>
<p>While it is by no means an extensively researched relationship, it does suggest that language scaffolds, in some way, the formation of episodic memories. However, this could be for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It might be because memories are more easily formed when you have verbal faculties that allow you to remember things in a more explicit, meaningful or sequential way. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may be that developing speech allows you to have more meaningful interactions with adults earlier, which might orient your attention to interpersonal situations earlier and so increase the chances of forming a memory (as the earliest memory is almost always in some way significant, unusual, interesting or traumatic).</p>
</li>
<li>However, equally possible (and not ruled out by research) is that an independent factor is responsible for the timing of development of both language and memory in childhood. For instance, we know the hippocampus is important for episodic memory, and we know most children have too many neurons in the hippocampus <strong>and</strong> other brain areas until around 3-4 years old, when they undergo 'pruning' (or refinement) - the unused neurons are essentially discarded and the most used neurons then work more efficiently. It is not too much of a stretch to imagine that perhaps, the several areas we know are responsible for various aspects of language might also start working better as a result of pruning. It's quite unlikely that they start working at the same time, especially since we know language usually develops before memory. However, pruning or other maturation processes might be responsible for the relationship we do see. </li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that I'm taking the trend reported to me by an expert on memory and describing several alternative developmental explanations. All three could be partly true and contribute to the overall trend. To properly understand it, quite a bit of research would need to be done. Memory is also not my specialisation, so I could be missing research that sheds light on some of what I've said. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're exactly right. To add to this, episodic memories (the kind that recall events in one's life) are not usually far less important than procedural memories (e.g. knowing how to walk or talk) and semantic memories (e.g. remembering the faces of your parent(s)), so these are usually the first to be pruned (which happens mostly during sleep, one factor as to why babies sleep so much). However, pieces of these memory &quot;traces&quot; are hypothesized to sometimes remain intact (usually when high levels of emotion are involved), possibly explaining certain fears or biases that have no root in a person's memories. </p>
<p>Sorry for rambling; I have a degree in this stuff and I get excited talking about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides emotions, smells is a big one There is a particular smell, earthy smell of  basement that whenever I encounter brings back a millisecond of a memory that I can't get back. Sometimes even thinking of that smell jolts my brain and tells me there is some memory in there associated with that smell. Or maybe there is some emotion, I can't really tell, I just know it makes me uneasy every time and leaves me thinking about it for hours, sometimes days</p>
<p>Sometimes it almost feel like I remember the whole thing for a millisecond, only for it to slip away at the same moment.  I know something bad happened to me in a basement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. I wonder if this &quot;pruning&quot; could also play a roll in the development of pathology. The reason I bring it up is that one of my relatives has many very early (and verified accurate) memories from when she was about 2. Unfortunately she has also struggled with   psychotic depression throughout her life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ASD are thought to be due to a pruning deficit in initial synaptogenesis, especially in the temporal lobe. Pretty much there is no elimination of low use synapses, so any sensory signals that would not be a problem/wouldn't even be noticed by a normal functioning brain can't really be filtered out abymore</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Too little and possibly developmentally atypical. The “too much” idea might stem from the hypothesis of global underconnectivity in ASD, but that probably isn’t actually pruning (which is local, and in many ways believed to rely largely on microglia) and is rather that the neurons fail to extend their processes outside of the region in which they originate properly (to the best of my understanding). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THat is very much a possibility. For example schizophrenia is thought to be due to excessive synaptic pruning in the second phase of maturation (in mouse models), which is an indication of some sort of an imbalance in signaling pathways. I don't think we know enough about how these processes work to say that the fact that your relative can remember these things is related to this, but i don't see why we couldn't speculate.</p></div>		</li>
