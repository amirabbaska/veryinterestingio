			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an alum of the college. The better question would be, &quot;Why did Reed decide to build a reactor?&quot; Because Reed is 99% undergrad and always has been.

Who else is gonna? I had friends who were operators. They took their jobs really seriously! </p></div>		</li>
