			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not true that choking victims make no noise.</p>
<p>I used to have attacks of paroxysmal nocturnal laryngospasm.
Basically I had sleep apnea plus gastric reflux. </p>
<p>Sometimes when I was asleep, taking those huge gasp breaths, and there was some stomach acid near the upper airway, some of that acid would get swept up in the gasp and land on my larynx, which reflexly closed - air-tight!</p>
<p>I'd suddenly wake up completely unable to take a breath. I'd be on hands and knees, making super-strong breathing efforts.</p>
<p>But the air just went into my stomach, making horrible raspy gurgling sounds, even though I was choking.</p>
<p>After 2-3 minutes of zero air intake, the blood CO2 built up to where it reflexly caused the larynx to open up and I could breathe again, and start belching the air from my stomach.</p>
<p>Finally got a CPAP machine, and it hasn't happened since. It also relieved the reflux, probably because of the increased pressure in the thorax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's a different sort of situation than what he/she was referring to, he/she was talking about large food particles blocking the passage, not liquid causing your larynx to close. He/she should have been more specific when saying that. While food particles is the most common form of choking (thus him being able to say what he said) it is not the only type and next time he/she should clearly say which situation he is referring to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, that sounds awful and terrifying and I'm sorry you've had to go through that! I'm glad the CPAP is working. I hadn't heard of your condition before, so thanks for brining it to my attention. I didn't realize people had sleep apnea at the level of their vocal cords (I had always assumed it was the soft tissues of the upper airway, pharynx, velum, etc) that were falling inwards due to decreased muscle tone. I hadn't heard of the vocal cords spasming!</p>
<p>It's interesting (terrifying) that your vocal cords spasm closed, but then don't reflexively open back up for the cough part of the reflex. Has any doctor been able to explain why that is? I might go do some more research.</p>
<p>Also, I hope you're getting the GERD under control. Even with the CPAP, make sure you sleep with the head of your bed elevated. and check in with your GI. A lot of folks still has silent aspiration with GERD because they sleep so soundly they don't feel the reflux coming up.</p></div>		</li>
