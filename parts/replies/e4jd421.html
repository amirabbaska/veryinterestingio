<p>There are other cases! Animal altruism and empathy has been well-documented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Primatologist and ethologist Frans de Waal, Director of the Living Links Center of Emory University, Atlanta wrote an interesting book on the subject, in which he argues, that &quot;human&quot; altruism has - and from a darwinian standpoint: must have - traceable evolutionary roots in the animal kingdom. There is much anecdodal evidence on this, but more interestingly also experimental evidence with chimps, monkeys, rats, magpies and so on.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, all of our automatic emotions are evolutionary. People are always surprised to learn how empathetic or playful a cow is or how a bird can solve logic problems. Itâ€™s like people imagine animals bodies evolved but somehow their brains did not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking yes.</p>
<p>The human brain isn't particularly anything new or special compared with other animals in the animal kingdom. Bigger than some, with parts some have and others don't, etc. And the underlying methodology for function is the same, neurons and their connections, plus how connections are formed/strengthened and broken/weakened.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not gonna pretend that I know more than this guy, but out of curiosity, why is it a must? For the most part I understand evolution and all that but, there has to be a first, right? Something has to have a trait that nothing else does. I suppose you could say it's maybe statistically unlikely for humans to be the first ones to develop me, but I don't get how it's a a certainty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently saw a video of a woman swimming with a large whale that began to behave strangely. It kept getting very close to the woman and at one point, lifted her up out of the water using it's fins. She was understandably alarmed and called to her boat crew for help. After getting clear from the whale, the crew and diver became aware if a large tiger shark circling the area. The whale had been trying to keep the diver away from open water and the shark.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The photographer came to the conclusion that, for whatever reason, the female leopard seal was trying to feed him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The seal thought that his camera lens was an open mouth. First she thought it was a threatening gesture and opened her mouth in response. </p>
<p>After realizing that the human was weak and harmless it thought that the photographer was desperately dying of hunger and begging for food.</p></div>		</li>
