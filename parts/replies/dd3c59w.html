			<div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated: their understanding of gender and sexuality were different to ours. But TL;DR: giving was fine, receiving was bad. Young men, women, etc. were already lower socially, so it was okay for them to receive. Adult men were higher, so if they received they were lowering themselves to the level of a child or a woman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're almost right: this was true for Romans more than for Greeks, although after the two cultures met and kind of melted this reasoning was &quot;exported&quot; to Greece too.</p>
<p>Young men did not receive anal because they were inferior, young men received because adult men were &quot;teaching&quot; them the art of love (IIRC this is well explained in Plato's Symposium, though you should find other sources too)</p></div>		</li>
