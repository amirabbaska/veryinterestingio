			<div class="markdown"><p>Current flows anywhere there is a voltage sufficient to overcome resistance. While we think of the &quot;direction&quot; being negative to positive, because that's the way the electrons move, it doesn't really matter much.</p>
<p>The neutral wire is at 0v. The hot wire oscillates between +170v and -170v. You, standing on the ground, are at 0v. </p>
<p>So if you touch the neutral wire, nothing happens, because there's no voltage between you. But if you touch the hot wire, there's a voltage present, and whether it's positive or negative doesn't matter - either way the electrons flow and there's a current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So very very basically, if the wires were hoses, a generator works sort of like a vacuum hooked to one in going from suck to blow and back again a bunch of times per second? I think the whole &quot;has to make a complete circuit&quot; part is what's confusing me so much. Does this all also mean by extension that power can be transmitted via a single cable? I'm so lost and now off to do some research, but if you see what's holding me up feel free to help</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a little misleading in the wording. </p>
<p>Voltage is always relative. One wire cannot be at a voltage without some reference point.</p>
<p>The voltage difference between the hot and the neutral wire in a single phase system is a sine wave that oscillates at 60 hz from peak voltages of - 170 to +170 volts. </p>
<p>In a properly grounded system, the voltage difference between the earth and the neutral leg is 0 volts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So do AC circuits not form a closed loop then (in simplified form, from the generator to whatever is using the power back to the generator)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different ways to realize an AC circuit. What you are thinking is one way that it can be done, but for safety reasons is not. Instead, what we do is cycle the voltage on <em>one line only</em>, leaving the voltage on the other line fixed. Since there is a voltage difference, you still drive <em>current</em> back and forth, but the direction of current flow doesn't determine which lead is &quot;hot&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;hot&quot; lead is the one that has a different voltage from ground. If you were to touch this lead, current would travel through you because you are essentially ground. The &quot;neutral&quot; lead is maintained at a voltage comparable to ground, so that if you touch it there wouldn't be a large voltage difference, and current wouldn't be driven.</p>
<p>Note that power is <em>transmitted</em> in a different fashion than it's used in the household - the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/hsehld.html" target="_blank">hyperphysics page</a> does its usual good job of giving a description of how the wiring works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I get it. I think. Houses are insulated from the main transmission network electromagnetically because of the transformers, allowing a house to have something tied to ground independent from if that's the same &quot;ground&quot; as the transmission grid, so long as the grid is a complete circuit and can make some good ol' flux?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So “Neutral” is tied to ground, back at your main breaker panel. When not connected to anything, they set pretty close to 0V. The “Hot” on the other hand, is alternating between +/- 170 Volts. If you have a small load on the circuit, that neutral will stay pretty close to 0V.</p>
<p>The neutral always stays relatively close to zero volts, hence its name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were also appliances before the adoption of the grounding prong that grounded to the sheet metal which was connected to the neutral. You can see how having the hot reversed would be a problem here. Sorta like that experiment in automotive wiring long ago where the negative was wired and the positive was run through the chassis; the idea was to inhibit corrosion and I do believe it worked, but could provide a nasty shock in certain conditions.</p></div>		</li>
