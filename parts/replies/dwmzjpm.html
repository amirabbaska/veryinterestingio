			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a business owner and so are most of my friends. This is the MOST correct answer. But it’s more nuanced than that. There’s four things that drive this.</p>
<p>1) Large companies and budgets. Use it or loose it! But most budgets are quarterly so, this actually isn’t the biggest driver.</p>
<p>2) Arbitrary cut off date. Well if I need to pay for a big expense by 1/1/nextyear. Well I’m probably going to complete payment on 12/31/thisyear so I get the tax benefit in a few days instead of a full year from now. This is an extreme example but you get the idea. Obviously this isn’t a huge driver, but it helps. It’s common to take on expenses a month or two before needed to get them in under the wire.</p>
<p>3) I have better things to do with my money. If you had $1,000 right now. And you could go buy dollar printers for $500 each. Would you go buy 2 before the end of the year? Or wait until after Uncle Sam takes his 25%+ of your money, leaving you only able to buy one? This is a very big driver.</p>
<p>4) But I think the biggest driver is because of personal situations/my CPA said to. Look things get crazy complex when you own a business and if your smart you have a good CPA. At the end of the day sometimes it just makes sense to make less because of some arcane tax code that you’d never know about if you didn’t have a good CPA. Really these are personal situations. But just ones your CPA is pointing out for you.
Or sometimes you just know on your own. One year I stuffed as many expenses as possible in at the tail end of one year, even pre-paid for stuff. Why? Well my wife’s got $100k in student loans. She was on the IBR and I was starting to make quite a bit. So, why not keep my income low for another year and keep those darn payments low too? Also helped our medical insurance rates that year. On top of it all, we were planning on buying a house in a couple years at that point. And higher income means lower interest. Doesn’t mean it was a sane choice for anyone else that year. But it made sense for us. I’m sure it looked to everyone else like I was trying to burn money. But really I just wanted to defer income into another year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. Business owners will even give themselves and employees bonuses to even get in the lower tax bracket if they must. </p>
<p>Why give extra money to the government when you can give it to yourself or hardworking employees.</p>
<p>EDIT: Misused to phrase &quot;tax bracket&quot;. More so avoiding taxes based on how much profit you make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Yes it is.</del> If you claim profit of over $500,000, you must pay a higger tax than being under that $500,000. </p>
<p>This is evident in Ontario Canada. Not sure what it is anywhere else. But this is exactly how it is. Based on how much profit you make, is evident to how much taxes you must pay. </p>
<p>EDIT: Didn't mean the phrase tax bracket. However you do pay less taxes by year end if you create expense. Why give money to the goverment when you can invest it back into the business, or give to employees or yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;get into the lower tax bracket&quot; is not how our tax system works.  all of our income is taxed the same, you just pay a different percentage on the income over a certain threshold.  even millionaires are taxed at 10% for their first $10,000 or whatever that number is.</p></div>		</li>
