Plus, westerns tend not to do as well in the international market as they once did, which is a huge drawback for the major studios because the international market is a huge deal now.</p>
<p>For example, the 2007 version of 3:10 to Yuma cost $55,000,000 to make. In the American domestic market, it made around $53,000,000, and internationally it made around $16,000,000. While it did turn a profit, it wasn't as large as the studios would have hoped.</p>
<p>Most of the other westerns to have come out in the last fifteen or twenty years have a similar box office story: if they're lucky, they might just barely break even in the domestic market, but they'll usually make less than $10,000,000 internationally.</p>
<p>However, they are still typically quite cheap to make by today's standards. The 2003 movie Open Range had a budget of $22,000,000 for example, and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford had a $30,000,000 budget. While these sound like huge numbers to an ordinary person, they're fairly small for a movie budget, and even the more expensive westerns like the '07 remake of 3:10 to Yuma are mid-budget movies.</p>
<p>By comparison, the film version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which came out the same year, cost $150,000,000 to make. In the US market, it made around $292,000,000, and in the international markets, it made around $647,900,000. Combined, these make up $939,900,000, or over six times the production budget.</p>
<p>On a side note, because of how strong the international market is, sometimes movies that were flops in the US market can still turn a profit internationally. The film adaptation of Eragon, as terrible as it was, still managed to make a box office total of close to $250,000,000 when you factor in the international market on a budget of $100,000,000. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for fans of westerns, this doesn't seem to be the case with westerns. The big market for them is the United States, and the international market will largely ignore them for the bigger American blockbusters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! That was really well written and informative. How do you know all this?
Do you think that maybe Westerns still exist, they've simply morphed into genre science fiction. So with Star Wars on, we've seen a lot of scifi that seems very Western in its beats. Like Outland being High Noon in space. It seems like unless you have a way to make a great, small contemporary Western (Hell or High Water) then the trick would be to take one and make it scifi.</p></div>		</li>
