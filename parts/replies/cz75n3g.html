			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that seems to be eluding people here as well is that a sniper's job is to place 1 round accurately. This involves approaching the target without being observed, engaging the target without giving up your position, and removing yourself from the area without being captured. Think of sound and light as the same thing for a moment. If someone flicks a lighter 1k away on a dark night you might notice it, if you notice it, you look in that direction, if it gets flicked twice you see exactly where it is. Hearing sounds may not be quite that exact, but in the world of blast radius weaponry like mortars and artillery, that can often be enough.</p>
<p>Another component that has been glossed over is brass. Brass can be very shiny. When brass is ejected from a weapon, it doesn't typically just fall out, most weapons eject it violently. It spins through the air. If there are light sources, and there always are, if could reflect that light to someone who would like to see you dead. Also, if a rifle sprays brass and leaves it behind it is easier to find your firing position and track your exfiltration. When a sniper is ejecting the round they just fired, they place a hand over the ejection port and catch the brass as they work the bolt. This covers the brass and helps them bring it back out with them while putting another round in the chamber, which is always a good idea.</p>
