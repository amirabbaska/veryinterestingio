			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing with NASA is that EVERYTHING is overengineered for the absolute worst case scenario on purpose since you can't just pop off to the store if you happen to run out. They probably thought &quot;What's the average amount of pads used per day? 3-6? Ok lets say 8 to be safe. How many days will the period last for? 2-7? Ok lets say 10 to be safe.&quot; That gives you 80 per week right there, plus NEVER having experience a period in space, there was no way to plan for what might happen.</p></div>		</li>

They also were uncertain of the medical issues of menstruating and whether or not the uterus would be able to expel the shed lining in zero gravity or if it were possible for the lining to move up into the fallopian tubes (retrograde menstruation) (<a href="http://www.popsci.com/brief-history-menstruating-in-space" target="_blank">Popular Science 2016</a>).

<p>Not necessarily. It is difficult and expensive to launch even very light things into orbit. Optimization and risk profiles are critical. You can't just take 3 times as much of everything you might need. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder if there's a preferred number of standard deviations above the mean for worst-case-scenario planning in general. You want to have enough supplies for outlier situations, but not too many to fit in the available space. </p>
<p>20 standard deviations is probably too many; 1 certainly isn't enough. Would 3 or 4 be a safe, non-excessive number? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not done by standard deviations generally, at least for structural design. NASA generally uses a factor of safety of 1.4 for strength. So you multiply the needed strength by 1.4 and design to that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to National Geographic (link below) if a woman spent three years in space she would need about 1,100 pills, which adds some weight to a mission but is less unwieldy than many tampons.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One packet of birth control pills weighs 4g, just the foil packet with the pills (I just weighed mine). Each pack has 28 pills, so 4g/28 gives us 0.14g per pill (give or take due to foil packaging). 1,100 x 0.14g = 157g so significantly less than the food, but it's still weight. Compared to a box of tampons which holds 18 tampons is 93g (tampons weighed without box). I'm not sure how many boxes they'd want to send, but you can get an idea of weight difference. That being said there are likely lighter tampons out there made with less material or out of lighter plastic or cardboard. </p>
<p>Edit - In hindsight, 18 for a week might be too little for some with heavier periods. I'm not sure what the average amount would be, but this estimate gives you at least some idea of weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me if I've misunderstood but it appears you are comparing the weight of 3 years worth of birth control bills to one week's worth of tampons... even if there were lighter tampons it would be orders of magnitudes heavier for a 3year supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>157 g for 3 years is negligible. The average mass of women and men differs by a factor 50-100 more than that (and astronauts are exchanged every 6 months, not every 3 years).</p>
<p>Tampons need much more mass and volume.</p></div>		</li>
