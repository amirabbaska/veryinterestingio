			<div class="markdown"><p>This is perfect. I hate when people say &quot;you know that's scripted, right?&quot; Ok.. I'm fully aware. But a lot of their moves take a certain level of strength and athleticism regardless and pose real dangers. Take Adam Copeland (Edge) for example... got hurt so many times he was forced to retire or he could become paralyzed or even die! He is now an actor on a show called Haven on Syfy and he's magnificent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to part about pro wrestling being the start of The Rock's acting career...I've also heard from interviews with other wrestlers that have moved into Hollywood and likewise from Hollywood people that step into a storyline in WWE, how much professional wrestling has some of the best talent in the entertainment business because they are basically making a movie, but only get one cut to do it. The live promos that occur are often well thought out before hand, but their ability to think on their feet at a moments notice or how to play off the crowd reactions is something that is unmatched anywhere in the entertainment industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RE playing off the crowd: DJing, improv theater, rap battles, etc. Not to diminish your point otherwise, but I wouldn't say playing off the crowd is exclusive to wrestling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty much like any theatre/musical actor right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be a bit biased, but I'd say WWE crowds are a bit more brutal and far less respectful than theatre/musical actors. For instance genuine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHKWvczWsho" target="_blank">please retire chants.</a> Or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqSY9mjlKqg" target="_blank">we all hate you chants</a> cheered at the guy booked as the good guy for the past decade. </p>
<p>Other common ones are &quot;what?&quot; chants after everything someone says and &quot;boring&quot; chants during matches </p></div>		</li>

<p>just remember that The Rock started his career in wrestling and is now Hollywoods top paid actor. </p>

<p>The Rock was the main reason I got in to WWF (this was a long time ago). He was different from the other wrestlers. Very charismatic, spoke eloquently, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=godn_ujvzjw" target="_blank">was pretty damn funny.</a></p>
<p>Degeneration X was pretty awesome too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to watch WWF (screw the &quot;E&quot; crap!) back then, too, and there was a short period of time when Big Show got kicked off of the main events for some reason (weight maybe?) and he went to Ohio Valley Wrestling for a while.  I got to see him wrestle in person at a small town high school gym (population 1200) and it was freaking amazing!  I had been watching wrestling on TV for years but was never able to go to a live event so this was my first time.  </p>
<p>I'm a fairly tall dude at 6'4&quot; and Big Show dwarfed me  so much I thought he couldn't be real.  He was very nice to everyone and even though he had to be frustrated having to wrestle in these little podunk towns, he took it all in stride and spent close to an hour after the main event to sign autographs for everyone.  </p>
<p>He was back on the WWF main events just a few months after that.</p></div>		</li>
