			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone once told me it was like &quot;sure they can use a laser (or whatever it was) to get your vision set, but it's better to choose your own 'anti-aliasing'. Having it perfect might give some people headaches, but others might prefer the sharpness.&quot;</p>
<p>And like you said, our eyes might see one thing but the brain might interpret it differently. Like that study that had the guy wear glasses that flipped his vision upside-down. After some time he got use to it and I think he described it as 'right side up'. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's already done, and it's a good starting point for fine tuning. People still do some things better than machines. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an &quot;autorefractor&quot;. It measures something. It even measures the same value over and over, consistently. But then every time you're allowed to choose your own focus, the value you choose &quot;subjectively&quot; with be consistently different, and it will be sharper than the autorefractor value.</p>
<p>It takes skill to measure this accurately and in 30 years I've never worried that machines would take over my job. It's a chuckle to think people would be satisfied with glasses made from autorefractor measurements given the current state of that technology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just had my first eye exam in a new country (Brazil). The doc used this technique with the light before asking me a thing. I only had to change twice after that...and then adjust for slight double vision. Never had that light trick in the US. </p></div>		</li>
