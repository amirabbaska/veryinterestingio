			<div class="markdown"><p>Continuing this line of logic a bit farther, sanctions hurt BOTH sides of the equation. To take a more recent example,  imagine if the US were to impose sanctions on China. Now, as the US is a large importer of chinese manufactured goods and it would undoubtably really hurt China's economy but it would also really hurt the US economy. The prices of manufactured goods would dramatically increase and companies profits would decrease. There would be a huge cost to the US. </p>
<p>When you are a small country (which most are compared to the US) large sanctions regimes will undoubtably hurt the country imposing the sanctions MORE than the country that is sanctioned.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's interesting, but Europe typically wins it's trade wars with the USA. And China I'm sure could empty out the shelves of Wal-Mart in a week and that would cause real chaos.</p></div>		</li>
