<p>Now it looks like a big greenish ball, except in the center, where it looks black. This is because that's the spot where you are able to see almost straight down the middles of some of the straws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One slightly similar effect can be seen on an LCD screen. In this case, the cheaper the better. An LCD pixel grid is a little like the segmented eyes of an insect. The biggest difference is it's flat instead of curved.</p>
<p>So, you probably know that with a cheap LCD computer monitor, if you move you head to the side and look at it at an angle, the image changes color and intensity quite a bit. At extreme angles, all you see is, like &quot;glowing shadows&quot; or something.</p>
<p>In other words, the image changes depending on the view angle; it is brightest and most distinct straight on and fades as you increase the angle.</p>
<p>So, imagine the same scenario on a <em>curved</em> surface. On a curved surface, at any time you have a slice that is &quot;straight on&quot; and parts that are at angles fading off around the sides.</p>
<p>If you move your viewpoint &quot;around&quot; the curve.... that strait-on spot <em>moves with you</em>. So, it looks like the &quot;good part of the screen&quot; is always pointed directly at you even though the screen doesn't turn or move, only your viewpoint.</p>
<p>A mantis's eyes don't move. They are locked in place in the head. But no matter what angle you take a photo of the mantis from, it seems like that false pupil is facing you.</p>
<p>When you look straight into an insect's eye or an LCD monitor, you see the bottom of the little cells that lie behind the &quot;grid&quot;. If you face the grid from an angle, you see down into the bottom less and instead see more of the walls inside that grid.</p>
<p>When the surface is curved, you always get the straight shot on the surface directly in front of you and where the surface curves away from you, you're seeing the &quot;walls&quot; rather than the core surface.</p>
<p>The inside of an insect eye is dark, the walls of the grid are bright. So you always see dark &quot;pupil&quot; turned toward you and brighter surface around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/calico_catamer mentioned that in another comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given how widespread some level of gaze monitoring is in the animal world (false eyespots are everywhere), I wonder if this has a significant impact on fitness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There might be a trade-off. Using the praying mantis example, the all-green pigmentation of its body improves concealment, including the eyes. And compound eyes themselves must present a distinct advantage over the simple eyes it has already. But the combination of pigmented compound eyes also produces pseudopupils which, from the explanations, would not be present if the eyes were pigmented black. Whatever advantage pseudopupils specifically provide would have to outweigh the disadvantage of their breaking concealment. A set of false eyespots may fit the bill... but after reviewing <a href="http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/FieldCourses00/PapersMarineEcologyArticles/EyeCamouflageandFalseEyes.html" target="_blank">this secondary source discussing camouflage/false eyespots in butterflyfish</a>, I'm not convinced. These pseudopupils produce small eyespots (not intimidating) and are directly attached to the head (not misdirecting to less lethal body parts). Maybe someone has a better source than I do.</p></div>		</li>
