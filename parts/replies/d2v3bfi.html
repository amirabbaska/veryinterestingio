<p>Watching what happens to an organism after it dies can reveal all kinds of patterns that often get preserved in the fossil record. A really great example is Kay Behrensmeyer’s work at Amboseli National Park:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Behrensmeyer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Behrensmeyer</a></p>
<p>She and her colleagues have been observing animal bones there for years. They have been able to study things like the order and timing of skeletal disarticulation, the way bone surfaces change and degrade when exposed to sun and the elements, how long skeletons of different animal groups survive being exposed, what happens when predators interact with the remains, etc. All of this falls under the field of taphonomy, which also overlaps with related fields in archaeology and forensic anthropology. This kind of information can tell us a lot about the environment in which an organism lived and died, including how long it might have been exposed before burial.</p>
<p>As for determining why an organism died, that can be challenging at times. Sometimes we find evidence like bite marks on bone, but did they happen during predation or scavenging? Other times we find evidence of disease or injury preserved on bones, but again, it isn’t always clear if they were the causes of death. Every once in a while though, we get lucky. For example, we sometimes find remains of organisms that seem to have been rapidly buried, sometimes while they were still alive. This fossil, for example, is an oviraptorid dinosaur that seems to have been buried in a dune collapse while it was sitting on its nest:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bone actually does not vary that much between vertebrates, especially those that live on land (tetrapods). Big mammal bones and their skeletons are actually reasonable analogs for watching how dinosaurs or other prehistoric animals may have decomposed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the base work has focused on mammals, because the research was initially spearheaded by paleoanthropologists and others who were more interested in those groups. Amboseli does have elephants, but the research there has looked at most all of the other vertebrate groups in the area, such as smaller mammals and also birds.</p>
<p>Part of my research is looking at taphonomic patterns among crocodylians, as a point of comparison to what we see among mammals. Sometimes, the group involved doesn't matter in this kind of research, but sometimes it does. For example, I have worked a lot with how crocodylians modify prey bone. They don't gnaw on bone like mammals, and while they will swallow some bones whole, they don't seem to be actively going after marrow as a food source. Therefore, their bite marks look very different than those left by mammals, which is great, because that means we are better able to identify and associate them in the fossil record.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's incredibly cool! My girlfriend is currently doing exactly this for her archaeology thesis using kangaroo and wombat corpses in Australia.<br />
Any tips or advice on studying disarticulation that I can relay to her?</p></div>		</li>

<p>A common sentiment among paleontologists?</p></div>		</li>
