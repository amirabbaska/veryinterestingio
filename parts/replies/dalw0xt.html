			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains why guys with performance anxiety can't orgasm. When I first started dating women I could fuck for like 2+ hours and not cum,  but if I jerked off in my room, alone, I could cum in a minute. Actually had to fake orgasms because I was embarassed. Likewise, many women can't achieve orgasm because of the anxiety of sex, so it makes total sense that many women need foreplay to ease into and feel comfortable and less anxious</p></div>		</li>
