			<div class="markdown"><p>I have normal A1A genetics, but I don't have any other causative factors for COPD either. Currently I'm considered &quot;undetermined cause&quot;, though the consensus seems to be something genetic, similar to A1A deficiency, but for which we don't have a genetic test for yet. </p>
<p>I've was also was born premature and have had the chronic bronchitis symptoms since birth, so it's possible that was a factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to be aware of when on oxygen, there are rules as to the amount of O2 you use but nothing to set the humidity level added to your oxygen by your humidifier. Over a period of 2 weeks, I was taking my father by ambulance to emergency twice a day at the end because he was having trouble breathing. A couple of hours at emergency and he was fine. After that, he wasn't allowed to return home which broke our hearts.</p>
<p>The yo-yo between home and hospital was totally baffling until I realized (unfortunately after he passed away) that his lungs were filling up with moisture from the humidifier on his oxygen line - it was drowning him. When he was in the ambulance and at emergency, they didn't use a  humidifier on the O2 line and it was drying his lungs out so then he could breath again. If you have COPD and wet breathing/cough, check your humidifier. You might have too much moisture in the O2 line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, that must be a haunting thing to know.  I'm sorry.   Second, the disease killed him, not you, not the humidifier.    Third,  thank you for sharing.  My wife uses a CPAP and, even though it's checked regularly, you have made me aware of the real risk of it malfunctioning between checkups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this detailed explanation. </p>
<p>Previously in the US, lung transplant was based on ‘time on the list’ and because of its slow progression COPD patients could accrue time easier than other diseases. </p>
<p>The biggest issue is that lungs suitable for transplant are harder to find. Everyone, please sign up to be an organ donor. </p></div>		</li>
