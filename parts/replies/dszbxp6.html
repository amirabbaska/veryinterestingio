			<div class="markdown"><p>Before reading the comments, my idea of a shadow was an object that was something blocking direct light. When proposing this question, I was curious what would happen when a photon comes in contact with something that has a smaller diameter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I am a layman, but this is a great introduction to how light works. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLQ2atfqk2c" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLQ2atfqk2c</a> &quot;A gentle lead-in to the subject, Feynman starts by discussing photons and their properties.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, lot of answers talk about wavelengths, absorption and scattering. One thing we've all experienced is a stained glass window, or perhaps colored sunglasses. Does a stained glass window cast a shadow? I think your answer will be 'kinda'.</p>
<p>So, when things are very small the answer is 'kinda' a lot. That video is great and will (i hope) give you some insight about how things work at that scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a thought. Would an opaque thing like a stain glass window or wax paper be considered a solid suspension? It lets some light through but since we can clearly see the color it must also reflect some light back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that video is misleading. It appears to be from before we knew about the particle/wave duality of light, and things like the double slit experiment, etc.. He insists that photons are <em>just</em> particles and definitely not waves, and that Newton was wrong, when we know now that photons behave like both. It gives the wrong idea about the nature of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When considering nanoparticle solutions (i.e. gold and silver), the color of the resulting solution is an indicator of the size of the nanoparticles within the solution. At this size they don't really create shadows, rather, they absorb and scatter light that creates a &quot;color&quot; you can see. This phenomenon is called surface plasmon resonance. Small particles have a higher relative surface area and thus reflect a higher frequency of light (blue light). In contrast, larger particles have less relative surface area and thus reflect a lower frequency of light (red light). </p>
<p>In the nanotechnology course I took, we synthesized gold nanoparticle solutions and used a UV-Vis spectrometer to determine the wavelength of light the particles reflected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the frequency of light matter. We can limit ourselves to visible light, but then what about an infrared shadow or an ultraviolet shadow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The size of the object where you see some effect scales with the wavelength (as long as we are not too far away from visible light). For UV it can be smaller, for infrared it has to be larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use light to expose patterns on silicon that are on the order of 10nm wide, with resolution of probably 1nm. I think they use extreme uv and do some awesome engineering to make the shadow look right but it works. Billions (devices) of billions (transistors per device) times.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EUV is only just starting to be used. Chips currently on the shelves were made with 193nm light, and every optical trick in the book to get feature sizes more than 10x smaller. It's like using an aerosol spray paint can from several inches away to print a newspaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No matter what wavelength they’re using, they’re still getting 10nm features with 1nm resolution. They’re patterning below the wavelength engineering around the interference you’d expect.</p>
<p>I like your analogy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the smallest object to make a shadow would have to be at least a micrometer in length (1/100 of the thickness of a human hair) to interfere with/scatter visible light.</p>

<p>Isn't light scattered by atoms/molecules in the atmosphere? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, many many times, the sum of it all is that higher wavelength lights bend away but lower wavelengths pass through to our eyes, hence blue skies. We see the bending reds and oranges during twilight. </p></div>		</li>
