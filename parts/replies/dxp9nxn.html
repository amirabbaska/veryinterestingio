			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain bits of the molecular machinery in our body are well-studied. We don't necessarily know 100% what will happen when those bits are targeted (they almost always have more interactions than we know of), but we do know what shape of molecule will fit into those bits of machinery, so to speak.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We're also starting to get to the point where we can make molecules from imprints as well. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecularly_imprinted_polymer" target="_blank">[1]</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rational drug design has been the holy grail for a few decades. When it works, it is a thing of beauty. </p>
<p>Unfortunately it very rarely works.</p>
<p>Partly the problem is that its difficult to find good molecular targets that are truly unique to the disease state and that can be modelled well both in simulations and in the lab. </p>
<p>An early success was Gleevec for a particular type of cancer that results when the ends of two chromosomes get rearranged. This results in a fusion protein that is truly unique and truly drives the disease state. So finding a small molecule to binds only to this protein and not to anything else was possible.</p>
<p>This doesn't happen very often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of drugs with good efficacy. In terms of monoclonal antibodies drugs are expensive to produce. Their specifity is allows for reduced toxicity.</p>
<p>Gleevac is an example of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Any tyrosine kinase inhibitor is not good because cells somehow build resistance to the drug itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also giant libraries of molecules that you can buy, and you just screen them all quickly for binding to your enzyme of interest.  You can buy a library of 1500 fda approved drugs and test them all at once basically for new functions. Pharma companies have their own in house libraries that they screen whenever they find that a particular enzyme or receptor is involved in disease. Thousands of possible drug molecules are screened before one good one is found.</p>
<p>We don't really know what will work ahead of time but we have hunches sometimes. So for the most part don't imagine a chemist sitting down with a piece of paper drawing a molecule and having it work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although, designer drugs still kinda fit the bill there, don't they? Take well-known illegal drug X, slightly alter functional group R to R' on the assumption the new related but legal compound Y will have similar effects as X. Not nearly as sophisticated as proper drug design, sure, but it's still the same idea, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're describing is essentially how a lot of antibiotics are created. New drugs can be created many ways, a few options of which are to create a drug based around a receptor, create a drug similar to another drug, or rework a drug that had unintended side effects. You can also modify the non-active portions of the drug to affect its delivery, e.g. you want a drug to stay in the bloodstream to fight a bloodborne infection so you take an existing antibiotic and make it fat, so fat that it can't leave blood vessels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, the actual reason why one works and another doesn't for a specific patient is widely unknown, and I was under the impression that SSRI's and others are largely a case of trial and error using compounds and processes that we are certain will affect those areas of the brain.</p>
<p>From what you've said, it sounds like they know the actual neurological processes and how to target them.  There is such a wide breadth of antidepressant types because they categorically and subcategorically target specific errors in brain chemistry.  Generally identifying what works on who is a matter of trail and error because there is no way to identify the exact chemicals that are lacking, or are being overproduced.  </p>
<p>What you say, and what I know reminds me of the complex flowchart of blood type compatibility; would you say that the various chemical imbalances that antidepressants are created to treat could be categorized in relation to the symptoms patients exhibit in a similar fashion to how someone needing a transfusion would have varying levels of compatibility with specific blood types?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in benzodiazepines, so not quite SSRIs but we deal with similar limitations in our field. It's pretty easy to know how different benzos affect different kinds of target receptors, but it gets more complicated as we go into cultured neurons/astrocytes in a dish, never mind going into more complex tissues. Still, you can usually tease apart a way to assay a drug's effect in a lab setting.</p>
<p>However, a lot of the clinical issues come into play when you take into account that we don't have a strong idea what's wrong with each individual patient. Depression commercials talk a big game about neurotransmitter imbalances and we learn really helpful things about those imbalances using animal studies, but it's not like we're evaluating this for actual patients. Short of cracking your skull open and doing some incredibly invasive (fatal?) tests, it's really challenging to know what kind of neurotransmitter release you have, or what kind of receptors are expressed in your brain.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the biggest limitation in neuro-therapeutics is diagnostics. You absolutely cannot fix a problem you don't understand. (On a consistent, population level. Obviously neuro-therapeutics work for some people and that's great for them, but we should still try to be more consistent/accurate in our diagnoses and prescriptions)</p></div>		</li>
