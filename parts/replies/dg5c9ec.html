			<div class="markdown"><p>Growing up, I heard several times it was because of a weak diaphragm. (The specific physiological cause of the pain wasn't mentioned.)</p>
<p>During my twenties, I worked my core muscles at physical jobs, at the same time training myself to primarily breathe from my diaphragm. I can't remember the last time I got a stitch from running, even though I have definitely hit out-of-breath fatigue often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keeping your core tight definitely helps prevent the pain. The less food I'm carrying in my belly, the less it hurts. I'm pretty sure it's your organs bouncing around in some way that's causing much of the pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to breathe in cadence with my running...in for two steps, out for two steps. I frequently got stitches in my side. I switched to three-step breathing with a faster foot cadence and the stitches all but disappeared. Then I learned to just focus on my footfall and let breathing take care of itself, and I never get stitches when running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what I did. I'm not super in shape, and I figured I was getting them from breathing too fast and too shallow, with the 2 in 2 out thing. I switched to three step and they disappeared for the most part. It's hard to get used to, cause it feels all out of whack, but it works</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about lactic acid? When I was in school we were told you got stitches from too much lactic acid building up in your muscles.</p>
<p>Is there any truth in that or is it bullshit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>General muscle pain is related to lactic acid - but I am not sure about acute pain that happens soon after the start of exercise, such as a stitch. But the reality is, we don't know.</p></div>		</li>
