<p>Lots of scientists 'figuring' it out with psychological explanations but not many people are drawing attention to the recovering addict.</p>
<p>I feel that even though there's no direct tone for disdain in here, it feels like there is some level of it. Treating the drug like it's some kind of reward system for the brain in terms of just dopamine and seratonin is primitive in my opinion.</p>
<p>Many different drugs have different effects, all too often we relate addiction to drugs because the most common legal drugs are alcohol and nicotine. Both of these are high on the addiction scale:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/1l36m" target="_blank">Click for Addiction Scale by Substance</a></p>
<p>Some of the <em>big</em> drugs like Ecstacy, LSD and Cannabis are in fact lower on the addiction scale and lower for overall risk than the 2 legal and taxed substances.</p>
<p>Drug addiction depends on the <em>type</em> of drug as well as it's effects on the perceptions by messing with our memory machines (our brains).</p>
<p>When you really bring it down to it's core, the only connection the consciousness has with the world is what it can store in the brain. Without memory, thought does not exist. It's the amalgamation of the links we've made over time between our neurons that creates the memories we use to create logic based on experience to understand our surroundings.</p>
<p>Addiction is mind-borne process. You can alter the memories in the brain by creating experiences with alcohol, but those experiences are ones that you created while on the drug. They can similarly be un-done through meditation, drug based psychotherapy (to allow faster remapping of the neurotransmitters), and self hypnotherapy.</p>
<p>Source: Myself. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder triggered by childhood PTSD, I self medicated with MDMA, self hypnotherapy, meditation and LSD. Both of these substances are used recreationally but they have huge value in therapeutic scenarios due to their ability to link areas of the brain and allow child-like states of impressionability. In some cases, complete loss of the ego resulting in a psychological rebirth.</p>
<p>We need to be pushing the front lines of these treatments. They've already shown greater success than some traditional 'treatments' (if you can call mind-numbers like SSRIs treatments) and they make complete sense in terms of both logical psychology and anecdotal tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES. I'm really glad you made this comment because I don't even consider psychedelics to be drugs in the traditional sense. More like teachers or magnifying glasses to reality. I've tripped 5 times over the past two years and to be honest while there are some beautiful and pleasurable moments (listening to music while tripping omg) the experiences I've had have not been all that pleasant. It was very unsettling to see the selfish part of myself so clearly. At the same time these drugs have helped me see my potential to be a source of light and positivity in this world and it does wonders for my self-esteem. So I think you are absolutely correct that &quot;Treating [drugs] like [...] some kind of reward system for the brain in terms of just dopamine and seratonin is primitive&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You saw what the psychologists call the 'ego'. You saw the primitive evolution based side of you which drives you to do certain things in order to illicit a pleasure response.</p>
<p>Punching that annoying dickhead, calling that selfish woman a bitch, eating 20 chocolate digestives in a row.</p>
<p>These are all primitive, ego driven responses and you get the choice over whether you allow yourself to indulge in them. Sometimes it can be fun and it's all up to you but the bits that hurt other people you need to find other ways of venting. Believe it or not, strong addiction affects others around you too.</p>
<p>I have a huge problem with keeping cool when other people try to justify being a cunt to others, especially when logically, ethically and spiritually they're wrong. </p>
<p>I just try to remember that it's an extension of human nature, our consciousness, our DNA that I'm seeing. In essence I don't like that part of myself. In acknowledging that each terrible thing exists as an extension of my own DNA then you become more responsible for actions given and therefore you can no longer be upset by these people. </p>
<p>The only solutions are self improvement, suicide or addiction to a substance to make the world go away. The latter two are only band aids to the real issue. Obviously remember that other people are different and experiencing life from their perspective, you must not fuck with that just the same as if you didn't see it that way.</p>

<p>I quite like meditation because it allows me to observe my own thought processes from a 3rd person perspective, to elevate my own thoughts above the standard day-to-day and to create memory links to remind me of that between my neurons. The neurons we're looking to link are keys from each area of the brain that chain react to create happiness daily. When you meditate often on the same patterns, they get easier to access while meditating or not. Same as riding a bike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy got it in one:  The biggest factor driving any addiction is that the person addicted does not wish to deal with reality.  </p>
<p>Speaking from my own personal experience:  I have never suffered chemical addiction, though I do enjoy the odd drink or smoke (monthly or less in both cases).  My addictions are purely mental.  I read a great deal of fantasy and scifi (I recently went through the entirety of Discworld in a span of 3 months, and I was taking it slow).  I spend a great deal of time playing videogames.  I will indulge any form of distraction that occupies the whole of my attention, because I have never enjoyed my own life.  The way to combat addiction, in this case, is to make improvements to one's real life, so that one no longer feels the <em>need</em> to escape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is awesome and it's great having people share from their direct experiences. I can confirm all that you said is true and helpful not for just you but many others. Keep it up your doing the right things and keep exposing yourself to social situations slowly. </p>
