			<div class="markdown"><p>It's wierd. I do it subconsciously anytime they're on. Every movie, anytime I see a public tv, you name it...if text is scrolling (like a news station) or if subtitles are on...fill keep catching myself reading instead of watching. It's honestly annoying. I noticed it 10 years ago, and I'm still that way today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a good thing for the young ones. I have always had captions/subs on since I was about 7.  With them my son and daughter read very quickly and very much above their level for their ages. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to circumvent that by adding a 2.5 seconds delay to subtitles, allowing myself to focus on listening first, which is important as I'm not a native English speaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've found that shitty subs utterly ruins this though when you get subtitles that <em>already</em> appear 3 seconds late but only <em>sometimes</em></p>
<p>But then again, reading the hyphen interrupting someone's subtitles and seeing [GUNSHOT] following it really lets you know shit is going down</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. My ex-wife only watches shows and movies with subtitles on. So if I watched with her, I couldn't really enjoy the visual style of the film because I auto-focused on the text instead. Which sucked because I'm a huge film buff and a fan of visual style.</p></div>		</li>
