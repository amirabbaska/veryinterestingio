			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. It makes perfect sense to me, and I am a mechanic, who is running a good fever, at 5 in the morning.
There are many parallels I was able to draw from my work, albeit they are many, many magnitudes lower than what you are working with. </p>
<p>Thanks for not talking so far over my head, that I had to reference several white papers to understand the gist of what you were getting across, and thanks for providing them anyway</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both commanded vs actual for engine rpm and injector pulsewidth. An engine is always chasing it's tail trying to hold it's 650rpm or so. Over a five minute period it usually averages out to very close to the target rpm, but looking at a 10 second picture, it can vary as much as 80rpm. </p>
<p>Injectors do this too, in the persuit of commanded rpm. </p>
<p>Then take an f1 car, they could care less about. How it idles, so long as it idles. But they have to accurately control fuel, ignition, and pneumatic valve timing all the way up to 23-24000 rpm.
They usually have an ecm with a 256 bit throughput, while your average civic works just fine with a 24 bit ecm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Great explanation.</p>
<p>My tldr would be something like: although the phenomenon used is incredibly regular over longer intervals, the instruments we use to calibrate clocks are physical and imprecise; though, thankfully, their imprecision averages out  over time.   Over short intervals, atomic clocks are <del>about as</del> 3 orders of magnitude better than quartz.  At longer intervals they get <strong>much</strong> better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that does my post justice! Atomic clocks are still ~3 orders of magnitude better than most quartz oscillators at short time windows, but the point is that the real benefits of atomic clocks come with longer averages, making them 7 to 10 orders of magnitude better (e.g. the difference between the size of a dog and the diameter of the moon's orbit).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me if I'm drastically oversimplify, but is this basically an example of accuracy vs precision?</p>
<p>If I'm understanding correctly the atomic clocks are extremely accurate, but not necessarily that precise: That is each individual measurement, (the length of any given second), isn't that consistent, but if you averaged many seconds, (the total length of a large time scale like years), the measurement would be excellent. </p></div>		</li>
