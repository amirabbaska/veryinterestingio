<blockquote>
<p>Book lungs are not related to the lungs of modern land-dwelling vertebrates. Their name describes their structure. Stacks of alternating air pockets and tissue filled with hemolymph (the arthropod equivalent of blood) give them an appearance similar to a &quot;folded&quot; book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spiders and Scorpions often have these. Which is why the biggest spiders and scorpions are bigger than the biggest insects. The reason that insects don't have these is that, unlike most spiders, they can't transfer oxygen through their blood. You can't have a single dedicated oxygen gathering organ without a way of transferring that oxygen to the tissues that need it. So insects can't have lungs.</p></div>		</li>
