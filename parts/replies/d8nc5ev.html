			<div class="markdown"><p>Ballast gets squished together over time. From time to time, the railroad will send vehicles out to move the stones around and generally get it back to how it started.</p>
<p>After quite a long time, though, yes, ballast does need to be replaced altogether, especially in swampy areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ballast has to be regularly renewed.  Partly this is because mechanical wear turns the angular ballast into rounder pebbles.  </p>
<p>However, the bigger problem is that the ballast becomes contaminated with finer materials that stop it working so well.  Some of these fines comes from the ballast itself wearing down.  More, however, come from other sources - plant material, wind-blown dirt, dirt carried by surface water, and mud from 'wet beds' (muddy water rising up through the ballast).</p>
<p>Ballast renewal involves removing the ballast - often with an automated train that supports the track while it does it - and then washing it and replacing it along with fresh ballast.  Some renewal trains do ballast sharpening, which crushes the ballast to make it more angular again.</p>
<p>YouTube search ballast renewal for some relevant videos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to add that many trains have sand sprayers for added traction.  One case where what's great for the train is bad for the track (ballast,) but it would take a <em>lot</em> of trains with their sanders running the entire time to really make a negative impact.  AFAIK sand sprayers are usually only used at low speed/high torque (as in accelerating from a standing stop in adverse conditions.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 3 minutes into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MKcTbYDP7w" target="_blank">this</a> clip you'll see they replace/reshuffle the gravel during the replacement of railroad ties.  Depending on how often the rails are used, gravel will be added, but a lot of it is just gathered from the sides that have spread out over time in order to save time, money, and resources.</p></div>		</li>
