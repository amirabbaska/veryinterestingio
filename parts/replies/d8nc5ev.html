			<p>I'm not familiar with railroad signaling outside the US. It very well could be the same or similar in other countries, but I can't attest to that. <br>In the US, the tracks either operate as &quot;DC&quot;, where there is either a shunt(0.06 ohms per the AAR) or not. Coded track uses varied electrical signal pulses to convey more information when a train isn't present. The train axle creates an intentional short, which is used to detect the train. If something causes enough water to be present, it could cause current to flow from one track to another unintentionally. This is called ballast leakage. Sever enough ballast leakage can affect proper train detection.</p>		</li>

			<p>But here's one that is true. When the rail tunnel between France and the UK forst opened, there were no specialist high-speed rails on the British side. Instead, trains ran on the third rail electrical system until they reached the tunnel, using a pick-up 'shoe' on the side of the power car. Theoretically, the drivers should have raised the shoe when entering the tunnel and switching to overhead wires, but many drivers forgot. On the french side, these shoes were then smacking French trackside equipment, causing significant (and expensive) damage. The French solution? Reinforced concrete blocks on the French side of the tunnel that ripped the shoes off before they could cause any damage. Which worked fine, until the train reached the UK again and was suddenly useless. And stuck!</p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly. This is exactly the sort of story where the facts are warped into a good story. None of it is true, either: NASA used mechanical pencils, the Soviets used grease pencils, and then Apollo 1 caught on fire and NASA tried to ban every flammable thing they could, at which point Fisher said, &quot;Hey, guess what, I designed this pen that meets your requirements&quot; and they said &quot;sure&quot;.<br><br><a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/13103/russians-didnt-just-use-pencils-space" target="_blank">http://mentalfloss.com/article/13103/russians-didnt-just-use-pencils-space</a><br><br>Most telling: &quot;... NASA received a bulk discount for the pens, reportedly paying just $2.39 per pen for an order of 400 units in 1968. The Soviet space agency also purchased 100 pens.&quot;<br><br>So both groups used pencils, floating chunks of graphite never even caused a short, someone built a private company to solve a need he saw in the world, and it was so clearly superior, and sufficiently inexpensive, that both space programs bought them.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not quite - you need heat, fuel, and oxygen for a fire (the 3 sides of the fire triangle). Conduction through graphite in an oxygen environment wouldn't meet those requirements. You'd have to use the electricity to heat up something, and for that something to be flammable too.<br><br>It <em>is</em> a danger for your electronics, though, if graphite flakes were to get into your machines. You don't want them short-circuiting.<br><br>Edit @ /u/skraptastic - it's just struck me that you mentioned a pure oxygen atmosphere. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISS_ECLSS" target="_blank">It's kept at an Earth-like composition</a>.

			<p>I'm not sure what you're asking here. A spark would need to cause something flammable to heat up to ignition point. This could happen at a gas station because the gas itself is flammable, and resists electrical conductivity so the energy is converted to heat, but a spark itself reaching from an electronic circuit to a piece of conductive graphite won't cause a fire.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ballast has to be regularly renewed.  Partly this is because mechanical wear turns the angular ballast into rounder pebbles.  <br><br>However, the bigger problem is that the ballast becomes contaminated with finer materials that stop it working so well.  Some of these fines comes from the ballast itself wearing down.  More, however, come from other sources - plant material, wind-blown dirt, dirt carried by surface water, and mud from 'wet beds' (muddy water rising up through the ballast).<br><br>Ballast renewal involves removing the ballast - often with an automated train that supports the track while it does it - and then washing it and replacing it along with fresh ballast.  Some renewal trains do ballast sharpening, which crushes the ballast to make it more angular again.<br><br>YouTube search ballast renewal for some relevant videos.</p>		</li>

			<p>Just wanted to add that many trains have sand sprayers for added traction.  One case where what's great for the train is bad for the track (ballast,) but it would take a <em>lot</em> of trains with their sanders running the entire time to really make a negative impact.  AFAIK sand sprayers are usually only used at low speed/high torque (as in accelerating from a standing stop in adverse conditions.)</p>		</li>

			<p>Some sanding systems are also equipped with a vacuum cleaner like device that sucks up the sand after the locomotive wheels pass. This is primarily to avoid so much sand accumulating on the rails that it interferes with signal systems that detect the presence of trains. These rely on a good electrical connection between train wheels and metal rail, which sand can interfere with being an electrical insulator.  But a side benefit of sand collection is reducing the impact on ballast. </p>		</li>
