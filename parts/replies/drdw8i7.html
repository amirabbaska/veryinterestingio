			<div class="markdown"><p>Want to make real magic? If you have access to a Polaroid, take a picture and immediately begin lightly  rubbing on the back of the photo (I've found using a spoon works best). Don't rub too hard. As the picture begins to develop, use a thin, blunt tipped instrument (think pencil with no lead) to draw lines around various parts of the Polaroid, using different amounts of pressure you can create soft grey, white, or almost black lines on the photo. You have about 5 or so minutes to mess with it. You can also lightly 'push' the image around, distorting it while the silver is still emulsified with the developer. Try all sorts of shit. </p>
<p>Or, try Polaroid transfers, basically peel the back of the Polaroid off and press it against some other hard surface, wood, laminate, plastic, basically anything you can press really hard against. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know how on the bottom of a polaroid there is a larger border?  Most people assume this is so you can pull it out of the camera, but that white tab is where the developing chemicals are.  When the camera ejects the photo it squeezes the developer out of the tab, spreading it over the exposed image.  That is why that part always the part that comes out of the camera first. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was coming online to post this specifically.</p>
<p>I also was under the impression that the ‘new’ version (Polaroid 600) film also had the chemicals in the white ‘base’ (I.e., the place most people hold the photo and shake it), &amp; they were mixed and rolled out under the exposed photo paper by the process of ejecting the print from the camera.</p>
<p>If the answer above is 100% correct, appears I’ve been mistaken for a while.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It does, it's original reason why the white base is there, but it has the nice benefit of allowing you to write on that bit as well. It still passes through rollers on 600/SX-70 cameras to break the pods and evenly spread the chemicals on the print.</p>
<p>As a side note, don't ever shake polaroids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shaking occupies the operator while the photo develops.  It doesn't have any effect, doesn't speed anything up.  You can just set the photo down and it develops just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The old ones that had an opaque layer that you had to peel off after it developed would be slightly damp, so people shook them to help them dry off. But that hasn't been the case for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>NO, you are wrong. Yes memory management is very good, but a human deciding to kill a process should still be considered a valid action.</p></div>		</li>
