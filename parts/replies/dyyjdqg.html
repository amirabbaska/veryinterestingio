<p>Since the metal moves heat into your skin very quickly it feels much hotter than another object that has also been sitting in the sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Extra information for those interested: this is why metal is cold at room temperature. It's still the same ~20C as everything else in the room, just that the metal conducts the heat away from your (warmer) hand much quicker than other, more insulating materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Extra fun, conversely good insulators don't feel as hot or as cold as they are (relative to good conductors).  Here is someone picking up something very hot in their hand but because it's an amazing insulator (space shuttle thermal tile) they are unharmed.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.</p>
<p>Metals are very good conductors and so, in a hot car for example, everything is say 180 degrees.  But leather and plastic are very poor conductors and so will transfer their heat into you much more slowly.  </p>
<p>With a metal you are suddenly subject to nearly all the heat contained in that metal when you touch it.  Thus its able to transfer more heat into the skin of your hands and trigger the hot sensation (or even burn)  </p></div>		</li>

<p>More like all the heat contained in the vicinity of the physical area you're touching.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Respectfully, I think you are incorrect.  That would be true if the material was non-conductive like say plastic or leather.  Your fingers would absorb the local heat and the anti-conduction properties of the material would prevent the heat-energy of the rest of the object from transferring into your finger.     But a metal is highly conductive so when you touch the edge of a seat buckle, the heat from even the far edge is being effectively conducted to your fingers.  Its why metals are used for heat  sinks and thermal pipes and other designs where its desired to move heat from one location to another.   For example imagine a computer chip heatsink.  The sink moves heat from the tiny 1cm square of the chip, though the metal of the sink, to its many fins to be transferred into the air that is blown through the case of the computer.   It could not do this if the metal heatsink didn't conduct heat from once side of the object to the other. </p>
<p>Now yes, some metals like copper conduct heat far better than others like iron.  But all metals as a whole conduct heat much better than nearly all other categories of materials.   </p>
<p>Now water is used in circulating heat systems wherever feasible not because water is very good at a conducting heat (it isn't) but because water can hold a lot of heat.  In fact its got one of the highest &quot;heat-capacities&quot; known to man.  Which makes it fantastic when coupled with metals in a circulating system that physically moves water from the heat source (like an engine or computer chip) to a heat dissipation device, like a radiator made of highly conductive metal)   Which also why radiators are very commonly made of aluminum or copper.  </p>
<p>Now the reason why 170 degree plastic buttons don't burn you, but 170 metal door latch does is because human flesh is full of water, that material than can absorb more heat any other.  In fact water's heat capacity is something like 4.7, where plastic is 1.1.  So with plastic you only pick up the very small total volume of surface heat and the non condutive material resists the rest being transferred into your flesh.  Thus your internal water can't heat to the point of causing tissue damage because the total volume of heat-energy is low.   You get a temporary, small spike in the local tissue heat and your circulating blood quickly normalizes everything back to body temperature.     But with a metal, it can, and the total volume is much higher, and whamo!  You have a burn because it was enough energy-volume to heat the water in your flesh to damaging levels.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why Solar thermal bankets are effective?  They're aluminized to reflect the heat, but it's a thin sheet of plastic, so not a lot of heat capacity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes basically. They make gold coloured ones as well which I believe they reflect better in the IR spectrum where almost all of your heat is emitted. They also act as a windbreaker which is probably just as important as convection is quite effective at moving heat in our atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>
