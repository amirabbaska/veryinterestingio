<p>If you consistently eat high calorie foods, or a particular type of nutrient, your gut and its microbiome will change in response to that level of intake, and you would absorb those calories more efficiently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could that be one reason most diets seem to work at least at first? If you suddenly change your diet, your gut microbiome won't absorb the new food very efficiently for a while.</p>
<p>What kind of time scale are we talking about for readjustment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most fad diets work by quickly reducing temporary water-retention weight. For example, glucose is osmotically active, and to maintain isotonic balance between the extra-cellular and intra-cellular environments the body can hold onto a large amount of water. If you reduce glucose content below normal (low carb diet for example) the extra water is flushed away and the loss of a significant amount of weight is apparent.</p>
<p>However, this is weight-loss, not actual fat loss. For fat loss, it is a lot more complicated, depending on multiple factors, including insulin, glucagon, cortisol etc.</p>
<p>For physiologically healthy individuals, one would need a net energy expenditure of 3500 kcal over metabolic requirements per pound of fat (in reality you wouldn't be able to purely lose the fat, but this is just a simplification).</p>
<p>In regards to your time scale question, I suspect that changing the composition of your gut microflora would take longer than the time most diets (at least the fad variety) start to plateau (mostly due to the water retention loss and not actual body mass loss).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note the distinction between a &quot;fad diet&quot; causing an initial loss in water weight and an initial loss in water weight being how &quot;most fad diets work.&quot;</p>
<p>Low carb (particularly ketogenic) diets do cause a drop in water retention when you use up the glycogen in your liver, but they also aid in the loss of body fat:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many diets engineer a spontaneous reduction of intake, even if they don't actually say anything about eating less. Low carb works because protein is very filling, and fat by itself is not very appetizing. Low fat works because even though carbs are more palatable by themselves, they're not as calorie-dense. Fat and carbs together (especially with salt) are very palatable and are easy to overeat (potato chips are the perfect example), so generally they'll limit one or the other. The restricted choice is also important -- people consistently eat more when there are more choices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since /u/Dradov7 answered most of this already, I'll address just the last question.I'm afraid I don't know the answer to that yet.  It's an interesting question, though.  My best guess is that it depends on how differently you are eating, what the nutrient is, how well your body is able to make adjustments, and how resilient your gut microbiome is.  School is back in session next week, and I'll talk with my advanced nutrition professor and see if there is a ballpark figure out there.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Have been some animal studies involving stool transplants to transport the microbiome from an obese subject to a non-obese subject and seeing the weight changes in the non-obese group?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a pretty cool study, I would be interested in that paper actually. I saw a presentation by one of the researchers working on that study but for the life of me can't remember the name </p>
<p>Edit: if it's even the same study we're thinking about, I believe that same group also found a novel species that might have a link to the mechanism behind gut microbiota switching and the resulting change in metabolism. As I said I only saw the presentation and had to rush out to go do my own work. I might try to find it later, I'll post it when I do</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so sure this is fully correct. The human GI tract is amazingly redundant...in any given normal meal, almost all of your carbs/fats are absorbed before the second half of your small intestines even begin. Are the receptors you are referring to glucose/galactose/fructose receptors? As far as I know these aren't down-regulated for any reason, but I could be wrong about that. As to the bile, yes you could theoretically overwhelm your bile production, but with how content release from the stomach works, only an amount that is able to be handled by the downstream GI system is released over time. So while some calories would pass through (as they always do), I don't think it would be any more than a normal meal. Please feel free to correct any of this info though! I just finished my GI block in med school so this is actually good practice :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of food. Carbohydrates get absorbed really well, proteins to a lesser extent and fats last. So if you eat 4000 kcal of pork fat, most probably you won't get 4000 kcal metabolised.</p></div>		</li>
