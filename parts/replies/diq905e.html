			<div class="markdown"><p>So how does this relate to cut flowers and salads?</p>
<p>I assume that when you harvest a head of lettuce that it's days are numbered but is that instant death for the head?  Or is the wilting of the leaves a sign of death.  I always get the feeling that fresh vegetables and fruits are still alive when we eat them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah in many cases there is still a significant amount of viable tissue.  you can replant lettuce and kale after eating most of it and it will grow back</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tissue, of say a lettuce, will remain alive for as long as possible, meaning that the individual cells will continue to function as long as they have access to the nutrients and water they need. In theory you can keep a detached leaf alive if you give it the proper nutrients and water,  assuming that enough of the conductive tissue is still intact. </p></div>		</li>
