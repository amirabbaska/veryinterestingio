			<p>A state school in 1991 [Massachusetts] cost $2500.00 per semester.  Multiplied by $7.00/hour is 8.5 weeks at 40 hours per week.  Minimum wage in 1991 was the same as minimum wage in 2014.  Back in 1991 I paid $650 for a two bedroom, two story apartment.  The same apartment today cost $1100.  My car was $16000.  The same car today is $32000.  Jobs were a dime a dozen and most offered entry level on the job training.  Graduates today face an employers market where most companies require a minimum of 5 years experience.</p>		</li>

			<p>I find it interesting that even though the numbers are all over this thread, and even though I said AVERAGE meaning some school cost more and some schools cost less, you insist that because it didn't happen to you, it couldn't happen for anybody.<br><br>And not only that, I never said you could put yourself through college on that amount.

			<p>I don't think education has much to do with it, there just aren't enough jobs to go around due to global competition and automation. Nothing would change tomorrow if we instantly gave everybody a masters degree tonight: too many people chasing too few jobs. <br><br>Cars are expensive and have big liability associated with them...no point in owning one if one can't make decent money owning one. <br><br>Also, communication is so much better now that you don't actually have to go travel to &quot;meet&quot; with somebody. One would rather spend the +$10K a year on having fun rather than feeding a car. <br><br>The proportion of jobs are also in the bigger and nicer cities. This is where everyone wants to live. <br><br>Homes are more expensive because the US has exported their wealth to other people in different countries...these people are coming to the US and spending their money on houses. The best cities to live are restricted by geography and have richer people already living there....which constrains the supply for non-wealthy folks. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>You only calculated for one year's work (1280 hours) for a four year college education. If you use the same estimated number of hours per year and multiply it by 4, you end up with 5120 hours of work over a 4 year college education. Assuming the tuition alone is $40k, you would have to make $7.8125/hr gross to cover it.<br><br>Of course, we are forgetting a LOT of variables. Rent alone is a HUGE expediture, not to mention books, lab fees, food, insurance, transportation to work, etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>For what it's worth, it should be noted that the chart you're both referring to is not using 1991 dollars.  The chart says &quot;in current dollars&quot; at the top and appears to have been created in 2007. <br><br>When you use <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=2159&amp;amp;year1=2007&amp;amp;year2=1991" target="_blank">this calculator</a>, it gives you a rough cost of $1,418 in 1991 for full time tuition and fees.  With minimum wage at $4.25, that's 333 hours, or 6.5 hours per week.  Factor in taxes, and 11 hours a week sounds plausible.<br><br><br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>The minimum wage in 1991 was $4.25. The average 4 year university cost was about $8,400. Working 11 hours a week, you would only make $2,431 per year (4.25x11x52). Even if those numbers are a little off, there is still no way you could afford that at 11 hours a week.</p>		</li>

			<p>Lets see.  I think in state tuition back when I was in school in 1993-1994 was about $2,500/semester, or $5,000/year.  <br><br>I think minimum wage was about $4.50/hour, so 11 hours/week is about $50/week x 52 ~= $2500/year.<br><br>That being said, in St. Louis, going to the local community college and then transferring to UMSL was in total about $700/month, which is about what I pay for daycare for my rugrat.  If you are serious and willing to compromise you can find affordable college programs.  If you listen to your high school and college counselors who don't have to pay the bills then they will often recommend something crazy.  I was recruited by a $20,000/year school and they offered me a $5,000 scholarship.  Lets see, $15,000/year plus the expense of going out of state or around $8,000/year and being home after a 2 hour car ride.  Tough choice...</p>		</li>

That is, assuming that you are equally as likely to be on minimum wage, and equally as likely to be able to acquire a job. I'm having a hard time finding a good source for percentage of workers on minimum wage per year. Without that information, it seems useless to hunt for job availability per years. If someone can unlazy themselves and find these, I would appreciate it.<br><br>BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE:<br><a href="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/926781/thumbs/s-COLLEGE-TEXTBOOKS-PRICES-480x360.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.huffpost.com/gen/926781/thumbs/s-COLLEGE-TEXTBOOKS-PRICES-480x360.jpg</a><br>You see that blue line there? Thats the inflation of college text book prices. <br>if 1991 is 200%, and 2013 is looking to be around .... 850%!!!! thats over 4 times the cost of 1991!<br>how much does it cost a year for textbooks, if you want the intended student experience?<br>According to the College Board's 2009 report on Trends in College Pricing, books and supplies cost students at four-year public schools $1,122 per year on average, or $561 per semester.<br><br>Lets calculate the 1991 rate, then:<br><br>1122/850 = x/200<br><br>x = $264<br><br><br>so now, we need to redo the math from earlier:<br><br>9498/7.25/52=HOURS is the equation for 2013 before books.<br><br>it becomes:<br><br>10620/7.25/52 = $28.17!!!!<br><br>3958/4.25/52 = 17.91 <br><br>becomes: 4222/4.25/52 = 19.1<br><br>So, ONLY CONSIDERING minimum wage, textbooks, and instate tuition, it is 147% (28.17/19.1) times harder to support yourself as a student now than in 1991!<br><br><br><br>OH, BUT WAIT, THERE IS SO MUCH MORE!!!!:<br>------------------------------------------------------<br>we need to consider that both of these options will be shifted updward when you factor in the cost of staying alive (food, etc). I'm not going to get into calculations on all that, because that would be impossible to accurately gauge, but thats not my point here. Even if the cost of living was the same, and they both shifted the same amount of hours/week up when you factor in the cost of living, there are new limits set on university students who are working.<br>When I was a worker and a full time student, I was disallowed to work more than 30 hours a week. if it takes 28 hours of work to only afford books and tuition, it is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to support yourself as a student now on minimum wage.</p>		</li>

			<p>I dropped out of Columbia for a year back in 1969. My draft status immediately became 1-A, so the only job I could get was at the Post Office. All you had to do was pass a test, and those jobs were easy to get back then. I worked for $3.05 a hour, lived at home, saved about $5500, and that was enough to pay tuition and live in a dorm for a year at an Ivy League school back in 1970. That sounds pretty ridiculous until you take inflation into account. $3.05 in 1969 is about $20 today, and $5500 then is about $33500 now.</p>		</li>

			<p>tuition was only part of the cost, though.  I remember going to UMR (now called Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology) in 1992 and tuition was roughly 1/3 of the cost, rest was books and housing and other &quot;academic fees&quot;.  If I remember right it was about 3500-3800 per semester, when minimum wage was $4.25/hr.  So in theory you could pay for your schooling as you went with a full time minimum wage job, but only if you put nearly every penny of your paycheck directly in the mail to the school, leaving you nothing to live on.  And that's working full time while attending school, which isn't easy for an engineering student.<br><br>EDIT: Keep in mind that we had to spend 2-300/semester on books back then, too, just like now.  And just like now, most of them weren't even used in class.  And we didn't have the option to just download them.  In fact I seem to remember the missouri university system getting in hot water because of how much they had in fees to make their tuition look low.</p>		</li>

			<p>I completely agree that the cost of education has gone up far more than it should have and here's a good <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2014/03/22/its-impossible-to-work-your-way-through-college-nowadays/" target="_blank">blog post</a> you can refer people to who &quot;don't believe this.&quot;<br><br>However, this alone doesn't answer the OP's question (and may even just be a red herring). In the year you mentioned only <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-08/millennials-become-most-educated-u-s-age-group-due-to-recession.html" target="_blank">23% of people</a> in their late 20s had a college degree, now it's closer to 33%. So the cheaper cost of college can't be the only factor (or even a major one) why previous generations could more easily afford housing since only about a fifth of them were affected by the cost of a college education.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeownership_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">Home ownership rates in the U.S.</a> has averaged in the mid to high 60s over the last 50 years. Which means even if every single person with a college degree from previous generations owned a home it would only make up about a third of homeowners. If two-thirds of homeowners don't have a degree the cost of paying for one cannot be the sole or primary factor.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't know about 1991, but ...<br>In 1981 I started at a large midwestern land grant university. I was an out of state student, on a &quot;full ride&quot; scholarship that covered tuition, books, fees, and $100 per month stipend. That $100 was enough to keep me in beer and pizza. My dorm cost (with 20 meals/week) was low enough my lower-middle class parents could cover it.<br><br>Because reasons, I lost the scholarship, and to protest the &quot;excessive hike in tuition&quot; the next fall, several of my friends and I paid our tuition in $1 bills. My tuition for two semesters of full-time college was $1100.<br><br>I moved off-campus, and paid for the last three years of school myself, with no scholarships and no financial aid. I worked two jobs every summer, and worked temp manual labor every long weekend/break, and earned enough at crappy no-skill minimum wage jobs to cover my costs.<br><br>My senior year I took classes over the summer, so I stayed at school and instead of working two jobs, worked part time for Domino's delivering (and later making) pizzas.<br><br>Graduated from a four-year university with no debt in December 1985.<br><br>On the other hand, one of my sons went to a private school where tuition was $16,000 per semester, and my other son is at an out of state university with tuition of $35,000 per year. Even with scholarships and aggressive savings in 529 plans, there is literally no way in the world for them to graduate without debt.</p>		</li>

			<p>You mentioning 529 savings accounts reminded me - I used a 529 savings account to calculate the estimated amount I'd need to save if I had 2 children starting college in 20 years (I have no children) and it said...<br><br>&gt; If your goal is to cover 100% of the $215,064 projected cost of college, <br>&gt; you will need to start making monthly contributions of $465 to meet that goal.<br><br>... per child.  That's 1/3 of my gross pay.<br><br>In the future, colleges will be small, lavish estates for only the wealthy.

			<p>It's not intentional, it's how a free market works. If your product is too cheap, demand will outstrip supply. Prices increase as those who have more money are willing to pay extra to make sure they get some product while those who don't have that money lose out.

			<p>While I agree with your analysis of free markets, that's not what's happening. Students aren't becoming more wealthy, they're going deeper into debt. They'll give you more than enough rope to hang yourself with. You're right, though, until people send a message and stop paying these ridiculous prices, things will continue down this path. <br><br>I recommend community college. My brother went there for less than my parents paid for high school and still got his masters from the big-name university. They never presented that as an option when I was graduating HS.

			<p>&gt; <em>It has very little to do with being wealthy and more to do with a willingness to go into debt.</em><br><br>Not really. Subsidized loans (government using tax dollars to guaranty private banks make a profit on every tuition payment) just distort the time frames involved, but the principles are still the same. As long as more people qualify for those loans than there are spaces at universities, the price will continue to go up. The larger the imbalance, the faster the increases. At some point the cost of college will exceed the potential future earnings for a significant number of people and they will start defaulting on their loans. The supply of people willing to go into debt will evaporate along with the supply of banks willing to lend them money, leaving only the people who can either afford to pay cash or the people who will earn enough to pay for the debt. In other words, not poor or middle class people.<br><br>Either way, the fact remains that increasing the demand for a product will never make it more affordable. Increasing the supply is how you drive down prices. Don't think for a minute our politicians don't know that, but what's more profitable for banks?</p>		</li>

			<p>As much as it would be nice for everyone to receive a well-rounded four year education, there are many people who aren't well suited to that form of education.  Add on that we keep trying to educate people when they're least likely to appreciate it and be effective students, and the odd conflation of personal improvement with job skills.  Finally, ladle on the perception that college = guaranteed money, pushed by a generation of high schools, and you have a lot of people who don't want to be plumbers, electricians, or linesmen.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with having a trades job and going to college to improve yourself.  You get the benefit of stable income, you get personal improvement, and maybe even a career boost. But the idea that you can get loans for 5 years of incredibly expensive schooling and then somehow get a job that pays well enough to pay off the loans is a joke.  Of all of the people I know who hold bachelors degrees or higher, only one recent graduate is making decent money without a lot of school debt.  He's a web graphics designer and definitely at the edge of the bell curve as stories go.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not like humans don't have a long history of making a living off of talking. Communication is often way more important in business than the quality of your product or services. Apple products are not the highest quality or most effective electronics on the market, but many people seem to think so. Most politicians are not the best candidates for governing, and acting in the best interests of their constituents, but that doesn't stop them from getting elected. The best selling books, movies and television programs aren't always the most artistic, most intelligent, or what we might consider a masterpiece, but it doesn't mean they don't make a huge pile of money. <br><br>It is foolish to think that somehow &quot;making&quot; has ever been more successful than &quot;talking&quot;.

			<p>Well, it's all subjective isn't it?<br><br>It doesn't take a study to realize that the human condition is to always want more than you have. Satisfaction is fleeting and we tend to set a new goal almost before we achieve the first. The key difference as far as income is concerned is that it is possible to reach a point where your every need is taken care of, and any pursuit towards further income is not about sustenance/subsistence. There is a point where you have so much wealth, that you can live off interest alone, and would never see the end of your money assuming you live a life without extreme excess.<br><br>Money is power though, and it often continues to fuel inspiration to acquire more and more. That is where the unhappiness can set in. The struggle is no longer about obtaining wealth to secure a stable lifestyle, it is now to obtain wealth and influence to further some other goals. <br><br>As for class struggle, well it is and always be a very real thing. Those who struggle to make ends meet will always look longingly upon those who have more than enough, just as those who have so much will often start to see themselves as more than those still caught in the struggle. The humanitarian point of view would say that those who have achieved great wealth should consider putting some of that wealth to use improving the lives of those less fortunate, particularly those who labor underneath them to have enabled such wealth.<br><br>In any case, the original point of my comment was to point out that it is possible to earn enough to cover cost of living and provide for your future, and not feel the need to acquire more wealth beyond that. Greed is a very real thing, and it is dangerous and can lead to predatory behavior. There is something notable about being able to achieve happiness with moderate success. </p>		</li>

			<p>I agree on the loan thing - I think loans should be available for students, and be a very low-interest loan provided directly by the government, only available to be paid to non-profit schools.  The repayment rate and deferral should be tied to graduation and employment. Pick a major that is in demand, considered a career critical to the success of the country, or one that will end in public service?  Very low rates.  Want to be one of the 3000% of excessive marine biology graduates?  Higher rates.  Loans should cover room &amp; board but be tied to grades.  It'd drop the number of people partying for 5, encourage studiousness, and set students up to succeed instead of fail.<br><br>Community college is <em>relatively</em> cheap.

			<p>Ive always said id go broke putting my kids through college if what they wanted to do required it, however at what point do trade jobs and non college based respectable professions far outweigh the cons of graduating college with a mountain of devt and no job prospects in that field?

			<p>Yep, I predict a resurgence in people going into trade jobs as the current occupants (many of whom are boomers) retire or die.  You're always going to need plumbers, HVAC techs, pipe fitters, and electricians.  Hell, I'm walking away from a decade+ of IT and tech work and applying to become an electrician.<br><br>Get this - the average salary of a bachelor's degree holder in the US is the same as the average salary of an electrician - $55k.  I can go to school for on avarage 5.5 years, get a degree, have a mountain of debt and maybe get a job, or I can sweat my ass off for 5 years as an electrician's apprentice and graduate with no debt into an actively hiring industry.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;  sweat my ass off<br><br>I would argue the vast majority of those looking into schooling are wanting to avoid this. Physically taxing jobs are in lower demand, and it's very possible to graduate from a large research university with little or no debt and get a job that pays incredibly well. Trades are good career paths for some but I would definitely say the majority of people don't want to sweat their ass off at their job unless they're making much, much more money.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sure - when the housing market went bust, so did all of the people building the homes, electricians included.  There's no job that is &quot;unemployment proof&quot;, except perhaps that of &quot;expensive CEO&quot;.  But with retirement rates and infrastructure condition, the need for tradespeople is going to expand and stay with high demand over the next couple of decades, no problem.<br><br>It has become somewhat more specialized, naturally, and probably will continue to do so, but the traditional apprenticeship model of training is significantly easier for most people to afford - especially young people who likely have few costs.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not sure why people are downvoting you.  I have no idea how old you are or what your situation is, but it sounds like maybe you're pretty young still and / or not established in life.<br><br>Don't worry too much about the loan balance right now - pay it down as much as you can, make sure you make minimum payments and leverage any interest rate reductions you can manage.  When you get established in life and your income-expense ratio is better you can pay it off in chunks, if you want.<br><br>At one point I owed around $16,000 to the IRS.

			<p>Honestly, looking at current pay rates is so extremely short-sighted and not a good way to decide whether going/not going to college was a good decision. It's about the increase in earnings over a lifetime, which is much higher, on average, for those with college degrees. Also, generally the jobs you get with a college degree are much less physically demanding and you can have regular hours, both things that most people desire</p>		</li>

			<p>We would have something equivalent to this here in Ireland. It's often run by universities who cater for adult learning. I did this for a year, but it became too tricky. Driving up to uni after work was a pain, and the travel for my work meant I'd often miss a couple of weeks at a time. Would definitely recommend it to people who can manage those challenges. I like the OU because for many courses it's mostly online, with a few tuition groups in person, but most of it done remotely. Works pretty well if I find myself on the other side of the planet for a couple of weeks.<br><br>Good call on the online stuff. Things like Khan Academy have a lot of good materials available.

			<p>Not sure why you're getting down voted.  Everyone these days is told by their parents and teachers all through their life that they need to go to university to get a job in today's job market.  A couple generations ago going to university was the exception not the rule and as much as every parent wants their little johnny to be a doctor and not a welder, the world still needs skilled laborors. If you have the drive and mental faculties to become an architect or an astronaut, fucking awesome!  Many young people however, end up making smoothies at Booster Juice with an arts major on their wall and a huge student loan looming over them because they were told that going to school is how you get a job.<br><br>  TL; DR:  Unless you know exactly why you're there, don't waste your or your parents money on university.

			<p>I was a student in college from 2002 to 2010. Had to pay almost all of my college out of pocket. From the time I started my AA to the my last semester pursuing my masters my tuition almost quadrupled.</p>
<p>When I started a class book, materials, and fees was somewhere in the area of 200-250$ (so a full semester ~4 classes ran typically in 800-900$)</p>
<p>By 2005 it was closer to 350. Pushing the cost per semester up to ~1400$.</p>
<p>My Last year each class could run as much as 800$. Tuition and book costs had increased dramatically. Putting the total at about 3200$ a semester.</p>
<p>When I started a part time job paying about 9$ an hour was plenty for tuition and a cheap apartment.</p>
<p>In 2005 I was a fulltime student working five jobs to make ends meet, and one of those jobs was also fulltime. To this day I don't know how I made it through that year.</p>
<p>By 2008 I nailed a good job so was able to drop so finally only had a full time job and school. But that was making around 14$ hr, and money was tight at that.</p>
<p>I can't imagine the barrier to entry since tuitions gone up since then, but minimum wage and opportunities for these students is barely a blip on the radar compared to what was available to me in 2002. It's not surprising there are so many skipping college and dropping out. It's sad :/</p>		</li>

			<p>I went to a State school as and was awarded a scholarship that covered my tution which I was very lucky to get. I was so suprised to see how quickly tuiton doubled. I started classes in ugust of 2008 and my school cost about 1500 a semester, but by the time I graduated in 2012 tuition had raised to almost 4000 a semester. I was disgusted at how quickly tuiton prices raised so quickly!</p>		</li>

			<p>When I grew up, union auto workers with a high school education supported their families on a single income. My family was relatively poorer but my parents sacrificed to put me through private school so that I would be better off than they were. I got a full ride scholarship, graduated without debt, bought a house at 25, and saved most of my kids' tuition before they had their 7th birthday. As soon as the kids are established, I'm going to semi-retire. My parents raised to believe this sort of success was the only option there was.<br><br>Today I see so many young people struggling and it seems like so many people from my generation are just greedy and don't realize that our future depends on young people being able to succeed. I'm proud of my kids, but I'm also proud of the bright young people who have worked for me, who I have seen go on to their own successes, even when it means they are competing with me (I'm an engineering consultant). I figure the rising tide lifts all boats.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't want to be that guy, but your sons don't need to go to a private school nor does everyone need to go to a (top end) university. Somehow everyone has the idea that they need a university degree which devalues degrees but at the same time we create a shortage of manual labour people. It's kind of a wish these days to study something (let's not get into the less sensible courses) and end up behind a desk instead of doing something outside like a roofer or welder. <br><br>Also while education certainly isn't cheap, let's just say they go to a regular high school and then to university 3 years at 35k is roughly 100k USD. Take the same summer jobs as you did they could easily shave off about 10k a year and endup with a debt of 70k. Mind you this is from a proper university which again it's not something we all need to do. <br><br>Also let's not forget that the biggest debt is gathered by a small group, the vast majority of those with a degree have zero or little debt. Also the idea of this debt little (or big) should be able to be paid of by what you studied. Which again comes in the first question, what did you actually study.<br><br>I tend to think the question about millennials is kind of loaded and difficult to answer. I tend to think we live in a time after almost 70 years no local wars, we live in a prosper our (grand) parents could only dream of. We also tend to think we have the right to get everything, owning a house isn't as common ever as we like to think, heck home ownership is at the top (60% in the Netherlands vs less then 40% 2 decades ago) also our houses are much better and bigger then ever before. Also look at home (i'm an 80's person) having a TV was normal back then but now pretty much everywhere are screens a console is also pretty normal and so on. Last but not least the US especially debt is very normal, it undermines your own economy trying to own what actually isn't yours. Buying on lease or properties on a scale you shouldn't be able to afford is now finally cut down by central governments and we should praise this. Somehow we have forgotten 2008 already and yet we complain our government from preventing the next one.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm one semester away from finishing my B.S. Over the last four years, I have been working full time and taking at least two classes per semester. Two classes, online, at a state university costs me just over $3,000. It's gone up a a hundred dollars or so each semester. Online tuition is comparable to in-state tuition. I have not taken any loans. I either pay cash up front for the semester or use the school's payment plan. The only reason I've been able to do this is because I already have a full-time job that pays middle-class wages. I got extremely lucky. There's no way I could do this with a part-time job on minimum wage.</p>		</li>

			<p>Paying for higher education is a silly corporate trap (Yes, universities are corporations, and yes, I fell into their advertised trap).<br><br>The internet has allowed anyone to get a higher education for free (Thank you OpenCourseWare and other similar programs). What you're tuition is truly for is that not so shiny piece of paper and the accreditation that goes along with it. Yea, it might have a shiny emblem, but with the cost of tuition, my father was expecting it printed on a gold sheet.<br><br>Hopefully more job recruiters look at people's actual skillset and less at their GPA and institution of learning.</p>		</li>

			<p>The transcript is part of the school property.  There are some loopholes posted that might be moot now that say - get your transcript and hold on to it but most current schools (mine included) require for the official copy to be no more than a year old.  There have been plenty of court cases but nothing that says they cannot do it - there are a few schools that do not do it and there are very rare exceptions made but generally you're fucked - you can google about a ton of cases like the guy who got a full ride to a school so he can receive a better degree in order to receive a job to get out from default but couldn't go because his school (Temple) wouldn't release a transcript.  A full ride...  And plenty of examples of people whose careers are stalled for the same reason (employer wants transcript for better position and you're SOL).<br><br>From <a href="http://www.finaid.org/educators/withholdingtranscripts.phtml" target="_blank">finaid</a><br><br>&quot; US Department of Education Guidance<br><br>Dear Colleague Letter CB-98-13 indicated that colleges were permitted, even encouraged, to withhold academic transcripts in cases involving defaults on Title IV loans, but not required to do so.   <br>   <br>As a result of a borrower's default in the Title IV Student Loan Programs, the Department of Education <strong>encourages</strong> the withholding of academic transcripts. The withholding of academic transcripts is solely an institutional decision, but has resulted in numerous loan repayments. &quot;<br><br>Emphasis is theirs, only it's underlined - not sure how to underline.</p>		</li>

			<p>This used to be true, but these days you wont even get the call without a degree.  Level 1 monkey jobs can be had without too much effort, but its difficult to move beyond your company in that situation and requires years in the trenches and secondary education in the form of technical certification. <br><br>I had 13 years in it/telecom with DBA/business intelligence/analytics core skills and when i was fed up and tried to move on, it was about who I knew, not what I knew that landed me the job I have now. <br><br>It sucks but we got fucked into thinking that flipping burgers is all you can do without a degree.  <br><br>They killed the skilled trades and convinced us that blue collar was a sign of failure or an indication of personal worth.  <br><br>I'm 37 and by they I mean our parents.  They weren't necessarily wrong, they just took it too far.  We need tradesmen(and women). <br><br>I have gotten off my main point that even IT has changed.  If you don't get some sort of secondary training, you're still screwed.  Its just a lot cheaper to get some technical certs than it is to get a degree.  </p>		</li>

			<p>This guy knows.  Currently working at a fortune 500 in IT.  I was hired in because I have certifications out the ass.  Since they've restructured, people without degrees are getting the boot.  I was passed up for promotion despite years of experience and certs for some  one less than six months on the job and zero prior experience.  Why?    Because they had a history degree.  </p>		</li>

			<p>The problem is they let MBA's and Humanities majors with ITIL or Six Sigma start running IT departments and they only want to hire people like themselves. They figure they got where they are by getting a degree therefore that's the best (and only) way. To promote non-degree candidates would be an admission that maybe their own method is not the best. </p>		</li>

			<p>Just a question. I graduated with a psychology degree but my nerdiness with computers landed me an IT job. It pays ok and it's mindless help desk support to doing database admin, BI, and coding. Do you think that without some technical certifications or without the relevant degree that I am fucked if I search for DBA positions? The job I have now has an absurd amount of mobility and there are many paths I can take. Just would like it if I could do the IT route but I won't waste my time if it doesn't help me. Im almost 3 years in. Thinking about going elsewhere in 5-10 years. Thanks!</p>		</li>

			<p>The whole IT certification process is complete bullshit. I've met people with certs up the ass who couldn't code themselves out of a box. In fact most Microsoft certifications have online cheats that help you cram from the exam. The moment I realized I could spend 12-20 hours to get a Microsoft cert and pass it with flying colors that I realized it wasn't worth the paper it was printed on. A lot of places care about those certs, and for fun I would be more than happy to outline how to match a Microsoft cert with the right cheat sheet that costs you 70 bucks. So 150 for the exam, 70 bucks, and a few days of cramming -- almost a sure bet you will pass based on your aptitude. <br><br>On top of it, a lot of times Microsoft gears the next years exams heavily towards the newest flavor of the month, which in most positions is worthless. Takes years to adopt the new bells and whistles, and 70% of the time those bells and whistles are wasted/un-needed/out of style. <br><br>I apologize for the rant, but anyone who waves a stack of certifications at me in IT only provides me with toilet paper in case of emergencies. Its a racket designed to syphon money. </p>		</li>

			<p>Generally I would agree with you, but it really depends on which certs you're talking about.  The ms certs are certainly bullshit. Oracle and Cisco not so much.  I have been working on the AWS certs and they are pretty thorough and nothing to sniff at.<br><br>I'd also like to say that a cert doesn't mean someone knows what they are doing just like a degree doesn't.  My point still stands though that even in tech, a degree is almost required just to get an interview for anything more advanced than help desk or level 1 positions.   <br><br>     Certain certs can be as effective as a degree for getting your foot in the door, but to your point, there are way too many people who have certs that have no business having them.</p>		</li>

			<p>I would tend to agree that Oracle and Cisco certs are certainly more indepth than Microsoft ones. I personally have not taken those certs, but have friends who have, and it isn't easy. <br><br>I qualify my statement because an IT Director I worked for, for a number of years, had multiple Cisco certs and a collection of books on his shelf. But he didn't understand how default gateways work, or how to properly structure a network. So he was smart enough to pass the tests, but not smart enough to utilize that knowledge in any sensible way. I wasn't the only one left dumbfounded at that organization...</p>		</li>

Unless you are making about 150k+ its usually irrelevant.<br><br>Put a 4 year degree on your resume. 90 times out of 100, if you have the right attitude, and the right problem solving skills, the degree will be irrelevant. <br><br>In fact, the best knowledge I gained during college was related to history and science in general, not computer science. Most of the things they are teaching you is using books that are 3+ years old, and at the pace that technology platforms are developing, it is usually out of date, and the jobs you get are dead end based on what you learned in college. <br><br></p>		</li>

I've just made a long <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2pvx53/eli5_the_millennial_generation_appears_to_be_so/cn0vbjl" target="_blank">post</a> in this thread about this very thing.  <br><br>Take away all of these degrees everyone calls useless from every school or adjust their tuition by the average potential income you will receive from it.  If the degree is useless, then why are you charging 50k/year for it?  And if you take away - well, let's see what happens to the generations 50-100 years from now who produce leaders that need to be fucking told that Iraq is not Iran (to use a cliche example but it is a cliche example that should not be forgotten nor forgiven); Yale - his university - is, over the the course of 40 past years, the #1 school for grade inflation.  Harvard was a running joke in Boston by not only the student body but by the faculty who taught there.  As an undergraduate, you show up and you pass with a C or better.    This is a somewhat of a tangent but it is related to the fact that we have a system churning out people who do NOT come from wealthy families that relies on those individuals to exist.  <br><br>You take away all of the liberal education from a school that inflates its grades, you're left with (amazing, but few) schools like MIT and the rest would absolutely vanish without lowering their cost or/and restructuring their curriculum to accommodate.  Yes, some schools do this, but again - you're 17, you're not told this shit.  You're told to apply to those that are as top tier as your grades will allow and to study what you want and follow your dreams and all that bullshit.<br><br>If you're lucky, maybe more lucky in today's economy than in the economy of the 90s, someone slaps you and says, NO, don't do that (my sister 12 years younger than myself is a good example - working, community college, going for AA in nursing, so she can work while continuing her BA, etc. - but she has me to thank for this lesson - most of her friends are still following this trend).<br><br>And as much as I love philosophy, I am the last person to advocate any 18 year old to pay 40k/year for it.  Sadly, the 40+ year old school counselors and financial advisers at my university had never even hinted at my options, quite the opposite, the encouraged to finish, just take more loans, you'll be fine, you'll get into a great grad school and defer till whenever - what economy collapse?  what life illness?  Nonsense, you're fine.  Your degree is not useless.  Here's your bill.  </p>		</li>

			<p>As another pointless sidenote - I actually held a job since the age of 11, when I first moved to the states from Russia.  I still remember the night when I was accepted and saw the bill, thinking, there is no way, then hearing my mom say how she will sell our apartment back in Moscow if we have to to pay for it.  But I got a full ride the first year and the 2nd year she changed her mind (she's never actually supported me financially after we moved - I even had to buy my own food etc. so I'm not sure why in the fuck I believed her).  But as a bunch of people pointed out - in the end, I am responsible, I chose to go there, chose to believe these things, chose the degree, and chose to stay after my grants were taken away and my advisers told me it would all work out.  I'm not blaming anyone.  I'm doing my best with where I am (I left the country to reduce rent, freelanced to save up to afford state school, ate nothing but pasta for ages, etc.) and after finding out what I just found out, well.. I feel like I'm finally out of options.<br><br>Some prison inmates can get MAs for free.. Jesus I just did a *google and the top result is my <a href="http://www.bu.edu/pep/about_us/" target="_blank">own school</a> that gave out 350 BAs and 39 MAs last year to inmates.  <br><br>And here I am defending a decision to better myself when I was 18 by going there (edit: like I'm some kind of a criminal myself).  Yeah they have a criminal record, but try getting a job that pays more than 10 bucks an hour with a shitty credit (one of the PMs actually offered me a 40k/year position if I could pass a credit check, and this wouldn't have been the first time I had to say I could not).</p>		</li>

			<p>/u/noturebutok, have you looked into filing for bankruptcy?  I am a lawyer, but sadly this is not my area.  even so, your story is awful and I feel there should be some relief for you somewhere.  I found an article on nolo which is often a pretty reliable source for legal information, and their reasoning SOUNDS solid.  when you file for bankruptcy, all sorts of thing are automatically &quot;stayed.&quot;  per this article, many courts have held that this would include preventing a college from withholding your transcript.  since I'm not a bankruptcy lawyer I don't know if this is true, but it sounds plausible, so I sincerely this could work for you!  here is the article, why don't you take a look and call around to some bankruptcy attorneys!  I definitely would.  <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/getting-college-transcripts-through-bankruptcy.html" target="_blank">http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/getting-college-transcripts-through-bankruptcy.html</a></p>		</li>

			<p>I have looked into it but believe it or not my credit was virtually spotless until I got laid off (eventually I ran some CC bills when I had to resort to them to pay for food but nothing outlandish - the bigger non-school related expenses came later from a couple of ER visits (asthma &amp; accident at a farm I was volunteering - still have nerve damage because I couldn't afford the recommended follow up to a hand specialist)).   <br><br>Anyway, yes looked into it; I knew it would not erase the school debt but I did not know anything about transcripts - since the transcript issue did not cross my mind until yesterday - why would it, after all, I just kind of assumed it's a piece of paper that says what I did - I'm fucking looking at it right now you know.  <br><br>Thanks for the article, I will read over it and will see what my options are.  Unfortunately, I'm already dealing with legal doodoo so what little savings I have will need to go towards a lawyer 3000 miles away who can show up to court and clear me of whatever the fuck they've accused me of (I had literally found out 2 days ago - yeah I'm having a great week - that there's a warrant out for something I did in Boston a year ago while I was living in Mexico - haven't stepped foot in boston since '09, but I still have to show up in person to prove it or hire someone - they cannot just scan my freaking passport or look at my bank accounts?  Yeah, 'happens all the time' every lawyer told me.. great freaking system.. let's not forget I need a license which is suspended to be able to get a job where I live - I'm even considering getting an FM3 in Mexico and a license/IP instead just because fuck the reinstatement fee that I shouldn't have to pay for their mistake)<br><br>Sorry I'm rambling now, everything is just kind of starting to flood the more I talk.  Thanks for the article.  Bloody hell man, one day you're about to start a new life after 2 months of studying the GREs, the next day you're explaining to people on reddit your life story like you're in a courtroom and you've been jacking off for the past 10 years; fucking AMAs from ex-heroin addicts who've gone clean get more respect - maybe that's my calling, nobody would blame me for it, they'd all say, oh yeah, he turned to a life of crime because of circumstance then wrote a book about it and is a new person, good for him).</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm sorry, I do sympathize.  Believe it or not, when I was a young person I had really similar problem.  I'm 45 now and everything's fine, but I too had legal problems in my early 20s from crap like not taking care of things and accidentally getting charges against me etc.  And yes, our legal system is very messed up, in lot of places, all over the place.  I also had my driver license suspended because I forgot to pay my insurance payment.  Try to hang in there!!  Just hang in there and try to learn from the madness, and maybe by the time you're middle aged, you can tell funny stories about it.  <br><br>Just remember that human are just creatures, and every system created by human is doomed to be hilarious and awful.  You must learn this, and expect it.  It is the only way not to be harmed by it.  But when we are young, most of us are taught to revere our system and think of it in a very idealistic way.  It's disillusioning when we find it's not true.  And dangerous.<br><br>Anyway, go ahead and call a bankruptcy attorney.  For starters, it's free to call.  Find out if it's true that you would get an automatic stay that would keep the college from withholding your transcript.  Also find out if you qualify.  It's just a mathematical test comparing your income and assets and your debt etc.  <br><br>Once you know if you qualify and if it will help you, then you can worry about how to pay.<br><br>When cold-calling lawyer, always call several and make sure they give you basically the same answer.   One thing about it is these days there are lots of them around, so there are plenty to call.  However, just because someone went to law school doesn't mean they always give the right answer or aren't greedy or lazy. <br><br>Best of luck to you!  I'm afraid I must log off for the evening because I have kids who wake me up early, and I don't get to reddit too much.  <br><br>Hang in there!!  When life is rough, it (almost always) has to get better.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for the kind words man :)  Yeah, that's the thing - I was clean, spotless man.  No tickets, no nothing.  I left the state with only the loans that I had and left the country in 2010 - whatever I was summoned for was a summons last may, 2013.  So I cannot possibly have done it unless it's something they dug up from ages ago but I don't know what it could be, my only thing was a speeding ticket and a DUI, both of which I settled (and DUI is from a different court/I have the paper in front of me w/ the docket # and it's not it).  Anyway - they won't tell me what it is - I'm trying to get a lawyer to find out (some redditor offered to swing by - maybe they will).<br><br>You're right - and it's what you learn in philosophy and overall through my many (very many) hardships, I've kept a positive attitude, and still do, don't get me wrong, and I'm sure this will be added to the list once/if I get through it (I won't lie, I had such a rough year, I'm starting to doubt this last part for the first time in my life).  Nietzsche is big on laughter, the absurd, the whole existence etc.  And it always makes perfect sense but when you're in the thick of it - well like you said, you know.  <br><br>It doesn't help that I have no friends as I've been traveling for so long and my mother, she does let me stay here but that's it, she does it out of pity I think because she's the reason I'm in debt (if not for her salary increase, I'd be clear) and she's done many other things I won't list - but mostly it's because as she said just the other day, she made the wrong decision to have a child at the age of 21, that child being me.  She listed all of the dreams she could not pursue because of it before she realized what she said but she didn't apologize for it, just got more angry at me - it was during our 2 hour drive for me to pick up a motorcycle I bought so I can travel between now and the start of school year for my MA.<br><br>So, on a related note, now I have to deal with THAT as being one of the assets I might have to lose.  It's probably super illegal to gift it to someone and I have no one to gift it to anyway but there are some exemptions on that - well I will find out.<br><br>But yeah, I called about 20 lawyers about my thing in Boston, all gave different answers, guesses, prices, possibilities, solutions, etc.  I'll do the same here.  <br><br>My main goal is to get the transcript, to take the GRE test under all this pressure and to meet the deadline - if I can do all of that, I can deal with the rest in a timely manner.  If not - well - then I will deal with that too.  <br><br>Sadly, I have been living for 20 years with the last line in my head - and I've accepted it will not get better, but I've never accepted that I have to stop trying.  And in the end, I can walk into almost any situation, anywhere in the world, and figure out any problem/solution better than most people in the room - so that has been the benefit of it all.  I flew in blind to Colombia, knowing no one, had established myself within weeks with friends/job/apartment/life - total spent must have been 1500 including the tickets.  So all that you say - there is value in all of this, however we phrase it - but when you're in the middle of the storm, it's all just words on the page.  After I click send - well, you know.<br><br>Thanks for the kind words man, whether you know it or not, they do mean a lot in a time like this and I really don't want to make one of those posts on a sub, I don't know why, but yeah - I've always tried to just push through it on my own.</p>		</li>

			<p>Last I checked, community college was still at least a thousand dollars a class here once fees are accounted.  <br><br>Took me a few years, but I finally looked up the word <em>prestige</em> in the dictionary.  I don't think most public universities have really adapted to the expansions that society has undergone, and consequently, I don't really think they really try to bridge the gaps between the various missions set to them by state legislatures.  They really need to start diverging into mass advanced education institutions that embrace technology, and specialized venues for those pursuing the pinnacle of their fields for those that have already passed or CLEP'd through them.  <br><br>This wouldn't be such a big deal if secondary public education wasn't such a colossal failure.</p>		</li>

			<p>I was going to a community college to get the cheaper price on classes I needed for my degree. Our price was $100/unit for classes you intended to transfer. However if you never intended to transfer the credits it was only $48/unit or some bullshit. BUT: if you ever changed your mind and decided you wanted a full 4 year degree and needed to transfer the credits the school would oblige.... if you made up the difference plus 5% per year after course completion.  If needed to be paid, in full,  before the would release a transcript for transfer.<br><br>Absolute bullshit considering the community college was a &quot;partner school&quot; and half the university classes were taught on the Community College campus. :/ I'm not even sure how it's legal as it was a state college system.</p>		</li>

			<p>Get into Sales! You can get a pretty base (50-60k+ commissions) and there are no pre-req's for degrees or experience. It is the best route for &quot;lost&quot; people after graduating. If you do well, you can have a doubled salary in a just a few months. If you do bad, well, at least you had a good job for 6 months and maybe put away some savings. Check into tech sales.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, frankly....I've never heard of someone not getting a retail job because of bad credit, so I would examine other reasons why perhaps you didn't get that job. Other than that, just find out what tech companies are in your area, or are in a city you'd be willing to live in. There are hubs all over the US. <br><br>Look for titles &quot;Sales Development Representative&quot;, &quot;Business Development Representative&quot; or &quot;Lead Generation&quot;. These are all entry-level sales jobs. They are essentially booking meetings for account executives to close on. An example of tech sales is like selling for Google or LinkedIn. <br><br>You aren't selling a &quot;hard&quot; product like a sweater, you are selling a software or value of a digital product. Its very different from retail but easy if you are determined. </p>		</li>

			<p>To respond to your first point - <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryhannon/2013/03/16/has-your-credit-report-cost-you-a-job/" target="_blank">one in ten are denied jobs due to credit</a>.  I guess you've never had a deep background done - I've had one back when I was in good standing with everyone.  Some top top level companies will hire fucking detectives like you're applying for the CIA.  They take everything into account and credit = trust and is a giant factor for any top position where you handle finances/assets.<br><br>I would be willing to relocate - I heard Austin is booming with tech, so I will add that to my list of things to research, thank you.  Relocating will be a problem as it will prevent me from getting free rent but if I can land some potential job prospects beforehand, why not.<br><br>You said entry-level but is that true entry level or do I still need to know a lot?  Or is this more like, no base pay/minor if any training &amp; commission only so that it's 100% up to me (because that part, I think I can definitely do well).</p>		</li>

			<p>I had to do a deep background check for my current job. I said it is unlikely for retail jobs that you were denied because of that---honestly, look into it. <br><br>And these sales jobs are entry level with a BA. I have a History BA and within three months after college, applied for 10 jobs in tech sales, got 7 interviews and 3 job offers in a matter of 2 weeks. My first job was for a 50k base and a total potential earning of 65k w/ bonuses/commissions. I did very well and in 8 months moved to a different company with a higher base of 60k and total potential bonuses/commissions of 75k, which Im confident I will achieve. My roles are SDR (Sales Development Rep), in California. In Austin, it would be about 10-20k less base, but the standard of living would balance it out to be comparable to mine. <br><br>Look at start-ups. Less competitive, fun office perks, and good health insurance. <br><br>My experience before this job was basically working part-time at Urban Outfitters and college. </p>		</li>

			<p>Jesus, guessing you're in SV?  I'm in SD and I don't see a tech industry here of any kind unless it's something totally over my head.  50k base with no tech experience?  What's your secret here?  Commission only I get, but without tech experience - why would someone hand you 50k?  Or is this more about the people/networking and not so much as the tech itself.<br><br>Either way - could you recommend any non-CL places I should start looking because hell yeah..  <br><br>p.s. sorry about the misunderstanding, fair enough - and no it was definitely my credit.  But this was a long time ago nothing to check at this point.  It was for a manager position, which means I had the keys to the store, so in theory could walk out with a several hundred thousand bucks worth of merchandise or whatever it was (downtown Boston - pretty much the spot).</p>		</li>

			<p>Linkedin and Glassdoor are the only places to look for tech jobs. I had no secret, I just understood the jobs and explained that in my interviews---they dont hire based off of skill, they hire based of of intelligence and culture fit. Everyone in sales at both companies I work(ed) are straight out of college w/ no prior experience. <br><br>Yes, Im in SF. But Austin is a tech hub, and LA/SD area will have fewer jobs, but for the price of living in that area, its not much different from the Bay Area so you might consider a move if you find a job. THe average SDR role in the Bay area pays a base of 40-50k. </p>		</li>

			<p><em>whose<br><br>But I won't go into the issues with the current system that yields the kind of human beings like yourselves, who are incapable of understanding 1st grade English and the difference between pronouns and verbs - let's look at your logic first.<br><br>A school offers a product and I choose to buy it with every intention to repay it using what little economic knowledge an average 18 year old possesses.  I am told if you receive this degree, you will find a better job than if you do not receive this degree.  You are </em>not<em> told that you might not, in fact, find a job at all.  (edit: Much less, that the job you find will have nothing to do with the degree and the degree itself will actually fucking prevent you from advancing as many higher level jobs take credit into account AND require a transcript that you may not be able to get as is my case).<br><br>In fact, the entire system is predicated upon </em>preying upon people such as myself who major in philosophy and other subjects of similar nature.  If a school does not offer a liberal arts education, it will plummet in ratings, applications and, of course, funding.  <br><br>Is this explained to an 18 (or really, 17 year old, given that is when we apply)?  No.  <br><br>Take out every single liberal degree that cannot yield a job in order to pay for the 50k/year school that offers it and you are left with technical schools and community colleges.  I look at my school's website and there is a list of at least hundred such degrees that will never lead anybody to afford to repay them.<br><br>Do exceptions exist?  Yes.  But they are <em>exceptions</em> and they are the crux of the reason the current system contains over a trillion(s) of debt in student loans alone (edit: this, however, does not take into account other debt that is the direct result of having student loan debt, as in the debt I incurred by needing to buy food using my credit cards, for example, or the debt I incurred at later stages of my life when, after being laid off and lacking insurance, I had to go to the ER).<br><br>But this is all moot to you and those of your ilk - all you hear is &quot;well don't get it.&quot;  You're defending a problem that is increasing despite your rhetoric.  And what does this problem lead to exactly?  A working class that is not working, is not contributing to the economic growth of the very nation of which you should be doing your damn best to develop.  <br><br>If we reword your statement and statements like yours and remove philosophy, what we are left with is - whose fault is it for you deciding to receive an education?  I would say I was sold a faulty product and I would like to return it, if education was not, in fact, the goal.  <br><br>If the goal of a university is <em>primarily</em> to give you a job, then remove every single class that prevents you from doing it.  If the goal is to improve the education of the future population that will supposedly be in charge of the country, but to leave them too poor and broke to actually do anything without striking it lucky through some reddit post or a youtube video, then the problem is not with me.<br><br>And not that this adds any value whatsoever to the content of the above argument, but no, I did not blindly enter a 40k/year school (that was 50k by the time I left) thinking I could pay for it.  I was given a full ride based on my financial needs and a decent scholarship.  My parents received giant salary increases the next fiscal year and my grants were gone.  I had spent countless hours with counselors but short of dropping out (still owing 20k for that specific semester had I done this) with a 4.0, I could do nothing.  I could not declare myself independent until 25, and the school deemed my parents inherently linked with my financial responsibility.<br><br>I could afford the school if only MY income and MY merits were considered.  But even that aside - I was still <em>encouraged</em> by that very school to continue because with my 4.0 grades, I'd have no problems.  <br><br>And as you quite eloquently put - 'who's fault is it for majoring in philosophy' - as in, who gives a fuck about this degree regardless of your GPA.<br><br>I have worked in retail and hotels for most of my life until landing a sweet executive assistant gig before the 2008 crash, caused, in part, by this very system.  <br><br>But no, let's just fucking sweep all of this aside and assume that a 17 year old who gets a full ride into a top school and aces everything his first year, should be economically astute enough to predict everything that even the top economists of the world either chose to ignore or did not see coming.  </p>		</li>

			<p><em>preying...<br><br>Just curious, what type of job did you expect to get when you began taking classes as a freshman? I see you complain that the job you are likely to get won't be in that field. What </em>ideal* jobs are there for philosophy majors? <br><br>Don't mistake my questions for criticism of your chosen education. I think you need to do some research and contemplation in regards to where you can provide value. Nobody is going to pay you to write a paper on Plato or Socrates or discuss the flaws in a society built on objectivism (this sentence exhausted my extremely limited knowledge of philosophy). But there may be literally hundreds of jobs where your education and other skills can be useful. </p>		</li>

			<p>It was a double with poli sci along with several law classes.  It was going to be an analyst position of some kind in the government after a JD, but life happened.  I tried to make it work by working full time and finishing school, then economy collapsed as I had started my night classes and JD became unfeasible.  A year later I defaulted.<br><br>edit:  Not sure if worth mentioning but my school had a special program where you could receive two BA degrees at once and I got into that program (this is different from a double major which is still just one BA).  It was meant to be the more practical degree (journalism) in case things went south.  However, my mentor talked me out of it and I dropped it after a semester.</p>		</li>

			<p>Paid yes, but borrowed to pay, some from school (though I thought it was through the government at the time, and some through other sources - as you can see below the sources themselves do not need to be the school directly).  After I found out I googled it - it's all over the net.  <br><br>From <a href="http://www.finaid.org/educators/withholdingtranscripts.phtml" target="_blank">finaid</a><br><br>&quot; US Department of Education Guidance<br><br>Dear Colleague Letter CB-98-13 indicated that colleges were permitted, even encouraged, to withhold academic transcripts in cases involving defaults on Title IV loans, but not required to do so.<br><br>As a result of a borrower's default in the Title IV Student Loan Programs, the Department of Education encourages the withholding of academic transcripts. The withholding of academic transcripts is solely an institutional decision, but has resulted in numerous loan repayments. <br><br>Although this guidance appeared in a campus-based Dear Colleague Letter, the language is general enough to include <em>Stafford loans</em> in addition to <em>Perkins loans</em>. Similar guidance also appeared in earlier Dear Colleague Letters, including CB-95-14, CB-95-13 and CB-92-14. &quot;<br><br>Italics are mine.  The legal jargon of my school does not specify which, so in theory it can be anything.  <br><br>Sigh, after 3 hours of these posts I've become quite bummed.  Between all the PMs laughing at how fucked I am and all of the reminders, however positive, of how sad the situation is, it's just too much.<br><br>I feel completely shattered now.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Was going to be history/economics, so I can teach English abroad (many schools are offering 5-6k/year but only if you have an MA with practical specializations), so in addition to the two above, I would be passing Actuary exams as well.  The goal was to use the MA as a way to setup for a PhD in economics/math and pursue an analyst/actuary position or simply fall back on academia life.  <br><br>I had it all mapped out somewhere with a way to get the 2 year program in 1 and all that good stuff, job offers, regions, etc. but it's all become moot now.  Today, I've made up my schedule for the local CC to go for a 2nd BA, which would be under 10k, and on Monday I will start the process of getting out from default if possible (something I was planning to do as soon as the application process for the MA was finished as I'd have until next August to bust my ass and get that cleared).  If getting out of default is possible without me getting a 2nd BA, I'll probably still take a few CC courses in CS/math/stats so I can pass some practical exams to be an actuary as a backup, but if getting out of default will mean not going to school due to the amount of payment, I will just get the 2nd BA so I can get a transcript that would actually be released (with my AP credits and the CC credits, I should be able to do that in 2 years or less).<br><br>But I will be talking to local advisers about all of this on Monday before work.</p>		</li>

			<p>The best I can do is get out of default, which others have suggested I do (and I was planning on doing after finalizing the application).  The process takes 9 months.  After you're out of default, you still owe whatever you owe and the interest still ticks.  I don't know what that exact amount is but the last time I did the estimate, it's over 150k.  <br><br>Working a full time job at 10/hour after taxes you make what, about 330ish a week assuming no benefits and assuming it's 40 hours and not 32 as some states do and assuming it never goes down/you never get laid off etc.  Maybe you pick up a second full time job (I've held a full time job all through school by the way, at when I took a year off, I did have 2 FT gigs so I know I'm more than capable - but the 2nd job places you into higher tax bracket as well).  Obviously I cannot provide exact numbers or anything of the kind, but take your best case 40/hour 350/week/1400/month scenario with no health issues, emergencies, car break downs, after gas (in CA you'd have to drive a ton, depending where you work) and food (I'm already eating pasta/rice mostly so I guess I would look into EBT or whatever that is - not sure if you're eligible if you have a full time job though), and nothing else going wrong ever in your life, I guess I can pay that off in 1400x100 months.<br><br>I'll be over 40, with 10 years of job experience working retail or something of that nature.  It's an absolutely valid option as I've met many others who do the same, but they usually do this with goals, dreams, families, lives.  The above assumes I will have none of that - I will not have rent/live with my mother, no girlfriends/no clothing expenses, no social expenses, no dreams/aspirations, beyond simply getting out of debt just so I can start pursuing them etc.  <br><br>I mean I'm probably stating the obvious but - that's why.  <br><br>Give me a job for 5 bucks an hour teaching philosophy or history or doing something in academia and I'll live in the library for 16 hours a day and thank you for it.  <br><br>I made a post on CL a week ago offering FREE tutoring service to improve my portfolio (I've 10+ years of experience with proof) and have yet to receive a response.  The market is saturated as shit.  Of course, it's the holidays, but still - I offer resume/grad-level proofing etc.  And no bites.  I'm hoping in a few months that will change and this is by no means a meaningful sample of anything but my point is - I'm trying man.</p>		</li>

The remaining money he made each week he blew on partying.  Almost 75% of his income was devoted to &quot;miscellaneous blow off fund&quot; and 25% went to paying the bills.<br><br>Now Im making $900 a week 35 years later, and my monthly bills for an apartment and car and food add up to $2200. And then $600 of student loan payments.  He is constantly telling me I don't make enough and I need to make more money, and if he could do it in his 20's with a grade 10 education, why cant I do it with a college degree.<br><br>Fuck its irritating.</p>		</li>

			<p>That is not how it works. When people are badly off they look for relief even if temporary. That is why the sale of sweets rose during the world war, why people in debt like to drink etc. Internet connections in some countries are literally a few euros a month. You can also buy used PCs for like a 100 euros or less. Not to mention that it really isn't feasible to expect a person 100% to trying to make a little more money. There are usually other problems that are more helpful in the long run.</p>		</li>

			<p>Seems unlikely without a lot of caveats.  I lived pretty well in the late 80s on 8 thousand a year, fully independent in a fairly high COL area (NJ).  But I shared a crappy dump without central heat, which took slightly over half of my income.  And wore mismatched socks because with my discretionary income I couldn't afford to throw out one perfectly good sock just because its partner had a hole.  I can't cite grocery prices - lower but not drastically lower - but as a price benchmark I recall the cheapest chinese takeout was $3-$3.50 and a sub sandwich was $3-4. Two thousand a year is only $40/wk for all expenses.</p>		</li>

			<p>Someone told me that you have to be billionaire today to live like someone who made a few hundred thousand a year in the 80s. If you made a few hundred grand a year in the 80s you could have a yacht, multiple homes, afford extravagant vacations etc.. Most millionaires can't afford the lifestyle of an 80s thousandaire</p>		</li>

			<p>I doubt that, though I don't know what he makes now.  When I was in grad school from 1969-75 my fellowship went from $1,700 to $2,200.  Even then, that was  not much money.  I lived in a cheap apartment that would generously be called a studio in New Orleans.  <br><br>Frequently when I took a shower, it would flood the apartment.  I remember the hot and muggy summer day I bought a used air conditioner and brought it to my apartment on my bicycle because I had no car.  I shoved it in the window, turned it on, and lay in front of it on my bed.  It felt like heaven.  I paid my rent, bought cheap food a few clothes and some weed, and that's about it.  </p>		</li>

			<p>When she said that, she was making maybe 40% more than the min. wage. This is also in Canada, so there's that.</p>		</li>

			<p>I am not sure what the minimum wage is in Canada, but the US Federal minimum is $7.25.   My guess is that what she said was essentially correct.  Once you adjust for inflation $2,000 in 1970 is worth about $12,000 now.  <br><br>If you work 8 hours a day <em> 5 days a week </em> 52 weeks a year <em> 7.25 </em>1.4 = $21,112.  <br><br>But most people making just above minimum wage don't get paid vacation or  sick leave.  So it is optimistic that they are getting a full 52 weeks of pay.  Also, when I was making my $2,000 a year, I did not have to pay payroll taxes, Social Security, medicare, or income taxes, since it was a fellowship.  <br></p>		</li>
