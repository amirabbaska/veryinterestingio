			<div class="markdown"><p>When you mentioned &quot;larger lamps&quot; it made me think of a massive fluorescent light. There's been some great answers on the post, but now I'm wondering if there's a physical limit to how big a fluorescent light can be? Is there efficiency issues, or as arguingviking's answer alludes to, will the volume be too large to be able to heat up the gas appropriately? Is there a solid number for how large it can be? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot to consider here. When you start getting above F96 you start to see some companies taking parts of the smaller lamps and 'glass soldering' them together to make the length you need. The upper level I have seen is F120T12. Beyond that, you really don't <em>need</em> larger, as you can take the length you need and just have multiple fixtures. At those lengths the glass is really fragile as well. </p>
<p>As lighting transitions more and more to LED we will find less and less of a demand for these as well, because there are several LED based solutions that can be placed into signs (where you find these large lamps mostly).</p></div>		</li>
