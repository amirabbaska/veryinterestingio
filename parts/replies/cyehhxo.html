			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're definitely right, I think he's referring to the fact that the difference between the DC and SF accents is <em>much</em> smaller than the difference between (DC or SF) and (for example, Australia or England). To a non-U.S. ear, DC and SF will sound pretty similar (probably like how to non-Aussie or NZ ears, those accents sound really similar).</p></div>		</li>
