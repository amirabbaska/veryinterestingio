<p>Most likely no. </p>
<p>Insects, at least some of them, cannot experience what we call pain. For instance, if you very carefully take the tip of the abdomen of a dragonfly that is eating and put it into its mouth, it will start eating its own abdomen. </p>

<p>Who figured that out???  I suppose I dont know what entomologists do all day...</p></div>		</li>

<p>In other words, pain in the way we feel it is only needed (and possible) if you can learn from it and modify your future behaviour accordingly. Insects can't learn this way, their nervous system is just too primitive.</p>

<p>This is factually incorrect. Insects <em>are</em> capable of learning from pain and from other stimuli, and their behavior is not purely instinctual; that is an outdated myth that was debunked decades ago. Of course, since this is /r/askscience I'm not surprised.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Learning encroaches upon virtually every aspect of the natural history of an insect. Where it has been investigated in insects, it has typically been found. Most of what is known about learning in insects comes from studies on the social Hymenoptera. For example, honeybees, Apis mellifera, have been shown to learn to use both flower color and shape as a way to increase their foraging efficiency for nectar and pollen, and foraging workers of the desert ant, Cataglyphis fortis, have been shown to associate directional information with landmarks. More recently, as researchers turn their attention to other insects, particularly phytophagous ones, the wider occurrence of the phenomenon is being appreciated. For instance, numerous studies have demonstrated that learning in grasshoppers is a mechanism that is commonly used to help regulate the intake of important macro- and micronutrients. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Insects possess small brains but exhibit sophisticated behavioral performances. Recent works have reported the existence of unsuspected cognitive capabilities in various insect species, which go beyond the traditional studied framework of simple associative learning. In this study, I focus on capabilities such as attention, social learning, individual recognition, concept learning, and metacognition, and discuss their presence and mechanistic bases in insects. I analyze whether these behaviors can be explained on the basis of elemental associative learning or, on the contrary, require higher-order explanations. In doing this, I highlight experimental challenges and suggest future directions for investigating the neurobiology of higher-order learning in insects, with the goal of uncovering l architectures underlying cognitive processing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for linking some sources! Seems like there are quite a few unbacked claims in the thread.</p>
<p>I wonder though, about the extent to which different taxa differ with regards to these things (experiencing pain, learning, learning from pain). It seems to me that it's a bit of an overgeneralization to
claim that all insects share some of these abilities/properties?</p>

<p>That's... er... an interesting comment. Very relevant. I guess?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither of those studies even mention pain in the abstract. What's a real source of bugs learning from pain? Or even that they can feel pain?</p>
<p>You're taking the claim </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insects can learn from stimulus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And extrapolating that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insects can feel and learn from pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a fundamental scientific no no that you just trounced over.</p>
<p>Your fruit fly study doesn't even support that claim either, since it doesn't even explore the electricity as a &quot;painful&quot; stimulus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're asking a question that can't answered in the way you want it answered. Using your bar, I could ask the very same question of you and never be able to answer it either ... I can't know that you are really experiencing pain and not just acting like you do in a highly sophisticated manner.</p>
<p>So at some point you just have to say if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck... it probably is experiencing itself as a duck.</p></div>		</li>
