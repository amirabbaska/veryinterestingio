<p>One of my favorite quotes. People so often feel the opposite. &quot;I read an article, so I know&quot;. No, you don't. Do your research, spend time on topics. Only after hours And hours of real investigation will you actually understand what you're talking about on any given topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even once you understand what you're talking about, you will (most likely) realize how few concepts have simple descriptions or appraisals. More often than not, the knowledge you gain will illuminate how nuanced most situations are and how subject to change even the supposed &quot;facts&quot; are. It makes talking about most situations an exhausting, difficult prospect that goes directly counter to our 24/7 media culture and the soundbite-ization that has happened in journalism in general, not to mention the micro- attention spans that have spread thanks to platforms like Twitter.</p></div>		</li>
