			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass of the orbiting object won't matter (provided it's significantly smaller than the mass of the Sun itself, of course - another star makes things complicated).</p>
<p>You're basically asking for the radius of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere" target="_blank">Hill sphere</a> of the Sun. Someone on <a href="http://cosmoquest.org/forum/showthread.php?60580-How-far-from-the-Sun-can-a-body-could-orbit" target="_blank">this forum post</a> calculated that it's 2.37 light years, anything orbiting farther out than that would tend to have its orbit disrupted by tidal effects from the galaxy's mass and from other passing stars.</p>
<p>In practice it's probably smaller than that, since something orbiting 2.37 light years away would be very tenuously bound to the Sun indeed. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud" target="_blank">Oort cloud</a> is theorized to have comets orbiting up to around 1.5-2 light years out, that's probably the max.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. It's neat to consider that the state of &quot;being part of our solar system&quot; involves not just physical proximity, but also the correct relative velocity. An object that's moving too fast relative to our sun isn't bound in orbit around it.</p>
<p>So you could have two solar systems approach each other close enough that the various comets and detritus out in the outer solar system are intermingling and are passing by each other like ships in the night, but almost all of the comets that &quot;belong&quot; to one sun are going to continue to &quot;belong&quot; to it after the solar systems have gone by and the other sun's comets will likewise mostly be left behind.</p>
<p>There'll be <em>some</em> stirring of the pot, sure, but our solar system has had probably plenty of close encounters over its lifetime and there's still lots of stuff out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is that the Sun's gravitational influence is basically infinite. If there was nothing but the sun, an object could be as far away as it wanted. The orbital period would be super slow at some point, of course. The main reasion why the distance has been &quot;limited&quot; to 2-ish light years is that other stars, as well as the galaxy's gravitation, would start having an influence. So it doesn't really tell anything about the absolute size, it's all relative to other distances. So yeah, the systems might &quot;overlap&quot; or share bodies, but that doesn't really have too much to do with the distance I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way to think about it is that the reason the limit is only that far is precisely because alpha centauri is there. If there was no overlap, there's no limit to how far the Hill sphere would extend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For an orbital semi-major axis of 2.37 light years, I'm getting an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period#Calculation" target="_blank">orbital period</a> of around <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2*pi*sqrt%28%282.37+ly%29%5E3%2F%28gravitational+constant+*+mass+of+the+sun%29%29" target="_blank">58 million years.</a>  The two-body assumption is getting very dicey here though - at aphelion the sun's pull on the orbiting body would be <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=-%28gravitational+constant+*+mass+of+the+sun%29%2F%282.37+ly%29%5E2" target="_blank">very small</a>, and it wouldn't take much to significantly affect it.

<p>That's an understatement.  To give a sense of <em>how</em> small, the gravitational pull of an average human (~65kg) 100 meters away would be stronger.  A paperclip (~1 g) at 50cm away has approximately the same gravitational pull.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sphere of influence is just a point at which the gravitational influence of one body is greater than or equal to the influence of another body, and although we could theoretically detect it with a very sensitive instrument, there isn't really any need to as it can be calculated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What your asking for is just an accelerometer, they sense acceleration, and since gravity induces acceleration into things with mass they detect gravity. For fine measurements you need to subtract out other sources of acceleration (engine thrust, solar radiation pressure, etc), but generally those errors can be estimated well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The OP presumably wanted something related to the universe in which we actually inhabit, where there's more than a single star with one planet. But even in a single sun/planet universe, the answer's still wrong - expansion of space would put an upper limit on orbit size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not relevant at all. An object on an escape trajectory can be any distance from the sun. The guy was saying that, with no other stars or planets to produce tidal forces to perturb a distant object's orbit, the maximum distance which an object could be and still be orbiting the sun is infinitely far away.</p></div>		</li>
