			<div class="markdown"><p>holy shit - sheet 5 in your first source is ... well ... I don't know.</p>
<p>I guess it's in there as a showpoint in his presentation but boy - it shouldn't be there in the way it is.</p>
<p>On sheet 51 he says &quot;Karen E. Wetterhahn was accidentally poisoned in her own lab. A drop of mercury spilled on her glove&quot;... That's so wrong! She poisened herself with Dimethylmercury, which is extremely toxic.Although it's absolutely not commendable you can try to put your hand in mercury and it's most likely that nothing will happen to you. Yes - it's a mercury compound but that's the same as saying ... well I don't know - cooking salt will explode in water because there's sodium in there. And if the explosion doesn't kill you the chlorine gas will do the rest.  </p>
<p>These 2 sheets definitley shouldn't be in the presentation.</p></div>		</li>
