			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got the process right - but it's more down to clouds &quot;trapping&quot; radiation emitted directly by the earth rather than reflected solar radiation.</p>
<p>The earth surface's albedo is fairly low (so it absorbs, rather than reflects, most of the incoming radiation from the sun). Just like the sun, the earth emits radiation as a function of its temperature. With clear skies that radiation is lost to space. Under overcast skies, radiation emitted from earth's surface is absorbed and re-emitted back to earth by clouds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO, I think u/brotta part is crucial for &quot;simplicity&quot;.  If I was reading this with zero knowledge, I would assume from your explanation that heat comes in from the sun, bounces off earth, and gets trapped by the clouds, causing it to be warm.  But, if it cant escape the clouds after bouncing off earth, how does it get through the clouds in the first place?  That's where u/brotta's explanation really clarifies it.  Either way, I feel YOU know the subject and I appreciate your response, I just want to justify the simplicity actually seems to imply something incorrect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you are saying is that clouds create warmer weather, and not that the warmer weather creates clouds?</p>
<p>If so that is intersting, I've been backwards on this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clouds originate from moisture and moisture is advected into the atmosphere when a low pressure system with cyclonic, upward vertical motion originates or moves over a water source. If you're in a location that is cold and sunny until clouds move in, then you are seeing the effects of air masses replacing one another, in this case a maritime polar air mass replacing a continental arctic one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venus is a prime example of &quot;runaway greenhouse effect&quot; and it is full time cloud.  It is also much much hotter than it's proximity to the sun should make it.</p>
<p>UV and visible light radiation has (relatively) little problem penetrating clouds.  When this radiation hits the earth, it is transformed into heat and infrared radiation.  Thermal and infrared radiation has (relatively) a great deal of trouble penetrating clouds and is &quot;trapped&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on OP's explanation, you have a reasonable assumption. But what u/seicar said is what OP didnt really mention, and what I think is critical to understanding the mechanism at play.  Its the radiation from Earth that's kept trapped by the clouds, not the initial &quot;heat&quot; that penetrates it in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
