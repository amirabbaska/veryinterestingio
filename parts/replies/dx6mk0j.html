<p>Those are inherently different demands for size, sturdiness, and ease of use, although with the popularity of flash drives I am surprised the reversible thing didn't take off sooner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back then you’d also connect your mouse / keyboard / printer when you buy them and keep them connected potentially for years. The connecting and disconnecting USB ports when you reach work, enter your car, get back home, move from your PC to bed, is a relatively new thing. At most you’d connect your Nokia to charge at night once every few days. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And maybe dig out the cord with the one weird end that didn't fit anything else every once in a while to get pics off your digital camera onto the computer.  Or plug in your external SD card reader and do it that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's what I mean. You weren't unplugging USB-A everyday, so it didn't matter so much that it was bigger and one-way. I remember the old dilemma of &quot;do I have to click eject before I pull it out?&quot; and it definitely didn't happen on a daily basis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This doesn't make any sense. A keyboard and printer puts barely any strain on the USB connection and a mouse only has a usb port on the far end which also is barely strained. </p>
<p>A phone, on the other hand, puts all kinds of stresses on the port. Constant connecting/disconnecting, using the handheld device while connected, tons of bending force when supporting the phone on a dock, etc. </p>
<p>The devices we use now put <em>way</em> higher demands on the ports. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what the poster was trying to say is that it is a more long term connection. It's not going to fall out randomly. In that case it is 'sturdier'.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A phone with a USB-A port would have a sturdier charging port. </p>
<p>Your phone's USB cable also spends most of its life unplugged. Instead of being a semi-permanent connection. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless you get your foot tangled in the cables under your desk. Or if you move your mouse or keyboard too far when its cable is too short. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>And that's why my 5-year-old laptop still has okay USB ports while my current, 1-year-old phone's charging cable disconnects as soon as I pick up the phone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It didn't take off because back in the day, people cared about backwards compatibility and the convenience of having one port for all of your devices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a lot of the pain comes from the fact that manufacturers didn't stay consistent on their usage of the plug.</p>
<p>It was supposed to always be &quot;log up&quot; on the cable and you'd be correct.  Vertical ports were &quot;logo on your thumb, then plug them in&quot;.</p>
<p>Manufacturers got creative with the layouts, and you can never actually predict which way the port is oriented without looking.</p>
<p>If you ever have to plug a USB-A into a laptop, try &quot;logo up&quot; first.  It's <em>usually</em> the right way, at least for the ports on the side.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Reversibility wasn’t seen as a necessary feature until Apple created the lightning port.  It was only then that the market began demanding reversibility in the plugs.</p>

<p>I feel like Apple responded to market demands as opposed to created them. Everyone had been joking about how you always plug in a usb correctly on the third try for years before the lightning port was released.</p></div>		</li>
