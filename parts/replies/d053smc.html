			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, cell breathing is something that happens naturally when the number of users go up and down - to your phone all the other users are noise (and to the site, messages to other phones is noise for your message). When users leave the area, connect to a different site or the call drops, the noise level goes down.</p>
<p>This leads to the effective coverage area of the site to expand and contract, which is the source of the breathing analogy. </p>
<p>I have never heard of a provider triggering cell breathing by adjusting strength dynamically. Boradcast strength is regulated and usually set to close to the allowed maximum to minimze the number of towers needed.</p></div>		</li>
