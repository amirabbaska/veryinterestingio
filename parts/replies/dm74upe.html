<p>No it isn't. Not even close. It's a metabolite of testosterone that has been reduced at the 5th carbon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Absolutely wrong. Testosterone does not cause balding. DHT technically doesn't cause balding either. Having the gene for androgenic alopecia is what causes balding. DHT just accelerates it. Men also don't live as long because they're 10% larger than women, and they store more fat viscerally than subcutaneously. Neither of those things are directly attributed to Testosterone. If anything, they come from a lack of Estradiol, which carries its own risk of cancer.</p></div>		</li>
