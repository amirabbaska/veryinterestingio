<p>0.006 Hz? That's amazing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>47 mics in 6 mHz of band sounds great, but at what latency?  With most national/international touring acts on IEM's, and the prevalence of digital boards and DSP (waves multirack), can't have much more latency for it to be useful in the touring scene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um... Voice only needs 10 KHz bandwidth. You could fit 47 channels in half a MHz, using AM or FM. Digital, you can compress even more. So I'm not sure what they're really bragging about, there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually each analog wireless mic in a pro system wants about 200kHz to itself -- they are not narrowband systems like walkie-talkies. Additionally, when you start adding systems together (i.e. larger number of frequencies in use in the same general location) you have to start accounting for intermodulation products, which will quickly reduce the number of frequencies available for use. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, okay, doy, they're FM not AM, and wideband at that because they want the SNR to be high. That noise you do hear is my brain, farting.  That 200 KHz is the same as commercial FM broadcasting uses, for identical reasons.</p></div>		</li>
