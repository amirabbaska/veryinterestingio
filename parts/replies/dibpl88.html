			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response.  This is what's in my head when credit unions give you a high return percentage on your account balance when you have [x] amount of transaction per month.  So they want you to use their card, but also maintain a high balance to get the most return.  It seems like them paying you a high percent would cost them money but I'm sure this strategy encourages you to keep a high balance while they &quot;sell your money&quot; to make way more than they're paying you in % return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear. It doesn't matter whether you keep a balance on your card or not (if you don't pay off your balance, that's more profit but the credit card company is making money off the credit card use either way). They already are making roughly 3% of the purchase price as their income and they are only paying you about 1.5% of that in cash rewards, points, airline miles, etc. That means at most they are only splitting a portion of their income with the people who use the credit card. They also capitalize on the fact that you don't spend that cash reward right away, or use those points, airline miles, until you've saved enough to buy something you want. This gives them time to earn interest on your credit card rewards until you spend it. This is similar to how buying a gift card for someone doesn't just give a company the money upfront it also allows the company to earn interest on that money while they wait for the gift card to be used. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Businesses save money per transaction by accepting only cash - there's no doubt about that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take into account all of the direct and indirect costs of dealing with cash, it's not quite so clear.</p>
<p>If you're small, you have time spent going to/from the bank, queuing up to pay money into accounts. If you're bigger you're paying for secure collection. Add on to that the time wasted manually handling the cash at payment time, the time wasted counting, reporting, and handling the money at the end of the day, time and effort spent ensuring the shop in general and each till has sufficient change at all times, either directly facing the financial risk or paying insurance to cover theft, extra hassle dealing with money lost/gained, and the staff discipline costs dealing with employees who always get it wrong.</p>
<p>Compared to all of that and more, paying a 1.5% transaction fee starts to look a whole lot less expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. The only other point I'd make is that in most situations it's illegal to not accept cash for payment in the US, therefore most businesses juggle the overhead of handling both physical and electronic payments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been awhile since I looked into this, but last I knew it's not illegal to not accept cash if the transaction/service hasn't taken place. Cash is legal tender for incurred debts - services or goods already consumed/used. If the &quot;debt&quot; hasn't occurred, the merchant can specify the payment method not be cash. So you could refuse to accept cash when someone is purchasing groceries (they haven't consumed them yet) but not when someone has already finished a meal at a restaurant, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes when a business is historically at peak patronage they'll stay cash only because they can't sell more than they already do (many restaurants come to mind). Switching from accepting credit to only cash isn't likely, however, as it would upset regulars who use credit cards. </p>
<p>It's easier to say it's always been this way vs trying to justify a new inconvenience you pass onto your customers to increase profits.</p></div>		</li>
