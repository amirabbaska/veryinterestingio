			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also super risky. Part of the reason JWST will be so awesome is that it's going in deep space where there is zero light pollution, to the Earth-Sun L2 (the point beyond Earth's orbit where the gravity interacts such that it doesn't move with respect to the Earth or Sun). That's not the kind of place where we can send astronauts on repair missions if something goes wrong. If any part of the deployment sequence fails, the mission is over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that it's 1.5 million km away, surely it's not beyond possibility to send a crewed flight to repair it?</p>
<p>It's further than humans have flown before, but it is a lot less time in space than the ISS astronauts spend, and it is a much lower fuel requirement than the Apollo programme needed to get a crewed lander back out of the Moon's gravity well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an idea to use one of the final shuttle mission to go get Hubble and return with it. Total crack pipe dream of course. Much to dangerous and too expensive. Also it would have required Columbia as it was overbuilt. Too bad as it would have been pretty sweet to go see it in a meuseum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a cosmologist and I asked the following question during a conference to the guys at ESA, but I didn't get a proper answer.  So here it goes:</p>
<p>Why don't they make 2 of a spacecraft, such as JWST?  My thinking is that surely most of the cost is in the R&amp;D, making the tools, the actual launch, etc, rather than cost of the actual parts.</p>
<p>So perhaps making two JWST would only cost 20% more.  Then that way you launch the JWST but if something goes wrong with it you figure out what, make those fixes to your backup, then launch that.</p>
<p>But is that &quot;20% more&quot; about right?  Is it 10%?  40%?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because less than 1 in 5 spacecraft fail. So even if it were just 20% higher, you would wind up getting much less science for your money. For example, 20% of the JWST budget would be enough to fund another Mars mission. </p>
<p>Additionally, it would take a fair bit of time and money to figure out what went wrong, make fixes, and relaunch. By that time you are potentially launching an out of date spacecraft you've now spent even more money on.  </p>
<p>And 20% is probably low. While planning and developing spacecraft is expensive, these are very difficult things to build as well. They are built of expensive and hard to make components and the work has to be done in difficult to maintain cleanrooms.  In some cases, the availability of components, materials, personnel and facilities is a bigger limiting factor than money. Building two would not only tie up money, but also many of these other resources. </p>
<p>So what NASA and others do instead is apply what they learned on previous missions to save development on future ones. Sometimes that is building the same basic thing again, like with Mars 2020, other times it is refining what's been used before like using shuttle derived boosters for the SLS. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>For some of the latest instruments in astronomy, I suspect that's becoming quite a large problem. They're becoming so large and complex that when the scientific results are sent for peer review, it can be difficult to find any peer reviewers that aren't already somehow involved with the projects!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is quite spot on.
If you build (and plan to launch in any case) an additional JWST this also means 2x the whole Mission Crew (lots of people working during the Telescopes whole lifetime) - if you're only going to launch the second one in case of a failure you're gonna waste alot of money in the long run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this thought, if the spacecraft did fail, then the way to handle it would be to run through a proposal process where someone proposes building a 2nd one and prices out how to do that.  They'd cut much of the R&amp;D out of the price by proposing to re-use most of the 1st build.  NASA retains every design schematic, every document, etc.</p></div>		</li>
