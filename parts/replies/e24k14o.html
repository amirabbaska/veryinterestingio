<p>For sure, there’s evidence that animals recognize some forms of beauty. Many species pick individuals to mate with based on some idea of “attractiveness” (e.g., a long colorful tail in male peacocks, a sexy loud call in male frogs, etc.). And some species even pick mates based on the the aesthetic creations that members of the opposite sex create for them (e.g., bowerbird males have to create a beautiful art collection for females. They spend tons of time gathering colorful objects and carefully arranging them in their bowers. Females choose males with the sexiest art collection.. so this is one of the most obvious cases of art/beauty detection in animals). </p>
<p>So we know animals make choices based on what’s beautiful but whether animals really <em>appreciate beauty</em> in the same way as humans is an open question, one that’s hard to test empirically. My gut tells me that animals do feel it in the same way as we do, even though it’s hard for me to test that intuition empirically. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Would measuring how long they down looking at a photo (compared to a control) test it empirically?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth mentioning as an aside that some animals (certain birds, for instance) can perceive a dramatically greater range of colors than we can. I'd like to think they use this for the appreciation of sunsets, forests, and lovers!</p></div>		</li>
