			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important question. CRISPR technology has transformed modern biology in part because of its relative ease of use. This feature has been democratizing for lab research around the world. It has also attracted interested from a growing biohacker movement. I find this concerning. CRISPR has potential health risks. In the lab, we implement rigorous systems for biosafety that are overseen by the University. As we and others begin to plan for eventual clinical trials the safety bar is raised even further. We're carefully considering the risks of each attempt at genetic modification and each trial will need to be scrutinized by regulatory agencies to ensure a reasonable risk/benefit profile. CRISPR is not ready for safe self-experimentation. Although CRISPR has enormous promise, the power of editing genome sequences carries significant risk and should not be attempted outside of carefully regulated settings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, their reply was kinda like saying you know that you shouldn't consume so much of that easily available alcohol at local car in rural America with no public transportation options and drive home. Doesn't at all mean people won't and how are we to address the issue?  </p></div>		</li>
