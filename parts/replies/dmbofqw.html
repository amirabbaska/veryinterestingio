<p>Just to add on to this part a little, most of the really dangerous radioisotopes produced by an atomic bomb have half lives measured in days or weeks.  If most of the particles are staying in the upper atmosphere for months then what's eventually coming back down isn't nearly as bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an entirely different question but very interesting and also - sadly - quite a burning one (hopefully we won't see it burn). Not due to nuke induced EMP but extremely strong solar flares. </p>
<p>EMP only has short term effects and it is basically a very strong pulse of electromagnetic radiation. Now, EM-radiation can induce a current in any metal conductor, you're using this effect every day, it is how an antenna works. Some rod (simplified) makes a EM field, that is in the air, and some other rod picks that field up and induces electricity. Depending on how the EM field looks it has encoded data (phone, radio, Wifi, whatever). </p>
<p>If you have a very strong pulse of that, you can get for a very short moment high current (or high voltage, for the sake of ELI5 I do not distinguish, you get an &quot;electric peak&quot;) in any metal conductor. Imagine your house that usually takes 250 V or 110V. Now, for a very short amount of time, you get a peak of some 50000 V. Anything that takes your normal voltage has a problem, because that peak makes condensators and other electrical ciruits too hot for a moment, they burn, break, sparks cross where they are not supposed to be, etc. If the peak is strong enough you might even have larger scale physical damage, as switches might fuse or similar. That peak of electrical energy was really bad for your house.</p>
<p>Now imagine a conductor many km long, connected to transformator stations on both sides, that again are connected to other lines, stations, households. And that system suddenly has to take a massive amount of energy because some EM-pulse (nuke, solar flare) puts it into some of the lines. Your transformators overheat and fuse, all kinds of large switches are killed, protection systems fail because they also break and the current is let into lower tier systems (local distribution) and does similar damage. Now the fear is that if that happens in unprepared grids (the classic example if &quot;California&quot;) you get vast damage that equals the breakdown of the entire electric grid.</p>
<p>And the thing is... to repair that isn't a matter of exchanging a fuse, if a large industrial transformator is broken, it is broken. A specialised company might take weeks to make a new one and there are just a bunch of companies that do make them, simply because you usually only need a few if the grid is extended or they are switched every few dozen years on some large-scale renovation - pretty bad luck you just now have 10000 of those broken at the same time in your entire country. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you just replace a few pieces of the grid or is the entire network fried?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That depends on the event causing the damage and also on how well the grid is prepared for power spikes far beyond normal parameters. </p>
<p>You can protect the grid against such an event to prevent damage or at least keep it local, but that costs many, many millions. Just hope you live in an area where your energy-grid companies do repair. Or hope there's no solar flare in your lifetime or at least when you need a working electrical grid (and even emergency power in hospitals carries them a certain way).</p>
<p>Now for the EMP-nuke: Imagine such a thing going off above one of the large metropolitan areas of the world with some 10 or 30 million people and that goes offline with damage that takes months to prepare in just millisecond all at once and repairing takes many months, and the damage goes from the highest grid tier down to the level of houses or even cars (they are full of brittle electronics).</p>
<p>Don't worry about your military, though. They are of course prepared. No EMPing entire armies and walzing through... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Individual components are damaged, permanently. The most susceptible components are much more common in today's electronics than in '62.</p>
<p>Those parts of the grid affected would need to be bypassed until dead components could be replaced. If one specific device, common to every node in a grid, is prone to failure, it would take some time to restore it. Just locating the critical failure may be impossible.</p></div>		</li>
