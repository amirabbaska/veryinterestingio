			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes dogs definitely love to use their nose, but what we have found is that dogs actually prefer to use their eyes and only use their nose when visual information is not available.  You may have heard that a dog’s nose is thousands or millions times more sensitive than a human’s. No one can agree. One author who compared dogs and humans found dogs were up to a billion times more sensitive to fatty acids, another found dogs were a hundred times greater, while another author said that dogs and humans were about the same.
The trouble is, we know very little about how a dog’s sense of smell actually works. Only four studies before 2000 looked at how sensitive a dog’s nose is. </p>
<p>Odor does not just waft from something and hang in the air. It is not a nice, clean gradient, strongest next to the source, then weaker as you move away. Odor is a kind of cloud, with patches of scent floating among clean air. The chemicals from an explosive disperse by either evaporation, where they change from liquid to gas, or sublimation, where they change straight from a solid to a gas. These processes disperse the chemicals into the air in unpredictable patterns. </p>
<p>Dogs capture these chemicals by sniffing. When searching for a scent, dogs can sniff up to 200 times a minute, sucking the odor deep into their nostrils. The odor comes into contact with the dog’s olfactory receptors, which are able to encode thousands of odors. The odor is dissolved into the mucus in the dog’s nose that covers these olfactory receptors. The receptors send messages to the olfactory center of the brain which is around 40 times bigger than a human’s. The odor is then decoded and recognized.</p>
<p>That is why dogs prefer their eyes over their nose when possible - I think becaus we have one of the weakest noses in the animal world we are easily impressed by dogs!</p></div>		</li>

<p>So....why do dogs sniff each other when meeting, instead of staring at each other? In fact, they <em>do</em> stare instead of sniffing only when they are uncomfortable with each other, and such staring can spark a fight. But when they are being sociable, they sniff instead.</p>
<p>When it comes to other species of animals, my dog does prefer sight over smell, once he's caught sight of them. But this is when he is in predator mode. If he is friendly he wants to sniff, not look. And when he meets humans (whom he loves), he prefers sniffing over looking.</p>
<p>Do your findings support such daily observations that dogs prefer the nose when friendly, but their eyes when they are predatory or confrontational?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sniffing tells them a lot about the environment the other dog has been, where they live, if they live with other dogs, etc. Obviously they use their eyes, if the other dog looks immediately aggressive they probably aren't going to go in for a sniff. But sniffing will tell them more about stuff that can't be seen with eyes. I know with cats they have a system of sniffing when meeting each other, like a hierarchy. They normally sniff faces first, then flanks, then butts, where the butt tells them the most and the cats are saying &quot;Hey get to know me!&quot;. I assume it's somewhat similar for dogs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, or so I read, dogs can tell a lot more about the fats they smell. They can tell how long a strain of a fatty acid is until the next double bond. They perceive the mix of these length not visual, but still similar to how we perceive a mixed color. </p>
<p>This is also why they trust there nose over vision, which does not help in traffic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, every mailbox along a walk is scented, but some appear to be more special than others and thus intently scrutinized.  The dog seems to need the &quot;proper&quot; amount of time to scrutinize that scent.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed that with my dogs. Sometimes they have to stop at a certain smell and refuse to leave for ten-twenty seconds. Then as if a switch is thrown they just stand up and walk off. They are quite different breeds but both always take about the same time to have had enough of it.</p></div>		</li>
