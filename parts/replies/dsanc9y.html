			<div class="markdown"><p>Rework is when you add food with a &quot;defect&quot; (but still safe to eat) into new product that's being produced in order to hide the defect. A lot of chocolate ice cream is other ice cream flavors that had something go wrong with it. They rework it to become chocolate since it hides flavor and color defects well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've seen product as old as 5 years used &amp; sold, but not much beyond that.</p>

<p>If we're talking about frozen meat or vegetables (as opposed to confectionary) how is the nutritional value affected over that long a period of time? Basically I'm asking how do we know if the frozen foods we buy to make dinner have as much nutritional value as we should expect them to?</p></div>		</li>
