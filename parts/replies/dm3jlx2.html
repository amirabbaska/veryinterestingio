			<div class="markdown"><p>This really does seem to be a US cultural thing, broadly speaking. Irish journalist Carole Coleman interviewed GW Bush in 2004 about the Iraq war and the failure to find any of the WMDs which had been used as the justification for invasion. Bush gave a rambling non-answer on the WMD issue and was shocked to be interrupted and called out during what Coleman later called a &quot;fillibuster&quot; answer.</p>
<p>The Whitehouse was upset and went as far as making an official complaint to the Irish government about the interview and what they saw as a lack of respect for the President. It helped that Coleman worked for RTE (the Irish state broadcaster, like the British BBC) who backed her up 100% during the subsequent fallout. If she had been working for a US outlet her career would likely have been over. In Ireland, interviewers are generally expected to ask the tough questions and not be intimidated or excessively deferential. She later wrote:</p>
<p>&quot;Had I been fair? Should I just have been more deferential to George Bush? I felt that I had simply done my job and shuddered at the thought of the backlash I would surely have faced in Ireland had I not challenged the president on matters that had changed the way America was viewed around the world.[3]&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In result? Not a lot. In method, however, yes. </p>
<p>In dictatorships, the government apparatus directly fucks with your livelihood. It orders your boss to fire you or imprisons you flat out.  In the US, not respecting the <em>quid pro quo</em> makes it impossible to do your job, thus indirectly fucking with your livelihood.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The US has some of the most restricted speech on the planet yet pretends that freedom of speech is important. Virtue signaling at its finest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's the follow up, and I think the real thing OP was asking: what systemic feature(s) prevent this sort of blacklisting from happening in other countries? Or does it happen at an equal rate in those countries, and we're just outside observers looking through rose-tinted glasses? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Sweden we have a strong Swedish national public TV broadcaster, SVT, funded by a television licence fee.</p>
<p>This means that they don't have a financial incentive to be lenient on politicians to make them answer questions. It's instead the politicians that have to defer to the journalists otherwise they will be considered dodgy. Journalists have a much stronger standing here</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess one reason is the US voting system. In a system with more than two parties and less all-or-nothing votes, parties oftentimes don't get more than 50% of the votes. So they need support from other parties to form a majority and have more potential opposition. Even if you isolate a journalist, there is still a group politicians representing more than 50% of the voters, which doesn't shun you. You even get more interesting to some, because of the feud.</p>
<p>But that's just a theory. A politics theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That plus the electoral voting system is I think also a key part. The fact that popular votes inherently put more value to an individual vote  vs in the electoral system the vote value is diluted. </p>
<p>This ensures true representation at each level of government. Plus the parliamentarian system also ensures that the opposition party has greater authority to keep a balance of power in place, which enables and empower journalists to not fall under the prisoners mentality.</p>
<p>Just my observations </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a great question, and I really hope someone can come along and answer it. However, I have a feeling that its probably a much more complicated question to answer without bringing in strong opinions (that are not based in fact!) about the U.S. or other countries press and political system. I guess now we wait for someone more qualified than me to come along and help us :)</p></div>		</li>
