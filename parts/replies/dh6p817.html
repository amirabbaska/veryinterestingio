			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I love Reddit.  I've gotten responses from a pro, college players, umpires, an 85 year old guy, little league coaches and everything in between.  Sports are more that just the big leagues, and while some things may not be the most accurate, having the spread makes for a damn good conversation.</p>
<p>Thanks for the recommendation, I'll look into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My passion has always focused around mathematics and physics. From the age of 10-14, everything I did focused around baseball (watching, physically playing on a team and failing, playing video games and excelling, and learning more math to see what else I could throw numbers at...even if it didn't make sense). Now I'm an engineer and appreciate that watching baseball relaxes me, although I rarely find time for it. </p>
<p>Given that I sit on my ass all day now and was never athletically skilled to begin with, I see you as a super hero since you were skilled enough to play at any professional level. I also hope you are enjoying your retirement from baseball.</p>
<p>With that said, I have 3 questions I was hoping you could answer as your exp at any professional level astronomically exceeds mine. If you don't answer, that is totally cool too and I wish you the best.</p>
<p>Think back to a professional moment you would classify as your personal &quot;bottom of the 9th, 2 outs, bases loaded, down by 1, you're at bat&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the time, did you realize the magnitude of the situation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there anything you remember worrying about at the time that seems unrelated/illogical upon reflection?</p>
</li>
<li>How much (if any) of a psychological mind-fuck did you find a group of fans making (or not making) the expected amount of noise?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I was a pitcher so that moment you're referring to wouldn't be a time at bat, but more of an appearance in a big game or two. </p>
<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>At the time I guess I didn't truly realize the magnitude of those situations. I was a 22-24, in the best shape of my life, had been training/practicing religiously for the previous 4-5 years, and been eating and breathing the game for the previous +- 10 years. So in the moment I guess it's more instinctual than anything. </p>
<p>When it's going well you don't really think about anything. When it's going bad you think about everything else all at once like mechanics, questioning your self worth, what your parents are gonna think of you after you gave up that 490 ft jack over the beer deck in left.</p>
<p>Same goes for the questions about the fans. When I was doing well I didn't hear them. However after one particularly brutal outing in El Paso I had a guy follow me down the line all the way to the clubhouse from the dugout berating me. Mentioned my hometown and how I should go back there. I'll never forget that piece of shit and I hate the city of El Paso to this day (appx. 10 years ago)</p>
<p>FYI my pro experience was limited to two mediocre seasons out of the bullpen in the Z-leagues so someone who had longer tenure might answer these questions completely differently.</p></div>		</li>
