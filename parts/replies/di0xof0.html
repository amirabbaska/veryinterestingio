<p>We know EXACTLY where the voyager probes are, what frequency signal is etc. To try and search for them with out knowing any of these parameters would be the devils own job</p>

<p>In addition, the Voyager probes are transmitting directly toward us. Any visiting space probe would transmit in the opposite direction. We wouldn't be able to detect something that tiny making only passive observations until it was right on top of us and got picked up by space junk radar. Maybe if it had a big bright dish pointed straight at us we'd pick up reflected sunlight a little sooner.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If it's not transmitting an obvious signal, or a signal we're able to listen to, we may never see it. </p>
<p>We currently are unable to send large craft beyond earth orbit. Unless it's traveling close and slow enough to be comparable to earth orbit we'll never be able to touch it let alone retrieve it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not that powerful... The total transmitter power on the voyager probes is 16 Watts RF, with about 48dBi gain at X-Band. At this point in time, we can only communicate with it at about 600bps or so.</p></div>		</li>
