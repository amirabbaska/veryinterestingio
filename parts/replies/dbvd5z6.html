			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation! I guess when I'm doing it it's just one little mug of water but I can imagine that if you were wanting to make a lot of tea then it would be much more difficult to get evenly heated water in a large amount in the microwave? Also I'll have to try pouring water over the teabag instead - thanks for the tip!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Liquids have convection though.  If the only goal is to make the water hot (and you don't have your tea in the water yet) you shouldn't have any issues with hot/cold spots.  If it takes you 5 minutes to remember you boiled some water and it's cooled off before you add the bag, yeah you're gonna have problems with your brewing.</p>
<p>If the tea is already in the water while you heat, it's going to produce a nucleation site for boiling, preventing the water from superheating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>microwaves will heat water evenly. microwaves actually heat things by heating the water in them. so when it's just water it will be heated quite nicely and evenly.</p>
<p>and you are not supposed to put the tea bag after you've heated the water. you're supposed to put in the cup along with the water and the sugar and then microwave the lot. the only thing you add afterwards is the milk.</p>
<p>if you want a stronger brew then use 2 tea bags.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mere fact that microwaves heat by exciting water molecules doesn't prove that the water heats evenly. It's well known that microwave ovens <a href="https://orbitingfrog.com/2008/05/13/measure-the-speed-of-light-using-your-microwave/" target="_blank">don't provide even coverage</a>. This raises the question as to whether the rotation of the turntable or the convection of the water is adequate to spread the heat evenly. I haven't found any scientific discussions of this, so I'm forced to fall back on the article I cited earlier, which granted doesn't back up its assertion. </p></div>		</li>
