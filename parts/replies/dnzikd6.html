<p>the failure of [Merrick Garland's] nomination is really an extension of the door opened by Bork and not a new development in itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>The Senate refused to consider the nomination entirely, as the Constitution prescribes, preventing Obama nominating a Supreme Court Justice as he was entitled to do. It had nothing to do with Garland and everything to do with Obama and the ideological balance of the court. Kennedy got seated; Garlands seat went to Gorsuch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The senate doesn't have to consider a nominee. It has the power and right to advice and consent to a nominee. Implicitly just like the first ammendment it has the right not to, just like you can't be forced to say something or in the case of the 2nd ammendment be forced to own a gun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's... novel. The language is &quot;the president shall nominate, and by and with the the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint...&quot;. The &quot;shall&quot; there creates an obligation. If it were merely a right, it would have been a &quot;may&quot;, or a &quot;should it so choose&quot;.</p>
<p>In any case, this is a very silly discussion, because the whole proceedings are contrary to two hundred years of precedent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It didn't advise or consent though. The refusal to consider Garland for the seat was unprecedented. He became the nominee who was left hanging the longest in Supreme Court history. The &quot;but it's an election year!&quot; argument was garbage, as anyone with a brain should know that refusing to install Justices 1/4 of the time is insanity and not how government is meant to work.</p>
<p>With that in mind, and arguments used to suggest that Garland not being considered was fair are unconstitutional, because the Constitution explicitly tells the Senate to get it together and do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the timing of the Garland nomination, Republicans felt like they had nothing to lose by holding his vote and leaving that spot open on the court.  </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that to have received a vote, he would have had to have been the living embodiment of current Republican politics congealed into human form, like midichlorians congealing to form Anakin Skywalker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely there were reasons other than ideology that Bork was denied a Supreme Court seat. Did anyone want the man who did Richard Nixon's dirty work near a lifetime seat of power?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nixon's dirty work? If you're referring to firing Cox (the Watergate special investigator), then you might want to revisit the situation and fallout. Nixon issued orders to fire Cox, and Bork only complied after it became evident that Nixon was going to dismiss anyone who refused to execute the order. Bork met with Nixon to recommended against the firing, and like his superiors, offered to resign, but ultimately agreed to issue Nixon's order.</p>
<p>Bork was in the position of a lieutenant being issued dubious orders from his General. He recommended against it, met with the General to discuss his misgivings, but was ultimately overruled. So he followed the orders rather than resign and shift the weight of the situation onto his underlings.</p>
<p>Additionally, once he was in the position of Attorney General, Bork immediately set to fill the position of the special prosecutor with a guy who looked into the White House activities as aggressively as Cox did.</p>
<p>Just sayin - Bork's actions were more along the lines of &quot;giving Nixon enough rope to hang himself&quot; rather than &quot;doing Nixon's dirty work&quot;.</p>
<p>That said, his opinions on privacy, RvW, and nullification are more than enough to be happy he never made it to the court.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was not aware that he replaced Cox with another aggressive special prosecutor, for some reason I thought Congress took over authority of that investigation (I guess the independent counsel law was drafted shortly after but not immediately?). So thanks for that information. </p>
<p>I still believe Bork should have resigned. Make the paper boy fire Cox if you have to. </p></div>		</li>
