			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note about 'convenience'. I used to be a canned shave cream kind of guy. It started with the foamy, then went to the gel, then back to the foamy. (At one point in college some eurotrash kid told me I used cheap shaving cream - more on that in a moment). Foamy you've got it on your hand, gel, on both hands, now the faucet handles are ferked, and you're spending three minutes shaving and five minutes cleaning up a bathroom superfund site.<br />
Then one year my dear friend then aggravating roommate then girlfriend, ex-girlfriend and now dear friend gave me an antique shaving brush and a round chunk of shaving soap (that I jammed into an old tuna can). The difference was night and day.<br />
First, you get a hot shave. Brush under hot water, lather it up in your shaving cup, apply to face. Second - THERE'S NO MESS! No unnecessary cleaning. Third, it smells so much nicer than the aerosol chemicals that come splurting out of a can - (fourth) a can that you have to recycle.  That's not cheap at all! How many cans of shaving cream do you buy in a year? I buy one chunk of shaving soap every two years.
Couple that with a classic double-edged safety razor and you will save a ton of money and aggravation. (None of that tap-tap-tap like with your disposables). Best thing I ever did. Give it a shot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not sure about the double edged safety razor...personally i use a straight razor...i tend to often let my beard grow large and then need to shave, with disposable razors they get clogged real quickly and turn to crap, straight razor cuts through that beard like no one's business, one blade nothing to clog. </p>
<p>my shaving soap is sandalwood...smells real nice, but i just lather it on my face...can't say as i can tell the difference from lathering in the cup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just don't have the patience for a straight razor. Having to shave a beard off I just use an open comb razor. It's all about personal preference. A straight razor really isn't practical for most people for everyday use. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could even be the random nature of them packaging the gel with propellant and it just happened that it turned into a nice thick foam when you expelled it. </p></div>		</li>
