			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in a single grad class at the moment that meets once weekly with a single HW assignment due each week. I will put in time each week doing that HW and listening to the lectures. All of that is the 80% that occurs. The 20% effort I will put in this week preparing for my midterm will do far more for my retention of the material long-term. </p>
<p>That's because when it comes time to take tests we all make better study sheets, review the material as a whole rather than a series of sections in a book. The 20% effort I will make into coalescing what I learned on many different HW assignments and during hours of lecture, is the payoff that matters. </p>
<p>Basically my grades come from a midterm, final, project... 3 discrete events... plus 14-15 HW assignments. I will spend 80% of my time doing the HW and listening to lectures, but it does not make up 80% of my grade. The 20% I spend for the exams and project will be 80% of my grade. Sadly this doesn't mean &quot;don't do the HW,&quot; instead it just means stop stressing if you wrote the &quot;T&quot; at the start of your first paragraph pretty enough it's a short story move along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means some things have larger effects than others on the outcome. Instead of spending equal effort on each component, allocate more effort toward the things that have a larger effect. This could mean skipping one homework assignment in one class to put extra work into a project for another class.</p>
<p>It's a way of thinking about priorities and opportunity cost that takes into account relative effects on the big picture.</p></div>		</li>
