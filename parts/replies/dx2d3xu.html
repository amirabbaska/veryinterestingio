<p>Stealing a company's source code wouldn't really be that big of a deal in most cases.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> <em>Sorry, this isn't meant to be a &quot;YOU ARE WRONG AND DUMB&quot; kind of response, but more like &quot;That's true, but when it goes that way, it reeeeeally goes that way&quot; - I've always found it kind of funny</em></p>
<p>Amusingly, a company I worked for a couple gigs back was a huge player in their space. They'd been making their software widgets since the 90s and are the uncontested bleeding edge of the technology. </p>
<p>For a long time, nobody really had any software widgets that could come close to competing. </p>
<p>Until... in about 2008, somebody on the new dev team in Pune leaked the <em>ENTIRE</em> codebase for absolutely everything that the company made. They never figured out who it was.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, all this company's corporate frenemies had their own takes on the product, juuuuuust different enough to not be blatant clones. </p>
<p>The part I found super amusing was the the codebase that got leaked - was from 2004 and there were literally only 3 modules in common between that archaic release and the stuff that was current at the time of the leak.</p>
<p>In the end, that employer was fairly happy about the leak - now that there <em>WERE</em> some competitors who were generations behind their work, it was a much easier sell for the customer... previously, it was &quot;Well, we need this and there's nobody else... so... bleh. I hate you guys&quot; and going forward it was &quot;Wow! Your stuff really does do so much more than the hardware vendor's built-in solution! We'll take twenty!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

China is very unwilling to prosecute intellectual property cases like this and there could be a lot of money to be lost if your product could have been marketed in China and is now undercut.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why would a Chinese business buy pirated software which is never going to be developed as well as the original version.</p>
<p>May as well just grab a pirate copy of the original!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern software needs supporting infrastructure that's maintained by the company for it to actually work. A company that doesn't need to work within the bounds of IP laws could just stand up their own infrastructure and modify the stolen code to work with it (which isn't possible with just a pirated version of the original). </p>
<p>Think Netflix. The value there is the content on the site as well as all the apps and servers to get it to your screen. But if someone got all of the code, they could just get their own servers and load it up with pirated versions of all the content. Yeah this is a simplistic example but it demonstrates why code alone is worthless <em>only when the underlying IP can still protected</em>.</p></div>		</li>
