			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/ProfJohnBush is absolutely right that pilot waves, as long as they predict the same observations, are just as viable as probabilistic interpretations (such as the Copenhagen interpretation). The real reason why pilot-wave (aka De Broglie-Bohm) theory is so controversial is that it is explicitly nonlocal. Statistical interpretations give up determinism in exchange for being local. Choosing one theory over the other is, at this point, a matter of deciding whether the universe is non-deterministic (ie &quot;random&quot; as many non-physicists struggle with) or nonlocal (locality being the basis of special relativity which physicists love, though there are people who argue that pilot-wave theory can predict the same results as SR). Most physicists would rather the universe be local but probabilistic than deterministic but nonlocal, but taste doesn't really prove anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering statistical interpretations to be local is perhaps a bit of a stretch. As a Quantum Prof. Stephen Bartlett said to me &quot;on one side you can keep a 'realist' view if you accept nonlocality, but on the other side (Copenhagen) where you give up realism altogether, its not like you get to keep locality because there is nothing real to be local or nonlocal anymore.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great quote and is a new way of looking at it for me, I guess what I mean by &quot;local&quot; is that statistical interpretations are much easier to reconcile with special relativity. There is the issue of instantaneous wavefunction collapse, but it doesn't transmit information. The Copenhagen interpretation is a tough pill to swallow, the issue is that there haven't been conclusive experiments that I know of that could differentiate it from a pilot wave theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pilot wave theory is based on the assumption that the behavior of a particle is dependent on the state of the entire universe, while the principle of locality is that a particle interacts only with its immediate surroundings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A number of pilot-wave theories are currently under construction. It is not yet entirely clear, for example, what the wave field is in QM, but there seem to be several contenders within the quantum vacuum. This system suggests that such theories are worth further consideration and development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Professor,  I did a paper over this Copenhagen/Pilot-Wave controversy for a Nature of Science pedagogical course a few years ago.  From my research then I was under the impression that Bohm's kinematic-based reformulations of dynamic Pilot-Wave theory created predictions which were later falsified, and that was part of the reason for the continued broad-acceptance of Copenhagen descriptions.  Is this so, and if so, what does that mean for the future development of Pilot Wave Theory?</p>
<p>Slightly tangential to this conversation: contemporary observations of Gravitational Waves have demonstrated that at least some waves exist as a fundamental feature of universal space. Is this a demonstrable proof of concept for Pilot Wave Theory?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't say I ever paid attention to the pilot wave concepts during my education, but as far as I know PWT doesn't even have an attempt at QFT. You can't say a theory is a viable contender if it only predicts 5% of the quantum mechanics that we know. There's no more accurate field of science than QFT and not being able to reproduce it's predictions completely invalidates PWT. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In bohmian mechanics particles follow trajectories that require non-locality to be possible. Locality basically means that only particles that are &quot;close by&quot; can interact. If we assume non-locality this could be real and it would solve a bunch of problems as well :)  (please correct me if i say something wrong, i'm no expert in this)<br />
Interestingly using the amplituhedron in quantum field theory also suggests that locality is not a correct assumption. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amplituhedron doesn't indicate that locality is wrong; it just derives it as a consequence from other assumptions. That might be a hint towards that locality is not fundamental (although I have serious doubts about how &quot;deep&quot; the amplituhedron really is), but it's not at all hinting that locality is not correct. </p></div>		</li>
