			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. It wasn't great, but compared to the terror of my lyme (I had heart issues, was sleeping 20+ hours a day, sweating to the point where I looked like I'd just gotten out of a pool, all kinds of visual issues, etc) it wasn't so bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, hopefully it's sorted itself out. Mine was mostly joint paint - knees, neck and jaw. Headaches for weeks at a time, trouble standing in the morning, and just zero energy. The herx was just more of what I was having plus a lot more brain fog</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What were the symptoms you had when you got Lyme's? I have had so many tick bites in my life, but never any strong indicators of Lyme's. Nevertheless I worry that I might have it, because so many people who have it don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Symptoms included: heart palpitations for days. Blood pressure fluctuation. Extreme exhaustion, sleeping 20+ hours a day. Extreme brain fog, it was physically uncomfortable to listen to somebody talk to me. Motion sickness looking at any kind of screen. Hands and feet extremely cold. Photo-sensitivity (like I had a migraine with no pain). Constipation (which was weird being on Doxy). Vertigo. Severe mood swings. Extreme feelings of doom. Crying jags. </p>
<p>I include all of these because they went away when the antibiotics kicked in.</p></div>		</li>
