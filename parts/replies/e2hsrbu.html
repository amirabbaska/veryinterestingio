			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you I was looking for someone to bring up Cold Brew. I make it all the time and it’s amazing. I use an Almond Milk bag. It’s a bag used to soak almonds and obv make Almond milk. Basically a giant refillable tea bag.
Anyway you just put ~1.5 cups of ground coffee and 2 quarts water and let it seep for 11 hours. Pull out the bag and you’re done. It’s basically concentrated coffee so you can dilute the concentrate by cutting it with  more water at the end</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the actual drink is a mixture of them boiling cocoa beans, cinnamon, potentially some other spices, and a little bit of sugar. I tried some on a plantation in the Dominican Republic and it was already made so I didn't see the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I live in DR. It's basically what you said.</p>
<p>But there are people that like it very simple and don't even add sugar; just the cocoa beans, a stick of cinnamon and water.</p></div>		</li>
