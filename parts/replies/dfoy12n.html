			<div class="markdown"><p>A proton can also decay into a neutron by emitting a positron, which is the opposite of an electron. This is called Beta+ decay. However, this decay requires energy, unlike Beta- decay.</p>
<p>These types of decay generally happen when the resulting nucleus is more stable than the initial one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure it is. They have different masses because they contain different amounts of energy. Energy is released when a neutron decays into a proton. Therefore their masses cannot be identical.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is equivalent to saying &quot;they have different masses because they have different masses&quot;. It's really not useful in answering OP's question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that a neutron can decay into a proton and electron via beta decay, but how does this work with the quark compositions of the proton and neutron? If an electron isn't a quark, nor is it made of quarks, how can a neutron decay into a proton and electron?  I know it does, but this has always bothered me because it seems to be counter to the quark composition definition. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A quark changes flavor from down to up. Processes which change flavors like this are mediated by the weak force.</p>

<p>The electron is <em>created</em> in the process of the decay. It does not exist beforehand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah - I never knew quarks could change flavors like that. Is there a conservation of flavor law or anything like that which governs this process? Thanks for the explanation. </p></div>		</li>
