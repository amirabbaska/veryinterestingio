<p>Digits 3 and 4 have no extra muscles besides the common flexors and extensors. This means their movements are ALWAYS linked, and the position of one affects the other. </p>

<p>Except they aren't!  Try flipping around what OP is saying.  Put your palm flat on a surface and curl your ring finger underneath your palm instead of your middle finger.  Now try lifting up your middle finger.  Easy!  But you can't do this in the scenario OP describes.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the third finger is more independent than the fourth finger.  I don't know why, and it doesn't really seem like any of the answers correctly explain it here either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's clear that when the middle finger is flexed, the ring finger won't extend. This MUST be because extensor digitorum is forcibly stretched and therefore unable to contract.
When you flex your ring finger, it doesn't seem to have the same effect on your middle finger, ie, extensors digitorum is NOT fully stretched.  Surely the fact that the middle finger is longest and therefore stretches ED the most when flexed is sufficient to explain this?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I really don't know about that definitely being the answer.  It sounds like it might be a decent hypothesis, but I don't know that it is 100% the answer.</p>
<p>Intuitively, I don't know why stretching a muscle slightly beyond what it normally is would cause it to be unable to contract.  It doesn't really make sense to me.  Think about people that are able to &quot;hyperextend&quot; their joints (<a href="http://blaim.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/031913_1059_Elbowhypere1.jpg" target="_blank">see pic</a>).  They have no problem contracting their muscles to return their joint to normal.  If the joint ever gets &quot;stuck&quot; in that position, it isn't because the muscle is physically unable to contract, but because tendons/ligaments/whatever catch on the bone or some other structure.</p>
<p>Personally, after some casual research, it seems the answer to this question may lie in a structure referred to as the juncturae tendinum.</p>
<p>The following quote is taken from this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2408985/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2408985/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tendons [on the back of the hand] are linked to each other by a highly variable collection of fibrous bands known as juncturae tendinum. The bands are probably important in controlling the spacing of the extensor tendons, channelling forces between them and co-ordinating the extension of different fingers [see von Schroeder &amp; Botte (2001) for further details and references]. <strong>However, the existence of the juncturae makes it difficult for different fingers to be extended independently.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh and another thing to think about.  I just tried bending my index finger as in the OP, and tried to lift my middle and ring fingers.  I couldn't at all extend my middle finger any further, but I could extend my ring finger a little bit.</p></div>		</li>
