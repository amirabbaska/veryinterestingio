			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, most surfactants/detergents actually have a love/hate relationship with water where one end of the molecule hangs out with water but the other prefers oils so the soap allows the two to “play nice” and little droplets of soap-surrounded oils can lift away into the water off of your dishes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI, the word for this is <del>amphoteric</del> amphiphilic, meaning the molecule has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic elements in its structure. This can be seen with alcohols too, particularly something like isopropryl alcohol which is miscable (soluable in any proportions) with both water AND benzene - but the solubility of benzene in water is only about 1.8 grams per liter (table salt is a about 360 g/L for reference).</p></div>		</li>
