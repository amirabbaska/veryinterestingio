			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, how does it in any way matter if insect's pain is similar to human pain? Insects obviously don't enjoy pain, they react to harmful stimuli by trying to get away from it. It is irrelevant if their perception of pain is similar to humans'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is exactly what he was trying to say. Everyone who eats lobsters just passively boils them or cuts them in half, because they don't have a CNS and instead have multiple nerve nodes and because we don't have any idea of the conscious experience they are having we should be doing the absolute opposite of justifying putting them through this. But the humans tend to find a way to reason with themselves that what they are doing is okay and as a second nature try to ignore the truth </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It matters because avoiding pain may be a purely mechanical action. We know that is not the case for humans, but we don't know that for insects, lobsters, etc.</p>

<p>Is that obvious? Newer cars on the market will predict collisions and move away to avoid potential harm. By all external observations we can make, this is the same avoidance behavior you describe. But cars don't experience pain the same way humans do--they don't experience pain at all. We anthropomorphize insect pain because we want to know whether their experience is closer to ours or closer to a car's pain. </p></div>		</li>
