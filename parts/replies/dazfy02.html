			<div class="markdown"><p>The GPS guided grading machines are still pretty new. The old fashioned way is surveying and staking.  A team of surveyors goes out to the site and establishes a series of control points, where you know the coordinates and the elevation. Then from that, they lay string and stakes to the appropriate points (again, using their survey equipment) with little flags on them to tell people where the key items go. </p>
<p>Measure twice, cut once.</p>
<p>And while we know have GPS and laser distance rangers, if we wanted we could still use surveying equipment that hasn't changed that much since the early 1800s.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>my friend works in the oil fields in Alberta and he &quot;drives&quot; an excavator to clear areas for the camps when they are making a new rig or dam or logging camp. </p>
<p>there is a satellite/GPS apparatus attached to the blade of his excavator and he gets in in the morning, programs the machine and sets it up. Then he sits back and makes sure everything runs correctly. No operator input. The machine drives and turns and adjusts its blade height all on its own guided by GPS and a set of computer diagrams. </p>
<p>He also gets paid crazy good money to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Machine control on dozers, graders and excavators is amazing.  I was working on a dam job in Manitoba and they had calibrated GPS machine control on some long stick excavators that were working from the shore and excavating a channel almost 10m below the surface of the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did construction in the oilfield as a junior civil engineer, and a lot of it is GPS coordinates, surveying, <strong>and if you're lucky</strong>, guys who know the difference of an inch at the end of their blade. </p>
<p>The ones who run the machines still have to use a hell of a lot of critical thinking in order to adhere to the plans. </p>
<p>The site foreman is the one who plans how to move the dirt around most efficiently. They generally don't want to have to move the dirt more than once, or twice, and will plan to get things done. </p></div>		</li>
