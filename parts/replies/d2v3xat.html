			<div class="markdown"><p>We are looking for people interested in becoming regular volunteers contributing to the scientific work at the site. This is not an experience to do once. No special experience is required other than a willingness to work outside with patience. All volunteers receive training before they can dig. Volunteers are expected to be in good health for working outside in Texas heat and must be able to walk a half mile, lift 25 lb buckets, and use digging tools - shovels, hand trowels, geology hammers, etc. Be aware that as a new volunteer you will not immediately be able to dig for fossils until the training is complete. This is not a commercial operation, we do not sell fossils and under no circumstances are volunteers allowed to take home fossils. We will be looking for people especially this summer. Our minimum age to participate is 14. If you are interested in volunteering, please email arlingtonarchosaursite@gmail.com for more information.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately the AAS is not open to the public because we are located in an active construction site with no parking or facilities. There are no large skeletons or anything big exposed, so actually there isn’t much to see for a casual visitor. </p>
<p>If you have small children I highly recommend the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas. They run several youth programs as well as having one of the best dinosaur exhibit halls around. You may want to check out the Dallas Paleontological Society who have a Paleontologist in Training program for children your son’s/daughter's age. You can find more information at <a href="http://www.dallaspaleo.org/" target="_blank">http://www.dallaspaleo.org/</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're looking for interesting dig sites that are family friendly, I'd reccomend checking out the <a href="http://www.waco-texas.com/cms-waco-mammoth/" target="_blank">Waco Mammoth Site</a>. It's an hour-ish south of DFW, and was just recognized as a National Park. It's pretty wild. You can go on tours through the dig site, and there's still mammoths being excavated that can be viewed. </p></div>		</li>
