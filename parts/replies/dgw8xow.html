			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 21 and I haven't lifted since 8th grade in weight training class. I went for 3 months because my girlfriend worked for the gym and when we moved she had to quit and I haven't gone since. It's been about 3 months of that. It's just not in the finances since in-shit city wants $100 down on a non-contract agreement.</p></div>		</li>
