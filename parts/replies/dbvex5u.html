<p>Most Youtubers have a Patreon page, where people elect to donate money to the person. This accounts for a significant portion of many Youtubers income. </p></div>		</li>

<p>instead of taking it down will request the Youtuber's revenue share instead</p>

<p>They get all of it? What if there are 2 different parties wanting to claim the revenue from separate &quot;infractions&quot; within 1 video? Surely there is some value added for anything original that has been created and the youtuber should still have a slice of the pie</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the complaints Youtubers have—if the video gets copyright claimed and the claimant requests a share of the ad revenue then the Youtuber no longer receives any ad revenue for that video.</p>
<p>It's fair in the sense that technically the Youtuber needs explicit permission (or a license) from both the copyright holder of the musical composition (usually the music publisher) and the copyright holder of the sound recording (usually the record label) in order to incorporate commercial music into their videos. If they do not obtain the appropriate permissions (or licenses) their video can be forcibly removed and they can be sued for statutory damages of up to $150,000.</p>
<p>So, in many ways, it's a fair compromise—i.e. we won't forcibly remove your video or sue you if you use our music without permission, but we will take your cut of the ad revenue.</p>
<p>As for you other question, I don't know what happens if more than one copyright holder files a copyright claim and requests the ad revenue. I assume it's shared between the two claimants, but that I'm not certain of.</p></div>		</li>
