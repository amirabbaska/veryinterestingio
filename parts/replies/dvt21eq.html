			<div class="markdown"><p>A few hospitals (literally...like 3 in the US) use neutron beams as a form of chemotherapy.  </p>
<p>Traditional radiation treatments don't actually kill the cells directly, but either cause DNA damage or generate free radicals, which then cause DNA damage. This is particularly bad for fast-dividing cells, so it hopefully affects the cancerous tissue (which divides quickly) more than the surrounding stuff.</p>
<p>In contrast, the fast neutron therapy beams deliver a <em>lot</em> more energy and can directly affect the nuclear structure of the targeted tissue. This is much harder for the cells to survive, which would be good for cancer treatments, but bad for whomever's holding the sack of neutrons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean besides the giant, hours long, world ending nuclear blast?  Well, it would probably weigh as much as several mountains and immediately begin falling through the crust of our planet like with was wet tissue paper, thereby precipitating a volcanoseismic event that would make the last eruption of Yellowstone look like a party popper.  Atmospheric aerosol induced winter, global forest fires, and near total global ecosystem collapse would all follow.  A high percentage of all life on the planet would go extinct...again...</p>
<p>It's ALL very bad.</p></div>		</li>
