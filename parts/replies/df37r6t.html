			<div class="markdown"><p>Imperial Germany gave up claim over Tsingdao after WW1, which is why there is a brewery there. </p>
<p>Nazi Germany also participated in cooperative efforts with the KMT, which is why early KMT shared weapons and similar political ideals. This was an effort to counteract the Soviets. </p>
<p>Also there's a gross understatement about the deployment and loss of the KMT structure. Which fielded almost 4 million soldiers in effort to stop the Japanese. </p>
<p>Lastly. WW2 in China is a small window. China has been in conflict with itself since the first writings. Bear in mind after WW2 had officially ended, China was still at war. And continued to be in the state of war well into the Indochine conflicts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to your points, all of which are correct to my knowledge, after the continued conflict that ultimately ended with Mao's communists in power, the new communist government focused much more heavily on their victories over the Nationalists than over any aspect of the war against the Japanese. The conflicts between the 30s and 50s were all viewed through the lense of Mao's revolution rather than a global war, so China just didn't talk about it like the West does. </p></div>		</li>
