This has to do with many things including completeness and reliability of data, methods of data collection or sampling, definition of the disease, and cultural differences such as likelihood to seek care or self report.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the surface and on the virus. For example the HIV virus is easily destroyed with some soap and water, wheras hepatitis (cant remember which) needs bleach to be safely destroyed.</p>
<p>Hence, wash you hands realy well after coming from public before you eat. You remove the surface layers of skin and either destroy or wash away viruses and bacteria </p></div>		</li>
