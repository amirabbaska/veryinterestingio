			<div class="markdown"><p>Because even crusty punks that play folk have expensive instruments? Whistling is pretty cool and I know plenty of bands that implement it, but it doesn't always work. Just like a Kazoo, if your band has one, it won't use one at all times like a guitar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't sing easily and play violin for several reasons, but here are three big ones: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Most of the time, especially in modern times, you tuck the violin under your chin with your neck at an awkward angle. You can't sing like that.</p>
<ol>
<li>The violin is LOUD, right under your ear. You can't hear yourself (important for staying in tune), much less others being able to hear. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Probably IMO the biggest reason- there are no frets on a violin/ fiddle. You have to play entirely by muscle memory and by ear. You have to listen. A 1/16&quot; difference in finger placement can be the difference between the right note and something that makes your dog howl. It's hard to listen that closely if you're singing too. </li>
</ol>
<p>Most older fiddle tunes that were sung and played are simpler tunes (amazing grace, for example). Easier to stay in tune both on the instrument and in voice tone. Easy to hear over. Not as much focus required to hit notes and stay in tune. Singing usually ceased when the hard and fast parts started. </p>
<p>Source: I play violin and flute, and can pick a tune on a piano. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to concentrate on your pitch/intonation while playing a non-fretted stringed instrument, and it requires constant micro-adjustments. This pulls your attention away from your own vocal pitch/intonation. </p>
<p>Plus, a violin allows you to modify aspects of the sound that are not all that different from singing.  There's so much control over tone, articulation, pitch, bowing styles, fingerboard position, etc that focusing instead on vocal qualities does end up detracting from the violin's nuances. </p>
<p>It's not impossible to do both simultaneously, but these are the reasons it's rarely done. I suppose if you played a lot of open double stops or something, like in folk music, you could find success singing while you play. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you can! In Folk fiddle traditions it's really common, but you do sacrifice good posture and the violin sits further down your shoulder. Still, classical technique is not that relevant for fiddle players!</p></div>		</li>
