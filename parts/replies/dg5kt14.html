<p>Capable of producing fully artificially generated sounds, incuding speech, in real time (I realize this is not really a &quot;graphics&quot; thing, but it's relevant to the whole experience).</p>

<p>This seems to me like the area where the least progress has been made...but also the thing I would like the most? Alexa/Siri etc all still sound so robotic, I'd like for to be able to ask a digital pa to read anything to me and for it to sound natural but I can't help but think we are still a long way off that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adobe has some tech they demoe'd  last year that can take samples of a person's voice and then simulate their speech patterns. It sparked a lot of controversy because of how it could potentially be mishandled, but I think it's amazing.<br />
EDIT: It's called VoCo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By the rate of progress, it wouldn't surprise me that 15 years brought us a digitized voice that was nearly indistinguishable from a real one</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think its just one of the most commonly overlooked aspects of game design though, and the article I linked to is kind of cutting edge.</p></div>		</li>

Otherwise I'd have to treat these points the same as I would for the setting for sci-fi set ~10 years in the future: fictional (but parts are probable)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift" target="_blank">Oculus Rift</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Vive" target="_blank">HTC VIVE</a> both have well over 1080p screens almost perfect tracking solutions and provide a very convincing experience.</p>
<p>5 is more difficult but not impossible. Motion Controls have been all the rage since the Wii. There are also people already working on making <a href="http://feelreal.com/" target="_blank">smell-o-vision</a> for VR.</p>
<p>We rely heavily on sight. There are even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3468806/" target="_blank">therapies</a> that rely on our brains dedication to the idiom &quot;seeing is believing&quot;. Once you have tricked the brain into mostly believing what its seeing, and its not that hard, the rest is kinda just icing on the cake.</p>
<p>I'm in the same situation as you as far as being an expert (I don't think I am one, but my university wouldn't appreciate me saying that), and this is my hobby, but its a hobby that I've spent a large amount of time researching.</p></div>		</li>
