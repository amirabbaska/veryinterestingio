			<div class="markdown"><p>The neatest part about these images, and something which I think is worth pointing out, is that the images that are being passed around are not composites made by referring directly to other images. They aren't telling the computer to see what it thinks the image contains, then to find other images of that thing and sort of &quot;photoshop&quot; in the closest match. The image data for the generated images comes directly from the memories of the neural net itself in a process kind of analogous (but much, much simpler) to how people remember images and look for patterns. Which is pretty neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like how the white-noise-amplification process allows you to see what the neural network itself &quot;thinks&quot; the object you're telling it to find looks like, which is otherwise difficult to determine (you can't just look at the network and figure it out).  As mentioned in the article, this is useful for debugging purposes (e.g. it turned out that the neural network trained to recognize dumbbells thought that they always came with a muscular arm attached - oops).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is this why the images have so many eyes? It's attempting to run something like facial recognition and turning anything that could be a face or eyes into eyes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically it tries to recognise eyes in pictures (I believe specifically a dog's face), and once it finds something that it considereds to be a dog, it sharpens the features of the &quot;dog&quot;</p>
<p>After doing this it runs the program on that picture again, rinse and repeat</p>
<p>So yeah basically it sees eyes everywhere, sharpens them up, finds new &quot;eyes&quot; and does the same,  until you get these weird images</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the way the eyes are put on there is representative of showing how the process works. It uses the image to search for more pictures and copies eyes in the process of searching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The coolest thing to me is that it allows programmers to see exactly how what the neural network thinks a given object looks like. The article said that they realized their networks thought a dumbell always had an arm in it – something that would have been difficult to figure out otherwise. </p>
<p>This technique is big for neural networks in general, because you could feasibly apply it to any neural network that's focused on recognition. </p></div>		</li>
