It's not that the ear sends a signal that says that there's noise at that frequency and the adaptive system fails to ignore it, it's that the ear sends nothing at all and the adaptive system converts that nothing to a constant annoying sound?</p>
<p>Somewhat similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight</a> phenomenon, where people become effectively blind because of the damage to the link between the image processing areas and the areas responsible for higher-level cognition, while having perfectly functional eyes and even vision-based reflexes like catching a ball working perfectly well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say, with the caveat that there  are multiple stages where adaptation can occur.</p>
<p>Blindsight is fascinating, but I think an even closer analog to tinnitus is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_limb" target="_blank">phantom limb pain</a>, since they both involve the sensation of something when the source of the sensation is gone.  </p></div>		</li>
