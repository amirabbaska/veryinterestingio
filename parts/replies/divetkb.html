			<div class="markdown"><p>No, he's saying cell phones on active cell networks are.</p>
<p>Big difference. One is sending and recieving radio waves. The other isn't.</p>
<p>This is what &quot;Flight Mode&quot; is for on phones and tablets. To turn off any networks, wifi, radio. Etc.</p></div>		</li>

A 14.5 hour flight is not fun when all you can do is play Tetris, listen to maybe 2 old albums you used to enjoy which run in terrible quality, or watch movies that aren't great </p></div>		</li>

<p>This may be be a little outdated with modern networks, so keep that in mind, but at least way back when I was a teenager a big part of it was troublesome to the cell network and people on the ground. Cellphones operate over line of sight radio broadcast. It can only talk to towers it can see (albeit with eyes that can see through a lot of walls) and they have to figure out and negotiate which tower will actually service the phone and manage handoffs in real time to other towers as the phone moves. Not a problem when you're on the ground and can only see say 3-5 towers and move at a walking or driving pace. But on a plane? Your phone has line of sight to hundreds of towers and is moving at very high speeds. That's a lot of math and network management, especially for late 90's cell networks. One or two people actively using a cell phone on a plane could cause noticable network deterioration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern cell phone towers only provide coverage along the ground, but not very high up in the air.</p>
<p>So while your phone might be able to &quot;see&quot; a lot of towers, the signals from the towers won't actually make it up into the airplane and your phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking here. I'm confused because there is no cellular reception once you're up in the air. Does this mean that the phones radio just searching for a tower causes issues as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and more than it would if it were on the ground.</p>
<p>If a cellphone connects to a tower, it only transmits at a high enough power for the tower to pick up its signal.</p>
<p>If it can't find a tower, it increases its transmission to the maximum to try and find one.</p>
<p>With that being said, I don't think there's a passenger aircraft in existence that hasn't had multiple transmitting cellphones in it at all phases of flight: I've traveled with two cellphones and just forgotten one in my bag before, and I know plenty of people who just don't give a damn about the warnings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's no reception your phone will try to connect at a higher power transmission. (this is also why bad reception has a large effect on battery life)</p>
<p>Regardless, it's probably during take off and landing that all electronic equipment of the plane matter most. The margin of error is the least here, and the functioning of all equipment matters most. </p>
<p>And during take off and landing you do have reception.</p></div>		</li>

I would hope that any person with half a brain would understand why this is a problem and comply. It's because they don't educate people about the science behind their policy that we dismiss their request for us to turn off our phones. Oh wait, half of us don't believe in science anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's indicative of a backwards situation when you distrust the people in charge of your safety while aboard a massive flying hunk of metal, and instead choose to disobey out of sheer convenience and based on NO facts. I would think in that scenario they have a decent amount of credibility and should be listened to. However, I do agree that if this were common knowledge, dissenters would be frowned upon more harshly and probably wouldn't do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big part of it is that the airlines rely on the &quot;trust us on these safety issues, we have your best interests at heart&quot; line straight after people have been subjected to unnecessary security theatre to even get into the airport. We know that airport security theatre does very little to actually improve safety but we grin, comply, take off our shoes, belts and remove our laptops for the x-ray machine because if we don't the authority figures in uniforms will prevent us from boarding our flight. So is it any wonder that when we board the plane we are cynical about their demands to turn off our phones? </p>
<p>A bit of explanation as to the science behind <em>why</em> would go a long way. &quot;Trust us&quot; just doesn't cut it any more. </p></div>		</li>
