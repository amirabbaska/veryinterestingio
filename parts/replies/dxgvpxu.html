			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking,</p>
<p>Your brain looks at the world through two lenses. Brain 1 thinks hard and about complex actions but doesn't like to do it.  This is why it takes so much effort to learn new things. Music is an easy example, try to play a small section of guitar by watching a tutorial video. It is really hard to do until you practice more. </p>
<p>Brain 2 does all the automatic stuff that you've done a million times. This brain is really fast but isn't very smart. After you practiced the song a while,  brain 2 takes over and lets brain 1 relax or move on to a new task. </p>
<p>This is also why if you start to lose focus while learning that guitar,  your brain switches over to something you know so you'll play some tune you already know almost accidentally.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The system 1/system 2 dichotomy is <em>not</em> what is actually happening in your body. It's just a useful classification system for thinking of human cognition. </p>
<p>Also, less relevantly, system 2 is not the same as muscle memory, though I suppose there is a lot of overlap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phenomenon called muscle memory is just system 2 acting. </p>
<p>If you are referring to nerve shortcuts then sure I'd agree.</p>
<p>I wasn't trying to explain specifically whats happening physiologically but for ELI5 I felt it was the best approach. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not all that different from writing a computer script to execute a bunch of commands in a perfectly timed order rather than doing it all manually and perhaps forgetting an operator or pressing a button late.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's more like compiling the script so it's a single process rather than a sequence of individual steps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just explained this so much better then my youngest son's neurologist can regarding the stroke he suffered and how it effects his whole right side. He's right side hemiplegic-the hit was on the left cerebral side and also had brain bleeds. Muscle memory is a HUGE part of our lives right now. So happy I came across this sub. </p></div>		</li>
