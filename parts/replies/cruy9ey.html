			<div class="markdown"><p>I think people vastly underestimate what 5 year olds can understand. A typical 2 year old would understand that sentence; most 5 year olds can have fairly intelligent conversations, especially by reddit standards. They just might have to be about potty jokes, superheroes and cartoons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I use a public restroom, the exposed porcelain under the gap is the most disgusting part of the toilet.  The seat will be relatively clean for the most part, but that space usually has congealed old yellow piss and a stray hair or 2.  I usually have to clean that spot first if I'm sitting or else stuff is going to be touching that disgustingness.  I'd much prefer, especially in high traffic and abused public restrooms, to have the entire bowl rim covered when the seat is down.  Yeah, people do sometimes or often piss on the seat because they didn't lift it, but that gap is ALWAYS pissed on, 100% of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the water was that high in your toilet, I suspect something is terribly wrong. I'm American, and toilets in every other country I've ever been to on earth, including Japan--nirvana of toilets--are basically the same. More often than not, they're actually worse, because the flush strength is weak compared to American toilets. </p>
<p>Keep in mind I'm talking about the toilets, themselves. American restrooms are dirty and nasty. There is much to be improved, there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They exist in other countries too. But it's typically an older design. Personally I've only seen wooden seats like this, and never plastic ones (which means not in the last 10-15 years).</p></div>		</li>
