			<div class="markdown"><p>The top answer and this are not correct. The light isn't bouncing around. It does move slower depending on the medium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, but I think this is wrong. I think that light actually do slow down in water as speed is dependant on permivity and permeability of the medium. more explained at my other comment:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct. If light is changing direction, it should introduce all kinds of questions about how it knows which direction to go in. Could it go &quot;around&quot; some matter and continue in a changed direction?</p>
<p>The right answer is that light is essentially absorbed by the field of the electrons in the atoms and transmitted as phonons (sound like waves) and remitted as photons each time they are in free space </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This really isn't different from what he's saying. The light repeatedly interacting with the atoms is what's happening on the micro scale (it has to be, because that's the only thing that happens in QED). When you zoom out to the macro scale, it looks like a uniform slowdown, and the exact behavior of the interactions gets averaged out to the permittivity and permeability.</p>
<p>In other words, if you follow one celebrity as he walks through the crowd, you see repeated intermittent interactions. But if you zoom way out, and assume that there's a bunch of celebrities who have decided to go single file through the crowd (presumably to hide their numbers), the line of celebrities will appear to slow down as it passes through the crowd, then speed up again when it leaves. Various things about the crowd (density of people, how much they move around, how much they care about celebrities) determine how much it slows down on average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Not really. This model gives all kinds of odd expectations. If light is literally taking a longer and randomized path, how to interferometers work in open air? Wouldn't the Michaelson-Moorley experiment prove nothing? And why would we expect the two slit experiment to be significant if it's just noise?</p>
<p>If light is turning, it's experiencing accelerations which means the process is endothermic. But it is in fact exothermic. Further, you can ask if the light isn't slowing down, what the hell is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation" target="_blank">Cherenkov radiation</a>?</p>
<p>You could make a simpler mental model with fewer counter-intuitive assumption by just saying &quot;yes&quot; light slows down. Watch</p>
<ul>
<li>what causes Cherenkov radiation? - the speed of light slows down so when the emitter can travel faster than the wave, you get a &quot;photonic boom&quot; just like a sonic boom when a jet flies faster than the speed of sound in the air</li>
<li>does interferometry work in air as well as vacuum? - of course. Both beams are slowed down exactly the same amount</li>
<li>does the two slit experiment produce an interference pattern in air? Of course, light is slower, it is still expected to travel in straight lines and diffraction is still surprising and indicative of a wave nature. </li>
<li>would shining a laser beam into water warm up the water or cool it down? Of course. Water slows the light down like drag on a car. That drag causes turbulence and releases energy which warms it up. The light that comes out is dimmer. </li>
</ul>
<p>Or you can use a slightly more sophisticated description that it actually gets absorbed and reemitted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Absorbed and reemitted&quot; is both simpler and more accurate. Why introduce an actor and a party with tables to explain a wrong answer that gives a totally wrong impression?</p></div>		</li>
