			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all. Your dentist for instance uses film. For those that go digital:</p>
<p>Now instead of using film, you use a screen that is sensitive to the x-rays. It sends a signal that a computer can turn into a printable image.</p>
<p>Edit. Thank you for corrections and clarifications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very few of us use film, actually. Unless you're in the middle of nowhere, there's an extremely high chance your dentist is using a digital sensor, but your general point is correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They were probably one of the last holdouts because of the need for a very small &quot;sensor&quot; that you could fit in somebody's mouth, which meant film was still better for a while.  But it's relatively common for dentists to use digital x-rays now.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most are, but there are still many things that are still done with film.  It's mostly limited to doctors/agencies that refuse to update or the very few specializations where the highest resolution possible is required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most are using a reusable phosphor plate and a digital scanner. But not digital in the same way. Where a camera has the sensor in the camera viewing reflected light, xrays plates need to be behind the object in order collect the pass through light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are big differences as well. As an example, x-ray cameras for medical applications don't have optics, as x-ray lenses and mirrors are very challenging to build. You need a small well-defined source of x-rays, and then you mainly look at the absorption between source and detector. Cameras in the visible range work with all sorts of light sources, and they typically detect the light reflected by the object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>X-ray microscopes can also use nested mirrors or diffraction lenses. Traditional refraction is impractical due to high absorption (depending on the frequency).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh. You're describing a pinhole camera in reverse - the source is the pinhole, instead of the detector.</p>
<p>I agree that X-ray focusing is challenging, and focusing visible light is relatively trivial, but X-ray machines are still very similar to one type of camera - the camera obscura (in reverse).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be a false color image similar to ir photography. While you could separate wavelengths hypothetically, it wouldn't be similar to what you see. It would essentially be a color map of just how penetrable the material is, which wouldn't give you a significant amount of additional information (unless the material behaves very differently depending on wavelength)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While perhaps not very useful clinically, such X-ray technology is what is used in airport scanners, and is very important, as it's what allows the systems to visualise different materials, making it way easier to identify what's dangerous and what's not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As it was already mentionned, you can create a false colour xray image using multiple energy levels (wavelength) but they have to be exposed separately  (with known and slightly different spectrums) because we dont have detectors able to differentiate between the different xray wavelengths simultaneously. This is already used in medicine in certain CT scans and Xray and is known as dual energy xray (basically 2 colours) Its useful to differentiate certain substances such as calcium from surrounding tissue. It increases the radiation to the patient and the benefits are clinically marginal still. Research in this domain is ongoing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not particularly common in plain film X-ray. However it has more application in Computed Tomography, which produces X-rays in basically the same way as a plain film application it is just far more diagnostic. Here's a brain perfusion image I found demonstrating color mapping.</p>
