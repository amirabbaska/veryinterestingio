<p>Most of Japan's debt is owed to the government of Japan. And what debt Japan owes to private bond holders is owed in a currency it controls. </p>

<p>This is the best answer I've seen, but it misses something important- Japan has been funding itself by buying its own bonds with newly-created money. If you look at the bond issuance the majority of them are purchased by the Bank of Japan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually a big problem for Greece was that the ECB refused to do much of that for them. Germany had this idea that greece had to pay it all back as a moral principle, without much regard for how it would devastate their economy and cause problems all over Europe. </p>
<p>The Japanese stuff is on the down low. For some reason it's not considered polite to say it in public. You have to dig through a lot of media to piece that information together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very unlikely. Japan's culture with regards to personal finance is drastically different to most of the anglosphere. They had a very deep recession caused by an asset bubble burst in the 90s, which means Japanese citizens/investors are very averse to risk. In particular, their real estate market went to absolute crap so most people don't consider home ownership as a very safe investment. In addition, Japanese people really like new homes, so the homes immediately start to depreciate as soon as you buy them - sort skin to the car market is western countries. A fair few banks also either went broke, restricted deposit withdrawals or simply defaulted on deposits during the aforementioned recession, so many Japanese people are quite wary of banks. Thus, many of them turned to the safest, yet still easily accessible investment: Japanese and US government bonds. It's a really difficult situation with no real solution.</p></div>		</li>
