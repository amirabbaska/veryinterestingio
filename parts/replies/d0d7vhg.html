			<div class="markdown"><p>Most microwaves these days have power settings that make this 'trick' redundant. On mine I just do [cook time] + Power Level button + 8 to get 80% power, or 7 for 70%, etc. It's a pretty underused feature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that doesn't turn down the power, it just cycles the magnetron on and off.  80% means it'll turn off for 2 seconds every ten seconds, etc.  So the bread in this scenario gets blasted with full power for 8 seconds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean that old microwaves have dials that you can simply turn to easily change the power. New microwaves have cryptic UIs with buttons and a dial that do seemingly nothing, so most out people just press the  &quot;heat for 30 seconds&quot; button multiple times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The power setting isn't usually a power setting at all, it's an on/off time setting. So if you put it at 20% power it just cooks on full for 1/5th of the time and doesn't cook at all for 4/5ths of the time, to allow the food to cool during that period. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem. I spent a year working in a bioenergy lab with people who worked on microwaving wood chips or pellets to make biofuel or char. There's a lot going on as people have mentioned with humidity as well. If the air is dry enough it'll take on moisture too, but it can only take on so much. It's like filling up a water balloon, it can only take so much before it pops. Humidity isn't the driving factor when it comes to microwave though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't it much easier to turn the knob a bit down instead of getting a cup, filling it with water, then putting it with the breadin the microwave oven? Why are people even doing this?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/disorderlee" target="_blank">disorderlee</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, no. The power settings on most microwaves is simply a timer and does not really adjust the power, but the amount of time it pulses. So even adjusting the power may not produce the same results due to it being a distribution of energy versus a shorter blast of energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright so I'm not going to get into heat transfer or dielectric heating, but this isn't a problem with a simple answer. You would have to use maxwell's equations and solve for this in iterations because the dielectric constants change with temperature. There's also things like penetration depth that you have to consider. We typically use Finite Element software like Comsol to model stuff like this. The formula to figure out the energy absorbed by a dielectric is this:</p>
<p><strong>P = ω<em>ε_0</em>ε_2<em>Eeff^2</em>V</strong></p>
<p><em>Where</em> <strong>ω</strong> <em>is the frequency,</em> <strong>ε_0 and ε_2</strong> <em>are the dielectric constants,</em> <strong>Eeff</strong> <em>is the effective electric field, and</em> <strong>V</strong> <em>is the volume of the material</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got a good scientist answer. Here's an engineer answer:</p>
<p>Assume your piece of pizza is 6 oz. So you're heating 8oz water + 6 oz of pizza. Assume most of the pizza mass is water or water-like. So roughly 60/40 water to pizza heating. </p>
<p>Then heat your water+pizza for 100 seconds. Measure pizza temperature.
Heat another slice of pizza without water for 40 seconds. Compare pizza temps. Create correction factor for future pizza heating calculations. </p></div>		</li>
