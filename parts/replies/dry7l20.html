			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries man! I just read up on a bunch of different websites, and have a background in the sciences, so I figured I’d try my best, though it’s not nearly as simple as I explained- which I suppose is okay as an ELI5. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very informative. Thanks. </p>
<p>What I can't get figured out is that we have variability on the same finger depending on how we place it. The ridge configuration of a 1cm x 1cm section of finger is different if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shift the finger over in any direction by a fraction of space</li>
<li>Rotate the same section in the window (placing finger up/down vs left/right)</li>
<li>Press harder/lighter</li>
</ul>
<p>How do these systems accommodate for that?</p>
<p>And theoretically couldn't someone gain access due to that variability?</p></div>		</li>
