<p>the sheer fucking heat and steam coming off a professional dishwasher is nucking futs.</p>
<p>I'm just going to throw another &quot;my first job was washing dishes&quot; anecdote on the pile. Your home dishwasher is made by designers who know you're going to load that fucking thing like a retarded monkey and then leave your shit to get all crusty inside of it.</p>
<p>My professional dishwasher had custom racks for each sort of thing I was going to put through it. Water glasses? A perfect grid for each one, so they were face down, and got the maximum pressure and drainage. Wine glasses? same, but narrower and more support. Dishes? There was a &quot;best way&quot; to load them so they got most clean, and if you were lazy, you'd end up spending extra time scrubbing shit and re-running it. The heat, pressure, detergents and accessories on that thing were totally customized to kick the fuck out of those dishes, just like the guy i'm piggybacking off of said.</p>
<p>That's why you'll occasionally see a person with some high-end &quot;professional&quot; range or stove in their house, but never a professional dishwasher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend bought one of these commercial dishwashers, ten year old that was in constant use in a retaurant - but it wasn't anything near what you describe. It's around 1.5x bigger than your average home dishwasher, draws over 8 kW of power over 3-phase (380V here, Europe), completes cycle in 90 seconds and they come out SCALDING HOT - it basically flash steams them. Of course any printing/paintings on the plates and mugs just vanishes in the process. This one also uses normal tap water, and draws around 10-15 liters per cycle (4-7 gal? I guess), and any only maintenance it frequently requires is replacing sealing, as rubber wears down, ever 5-6 months or so.</p>
<p>He told me that his wife HATED that monster, until some extended family came, dinner was served, and they got second meal on the same dishes five minutes later. Now she says, she will divorce him, if he gets rid of it!</p>
<p>Of course, it being so large, has it drawbacks: for a family of five, it takes 2-3 days to fill it up, so if any food ends up there... smell. But, as he says, after the cycle, nothing stays.</p>
<p>for a person living alone, or a couple, that'd be overkill. For a single person something like <a href="http://clipset.20minutos.es/bosch-instant-dishwasher-lavavajillas-personal/" target="_blank">this</a> would probably make sense, if anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That Bosch Dishwasher is interesting.  Where would you wash larger things like pots or pans?  </p>
<p>But also, if I only had 1 plate, 1 cup and a utensils , it would just make more sense to just wash them myself.  </p>
<p>In fact, I am 1 person living alone and I just use paper plates. </p></div>		</li>

<p>we spent many efforts trying to get all that gunk off, and I never once saw it completely lime-free.</p>

<p>Citric acid! It's what is recommended for home dishwashers and washing machines, too.</p></div>		</li>
