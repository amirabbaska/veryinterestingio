			<div class="markdown"><p>Bird flight and insect flight is very different though. In not even sure if certain insects would be able to make a flying motion in zero-g due to the mechanics of how they fly. They move their wings by contracting and expanding their thorax (body cavity) rather than having muscles directly attached to their wings. Without gravity I dont know if their thorax would still be able to make the motion required for flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That thoracic motion has nothing to do with gravity.  In indirect flight, which you're talking about, paired muscles warp the exoskeleton to elongate it or flatten it, kinda (but not at all) like how when you squeeze playdoe it gets longer.  The wings beat because of they way they're anchored into the skeleton.  There'd be no problem generating flight.  There might be problems controlling it, but they've had bee colonies in orbit and the colonies seem to function normally, though I don't think they were flying freely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info. I knew the contraction part would work as that just requires the muscles to pull on the exoskelleton, what I didnt know is whether the reverse motion would work correctly without gravity to pull the insects body down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plus there isn't any terraforming of Mars to be done that's stupid. We are terraforming Venus. 90 something % the mass of the Earth, geologically active, organics, iron core. We use Mars as a F.O.B for asteroid belt access, send a stream of them at Venus at a calculated oblique angle, jump start it's core spin and get a magnetic field going again, and blast off some of that excess atmosphere. Wait a little while and we can begin</p></div>		</li>
