			<div class="markdown"><p>Like ten or so. It depends. They usually service 3-4 houses.</p>
<p>Though, in my area, a lot of the power has been moved underground over the years and pretty much all new construction homes and businesses are added to the grid via underground power. I do a lot of rural work where the green box will only provide power for a single residence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EU is all 230V nominally so transformers can be further from consumers and smaller per unit output current for the same losses. Not sure how much that is offset by the larger core for 50 vs 60 Hz.</p>
<p>The &quot;tiny&quot; transformers on poles in North America seem to go up to about 170kVA, which isn't exactly small. There are some tiddlers when they just supply one place though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There might be a slight size difference due to North America being at 60 Hz and Europe at 50 Hz (higher frequencies -&gt; smaller transformers which is why planes/boats use 400 Hz). But are you sure you're comparing comparable transformers, and not think of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_substation" target="_blank">substation</a> or something?</p>
<p>Could you provide a picture of a giant EU transformer.</p>
<p>Basically, higher frequency, smaller and cheaper transformers, but more line loses (i.e. the 400 Hz used in planes/boats would not work on a full sized grid). But I wouldn't think 50 vs 60 Hz would make that big of a difference to the perceived size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of software development. So many companies are running on 20 year old legacy code that they just keep patching. For all the reasons here, we don't refactor old systems just because. There has to be a clear and defined business need that shadows the cost. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>20? 20 is young for code.</p>
<p>Mainframes are largely code compatible back to the 1960s, and pretty much every big legacy company (banks, insurers, etc) still have a whole lot of 50+ year old code/systems running, often a lot of their core business functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Often the cost and risk isn't worth it. </p>
<p>Switching to a newer framework or language can imply re-writing most of the code as even a simple change in logic can break everything (especially when we're talking corporate-level software which tends to be <em>very</em> complex). It ends up being cheaper and, more importantly, <em>safer</em> to keep patching old code (think of banking software, for example, where fuck-ups can have <strong>massive</strong> financial repercussions).</p>
<p>That's why developers that can work with &quot;outdated&quot; languages can earn ridiculous sums. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Make sense. The cost to convert an existing overhead system is prohibitively expensive. That's not difficult to understand. But how is it many other countries have managed to achieve underground delivery? </p>
<p>Where I live overhead is only used for long distance high voltage transmission and the occasional remote property like a farm where you need to run a significant distance to perhaps serve only a single property, otherwise all local delivery in every single town and city to every single building is underground.</p>
<p>My question really is how have countries like mine managed to achieve this? What is so fundamentally different about the US vs other countries that resulted in the US creating an overhead system in the first place (and a result creating the problem that it would be prohibitively expensive to change over to an underground system) vs other countries going with an underground system presumably from the start? (and with it avoiding the issue and cost of converting later).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That I couldn't tell you.  I don't know enough about the industry in other countries to say.  Cost is obviously a part of it, as overhead lines are much cheaper to build.  That may be exacerbated by the comparatively larger distances involved in the US - large cities are much further apart and there's a ton of sprawl.  </p>
<p>It may also be in part due to the ownership of the power companies - private in much of the US, public in many European nations.  It's easier for a publicly owned power utility to get easement rights to run the lines through roadways, where the American private power companies have to negotiate with each individual landowner.  There's also the free market reasons - American electricity tends to be cheaper than in comparable EU countries, and I'm sure building large sections of the grid overhead contributes to that.  A company building everything underground would have higher costs, and that would end up passed along to the consumer.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Those countries you are looking at, did they have their infrastructure and cities bombed to shit in the 1940's and had to rebuild anyway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a very good point, something I had not considered. That said the last house I lived in was built in 1920. So while that is perhaps a contributory factor, it can't be the only answer.</p></div>		</li>
