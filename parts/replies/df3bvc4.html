<p>What's the difference between a business going out-of-business and filing bankruptcy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most simply, a business can go out of business without filing bankruptcy. Imagine you're a small business owner in a small town. A lot of people know you and shop at your business. But Wal-mart just opened in your town, and they're able to source products much cheaper than you are. You're nearing retirement and you've saved a bunch of money. You own the land your store sits on, and you have a lot of inventory. But you have no children who want the business. So you decide to shut down your business and retire. You sell off all of your inventory for just a little more than you bought it for, and you manage to sell your store building for $100,000. You close your store and retire. You've gone out of business, but you haven't filed bankruptcy. </p>
<p>A business can also go out of business AND file bankruptcy. Imagine a slightly different scenario than the one above, where you own a small business but you don't manage your money very well and you start owing a lot of money to other small business owners in town. Then Wal-mart moves in and business goes down a lot. After a year or two, it's clear that no matter what you do you'll never be able to compete with Wal-mart, and pay off all your debts. So you file bankruptcy and close your business. </p>
<p>Okay, so those are two simple situations. But what about businesses that file bankruptcy and DON'T go out of business? </p>
<p>This is what happened to a bunch of airlines in the early aughts. But understanding what happened requires understanding pensions. Let's recap what those are: </p>
<p>At their most basic, pensions are a perk of employment where the company tells employees that if they work for the company for a long time, they'll get a monthly paycheck even after they retire from the company. And the longer they work at a company, the more money they'll get in retirement. It probably won't be the same amount they were making before they retired, but that's okay because they no longer have to commute to work or pay for lunches at your company cafeteria, so their cost of living is going to go down in retirement anyway. </p>
<p>Why would a company do this? Well, it costs a lot of time and money to find good employees. You have to screen people to make sure they're highly educated and/or hard workers, and that they won't steal from you. And once you hire them, there's a few weeks, or a few months, where they're not making you money. They have to be trained, so they're not doing the job at all while they learn, or they're not doing it efficiently enough to output enough to cover the cost of their pay and make a company a profit. Not to mention, an experienced person probably has to work with the new employee a lot to show them how the job is done, which means the experienced person isn't working as efficiently as they could. </p>
<p>And when an experienced person leaves your company, it costs the company money. How? Well, an employee costs money each month because they have to be paid a salary, and need health insurance and whatnot. But – in theory – employees make a company more money than they cost each month, otherwise the company would never make a profit! So when one leaves, that costs the company the profit they were earning. </p>
<p>Therefore, if a company can incentivize people to stay for a long time, it might be worthwhile since you won't have to go through finding and training new workers, right? Let's say you start working for a company when you're 25, and you work there for 20 years. You might have a lot of pension &quot;credits&quot; built up at that point. But if you leave to go to another company, you lose all those &quot;credits.&quot; And if you go to another company, you may have to start over at zero on your pension. If that other company isn't willing to pay you enough extra money to put away part of your salary into savings to make up the difference, it won't be worth leaving, right? So your pension is a strong incentive to stay at your company once you've been there for a while!</p>
<p>The problem is that if you've been in business for a long time, you start to get a very long roster of people who have retired and who you're still paying.</p>
<p>When companies promise employees a pension plan, they have to set aside money each month to help fund it. It's sorta like paying a second paycheck for an employee, but putting that second paycheck into an investment account. Then, when an employee retires, you just pay them out of this second account. </p>
<p>Now this is really important: Regardless of whether or not the company sets aside enough money, they still have to pay the pensions they promised to people once they retire. So let's say that your company puts all the pension money into an investment account and then the stock market drops a whole bunch and your pension plan loses all its money. Or, let's imagine that somehow one of your executives managed to steal from the pension fund – maybe they made it look like you were paying into the investment fund enough money for everyone, but really they were siphoning off money into another bank account that only they knew about. Or perhaps you just didn't put away enough money because you figured most of your employees would die by the time they're 75, while they start living longer and longer as time goes on. </p>
<p>Consider another scenario where you hired someone 25 years ago when the business was doing really well, but now that person is still working at your company and they're not making you as much as you expected they would, because business has gotten really bad. So you can't put away enough money to fund that person's pension. </p>
<p>Either way, you still have to pay your pension obligations! That means putting aside money you might not really have to pay for those pension obligations. What do you do? You might tell currently active (pre-retired) employees that their future pension is going to be smaller than they thought, to help fund the obligations to the people currently receiving pensions. That will make them really mad, because you promised them they'd get a certain amount of money in retirement, so they didn't put away any savings for retirement. Or maybe you try offering the people currently receiving pensions a &quot;lump sum&quot; – that way you can pay out a bunch of money at once and never have to pay them any more pensions. It'll be less than they would have received if they continued getting their pension check every month, but they can do whatever they want with all that money they'll receive at once, like pay off their house to significantly decrease their cost of living to the point that their Social Security check can cover their costs.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other things a company can do when pensions become a problem. But one of the other things they can do is file for bankruptcy reorganization. This basically means that the company will be required by a court to change how they do some things, but they'll be allowed to pay a lot less for their debt, or nothing at all on some of it. </p>
<p>Back to our examples above: Airlines. In the early aughts, it became clear that U.S. airlines were in trouble because the government had changed some rules about how airlines worked, which meant that there was a lot more competition from low-cost airlines than before. But airlines had built their company benefits around a certain expectation of profit, and now the whole industry was changing. They couldn't continue paying the benefits they had promised AND continue operating. This is like the scenario I mentioned above where an employee works at your company for 25 years and you can't pay them what you were originally paying them. </p>
<p>So airlines were allowed to default on their pension plans through bankruptcy. </p>
<p>The United States has a government backed &quot;insurance&quot; plan for pensions. Basically it's a system where the government agrees to make sure that people who've been told they'll get a pension will get something, even if their company can't pay the pension they agreed. The problem is that this protection does't cover the entire pension plan – it has a cap on how much it will pay out.</p>
<p>If you're very young, or perhaps you've only worked at office jobs, you may not quite understand why this is such an issue. The important thing to understand is that people who worked for companies that promised a pension usually didn't save anything for retirement. You know that 401k benefit that many companies offer? Those were created BECAUSE so many pensions were defaulted over the last 25 years, and the government &quot;insurance&quot; plan was having to pay more and more, so the government said companies had to pay more into the pension insurance plan. At that point, companies decided that pensions weren't worth the cost anymore – better to figure out other ways to keep employees than promise a pension. So they started offering 401ks, and other benefits. </p>
<p>But those 401ks came mostly AFTER pension plans started to blow up. So lots of people who didn't save for retirement, expecting a pension from their company which had promised them one, were caught in a situation where they didn't have a back-up plan. They were too old to get another job, with no money except their Social Security check, which usually isn't enough to live on. </p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, this reorganization allowed a lot of airlines to continue in business, which allowed most of the current employees to still get paychecks, which is really important because lots of them have families that would be in real trouble if they didn't have a job. </p>

I know I'm asking a lot but this is something that caught my attention recently and I just can't seem to find much source that comprehensively discusses it as a whole picture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chapter 11 is a reorganization of the company.</p>
<p>Imagine a company owes a lot of different people money. The people owed are called 'creditors.' The company borrowed money from some of them. The company lost lawsuits to some of them. The company pays rent to some of them.</p>
<p>When one of those creditors doesn't get paid in a timely fashion, he might start to suspect that the company is failing. The other creditors might get wind of this, too. All of them might try to collect whatever money they can from the company before the company loses all of it to other creditors.</p>
<p>You see, the company only has so much money. It has some cash in the bank. It has some assets it can sell--office furniture, product inventory (the stuff it sells), etc. Creditors might be eying that cash and those assets hungrily, hoping to be the first one to force the company to sell all of its stuff and fork over some money.</p>
<p>Here's the problem. A lot of times this is bad for society. Companies are valuable things. Oftentimes they make a lot of money--they just owe a lot of money, too. So it's bad for everybody, including creditors, if one creditor forces a company out of business. Here is where Chapter 11 comes in. In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, all the creditors get together with the company in federal court and they negotiate a way to 1) keep the company running, and 2) maximize the money the creditors get. If all the creditors can agree to some terms that keep the company going, they may each get paid back more (in the long run) than they would if they just fought over what the company has right now.</p>
<p>Part of this arrangement is that the court forbids any collections from the company outside the scope of that agreement. So the company gets some protection from its creditors--and it gets to continue to do business.</p>
<p>Sometimes this doesn't work, and the company is forced into Chapter 7 (liquidation). That's when they just sell all their stuff and pay up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember working for a bank doing commercial underwriting. If we weren't first in line to your collateral you didn't get a loan. It's obvious but occasionally we would catch wind of someone having a liquidation or going out of business sale and they would take out all the cash from the business. This isn't okay. If your business is failing and done for we own your product. I can recall two times we rented a uhaul showed up and showed up to stop them from getting rid of everything. </p>
<p>Another time unrelated we had someone who's business burned down and for some reason their insurance didn't put our names on the checks. Huge deal because they no longer had collateral (the building) which would mean if they decided not to pay us we had nothing to take back. The only reason we found out was they were depositing a 20k check from an insurance company. The teller (we were a very small bank) realized the customer hadn't made any regular deposits in a long time. They asked the customer who said the business burned down. After the customer left we frozen the account and verified yep they had no business any more and they still owed us like 100k. This was right before I left but the insurance company definitely fucked up somehow. Our records showed the bank on the insurance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note that ownership of the company is something that can be negotiated during such a bankruptcy.  Creditors might, for example, accept newly-issues shares worth 90% of the company in lieu of repayment of the debts they are owed.  Those creditors are effectively trading cash now (which they might not get any other way) for shares of future profits if the company recovers.  </p>
<p>The existing shareholders of course see their stock diluted to nothing.  Shareholders have virtually no protection at all during bankruptcy, because they thing they own is already deemed worthless.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If all the creditors can agree to some terms that keep the company going</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It only takes agreement of 50% of the creditors to authorize terms. </p>
<p>What I forget if the creditors are counted as one vote per creditors or one vote per dollar owed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chapter 11 bankruptcy is a limited form of bankruptcy during which the company continues to operate and renegotiates its debt with its creditors. The company undergoes a reorganization, and may sell off its assets (cash flow  generating legal instruments like bonds or physical assets like a store) in order to pay its creditors back. Many companies that undergo chapter 11 bankruptcy have their debt reduced, say cut in half, have their stockholders absolutely whipped out (lose all their money) but then continue to operate afterwards and don't go out of business. Creditors prefer that the company stay in business rather than being liquidated (sold off piece by piece) because that way the company can continue to generate revenue. </p>
<p>To clarify businesses can also undergo chapter 7 bankruptcy and be completely liquidated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice summary. I would just like to add that Ch 7 is a liquidation bankruptcy. Any amounts of equity you have in assets that are non-exempt would be liquidated by the Ch 7 Trustee to pay off your unsecured debts.  </p>
<p>Chapters 11 and 13 are reorganization bankruptcies where a Plan is created to pay back certain debts over a period of time. Usually the remaining unsecured debt is discharged if the debtor completes the Plan in good faith. Main advantage of reorganization bankruptcies is that debtors generally get to keep their assets while the conduct their plan and do not have to worry about losing non-exempt assets or equity to liquidation.</p>
<p>Receiving discharges in all chapters only discharges that persons (or entity's) direct liability on most general debts. If the debt is secured by a security interest in an asset the debt remains against that asset. There are ways to remove secured liens but that would require a bit more detail and the methods only apply in certain situations.</p>
<p>Lastly most people file for the automatic stay which prohibits any acts of collecting or perfecting debts during the pendency of the bankruptcy. Creditors can obtain relief from the stay but the automatic stay is considered one of the most powerful injunctions. It applies immediately upon filing of the bankruptcy petition and stays even pending state or federal court actions outside of bankruptcy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk, if OP is interested, but in Germany you can undergo a personal bankruptcy once in your life. It is for &quot;normal people&quot;, not businesses though.</p>
<p>You basically have to ask all debtee you owe money to, to forgive those without any further demands. This is called a &quot;zero plan&quot;. Obviously they deny. Then you file bankruptcy with the court and your request is filed publicly in the &quot;Bundesanzeiger&quot; (Federal Announcements). During that time other debtee can file that you owe them money. Credit rating agencies are also notified of your bankruptcy and your score goes to the worst imaginable. </p>
<p>After the above mentioned period, the court enters you into bankruptcy. During that time, you get a bankruptcy manager from the court, which gets a say in your financial things. He can actually actively intervene in any contract you sign, because he is responsible for your financials too, from now on. You are also  now protected from any seizures of your bank accounts or payments from the employer. Debtee have a very far reaching power to seize a lot of your assets, including security deposits you made to your landlord. So this protection is quite important to get your life in order.</p>
<p>Everything above roughly 1080€ (for a single, unmarried person) is used to satisfy any debtee's interests and you only get that amount of money for your disposal. Then you have a period of 6 years in which you are obligated to do everything in your power to pay off your debt and also not make any new debt. You also have to pay court costs of about 1500€. If you do not earn enough and are unable to find work, for legitimate reasons, the court cost can be forgiven. If you manage to pay everything off in time, the whole process can be shortened by up to 2 years iirc. After 6 years, you are declared debt free and after another year, all credit rating companies have to delete the entries regarding your debt and your bankruptcy. You now have a clean slate and can start a fresh financial life.</p>
<p>Idk, maybe interesting to see methods from the other side of the world.</p>
