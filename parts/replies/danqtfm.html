			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called partible paternity and some cultures still practice/believe it. And you're right regarding survival: </p>
<p>&quot;He suggests a Bari child is 16% more likely than a single-fathered child to survive to the age of 15, probably due to improved nutrition. Among the Ach√© people of Eastern Paraguay, having multiple fathers appears to protect children from violence, the main cause of infant and child mortality.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, Bonobos have promiscuous sex for bonding and stress relief, not for females to get males &quot;on the hook&quot; for offspring. I mean, it's not like male bonobos pay child support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, most early societies had community child rearing, and there was no inequality between the genders (this kind of society was described as 'primitive communism'). But the advent of agriculture created a profit motive to raise as many kids as possible in individual family units, leading to the development of the nuclear family as a social expectation. Theorists predict as we transition into capitalism and out of capitalism, community rearing will be the social norm again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I took an advance anthropology course, we spent a lot of time on the Yanomami Amazon tribe.  They live in extended family units, where the women grow subsistence crops of manioc and the men hunt.  I think that division of labor is pretty typical.  I don't know which job is more/less work, but someone did a study of the Yanomami food supply and calculated the women were contributing significantly more calories.  Also, some women were traded as brides to neighboring tribes to help keep the peace, a tradition that probably developed due to the benefits of genetic diversity.  </p>
<p>Has there ever been a society with true equality between genders? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about the dietary contraceptive theory, but there are arguments that the lifestyle of people in these cultures has a big influence on their beliefs about reproduction. They tend to be sexually active from a young age - usually with many partners - due to a culture that is very open about sexuality. At the same time, they also lead very physically active lifestyles with a low-fat diet, which leads to a delay in menstruation for women until they're around 17 years old. With these things combined, what you end up with is people having sex without resulting pregnancy for many years, and a likely reason why they do not associate pregnancy with sex. </p>
<p>Source: in an anthropology class; we discussed this about Trobriander society recently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yams, although I'd like to emphasize that the effects are very mild and will only slightly reduce the chance of pregnancy if you eat them quite a bit. Not sure if different breeds are more or less effective</p>
<p>Edit: I may have been wrong about the yams thing based on more recent research I been made aware of, sorry for the possible confusion (also many of the posts have been locked so I can't reply to them with this message)</p></div>		</li>
