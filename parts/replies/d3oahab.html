			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that make it impossible or just generally unlikely? If the atmosphere expanded so far out that it encompasses the moon, couldn't the moon just be in geosynchronous orbit and continue moving along with its surrounding atmospheric gasses in a frictionless fashion?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be a crazy amount of drag on the moon if it was orbiting through an atmosphere. Even if you think of just the gasses sliding over each other there would still be friction/drag. This would cause the moon to slow down and spiral inward. So I suppose it could happen for a short amount of time, but it would be bad for both the planet and its moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that depend on how <em>dense</em> said atmosphere was, though?</p>
<p>Couldn't you have a very, very thin atmosphere (where our hypothetical moon is) that exerts little enough drag on it that this would be possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if the atmosphere rotated along with the planet and the moon was in a geostationary orbit, then there would be zero friction. Is that a possibility? or would the planet's host star cause some sort of sum rotation of the atmosphere relative to the planet's surface?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Impossible. You can't have atmosphere past the Roche limit. If you add gas until the atmosphere goes past the roche limit, you add mass, so the gas gets compressed more by the higher gravity and the Roche limit gets pushed further out. You can keep going until you have enough mass for a star or black hole, but won't get an atmosphere past the Roche limit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That doesn't really describe gas giants, though. By mass, Jupiter is mostly metallic...liquid metallic hydrogen under incredible pressure, but still, metallic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, for anything that resembles what you're thinking of when you read the word &quot;atmosphere&quot;. </p>
<p>Dracomister's answer is about the Roche Limit. That is about how close two objects can be without tearing each other apart gravitationally. This is <em>much</em> further than athmosphere extend to (ISS is ~400 km, Roche Limit for Earth-Moon is &gt;10'000 km). So, you can't bring objects close enough for them to ever reach any kind of significant atmosphere, because stuff will literally explode first. And if you could, the moon would start to loose speed, spiraling inwards and eventually crashing into the planet. This would happen very quickly (astronomically speaking).</p>
<p>Now, an object that is too small to hold any significant atmosphere might still have gases that evaporate and replenish a very thin atmosphere. If that object has a moon, the escaping gas might stick around for a bit in the whole system, and you could technically call that a shared atmosphere. That happens in the Pluto-Charon system, with Plutos atmosphere at the surface having a density of 1/100'000th of Earths. That is really interesting, however, active comets have much denser &quot;atmospheres&quot; than that which are also <em>much</em> larger, sometimes larger than the Sun! </p>
<p>So, the answer is still no, it's not possible to have astronomical objects flying through any significant atmosphere of another planet without some kind of desaster of astronomical scale beeing imminent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. A dwarf planet can have a very tall and very thin atmosphere. If one were to imagine Pluto with a much much deeper atmosphere, it is easy to imagine that atmosphere being shared by its moon Charon. This would be dependent upon the fact that Pluto has very little gravity and very thin atmosphere, and the fact that both bodies are tidally locked.</p></div>		</li>
