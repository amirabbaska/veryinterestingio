			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the explanation! This the way I've come to think of MSG more than salt. Is something similar going on with chemicals like MSG and is there a key difference? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MSG is a salt!  It's a salt of glutamic acid.    In the science world many many things are salt, not just table salt.  Hence the use of &quot;ion&quot; channels - since it isn't just Na and CL (sodium chloride - table salt).</p>
<p>I don't know too much specifically about MSG mechanism beyond the basics but yes, it would work in a similar fashion.  MSG is considered a flavor enhancer, much like salt.  In fact MSG will dissolve in water into Na and glutamic ions and anions; with Na being the same as table salt.  So (most) any channel activated by the Na in salt will likely get activated here too.  It has very little flavor on it's own but when combined with other, specific flavors, makes them more intense.  </p>
<p>TL;dr: Yes.  It works in a similar fashion on similar channels.  Also note that a single thing (ie salt/msg) can react with many channels, not just one type.  It's a complex cascade of reactions.  </p>
<p>Edit: The key difference here would be table salt being NaCL (Na + CL) when dissolved and MSG largely dissolves into Na + Glutamate.  Much of the difference would be the Cl versus glutamate, but other things may be going on too.  </p>
<p>MSG and its mechanisms are admittedly beyond me.  I'm a food scientist but I don't work in the savory realm.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really complex question that I'll attempt to answer in parts, but it's most likely a combination of things below plus other things I haven't mentioned (or considered).  This will not be even remotely like an ELI5 as a warning.</p>
<p>Taste is subjective, but defined by qualities we give them - sweet, bitter, salty, etc..  Saltiness being one of these major flavors  to quantify a flavor results in even small changes having very large magnified effects.  </p>
<p>We also perceive flavor intensity - not just what type of flavor.  As saltiness increases we taste something as more salty (duh).  However, there is a &quot;max&quot; saltiness threshold that once hit we can't/won't perceive something as more salty.  This &quot;maxed out&quot; threshold is relitively low for something we consume in larger quantities, therefore we taste the &quot;OMG to fracking salty! relitively easy&quot;.   (My theory on this is since salt intake essentially matters for 24-48 hours due to excretion; we evolved to want constant low doses of it.  It wasn't something we could have a ton of now and be fine without for a month or two like some other nutrients.  And a single high does wouldn't be helpful and detrimental if anything so we evolved to quickly &quot;max out&quot; on it).   </p>
<p>Also related to the perceived intensity of a flavor is HOW we taste salt.  Salt taste is a fast flavor to us - meaning when we first taste it the intensity raises very very quickly than drops off quickly - which creates a &quot;sharp&quot; flavor peak that is desirable to most people.  However these fast rise/fast drop type flavors give the impression of more intensity - adding to the salty impact flavor.  </p></div>		</li>
