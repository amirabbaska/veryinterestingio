			<div class="markdown"><p>If you could, &quot;greater depths&quot; here would mean a few tens of centimeters at most.  Not really enough to make an appreciable difference.  Pressure rises fast underwater.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it not possible to train your lungs in this way or are you unsure? If it were possible, would you see there being any benefits to this type of training outside of diving deeper? For instance, might it improve my cardio or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jacques Cousteau found himself unable to breathe through a long snorkel, and he was one of the greatest divers of his time (if not the best of his time). This leads me to believe that, while you could probably increase your lung power somewhat through training, you could never increase it enough to use a super long snorkel. It would simply be beyond what your lungs could do. To use an analogy, you could train your muscles to lift more weight, but you could never train enough to lift an adult bull. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were curious, an adult bull weighs about 1,700 pounds. The deadlift record is just over 1,000 pounds.
I'm sure people have lifted more in other types of lifts, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jacques Cousteau's reasons for being a great diver have little to do with the physical ability you're discussing.</p>
<p>Free divers like Maiorca, Mayol, Herbert Nitsch, et. al. would be better examples to this context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After being a swimmer since I was very young, I pride myself on being able to hold my breath for long periods.  However as a kid I tried to breathe under water using a pool hose (1 1/2&quot; diameter) and while sitting on the bottom of a 4' pool found out that my lungs could not do it.  It was amazing to realize how much pressure is involved.</p></div>		</li>

I have never learned how to swim (had a fear for water since childhood), but sometimes I hold my breath for fun and I can confidently do 2 mins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: In one of Jacques Cousteau's books (I believe it was The Silent World) he wrote that as a young boy he had thought it would be possible to breathe through super long snorkels, but later in life found he couldn't even breath through one in a shallow swimming pool. Of course, he would go on to invent the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus: Scuba. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So as someone who has never scuba'd before, how does the self-contained system aid in this? does the additional pressure from the tanks sort of &quot;force fill&quot; your lungs, to an extent? is there a pressure adjustment to make sure it pushes a certain amount based on the ambient water pressure?</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Holy cow! Thanks for all the super informative replies! I think scuba just made the bucket list!</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never scuba dived, but I think this was the breakthrough that Jacques Cousteau had when inventing &quot;Scuba&quot; technology. The air tank is at like 3000 psi and the diaphram of the regulator you breath through is exposed to the ambient pressure of the water. This allows it to provide air at the correct pressure for the depth you are at.</p>
<p>This is also why it is important to never hold your breath when scuba diving, a lungful of 130 psi air is much larger at even a few psi less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The SCUBA regulator converts the high-pressure air in the cylinder to an intermediate pressure 7-10 bar above the surrounding water pressure. When the diver breathes in a valve opens up allowing the high pressure air to continue to convert to intermediate pressure making it easy for the intermediate air to be inhaled by the diver.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The air in the tanks are pressurized to about 3000 psi and the regulator steps it down so you can comfortably breath. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Encyclopedia Brown series actually goes into this by saying a man tried to hide from someone by using a hollow bamboo reed to try to breathe underwater.  Turns out the guy died because after a certain length you would be unable to move the air due to the pressure.  I know it's just a kid's series, but it was usually spot on with physics analysis that kids could understand.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find the story you're referring to (though it sounds familiar), but the trope you linked to seems like it's saying the exact opposite?  </p>
<p>In that case it specifically talks about pressure not being the problem, but about rebreathing the same air until suffocating.  Though it's also mixing in the need for the snorkel to get wider (for pressure), so I'm not sure what to think =)</p></div>		</li>
