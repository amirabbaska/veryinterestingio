<p>hundreds of them are stable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are only 80 elements known to have any stable isotopes at all. I know several of them have more than one stable isotope, with one being far more common than the others, but surely &quot;hundreds&quot; is an exaggeration? That would require every element to have <em>at least</em> two or three stable isotopes and several to have more than that.</p>
<p>Edit: Just looked it up for myself: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only 90 isotopes are expected to be perfectly stable, and an additional 164 are energetically unstable, but have never been observed to decay. Thus, 254 isotopes (nuclides) are stable by definition.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only give a short cursory overview of this.</p>
<p>We have a wealth of experimental data on most all of the elements in the periodic table. We know how they exist, how they react, what they're made up of, what phases they exist in, and all of their other characteristics. From that data, we can &quot;interpolate&quot; and develop models and theories that explain these phenomena. However, perhaps when we synthesize an element that doesn't naturally exist, it will throw a spanner in the works, and we'll need to construct a better model based on our new understanding. That better model is more complete at explaining natural phenomena.</p>
<p>For instance, we have experimental data that shows the Flerovium is potentially a gaseous metal that shows properties of some noble gases at room temperature. That's bonkers.</p>
<p>What they're doing is literally creating new forms of matter and investigating their properties. Not only is it really fucking cool, but it's expanding our knowledge of how the natural world works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically as the physics and chemistry become more extreme the experimental results can be used to refine the fidelity of our physical models.  These models have utilility unrelated to the production of super heavy elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool, thanks! So for example if we say that the rate of something happening is currently modeled as  X + Y = Z, then we find that it doesn't quite work in extreme cases and that X + Y(1.000001) = Z is more correct there, it would then be tested to see if that's true in normal situations as well. Then, if it is we'd go with the second equation? </p>
<p>Apologies for the run on sentences and if this didn't make sense. I'm exhausted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the difference between creating them and &quot;using physics to figure out how they would behave&quot;? Do you mean using <strong>theory</strong> to figure out how they behave?</p>
<p>Well, we don't know that the theory is any good at predicting the properties of these extreme nuclei unless we test the theories.</p>
<p>Theories reproduce <em>what we know</em> very well (they have to, or else they'd be modified or thrown out in order to do so). And we can use theory to predict things we haven't yet measured, but we can't know whether or not the prediction is correct until we actually make the measurement.</p></div>		</li>
