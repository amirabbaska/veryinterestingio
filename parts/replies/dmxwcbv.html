			<div class="markdown"><p>well not so much actual climbing but more so to drop things on them on the way up, and to create extra problems for siege towers. Castle batters were very multifuntional.</p>
<p>Functionally, at that angle they are nearly identical to vertical for people actually attempting to climb, but it offers much greater options to stop them doing so.</p></div>		</li>
