			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's anything like my book-signing, you'll have to buy the book at the book-signing itself. It's due to them numbering the books so that lines could be formed pertinent to who arrived earliest.</p>
<p>The proceeds to <em>You Are Here</em> go to the Canadian Red Cross! It's a great coffee table book of images. I really enjoyed that book, but <em>An Astronaut's Guide to Life</em> is definitely more info-packed and better. Just saying, if you wanna get both, you probably won't be disappointed!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the insight! I'll definitely be picking up <em>An Astronaut's Guide to Life</em>, I'm ecstatic when it comes to information, though visuals certainly don't hurt. </p></div>		</li>
