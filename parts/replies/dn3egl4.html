			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a brilliant analogy. Someone should tell Rockstar that. Maybe they'll figure out how to design enemies that aren't superhumans with god-like powers of aiming the fixed cannons of a notoriously unstable helicopter directly at a man-sized target who's already zig-zagging 100 meters away. They created an incredibly detailed open world filled with all sorts of different activities, then populated it with enemies that make you want to throw your keyboard into the monitor or your controller at the television.</p>
<p>And now I just realized why I keep coming back to it despite hating it so much. It's because every time I buy the next really expensive piece of simulated military hardware, I get to feel proud that I did it without forking over a single dime for those dumb-ass shark cards. I think that's a pretty bad thing, though. Game developers shouldn't want their players to play their game to feel like they're fucking over the devs when they win.</p></div>		</li>
