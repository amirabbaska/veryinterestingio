			<div class="markdown"><p>It certainly does serve a function - in addition to the active fight against the infection, many of the living invaders are swamped in the overwhelming volume of white blood cells around them. A bacterium trying to invade a healthy skin cell, but surrounded by 100 dead blood cells, is thwarted from reaching its goal.</p>
<p>And when a pus-filled sore is emptied by squeezing, many living invaders are flushed out with the millions of valiant white blood cell corpses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly correct. I would just nitpick and state that usually the white blood cell (WBC) self-destructs and degranulates toxic compounds to kill the bacteria. It's very uncommon for the bacteria to kill the WBC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Admittedly it's been about a year since my immunology module so I'm quite rusty, but I was under the impression that degranulation involved exocytosis rather than apoptosis as a mechanism for granule release? I could be very wrong about that however. </p>
<p>As for bacteria killing WBCs, I just gave two examples as to things that could kill them, I wasn't sure about what the biggest cause of WBC death is. I know that WBC lysis is caused by PVL in some staph infections, but wasn't sure of how common this was.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that it depends on what granule is released, and if lysosomes degenerate intracellularly. Regular degranulation does use exocytosis. It's usually when the neutrophil has an intracellular bacterial burden that is ends up opening lysosomes and granules intracellularly and results in collateral damage. It's not &quot;apoptosis&quot; per say, and it hasn't been well defined  in terms of molecular messengers and pathways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what WBC we're discussing--neutrophils, which are the most prevalent WBC and the &quot;first responders&quot; to most infections, have a short life cycle and basically just run at their target, engulf it, blow up, and die. (More specifically, they can't replenish their lysosomes--the thing that causes the &quot;explosion&quot; of the bacteria inside the WBC--so they are one-and-done defenders). Macrophages, however, are hardy and once on the scene of an infection will continue to grab, engulf, and breakdown bacteria as many times as possible for as long as it would normally live (hours/days long), unless a pathogen also causes it to die/trigger a &quot;kill me too for the good of all&quot; signal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>neutrophils. They pretty much phagocitize a few bacteria and then die, hence why they build up. </p></div>		</li>

It's a common acronym in the medical/scientific community. It may stick the next time someone non-medical reads it.</p></div>		</li>
