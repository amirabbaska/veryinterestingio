			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents met in S.A and both learned fluent Afrikaans while there (now living in the UK). My mum got a job that involved communicating in dutch. It only took her a week to somewhat understand and construct sentences in Dutch and not much longer to communicate effectively for work. She would always say how similar the two languages were and felt if she were around dutch people 24/7 she could have picked it up well in a week alone. So they must be very similar (to put it in comparison she's now having to learn Spanish for another company, she been at it two months and is still fairly clueless).  </p>
<p>On a side not as a child I could fluently speak Afrikaans. 20 years later the only words I remember (and still mix up tbh) is &quot;frot&quot; and &quot;tackies&quot;. Would've been nice to be able to speak two languages but hey :') </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to Afrikaans-speaking primary and high schools and most of my undergraduate studies were in Afrikaans. In our final year of school, we had a Dutch book as prescribed work in Afrikaans. I speak German, and also some Italian, Spanish, French, isiXhosa and Russian, and there is no way I'd be speaking grammatical Dutch in a week. I can communicate with Dutch people, but it would take a month or so of immersion for me to achieve generally good grammar, and it would take at least a year before I could hope to pass as a Dutchman for more than a sentence or two.</p>
<p>The thing is, Afrikaans threw away almost all the grammar of the Dutch language, and you just don't learn that in a week, and there are subtleties of pronunciation and ingrained speech habits that are tough to break.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hardly surprising. Afrikaans is a daughter language of Dutch, so they are extremely similar. Dutch and Afrikaans are Germanic languages: Spanish, on the other hand, is a Romance language, a very different family altogether. Your mother would probably find German noticeably easier than Spanish.</p></div>		</li>

I am glad for them for how famous they have become but they are also portraying their own warped version of afrikaans culture. They definiately don't portray mainstream afrikaans culture. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>should add that to a Dutch speaker, Afrikaans sounds like very simplified and literal descriptive Dutch.</p>
<p>Example: their word for &quot;prison&quot; is &quot;cellenhuis&quot; which translates to &quot;cell house&quot;.</p>
<p>My favourite is &quot;bijnabroekje&quot;, which translates to &quot;almost panty&quot;. It's their word for &quot;miniskirt&quot;, because you know, you can almost see her panties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are all Dutch words. The Afrikaans word for prison is &quot;tronk&quot;. Also if I had to &quot;Afrikaansify&quot; bijnabroekje it would come out as bynabroekie.
Also Afrikaans to me is much closer to Flemish than Dutch. Wish I could say more about the linguistic history, but I honestly know jacksquat about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both bijnabroekje and bynabroekie are the same for me as a Dutch person, the 'je' and the 'ie' imply the same thing so I would understand both.
I don't know why Afrikaans is more close to Flemish for you, because Flemish is 100% understandable for a Dutch person and it sounds way different than Afrikaans. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I believe quite a few Flemish people were among the settlers.<br />
Quick note though. Flemish is not a language. At best it's used as a descriptor for a mix of regional dialects which don't always sound similar making it hard to say that Afrikaans sounds like Flemish.</p>
<p>It doesn't specify which Flemish dialect nor how strong it is. (Some old ones are really something else)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ja, Afrikaans is a kitchen language. It's a language that derived out of necessity. Households were made of many different languages (Dutch, French, Sotho, etc) and therefore takes cues and words from all the different languages.<br />
Of course it's has since matured and a lot of the words have changed in pronunciation and spelling but words (and therefore context) can be understood by the languages that made up Afrikaans.</p>
