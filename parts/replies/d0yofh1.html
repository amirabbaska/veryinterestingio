			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you'd overheat pretty quickly from your suit, because <em>you</em> are producing energy... but yeah, you'd not overheat from the sun.</p>
<p>Rather ironic, really.  Right next to a star, and you die from roasting in your own body head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine temperature as the amount of thermal energy contained in matter. If you have very little energy stored in extremely small amounts of matter the temperature of that matter is very high. If you touch it, the energy gets distributed across your matter, which can absorb far more.</p>
<p>Very simple practical example: A candle-flame has a temperature of a few hundred degrees. Yet, drop a lit candle in a bucket of cold water and you won't notice any temperature change in the bucket because the mass of flame is so low. But pour half a bucket of water at just one hundred degrees in, and you'll see a big change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there's not much of anything there.  The temperature is high, but the amount of energy it contains that can be transferred to you is very low due to its very low density.  </p>
<p>A high temperature does not mean high total energy.  It just means a high amount of energy for the amount of stuff that's there, but can easily be a quite low amount of energy overall. </p></div>		</li>
