			<div class="markdown"><p>Fish can see quite well above the surface. A lot of study has been done on this with trout because of the popularity of fishing. Basically the biggest limitation on what they can see above the water surface (from underwater) has to do with the refraction (and reflection) of light by the water surface. A fish closer to the surface sees a much smaller area above water than a fish deeper in the water colum.</p></div>		</li>
