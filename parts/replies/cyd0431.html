			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this poster, I just wanted to expand that these reasons together are the biggest reason the site is unreliable. (Editor bias + bad summaries of sources) A lot of Wikipedians have their own pet sources they like, and having not gone to the library lately, have not been updated, or synthesized with the current beliefs on things, so they end up looking like a summary of whatever sources were available at the BFE County Library and not necessarily representative of everything available.</p>
<p>There are two extremely large obstacles to anyone dumb enough to attempt editing Wikipedia in a serious and constructive manner:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wikipedia explicitly gives preference to online sources and recently published accounts. Both of these equate to a requirement that documentation be as distant as possible from the actual evidence. That is the exact opposite of what an expert will do, so experts are effectively prohibited from using good practice. I hasten to add that primary sources are not forbidden by Wikipedia policy; but some policies do firmly declare that one should not &quot;analyze, synthesize, interpret, or evaluate material found in a primary source yourself; instead, refer to reliable secondary sources that do so.&quot; This is the opposite of what experts actually do.</p>
</li>
<li>Bureaucracy and edit wars are won by the people who are most familiar with years of rules, not the most correct person</li>
</ol>
<p>Some really important core articles are really, really bad: a good example is the article on Homer* - The thing is so absolutely awful that it needs a complete re-write from scratch... But this is the article on Homer. A pretty big topic, and one in which an awful lot of people have an awful lot invested. Editing even one paragraph of it is a recipe for a protracted conflict. Re-writing the whole thing from scratch? Forget about it. Your right to correct Wikipedia by swinging your fist ends at the nose of some nerd who is better able to keep years of arbitration &amp; bureaucracy in mind. If you do not know the dispute resolution process, and you do not have the tenacity of Asperger Syndrome, you will not and cannot win, despite being factually correct.</p>
<p>Between the misinformation, poor choice of sources, and entire sections that either don't belong or are wholly misleading, there's not a huge amount to salvage on Wikipedia, outside of hard maths/sciences where there are definite capital-F Facts and Formulas.</p>
<p>*explanations:</p>
<p>Obsolete sources: Gilbert Murray, Martin Nilsson, Wilhelm Dörpfeld. Nilsson and Dörpfeld were very respectable when they were alive, but a little thing known as the &quot;decipherment of Linear B&quot; has happened since their time; there's also a certain amount of fiction in the claims attributed to them (there is no &quot;palace of Odysseus&quot; on Ithaca).</p>
<p>-Fringe views: references to Murray, Samuel Butler, Robert Graves, Andrew Dalby, Barry Powell</p>
<p>-Unrepresentative sources: Najock &amp; Vonfelt (these are probably the worst offenders; there are others)</p>
<p>-&quot;The association with Chios dates back to at least Semonides of Amorgos...&quot; - both false (the source is <strong>Si</strong>monides of Keos <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonides_of_Ceos" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonides_of_Ceos</a>, 3 centuries later than Semonides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semonides_of_Amorgos" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semonides_of_Amorgos</a> ) and misrepresents the source cited (you will not find this source in West's edition if you look in the &quot;Semonides&quot; section! West rightly puts it under &quot;Simonides&quot;).</p>
<p>-The section on &quot;Life and legends&quot; is totally misleading, since it prioritises ancient biographical traditions (even while accepting that they're basically fictional), and even there, it prioritises fictional legends from the Roman era ahead of material dating to earlier centuries! The upshot is that a satirist (Lucian) and a totally fictional story (Hadrian) are prioritized ahead of modern linguistic research.</p>
<p>-&quot;Homeric style&quot; section: hopelessly bad, based entirely on a single 19th century literary critic. No mention of anything 20th century or later; no mention of formulae, tropes, and type-scenes; no mention of the enormous number of modern narratological studies. Even it were confined to traditional olde-style literary criticism, it's flabbergasting that critics like Lynn-George and Redfield get no mention, and Auerbach and Andrew Ford get minor citations at the bottom</p>
<p>-&quot;Homer and history&quot;: totally obsolete. No research later than the 1890s-1900s is represented (Schliemann); no mentions of Snodgrass, Korfmann/Latacz vs. Hertel/Kolb, van Wees, Grethlein, or Raaflaub.</p>
<p><em>END RESULT</em>: What I found out, when you try to change a ton of things, at once, is I got my account banned, because essentially they thought my (truthful, necessary) massive revisions to the Homer page were one crazy person who just wanted to be contrarian. The way wikipedia judges sources and users editing it is that a hundred people gradually calcifying an article over a decade is somehow more reliable than someone like me, knowing what I know, going in and trying to redo it all to modern factual standards, and if you try to be revolutionary, you will not win the arbitration process. So we end up with the verifiable, but obsolete Homer page you see today, and that's just one small thing important thing out of 1000's of things</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great expansion on the issues Wikipedia has.  I just wanted to follow up on one (accurate) thing you mentioned: the bias towards online sources.  It's very true, but it also exists for a very good reason, namely to (try to) prevent sources being summarized badly or incorrectly.  If a source is online then theoretically any Editor could glance at it and notice that it's summarized badly, or left out some key information, etc.  When it's a physical volume, the number of Editors able to look it up drops dramatically, to say nothing of how many would be willing to.</p>
<p>I'm not saying this is ideal - far from it - but for what Wikipedia set out to do it is understandable.  I'd argue that without a bias towards online sources Wikipedia would actually be far worse, just in a different way.  Still, it's something to keep in mind when reading articles on Wikipedia: they may be really well done, but that doesn't mean they're the best you can find.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think it's possible to adopt a rating system for each Wikipedia page if it meets some golden standard of well-thought-out principles?</p>
<p>Like if a page has multiple attributed sources both online and offline, is vetted by multiple academics coming from multiple perspectives, presents the facts as well as controversies surrounding those facts, etcetera etcetera, then that page can be considered a five-star article, for example. </p>
<p>Upon visiting a page and looking at its rating, the user can see right away whether the article he's reading is factual, fair, and concordant with the current research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so painfully true sometimes.  Fortunately every now and then you can point out the farcical nature of what's going, point out that despite so-and-so going by proper procedure it doesn't change facts being, well, facts, but it's rare.  I've seen so many idiotic arguments turn on decisions relating to who did what in the proper order instead of what the sources actually say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In other words, wikipedia is a war of who has the most time to spend on something, sometimes that can be good and a good editor will spend a lot of time and effort making a good article where one might not otherwise exist, other times it leads to bias towards whoever has the most time to go through wikipedia processes and keep editing. The people with the most time to spend tend to be the most obsessed and the most biased. That kinda explains why some parts of wikipedia are gold (ie. Hard sciences) and others are absolute trash (more social issues and politics), someone obsessed with chemistry will probably make a good chemistry article, someone obsessed with Bernie Sanders won't make a good Bernie Sanders article.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading this gave me flashbacks, it really was like politics or congress, trying to worm your way up the ladder, every action scrutinised, communicating/making deals/hatching plans 'off-site'.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a nutrition class I took in college. Registered dietician / instructor says vegetarians HAVE to combine amino acids to be a complete protein in every meal. Now, the original author who suggested this has since retracted this view, stating that the &quot;complete protein&quot; was just an arbitrary set of values; research since has shown that amino acids stay in circulation for some time, therefore not requiring them to be combined; and that a vegetarian diet of proper calories per day will meet the protein needs of all but a few outliers. </p>
<p>All of this falls under the modern dietetic maxim that to be healthy, all you really need is to eat a variety of non-junky foods, which my instructor with her registered dietician certification does agree with, but her mindset towards protein combining is still stuck on some early edition of Diet for a Small Planet, and she's stubborn, so every class she teaches is going to learn off the wrong citations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey wait... I just realised we've been taught this all the time too, even though the fact that protein remains in the blood for some time has been accepted parallely. Sometimes you just don't connect the dots I guess... I feel really dumb now, but considerng that every teacher I know so far did the same mistake despite being so much more entrenched into it makes me worried.</p>
<p>Do you have data on how long exactly amino acids are supposed to remain in the blood?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, interesting. Thanks for writing, even as a long-time vegetarian, I never knew were those ideas came from. Apparently (wiki), Labbé retracted the view in 1981, ten years after the first edition.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell, if that's the case then I'm fucked because I don't eat meat in every meal I eat, and I certainly don't eat a complete amino acid mix in all the vegetarian meals I eat. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post. To expand on sections 1 and 4. If these issues are a problem on the George W. Bush article, imagine how bad they are on obscure articles (especially biographies) with fewer sources. The trick is in the subtlety e.g. Say you're biased (we all are), you find an unflattering fact about your favourite war hero from the War of Obscurity. Well you can just omit to add that particular fact to the article. Probably no one is going to check the source anyway, especially if you've written the article well and apparently neutrally. You could probably even get the article up to GA or FA class, as most peer reviewing is on the grammar/prose/style of the article, rather than if it's actually correct/true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  And when someone tries to add it in, you just revert the change and demand sourcing.  Nine times out of ten, the newbie won't even return to challenge you.  In the future, then, &quot;consensus&quot; becomes that the fact was immaterial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, &quot;reliable source&quot; in wikipedia land does not actually mean a reliable source.  Many of the most egregious errors I have seen on wikipedia have been sourced... the source was just an incorrect summary of the information, or contradictory with other sources, or just flat out wrong.</p>
<p>This happens a lot.  It's frustratingly hard to get accurate information on a topic, and if no one cares enough to dig then misinformation can survive for long periods of time.   Especially topics which require specialist knowledge such as science or legal backgrounds can be very hard to accurately summarize based on the inaccurate summaries that inevitably appear in multiple secondary sources.</p>
<p>An additional frustration with wikipedia: try getting the information corrected and you'll run into a wall of people reverting the correct information because it doesn't agree with the incorrect sources that are already there.  Even if they're obviously incorrect, someone watching the page is likely invested in the false information having dug it up and put it on there without actually understanding it.  Contradicting that is &quot;original research&quot; and disallowed.  Sometimes I think wikipedia was designed as a sort of venus flytrap of misinformation.</p></div>		</li>
