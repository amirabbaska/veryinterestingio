			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed out one piece of information, and it made me cry.... The capture effect.</p>
<p>If you place AM transmitters too close together in frequency, you hear a mixture of them both. Two FM stations don't do this, because they sit at different frequencies constantly, so any &quot;blips&quot; into each others range come out as noise extremely higher than the humans range of hearing (and normally filtered by the audio filters in the radio). This is why FM receivers 25 years ago would loose stereo momentarily (encoded above human hearing) but keep the mono so well that you barely notice anything happened.</p>
<p>The rest of your explanation was perfect, and under voted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overlap is also a range issue. AM signals have longer wavelengths which aren't disrupted by obstacles to the same extent as FM signals so they travel much further. Under the right conditions, AM signals can bounce off the ionosphere and travel past the horizon as well, meaning you could pick up two signals from opposite ends of the continent, which isn't really possible on higher frequencies. The effect is more pronounced at night, so the FCC requires stations to reduce power at night, but it's weather dependent and overlap can still happen from very long distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now hold on a moment.  FM stations don't do that, primarily because they're generally decoding with phase-locked loops.  So long as one of the stations is noticeably stronger than the other, the phase-locked loop will stay mostly locked on the one station -- which gives you nice signal rejection.  The interference you're describing sounds to me like interference/beating in the <em>AM</em> band.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PLLs jitter from it still. I was trying to explain PLL decoding while avoiding getting into it, because even though I studied it (several times) and use them in clock multipliers, I still think they are creepy magic not to be messed with (basically, my brain just won't understand the why).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What part was the historical accident?</p>
<p>The allocations of much less spectrum for AM than for FM? The decades of R&amp;D that went into developing FM after AM?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oops, missed that, sorry.  The part where AM was the most accessible technology at the time when 1MHz receivers were just becoming readily manufacturable.  FM came later for a bunch of reasons, but one is that it is harder to decode well.  By the time that technology was ready for mass market, VHF and up was the available band.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think accident is the right word, because yeah, FM had more forethought of malice.  Yes, there is 15x more bandwidth in the FM spectrum than AM.  Each FM station was alloted essentially 100kHz bandwidth per station (ever notice the tuners are always odd numbers after the decimal? 89.1, 89.3, 89.5, etc?), to avoid sideband overlap and other stuff I've forgotten to malted beer hops and bong resin clogging my synapse. </p></div>		</li>
