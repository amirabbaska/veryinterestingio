			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but the islands are essentially mountains so the waves aren't impeded by a gradual slope to the shore. There's nothing to break on before coming close to shore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder the percentage of the scientists (and much larger support crew, somebody has to wash the dishes) that sailed the southern ocean to McMurdo Station on Ross Island. I think the vast majority fly into Scott Base from Christchurch.   But your point is correct, the southern ocean is not to be taken lightly.
Shackleton and the crew of the Endurance, I can’t even imagine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scientists fly in. I was a sailor on a supply ship. We went in summer time and the seas weren't so bad. Although being so used to it, swells no matter what size are smooth and waves are rough. Then we hit ice and go through it until we can't.  Then we waited for the Russian IceBreaker to come lead us in. They are awesome by the way. Total party beasts and also professional and kind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know.  USCGC Polar Star, Deep Freeze 90 &amp; 93.  We cut a fast ice channel and escorted supply ships as well.  We also helped with science stuff too which was pretty cool. We evacuated about 100 support staff from McMurdo with us when we left for home in February.  It meant an extra port call in Adelaide SA so we didn't mind one bit.
Icebreakers don't do well in large swells or rough seas so the transit down from Tasmania in late December, beginning of summer could get interesting.  Christmas dinner 1990 was crazy, remembering back I feel so sorry for the cooks in the galley.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently saw a documentary about the Russian nuclear powered ice breakers, and it was insane. My boss is prior USCG, and he told me about the differences between the Russians and the conventionally powered USCG ice breakers he was on.</p>
<p>What I thought was really funny was the difference in techniques. </p>
<p>The USCG ships will almost nudge the ice, then they will throttle up the engines to get the bow up on the ice, and then the weight of the hull will break the ice beneath. Rinse and repeat for weeks on end.</p>
<p>The Russian nuclear powered ships don't have the torque of the USCG models, so they built massive ships by comparison. They hit the ice at full speed, and just keep going until the ship stops. When they get stuck, they back up a ways, get going full speed, and ram the hell out of it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to find comfort in believing that somewhere in the Antarctic there’s a nuclear icebreaker forever going around helping those in need, his crew getting professionally drunk on vodka and reactor water while doing so.

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was no summer sail and cross island hike, that’s for sure.
Not to hijack the thread at this point but in case folks are interested, here’s a <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/a26938/south-georgia-island-ernest-shackleton/" target="_blank">nice summary</a> .
The book, Endurance, An Epic of Polar Adventure by Captain Frank Worsley is a good read too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was telling an American friend about the Shackleton expedition, and when I got to the James Caird bit, he said he and some other crew had gotten seasick being pushed around by Southern Ocean swells in an <em>aircraft carrier</em>.

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite passages from the Aubrey/Maturin series is when they’re being chased around the Southern Ocean by a Dutch warship. The waves were 80’ high, with gales at the crest of the waves and calm in the troughs. If the ships didn’t keep up with the waves - meaning flying every stitch of canvas - they’d be turned sideways and capsized. Eventually they manage to shoot away one of the <del>sales</del> <del>sails</del> masts, and this massive Dutch ship with 300 souls is capsized and swallowed by the ocean. And they can’t stop to look for survivors because they’d die, too.</p>
<p>All of the actions in these books are based on real events, so I can’t imagine what that must have been like for the people who really lived through it. It’s no wonder passage to Australia was equivalent to the death sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been about 20 years since I read any of thise books but I immediately remembered the scene you're talking about.  IIRC they didn't just hit its sail, but one of its masts. It was a one in a million shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Desolation Island</em>?  Ha, I'm just about halfway through that right now and you just spoiled the action a bit for me.  But I'm not bothered.  </p>
<p>As soon as the Dutchman was mentioned, I knew there would be a chase, and of course Lucky Jack Aubrey will come out on top.  I still want to know what will become of Miss Wogan or Herapath, though they are likely doomed.   And certainly Stephen will correspond with Diana Villiers one more time, and she will put her hook back in him.</p></div>		</li>
