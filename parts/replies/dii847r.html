			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if you want to avoid perjuring yourself.  Part of the oath you take as a juror includes some form of &quot;I solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that I will give a true verdict according to the evidence&quot;</p>
<p>This means that you will find a verdict from the evidence <em>and only the evidence</em>, and not whether you think a law or the circumstances are fair or just.</p>
<p>If you are honest at the beginning about deciding for yourself, and not based on the evidence, then you will not be chosen as a juror.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't the main problem being that there's no way to convict someone of perjury in that context. They don't have to disclose why they voted a certain way and since burden of proof is on prosecutor there's no evidence unless said juror is REALLY stupid and admits to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jury nullification is a logical consequence of a legal system in which juries are triers of fact that also contains prohibitions on double jeopardy.</p>
<p>If a jury believes that a defendant is guilty, but also believes that punishing them would be an injustice, they can return a not-guilty verdict despite having determined the defendant's guilt.  The jurors can not be punished for doing so, and the defendant can not be tried again.</p>
<p>If a judge asks you &quot;Is there any reason you couldn't render a verdict according to the law?&quot; and you are aware of jury nullification, it is unclear whether you can be truthful when saying &quot;no.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but you can say yes and then explain that answer with jury nullification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recognize, as appellants urge, the undisputed power of the jury to acquit, even if its verdict is contrary to the law as given by the judge, and contrary to the evidence. This is a power that must exist as long as we adhere to the general verdict in criminal cases, for the courts cannot search the minds of the jurors to find the basis upon which they judge. If the jury feels that the law under which the defendant is accused, is unjust, or that exigent circumstances justified the actions of the accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the power to acquit, and the courts must abide by that decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've never had jury duty, but when they ask for the verdict do they ask you to explain the verdict at all? I think, based on the wording specifically calling out 'according to the law' that it would be untruthful to say 'no', but that if you explained that you chose to acquit <em>because</em> of the jury's opinion of the law (jury nullification), then it's still a valid verdict.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can never be required to explain your verdict.</p>
<p>If you do make statements, they can be used in court.</p>
<p>Regarding nullification, it is not a concept in the law.  It is a consequence of the law, but not a part of the law.  Which is part of why the question is ambiguous.</p>
<p>It is relevant because if you admit to knowing about nullification, you'll be sent off the panel.</p></div>		</li>
