<p>There's also the phenomenon that when prices fall, gasoline prices at the retail level don't fall as quickly or as hard - there's a saying that prices tend to shoot up like a rocket and fall like a feather. From the perspective of a retailer, you don't want to charge so little that you lose money, so you raise prices quickly when your costs increase. But when costs fall, consumers are going to be happy with any price decrease, so you don't lower prices by as much, and your margins increase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To add on to this and give a real world example my parents own a gas station when gas prices go up really fast and are high we might make 10 cents on each gallon of gas sold which barely covers our overhead/payroll leaving barely anything for us. We sell at 10c profit per gallon because usually when prices for gas are high everyone is much better at looking around to find the cheapest price and our competitors are usually at the same price forcing us to sell at their price. When gas prices fall though everyone usually lowers their price slightly to make up for the lost profit from having sold at 10c for so long ie say we were getting gas at 4 dollars a gallon we would sell it for 4.10 but if now our next delivery comes in at 3.50 a gallon we would sell it at 3.90 giving the consumer a 20c price reduction and we would make about 40c instead of 10c. Over the next few weeks competitors usually lower price to try to get a leg up on each other and the price usually settles at around 20c of profit per gallon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly - gasoline is an example of a loss leader: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader</a></p>
<p>I don't want to speculate too heavily into your parents' gas station, but I would imagine that most of the profit on the store was inside on the convenience store items, and very little of it was actually on the gas itself.  Gasoline, in this case, is primarily designed as a good to bring people into the convenience store, where the bulk of the profitability (i.e. high margin products) are located.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is it a loss leader?</p>
<p>They don't sell gas at a loss in order to get you into the store.  They sell gas, and gas happens to have a thin margin.  They sell other things with higher margins because they've found that gas customers tend to shop in the store, and non-gas customers will come to the store too.  Every time a discussion about retail goods comes up on Reddit someone throws out the loss leader wiki article and claims it is an example of it.</p>

<p>Just because a business sells mostly high margin items and one low margin item, it doesn't make the low margin item a loss leader.  Alcohol and tobacco are low margin items as well; are they loss leaders too?  It doesn't even make sense to claim that gas is &quot;designed as a good to bring people in&quot;.  Gas is an essential, basic high-volume product that people need.  It wasn't and isn't sold simply to sell Snickers bars.</p>
<p>For example, average profits in 2014 for gas at Speedway was about 18 cents / gallon.  This is public information.  I'm not sure how many gallons they sold, but assume a shitload.  They didn't lose money.</p>
<p>The only good example of gas as a loss leader is with certain grocery store chains who also sell gas; they will offer fuel discounts as a reward for shopping with them.  That's a pretty reasonable example of a store using gasoline as a loss leader to drive loyal grocery shopping, especially since they likely lose money on the gas sale itself once the discount is applied.</p>
<p>Gas stations sell gas because gas is a core part of their business, just like convenience stores are a core part of the business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have always heard this, but I still a lot of gas stations that barely even have a convenience store. It's just a little booth type gas station and you can't even go inside.</p>
<p>If all the money is in the snacks, why would they build the gas stations like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a little off both the margins on gasoline so you are correct in that there isn't much money being made there.  The biggest problem of the profit I believe comes from diesel from 18 wheeler trucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good-sized gas station can sell 250,000 gallons of gas per month according to market place.org. I'm not saying that you sell that much, but for the sake of argument lets say you do. You say you make .10 - .20 cents per gallon profit. That's $25k - $50k per month in Profit on just gas prior to expenses.<br />
Do your parents sell anywhere near this much gas per month?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the top comment.  I'll also add that the supply chain for gas doesn't have a lot of room for storage of surplus so one retailer having prices much lower, or lower than a competitor for too long can be detrimental to business if you can't supply the additional amount of gas that will be demanded from you.  You'll just end up selling your supply out at a lower price.  This causes competitors to be more willing follow suit quickly when another competitor raises prices than when they lower prices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point.  Another thing worth mentioning is that crude oil is currently in a glut - the storage capacity of oil between the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the government and the massive storage facilities in Cushing, OK are pretty much at capacity, and federal law in the US prohibits the exportation of crude oil (though you can legally export refined products).  This has the effect of pushing down crude oil without a corresponding decrease in the prices of refined products; the primary limiting factor on getting supplies of gasoline to market is on the refining side, not so much on the drilling side.  This is great if you're a refiner, since margins are high - you buy crude at the market price and sell it at a premium because the market will bear high prices for gasoline.  It's not so great if you're a consumer wondering why the hell gas prices are still $2.40+ if oil prices have fallen by 2/3'rds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some areas changed tax law to keep the price of gas from fluctuating so much.  Essentially it was too hard to calculate the tax daily or more often, and make it budget based on that.  Generally now the taxes are higher.  </p>
<p>You should add inflation to your reasoning.  Generally, workers at the factory make more, routine maintenance costs more, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most taxes that I'm familiar with are a flat rate per gallon, not a percentage-based tax.  For instance, the federal gas tax in the U.S. is 18.4 cents per gallon, and this doesn't depend on the actual price of gasoline.  For reference, see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_taxes_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_taxes_in_the_United_States</a></p>
<p>Inflation isn't actually that big of a deal, and it's not fully accurate to talk about inflation when referring to the price of a single good.  Inflation is about a basket of goods &amp; services, and how prices increase on average among all goods in an economy.  2% inflation doesn't actually mean that all goods uniformly increase in price by 2% per year.  And over the last two years, core CPI has increased by very little and wages in the economy as a whole have been pretty flat - about 1 - 1.5% per year.  It's not likely to be a substantial change - at most, probably about 3-4 cents of the increase in gasoline prices per gallon is attributable to inflation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I'm most familiar with Indiana, where it is both flat rate and percentage (~16 cents + 7% calculated by month)</p>
<p>Inflation since 2008 (when gas prices were higher and most commenters were leaning 2008 though I reread yours now and see 2 years ago) is 11.8%.  A decent chunk of change, every dollar then is worth 1.11 now.  </p></div>		</li>
