			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, static scenes are getting very close. I think the problem is people. CGI characters used in movies still sit in the uncanny valley, and they aren't even limited by real-time rendering power. Who knows, maybe our brains will always be able to spot a fake human and a convincing replication of reality will never be possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key issue with the &quot;Paris Apartment&quot; demo is that it's <em>static</em>.  Nothing in the scene moves or can move.  That said, people have created some amazing games around situations like that.  </p>
<p>The reason that a <em>static</em> demo is limited for what we think of as &quot;most games&quot; is that what you see there can't handle anything in the space changing or moving.  Imagine standing in the dark hallway and a door to the sunlit room closes.  Not only will the hallway get darker, but to be realistic, light must bounce off the face of the door casting soft light into the hallway and how that light bounces will move along with the door. </p>
<p>Also, you as the viewer aren't present in the room.  Not only do you not generate any reflections (which is not to hard), crucially, you don't bounce any light into the scene.  Imagine your character has a red outfit on.  When you stand in a beam of sunlight, red light is going to bounce off that outfit and &quot;fill&quot; into darker areas/surfaces.  That's a big thing to compute.  You run into the same issues when you have moving light sources in the scene also.  Blasting a spotlight beam into the scene isn't too bad, but all the light that bounces from there is.</p>
<p>That's the indirect illumination that we put a ton of compute power into.</p>
<p>That said, the point to a game is for it to <em>feel</em> realistic, not that it has to be scientifically accurate.  (I'm an architect, and I'm setting up a lighting simulation that will be used to select light fixtures - if I get it wrong, people will be trying to work in the dark, but I can devote days of processor time to running the lighting simulation for still frames if I need.  I'm not trying to hit continuous 60fps.)  As a result, developers will be able to cheat in a lot of ways to speed things up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're completely right. Oddly enough, URE4 and CryEngine both have fantastic real-time global illumination --
shading, occlusion and color bleeding, they just aren't being utilized in the static demos...</p></div>		</li>
