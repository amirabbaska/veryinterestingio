			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who played in an orchestra with a world-class conductor, I can confirm that your explanation is spot on. </p>
<p>It takes some time for the conductor and all the members of the orchestra to get to know each other. Eventually you just start understanding his hand movements. It's like he's constantly talking, non-stop, to everyone in the orchestra. He can point out any single player and tell them to speed up, change volume, tone, prepare for an improvised on-the-spot solo and say any other thing that is relevant to the play. </p>
<p>It's especially useful during celebrations and other not-so-official events, when he can go off-schedule and do a few tricks, such as tell all the trumpet players to stand up and play the intro twice as loud as usual or something like that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is he facing the trombones, pushing one hand down while conducting with his other hand? He's asking them to play softer... they're overpowering the rest of the band more than expected</p>

<p>And you're never too loud.</p>
