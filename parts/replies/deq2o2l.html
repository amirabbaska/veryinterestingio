			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting, I never even heard of a wound vac. How long does it take for an average one to heal? Does it depend on how the pus is released? Also, do you know (and want to share) why you're so prone to these abscess? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once antibiotics are started usually it's mostly gone in 5 days to a week. Antibiotics usually continue for a week beyond.
Releasing the puss does help a bunch. Not just with the infection but the pain. </p>
<p>I got my first one while working at Walgreens. I was lucky to be sneezed on by a patient. All over me face arms and hands. I felt o got myself pretty cleaned up. But I had a small cut on my hand from something and by the next couple of days my hand looked like I was wearing a mitten. The blood tests showed this as staph and concluded later it was MRSA. Staph is a very common bacteria on human skin and particularly in the nose. A sneeze could have easily carried it to me. I quickly noticed I was getting small ones after that usually marble to golfball. </p>
<p>After treatment for these my Doctor believes I have a systemic infection and it has compromised my immune system. I noticed them after days of increased activity or days of extremely laziness
.
My first severe one that requires a hospital stay happened over a weekend before finals. It formed in my groin. My dorm did. Or have AC and it was a hot May. I spent the majority of the weekend sitting on a chair or my bed sweating with a laptop sometimes on my lap. By Monday it was pretty bad and I started the common antibiotics (Bactrim DS). By Tuesday night after suffering through a final I was admitted to a hospital. This is the one I call cucumber size. It ran from my waistband along between my leg and scrotum. It had no head so I was placed on IV antibiotics and did a bacterialcidal wash twice daily. The best feeling was when I sat down in the middle of the night after going to the bathroom and it popped. A head had formed and my underwear was filled with puss. </p>
<p>I have pictures of my foot infection I'll post to imgur shortly and link here. </p>
<p>Edit: the following link might be graphic. This is of my last MRSA infection. The infection happened on my honeymoon. We were on a cruise and then in New Orleans in august. Lots of friction and sweat in my shoes. I had an irritated hair on my pinky toe and the new wife plucked it. Infection set In. There infection transversed to the top of my foot. </p>
<p>At one point the red infection was up most of my calf before the antibiotics started working. There was a chance to lose 2 toes during surgery. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/4jLrF" target="_blank">MRSA infection </a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently had a couple bouts with MRSA, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus in my foot that required two extended hospital stays, a few debridements, IV (Vancomycin, Zosyn) and take home antibiotics (Linezolid, Cipro). </p>
<p>Worst pain I've ever experienced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree on the pain. I've had surgeries in the past, but non were equal to this. I walked around and did 2 flights with a giant swollen foot. I pretty sure I did zosyn in the hospital. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I walked into the hospital both times with my foot barely able to get into my biggest boots. I've dealt with a lot of pain and nothing touched that. Oxy and Dilaudid couldn't even take the edge off. </p></div>		</li>
