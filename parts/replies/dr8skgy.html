			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, different voltages have different distances. I work on systems ranging from 11kv to 400kv and clearance distances change rapidly, then they're extended to account for long objects like cranes and ladders.</p>
<p>*Now I'm sitting down and have the time I'll explain arcing like you're 5 as best as I can.<br />
When you imagine arcing think of a rubber band that's stretched out and you ping it, it'll go roughly the same distance every time so what you do is stand just outside its maximum distance and you won't get hit.<br />
Now, a bigger rubber band (higher voltage) will go further so you have to stand further back from it so that you don't get hit by it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The large brightly colored balls are to prevent low flying planes and other things from flying into them. Although many power lines also have little insulated bars connecting wires to prevent them from getting blown into one another in strong winds.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The marker balls are placed on power lines to make the conductor crossings visible to aircraft. Helicopters and small aircraft often fly low in mountain passes or freeways and usually fly low while approaching an airport.</p>
<p>When you are flying, the conductors and skyline become almost invisible against the terrain—especially the skyline wires.</p>
<p>Many of the marker balls are required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), like the ones near airports.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You answered your own question. Direct burial cable regularly gets fucked up and then rain gets in and can cause issues.</p>
<p>Rocks can work their way into the insulation, heat and cold cycles, wet and dry seasons all deteriorate direct burial cable. Heck even PVC conduit can get damaged from rodents or traffic driving over (usually if it wasn't buried deep enough or heavier traffic than is rated comes through) or leak at joints and fill with water. Sometimes wire insulation will wear and they will weld to each other or their conduit  causing a short and you have to completely re-run the circuit.</p>
<p>Source: work for an electrical contractor. Dealt with all of these issues last year during the rainy season after years of drought in CA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The space between the conductors are usually not related to arcing concerns but rather to minimize reactance in the lines. The arcing concern comes in place when you build the isolators separating the lines from the poles. Generally the distance between the lines are much higher than the isolator length.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess the capacitance between parallel conductors becomes significant after a few hundred kilometres.</p>
<p>Although, I just followed the formula I found on el wiki page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance" target="_blank">capacitance</a>, and for two parallel conductors, 10mm diameter, 1m separation, 1000km long, I get 5 microFarads.  That's lower than expected.</p></div>		</li>
