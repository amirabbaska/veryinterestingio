			<div class="markdown"><p>Where is the evidence that this was a common strategy? </p>
<p>Persistence hunting was and is used, but the presences of spears and other weapons going back at least two million years shows that they were also using ambush or other techniques. Why spend many hours or even days chasing something down when you could throw a spear at it and be done with it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Persistence hunting was used long after spears appeared. A spear is far from a deadly strike, and many animals with hooves or horns or just outweighing a human could easily fatally injure a human without any medical intervention, so wearing it down before attacking was the safest option. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This implies that they hunted large game. Humans did far more trapping of small game than hunting of large game. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read about small snares and falling  rocks with bait under them. They could knock a bird out of a tree by just throwing a stone at it.</p>
<p>They also scavenged leftovers from large game kills. </p>
<p>Hunting took place and was strenuous. My point was simply that it's a misconception that the main source of meat was big game hunting.</p></div>		</li>
