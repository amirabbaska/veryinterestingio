			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that &quot;completely different foods&quot; are all the same thing at the atomic level -- carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen. Aside from traces of other stuff, it's no surprise they burn into the same product.</p>
<p>edit: Please not that I'm <em>greatly</em> oversimplifying this. Counting the atoms in a substance tells you nothing about its molecular structure. It does sorta tell you what you get if you tear the molecules apart though, e.g. the thermal decomposition /u/shnaffle is talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of but no. </p>
<p>Flavour first:</p>
<p>Organic molecules (those that contain carbon) can be of arbitrary complexity. It is true that you could decompose most organic chemicals in your food to a simple percentage of carbon or oxygen or hydrogen or nitrogen. But that simple ratio will tell you nothing about the flavour. </p>
<p>Flavour and smell are a result of the shapes of the varied organic molecules in your food. Different shaped molecules bind different smell and taste receptors with different binding strengths and that binding profile gives rise to different sensory response (different taste). </p>
<p>Texture is no less complex, and very hard to summarise in a brief post. Proteins when heated tend to become firm such as egg whites or cooked meat. Cooking vegetables breaks down cell walls releasing water and making them wilt and become soft. The texture of many fruits and vegetables is governed by the amount of cellulose where lots of long chain cellulose present will give a fibrous texture. </p>
<p>Note that again texture is less about the amounts of specific atoms and more about the physio-chemical properties of specific classes of organic/biological molecules</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, the atoms are just the building blocks. What's most important is how these atoms are arranged together. For example, there are molecules that have the exact same number and type of atoms, but in different arrangements--the two molecules taste different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, mostly the same handful of element compose all macromolecules (fats, carbohydrates, proteins) which here are countless variants of and which are arranged in different ways to make up all living organisms and hence all food. There are also many other smaller molecules which contribute to flavour. But it's far from different ratios of mixtures (i.e. one part nitrogen, two parts carbon or something), and much more to do with the structures of the molecules they join together to make, which in turn join together to make even more complex, bigger molecules. Kind how the same construction materials can be used to make so many different buildings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the point that needs stressing is that the more you heat things, the more completely you are able to break the complete jigsaw puzzles it into their component pieces.</p>
<p>Since almost everything we eat is organic in origin, eventually it all breaks down into the same small pieces.</p>
<p>If you only break things a little bit, you might cut a bus in two, and remove the hood on a car; still obvious difference between the two. If you keep cutting both the bus and the car into smaller pieces, eventually they will both be piles of metal and plastic; they will both look the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theories exist however that the human digestive system is very resistant to carcinogenic compounds related to cooking and burning. Since it is a defining factor that led to us becoming human. So studies which test carcinogenity in rats and mice may not be fully applicable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pyrolysis of fats can produce Acrolein, which has been <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/103/42/15404.full.pdf" target="_blank">linked</a> to cancer, however it takes a much higher temperature for pyrolysis of fats. Generally it's fine for most foods since you can smell the toxic stuff, although there's no nutritional value to charcoal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only pyrolysis can cause the release of Acrolein. Acrolein is also a product in maillard reaction or decomposition of glycerol from fatty acids while frying. But I think that these threats are small compared to the amount you would have to consume so negative effects become relevant.</p></div>		</li>
