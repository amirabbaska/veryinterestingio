			<div class="markdown"><p>In the rare situations where up and down are not absolutes, it is dangerously common to mix them up as well.  </p>
<p>Most people who swim have experienced this underwater occasionally, where it’s entirely possible that only slowing down to watch  bubbles will show you the way back up.  </p>
<p>Pilots train and equip themselves to have their sense of direction start making things up in fog.  They can be dead certain that down is sideways.  (Luckily, it’s hard to get them completely backwards in a civilian pilot’s seat belt.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, your example of underwater swimmers isn't really an example of up-down confusion, is it? Relative to their point of view, they are not confused as to which direction is &quot;up&quot; (are they?). I feel like knowing where the &quot;surface&quot; is is quite a different kind of confusion than OP is talking about: it's like conflating left and right with west and east, to put it in perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be real for scuba divers. Go deep enough and it can be confusing. When first getting your cert, they make sure you understand to watch the bubbles if you get disoriented. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an old game called Descent. You go into a maze like mine with a flying ship. You can maneuver your ship any way you want (6 DOF). After a while, even up/down lose any meaning because there is no ground or sky (the tunnels in the mine can go any direction). Your brain is always trying to find the &quot;ground&quot; or which direction is down though and can get very uncomfortable at times. It's only when you just accept the fact that there isn't any and you just move around like you please that it starts getting easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and people do actually confuse up and down when they are buried under an avalanche. That's why, if you get buried, you are told to drool so you can tell which way gravity is going and dig yourself out in the right direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Up and down can also get confusing while diving with low light or visibility.  If you are floating and everything is blue/grey/black whatever it can be hard to tell.  Watch where the bubbles go to figure out up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. Up and down are only easy because we have constant visual and sensory cues to tell us which is which.</p></div>		</li>
