			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, it was an educational science experience for my son. He and I found a HUGE black widow outside and wondered why it was so big. So we went online and learned that she was pregnant. Instead of capturing her and releasing her up in the hills, we thought it might be interesting to place her and her egg sac in an empty aquarium to study her behavior.</p>
<p>Once her babies were born, they wasted no time engaging in cannibalism and incest. So I ended up with a bunch of them. I took care of them for about two years. They're actually not quite as scary as they seem. In fact, they're mostly docile when not protecting their egg sac. All in all, it was a good experiment as my son learned to appreciate nature as well as the importance of researching and understand things one might be afraid of.</p></div>		</li>
