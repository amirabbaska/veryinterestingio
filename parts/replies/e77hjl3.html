			<div class="markdown"><p>Your point about being impressed/ understanding/ enjoying the sport the first time you see it is what this question is all about. </p>
<p>I moved to Australia and found out about a popular Australian sport called AFL and I was able to have fun watching it the very first time before I knew any of the rules because of all the jumping and kicking and defying physics. </p>
<p>This is pretty much the opposite of seeing a game like Dota for the first time. You need to know a lot about e-sports before you understand what is happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an Australian, glad you're enjoying AFL! But yeah when I first watched NFL highlights I had no idea about anything but when someone runs the whole field for a touchdown it's immediately impressive. Whereas I saw a DOTA game once by accident, and there was a moment where everyone went wild but I had no idea why. Since games can go outside the realms of reality, they can be more difficult to understand and appreciate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But even in rocket league, it's hard to appreciate some of the things you see until you play the game and find out just how difficult it is. You immediately understand that it's really hard to kick a ball accurately 50 yards if you've ever kicked a ball at all. The aerial plays in rocket league, however, look natural and easy until you get into the game and try it out for yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha really?  As starcraft is one of the games I've spent the most time on in my life, I'll give you the simplest summary I can think of.  You can kind of imagine it like a warped version of chess.  Each side needs to focus (in real time) on accumulating resources, protecting their base, and attacking their enemies.  The basic idea is, get a decent economy running, build structures which produce units or offer some other benefit to you, then try to kill the enemy using units you produce.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason it is somewhat like chess is because there are standard opening moves and other mid-game/late-game strategies that all have specific counters and specific weaknesses.  And the placement of your units, and the choice of which units you are attacking with vs which units the enemy has completely shift the advantage of an encounter.  And on top of all of this is a dexterity, skill, game knowledge, and reflexes which all play a factor in how you do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense.  In summary....  The overall point of the game:  Build a base and units and kill your enemy before they kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You kinda touched on the main point I had in mind without using the keyword - CULTURE.</p>
<p>Sport is fucking A N C I E N T, literally. It has had ages to be ingrained in many cultures around the word. How long has the internet existed for in comparison?</p>
<p>A pet peeve of mine, even as an avid esports fan, is this retarded obsession with trying to accelerate something that obviously takes time to establish itself. You can't force people to like things. Think of it as you can't force grandma to learn to use the computer, and by extension, the internet.</p>

<p>Every time a new game like the two I mentioned are brought into the Esports world I'm always disinterested as I'd rather be playing the game and learning more about it.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Esports are also inaccessible to some people - a spectator who isnt familiar with the game being played may not know what the objective is, or how the teams work, or even the most basic of rules.  And it can be hard to learn that by just casually watching, impossible in some cases.  </p>
<p>Compare hockey with starcraft for instance.  If I had no idea how hockey was played when I first started watching, I can quickly figure out the overall goal - get the puck into the other teams net, the team that does this the most in 1 hour of play wins, they take a break every 20 minutes.  I can figure out what everyone's job is, and what is and is not allowed in normal play.  Sure I might not know what the hell an icing is, but I got enough of an idea on what's going on to enjoy myself. I can get excited when one team is close to scoring, because I know the team is close to scoring</p>
<p>Now with starcraft.  If I had no idea how the game was played I could grasp the overall objective quickly enough - destroy the other army, but I may not know exactly how that's achieved.  Is it the most damage in x number of minutes, if it is, then how is that measured? do they have to destroy all the buildings? Do they need to kill the little robot guys getting crystals?  This is hurt by one of the two teams usually forfeiting before the actual game is completed - as a viewer unfamiliar with the game i might not always recognize that the forfeiting player is in an unwinnable position, and simply quit to save everyone 40 minutes of a slow boring attrition. </p>
<p>And that's just problems with the fundamental goal, a new casual observer would have a hard time figuring out what all the units are, what they do, in what situation should they be used, why they're only sticking with a small fraction of the available units and so on. To a new viewer to  competitive starcraft, it's a jumbled mess of flashy graphics and confusing terms. So when a real big game changing push happens, I dont get excited, because I had no idea what was happening or how important it was.  Sure I might have a decent enough time, but I might not dive deeper into the esport to really get involved.</p>
<p>And to nip off any &quot;but those are casuals, no one cares about casuals&quot;, please remember that today's casual viewers are tomorrow's hardcore fans. If you dont give them a reason to care, and you make it hard for them to understand why its exciting don't be surprised when they stop viewing the content.  You dont need to dumb down the game, you just need to present the information to the viewer in a way that helps guide the viewer to understanding what's going on without needing to watch a tutorial on  the game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>eSports will never become that popular compared to other sports of the olympics on the simple basis that physical achievement is still a measure of hand-eye AND eye-total-body coordination and video games simply is a stripped down version of that in some aspects, while incorporating other &quot;abilities&quot; (like in dota) made possible ironically but precisely because of its stripped down nature.</p>
<p>(ie: its not physical because unlike sports, you're not expected to move yourself as the video game does it for you. But being that its a video game, now one button can make you into a Swedish penguin that uses a gatling gun during a 20 second ability boost, etc)</p>
<p>The former sees the total accomplishment of that traditional physical form of sports, whereas the latter enjoys the added perks from precisely those additional benefits achieved from its lack of physical form (ie2: virtualization)</p>
<p>I can't admit to be a real life sports fan at all, but not gonna lie, I have zero desire to watch other people play video games.  I totally do not rag nor want eSports to stop growing. But I find it equally, if not more boring than going to a sports game, which I already find tremendously boring.  I speak only as someone who's been to video game conventions but I never met people that go out of their way to play games a lot, that I find particularly interesting. </p>
<p>Maybe Im just a fucking loser for saying that. I won't disagree with any of you guys for coming to that conclusion</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only certain esports do the helicoptering. If you're smart as a developer, you will want to make sure the game grows right and doesn't make known mistakes in its growth. DotA and CS are both mostly open esports scenes without much developer meddling at all. It's games like Overwatch, where the devs think they can just throw money at a game that simply isn't competitively viable, and it'll get big with their iron fist guiding the meta rather than organic meta development.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched Brett Bayonne figure out at the very last second that he could baseball bat his competitor using a special assist combo  and fly into it with a leaping pile driver with his main in the fighting game  <em>Nitroplus Blasterz: Heroine Infinite Duel.</em> It was literally the most impressive play I've ever seen in a competitive video game and had me laughing and on my feet. But I fee l the same way multiple times during a football or basketball game because the physicality and coordination is instinctually more relatable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain feats in certain games are just as impressive, but only if you know what you're looking at. If the world's best offensive player lands a perfect combo, a combo nobody else can pull off with any consistency, against an opposing team that's of comparable skill, people who have practiced both landing and dodging that combo literally hundreds, maybe thousands of times...</p>
<p>I'm on mobile, and I'm really struggling to find the right clips, but I did find <a href="https://youtu.be/_llAUV3KwSE" target="_blank">this</a>. The player's name is InSec, and the combo requires punishing the <em>other</em> team's positioning. It's about a .3-.5 second combo, and it results in kicking an opposing player straight back to his team. Anyone can do it, but he does it perfectly well over 95% of the time.</p>
<p>At one point, this prompted the North American color commentator, awestruck, to muse, &quot;The geometry that goes through this guy's head, I can't <em>believe</em> it...&quot;</p>
<p>If you know what you're looking at, it's the rough equivalent of a tiny dude who keeps shooting for 3, every single possession, and he never misses. Literally millions of imitators, no peers for years.</p></div>		</li>
