			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to add that even for Earth in the current day, there are something like 30-40+ calendars in use by various people around the world, and we get along with time just fine, for the most part.  Some notable points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The October Revolution - Occurred in early November according to our standard, modern Gregorian calendar but was named as such because the Russians were using the Julian calendar at the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>China has only one time zone.  That is equivalent to all of the continental US (EST, CST, MST, PST) being a single time zone.  Have fun with your 9am-5pm work schedule!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Countries can change their time zones/Daylight savings at any time.  Egypt infamously shifted +1 hr in order to gain a more favorable trade day and then shifted it back again a few weeks later.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daylight Savings was suggested during the Industrial Revolution as a means of affording workers an &quot;extra hour&quot; of daylight to enjoy outside of their soul-crushing factory jobs.  However, this meant that it would be darker an hour earlier during the winter.  People started using more and more electricity in their homes to provide light during the winter.  A nice unintended consequence or was it the intent of the lobbying all along?  You can decide :D</p>
</li>
<li>Arizona and Hawaii do not observe Daylight Savings, along with many US territories. </li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the application of units of time is not very cohesive and is affected by a variety of cultural, political, and economic factors.  It would be impossible to predict exactly how time will be kept on an alien planet until people actually live upon it and come up with colloquial time keeping methods.  The units of time that are defined are already accepted as formal values, and can always be referred upon at any time as necessity dictates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being a programmer in AZ affords you many opportunities to deal with the idiosyncrasies of daylight savings time. Basically, you never are really sure what time it is anywhere else. Side point: UTC and GMT are both 0 offset, but UTC does not reflect DST whereas GMT does. In short, DST provides a near endless supply of bugs &amp; job security for developers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really activates my almonds when people say, e.g., CST during daylight savings time when they mean CDT. Like, boy, we didn't have it hard enough already?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have heard about this!  I found out about this issue when I was researching why my Total War: Third Age game was crashing so often.  As it turns out, disabling auto DST settings helps with a lot of games.</p>
<p>It seems like a nightmare, even from the perspective of a guy who knows nothing about programming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really: Britain during summer is on BST (British Summer Time) which is both GMT+1 and UTC+1.</p>
<p>There are more nuanced differences between GMT and UTC, but 'functionally', for everyday stuff, they are the same.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But the Navajo Nation within Arizona does observe DST.</p>
<p>But the Hopi Reservation within the Navajo Nation doesn't, just like the rest of Arizona. </p>
<p>I'm not sure why this is the case, but I assume it was made this way just to mess with programmers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, Native American reservations are not counted as part of actual US states.  They fall more or less into autonomous regions.  They largely have not used DST since they were not greatly impacted by the policies of the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts, not sure exactly why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although the anti-prime nature of a base-12 time system does make it versatile, with regard to calendrical systems on Earth in particular, the base-12 system is also probably related to the observations by the Babylonians of several near coincidences; namely that there are <em>almost</em> 360 days in a year, <em>almost</em> 12 lunar cycles in a year, and <em>almost</em> 12 years in one sidereal orbit of Jupiter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A third option would be to implement a Galactic Standard Time or something like that.   It could be used to coordinate events between different planets and systems.   While on planet you'd just use planetary time, while in space you could go with Galactic time.   </p>
<p>Planetary time could be based off of the orbit and rotation of the planet.  As for the basis for Galactic time, we would need to find something that is steady in all cases.  I'm not sure what that could be.  The speed of light crossing a distance works great for everything but setting the clock as there is no reference for the start event.  I guess you could just arbitrarily pick a start point, dedicate something as a reference and have everyone look to that to sync.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.  A truly universal unit of time could be based on an ultra stable and fine (high resolving power) property of our universe, such as that of a cesium atomic clock since in one second it undergoes something like 9 billion cycles of radiative transition.</p>
<p>I think the complexity comes into play when we try to keep a common time for reference.  In this example, those atomic clocks have to be synchronized at the beginning or the signal from these clocks have to be somehow transferred, ideally with faster than light speed methods.  In the end, it may not even be necessary to keep a &quot;common time&quot; if we are not interfacing with each other over gigantic interstellar distances on a regular basis.  It will be like going back to the inconsistent travel of horseback riding only on a stellar level.  A &quot;common time&quot; system may develop naturally as our space travel technology develops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure problems would arise when you start travelling at interplanetary/galactic speeds, right?. You could sync up a clock with a planet's galactic clock, but as soon as you start traveling through space (at a rate that makes space travel feasible), time dilation would probably desync your clock fairly quickly.</p>
<p>For interplanetary travel, it'd probably be only fractions of a second, and as far as human travelers are concerned, that might just be a very minor inconvenience, but as far as computer systems go, that may be a bit more of an issue. Intergalactic travel may be different. I'm sure you could adjust a system's clock dynamically based on speed, but that'd be a pain itself.</p></div>		</li>
