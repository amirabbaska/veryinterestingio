<p>Ever smelled something. Like really, really smelled something? </p>

<p>My SO is lactose intolerant, and once she ate half a big container of yogurt believing it to be lactose-free. It wasn't. The farts started five minutes after we went to bed. So yes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What did you do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opened all the windows. Surrounded the bed with strategically-placed fans. Desperately wished for a gas mask.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You closed your eyes, leaned back, and probably let out a big sigh after.</p>

<p>Your kink is not my kink, but your kink is OK.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There probably is, but it has got nothing to do with the kissing ;-)</p>
<p>It is just a matter of habit. Some people want to see the one they kiss while they kiss them.</p></div>		</li>
