			<div class="markdown"><p>I have hypnotic jerk every night but it isn't like you describe because l do not fall towards the bed. Every night I jerk awake because I am falling from my feet. Sort of I just barely missed a step. I feel an edge (like a step perphaps) across the ball of my feet, and my feet slip off of it and I jerk awake &quot;falling&quot; in direction of my feet. It really feels like when are coming down stairs and you don't entirely miss the step but are still too far forward so you feel the edge of step but your foot is more off than on and you slip past it. It feels exactly like that except both feet at the same time and starting from stationary.</p>
<p>I think it must be some how related from entering REM too quickly because I have narcolepsy and almost instantly am in R.E.M. sleep once I lose consciousness. Sometimes maybe even a little beforehand. That stage of drifting between fully thinking thoughts and sleeping is very weird, both at night and in the mornings.</p>
<p>This morning I had been dreaming I Was in a Spanish class that I really didn't belong, after spilling a drink which drew attention to me, I was put on the spot todescribe something of my choice entirely  in Spanish (so very much normal dream stuff). I woke up at some point and laid there putting together words from rusty Spanish to describe this particular game. In the end I was fully awake and just daydreaming thes Spanish descriptions, thinking in Spanish nearly completely, until I had finished describing the game. Why that game chosen? Was I still dream when that became the item chosen to describe? Had I just woken up at that point? It seems that it would not a dream sort of decision to me, because it is a perfect game to use as a prop in a foreign language. Dreams are generally not moving towards the logical choice. But the early part of my descriptions included the teacher mocking me which is very dreamlike. Could have been drifting in and out of R.E.M. when I had just regained consciousness? A bit of REM sleep and a bit of R.E.M. awake? Why did I stay so long in bed daydreaming until the task was done? It never even occurred to me to stop and get up until I was done with the task even I think I was 100% awake for at least the last 20 min.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not very knowledgeable about narcolepsy, however, I do know that the rapid entering of REM sleep is due to sleep deprivation. When you are sleep deprived, you do not have as many of the REM cycles (90 min long), but you fulfill the 2 stage 3-4 NREM deep sleep cycles (also 90 min long). NREM sleep is to regenerate the body, while REM sleep is to regenerate the mind. When you cut off your sleep, you are missing out on the REM sleep, which comes after both the NREM cycles. What happens then is that the body compensates for this by speeding up past the NREM cycles straight into the REM cycles, and makes the REM cycles 50% longer. After extended sleep deprivation, the mind may not have fully recovered from whatever activities during the day, and you may remain sleepy as your mind craves that REM sleep.</p></div>		</li>
