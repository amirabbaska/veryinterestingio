			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of variables that contribute when you need to change your oil. How old is the engine? Newer engines will have metal shavings in the oil because the engine is essentially getting its groove going and you are quite literally “breaking it in”. A bunch of metal shavings will cause more wear on the engine and works like sand wearing down the engine. That is why it is very important to change your oil more regularly on a new car. Older cars are already broken in and less likely to have these metal shavings. Instead, grooves have already been worn into the engine and this can let small particles into the engine which is why you may need to change it. Generally, higher mileage cars need less oil changes than newer ones <strong>but they still need them.</strong></p>
<p>How you drive and where you drive will affect your engine. Driving short distances and not letting your engine heat up? You’re going to get more buildup in your engine since a certain amount of heat is good for your engine. If you live in a very dusty area, like Lubbock, Texas particles can get inside your engine and cause wear (a good reason to have a clean air filter). </p>
<p>Ultimately, the best way to know if you need to change your oil, is to just check your dipstick. Oil usually has color to it, but look if it is dark in color, or if you can see small particles. These would be indicators that you may need an oil change. If the oil is smooth and pretty clear, minus some color, your oil is pretty good. Please note, that oil does decay, so even though it may look clean, if you have not changed it in some time, it is generally good practice to just change your oil.</p>
<p><strong>Oil is freaking important people, you wouldn’t want to go down a dry water slide naked; nor would you want your girl to be dry when you go in her. Keep everything lubed people!</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are very correct! But just because an oil is dark doesn’t necessarily mean you need an oil change. Oil color will change very quickly in a vehicle even though it is still good oil.
I knew someone who added an extra oil filter on their car and regularly analyzed their oil. They were at 100,000 km and the oil samples still read as perfectly good oil! Although, I would recommend that everyone change their oil as per OEM recommendations!
Another important thing is to continue using the same type of oil for older vehicles. If you upgrade to a high quality synthetic it can break down the spot in the casing and actually chase more problems!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, piston rings aren't a perfect seal especially when dealling with cylinder pressures associated with a &quot;full throttle&quot; scenario. The partially combusted fuel and byproducts get pushed past the rings and disolve in the oil which contributes to the blackness of used oil.</p></div>		</li>
