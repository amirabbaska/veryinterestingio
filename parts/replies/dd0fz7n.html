<p>Though one super confusing thing to me is when you go on a long car journey, particularly as the driver, you get there and then want to sit down because you're tired. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because you're tired from the trip itself.  The driver is usually most tired because they were having to pay attention and react to things while also barely moving.  </p>
<p>You'll notice the first thing people usually do is walk around a bit.  Even in circles around or near the car.  &quot;Stretching their legs&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of it would be muscle atrophy wouldn't it? That's why people slouch. The chest muscles are tight and the back muscles are weak and stretched. I assume if you sit all the time and then go to walking or standing often, muscles need time to catch up?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Standing for long periods of time is also unhealthy. As is the extreme end like running a marathon. </p>
<p>Moderation is always key. Good form is more important. Slouching for 4 hours at a time everyday is horrible for your back, as is standing and with your back slouched/pelvis tilted incorrectly, etc.  </p>
<p>Exercise is incredibly important for our bodies to maintain ourselves. We don't require a lot of it too, which is a great and beautiful thing. Hitting the gym hard at least once a week for 30-60 mins has so many great benefits as is eating well and drinking water. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So millions of years of evolution didn't lead to our current needs and capabilities? </p></div>		</li>
