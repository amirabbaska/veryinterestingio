<p>I don’t think I’m capable of voluntary nystagmus, but I can do something in my eyes that feels like vibrating. Is there a way to tell if it’s actually voluntary nystagmus or if I’m doing something else?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You will feel your eyes shaking. The feeling is almost unmistakable. Blurring your vision is the first step.  The way I get to voluntary nystagmus is actually by trying to blur my vision as much as possible. If I were to set checkpoint of blurring vision it would be. </p>
<ol>
<li>Vision blurred, like trying to read after just waking up but you can still read the words. </li>
<li>You can't read the words but you can tell that they're there, and you can probably count how many in the sentence total. </li>
<li>You can't tell how many words there are in the sentence, you just see  really blurry pieces in a line. </li>
<li>Your eyes start shaking. (it feels like your eye is twitching, and your frame is shaking from left to right) If you hold your finger in front of you while dong it, it should look almost like a guitar string that's vibration up close, just not as fast. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I've been doing this eye shaking stuff since I was a child. And now I learn it is not very common.</p>
<p>Didn't know it was actually a thing, a biology teacher I had suffered the involuntary one and freaked out when I showed her that I could do it voluntarily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't even know I was doing this until one day I was hanging out with some friends bored. I was sitting on the couch doing this when one of my buds asked me how the hell I was shaking my eyes like that. Learned that day that I could shake my eyes and individually cross one at a time! It's kind of uncomfortable to do but a cool party trick!</p></div>		</li>
