There's a hiccup when transitioning from above/below, but otherwise it's pretty great. Boston has a much smaller system than, say, NYC, so it's a lot easier to cover, but it shows that it's possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is interesting. Apparently the costs have lowered enough to meet the demands. Thanks for elaborating!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Att and Verizon have done a lot of work over the past few years, and at this point I believe all the stations at least in manhattan have cell service. The problem with trains though is the same as with airplanes - they are effectively metal cages, so that attenuates the signal that is able to get through to the car (reduces the effective range). Between stations will be a lot more work to come.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's great except when anyone else is using the subway - during rush hour it's practically useless. (bandwidth must be extremely small)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd think part of the problem would be the tremendous strain of the handoffs between access points. Not sure how applicable this is but in a cell network or trunked radio you have a device called a comparator that is comparing signal strength of a subscriber from two neighbouring cells. When it determines that the signal is now stronger in cell B, cell A hands off the subscriber's call to B without interrupting the call. </p>
<p>Assuming there's an analogue in wifi repeaters and access points, but suddenly you have a few hundred/thousand devices suddenly moving between zones and you have to hand over many ongoing data connections all running at 50 mph. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there most certainly is an analogue in wifi access points, you set a minimum signal strength... but I wonder how that would far at 50mph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a very good notion and it will be a logistical nightmare. You could do it but it would be difficult since clusters of users would be moving and not only a few of them. So yes, well spotted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was in NYC a couple years ago and I was so baffled that I didn't have service on the subway. In Hamburg Germany where I'm from we've had that for over a decade now. There are zero drop outs or disconnects or anything. I can stream music or videos through my entire subway ride no problem. </p></div>		</li>
