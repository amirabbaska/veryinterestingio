<p>So the answer is really &quot;We have no reason to believe it <em>wouldn't</em> collapse into a singularity, so obviously we have to say that the most likely outcome is that it will, barring currently unknown forces&quot;</p>
<p>I mostly read &quot;popular science&quot; (Suskind, Hawking etc.) that seems to make this seem more certain than it is I suppose. </p>
<p>And re: Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff, follow up question.  I'm assuming this is true of both stellar and non-stellar objects?  So for instance, if you compress an apple to it's Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, it will eventually collapse into a black hole but have a window during which light can still escape? </p></div>		</li>

<p>So the TOV limit is a mass where an object which is supported by a certain type of pressure (neutron degeneracy) will collapse under its own self gravity.</p>
<p>You can have stuff heavier than this as long as it is hot enough (e.g. stars).</p>
<p>As you suggest, you could exceed this pressure limit without using gravity. If you could squeeze an apple hard enough you would first exceed it's electron degeneracy pressure (this is the pressure that is making your apple and indeed any other solid object solid) and it would collapse into a very small object that would be supported by the neutron degeneracy pressure, an apple mass of neutronium.</p>
<p>If you squeezed this object further still then you would eventually exceed this new pressure and would make a black hole.</p>
<p>The force required to do this would be incredible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Absolutely.  I'm just thinking the possibility of forming primordial black holes, or black holes in particle colliders etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After squeezing the object further, how likely is it that the object might stop at meeting quark degeneracy pressure? Would it be able to map out the collapse of a supermassive object destined to become a black hole by measuring the stages of collapse and determine if preons exist?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not 100% on-topic and I apologize if this is not allowed in this sub, but is there a simple way to explain this?  I'm a teacher (middle school) and I've tried to explain this phenomenon before to students (11 - 13 years old), and have yet to be successful.  I think the issue is I don't fully understand it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I really don't like that answer either.  Throughout the history of physics there was always some physical process which stopped singularities---if you did classical fluid mechanics, the singularities of shocks really weren't true singularities, it was just a different regime of statistical mechanics in truth. </p>
<p>I don't see why it would be otherwise now.   pentaquark states were just recently discovered.  What if we get a pentaquark &quot;star&quot;, a giant nucleus of pentaquarks or higher energy density quark-gluon configurations?  </p>
<p>I think the default answer should be something like, &quot;there is probably some even higher energy and density state that we don't know about now, but is conceivably possible in the Standard Model.  We don't know what it is or even might be because we haven't come close to unifying the SM with GR, i.e. SM phenomenology in strong gravitational metric distortions that we can't probe experimentally.&quot;   </p>
<p>Do gluons unify in some way with gravitons like electroweak?   Do we start having Higgs-gluon plasmas?  (I just made those up, not that they are remotely feasible)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few alternative ways of looking at this.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation can not escape a black hole because it only travels at the speed of light but black holes can still be charged. As in you could theoretically have a positively charged black hole if you dumped a lot of positive charge in, this black hole would repel other positive charges.</p>
<p>Similarly you couldn't emit gravitational radiation from the singularity and have it escape since, like light, this radiation travels at the speed of light.</p>
<p>However the gravitational field of the black hole is still a perfectly fine concept, we can still measure this field at any distance from the black hole.</p>
<p>What might help is imagining a universe with absolutely nothing in it but one mass, mass A. Does this mass have gravity? Before the concepts of fields came into physics the answer was no, gravity was a force that acted on one body from another.</p>
<p>If we introduce another body, mass B, into our universe then suddenly there is a force between the two, mass A must have told mass B that it exists and what its mass is in order to facilitate this. This communication was initially assumed to happen at an infinite speed.</p>
<p>Of course now we know this is false. When mass B appears it already knows of mass A because its local space is curved. In order for mass B to be attracted to mass A it only needs to know what the local curvature of spacetime is doing, it doesn't require communication of any sort with the position of mass A.</p>
<p>Of course things get a little more complicated than that and essentially you have to start using the horizon of a BH in sneaky ways but that is the gist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was pondering this question for a while and am still confused. It seems to me you have called it curvature instead of gravity, but the problem remains. </p>
<p>Does this curvature not propagate from within the black hole? For the spacial dimension to react and warp based on mass within a black hole, does this not necessitate transferring information across the event horizon?</p>
<p>Or is it that all the information necessary for the field to react is contained on the event horizon itself?</p>
<p>I'd really love some extra help wrapping my head around this! Thank you so much!</p>
<p>Edit: I saw somebody else reply with this: &quot;These deformations travel at the speed of light, but don't &quot;pull on themselves&quot;.&quot; Is that correct? I think I understand that statement, that gravity can't stop its own propagation, but I'm unsure if it's really describing what's happening here.</p>
<p>There was also this reply: &quot;For an outside observer, stuff takes forever to fall into the black hole. So (unless something weird is happening at the horizon) the gravity can be thought of as coming from stuff on the observer's side of the horizon in that reference frame, and there's no need for it to 'escape from the black hole.'&quot; Which I think is what I meant when I made my guess about the event horizon. Which one of these guesses are correct? Are neither? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Silly hypothetical: could you create a black hole with such a large positive charge that you could then create a stable shell around the event horizon, made up of positively charged material?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is the result of the warping of space, and so is the black hole. The black hole is warped space, and is stable as such.</p>
<p>The warping exists outside the black hole as well as inside.</p>
<p>Light generated inside has to follow the spatial curvature inside, and all paths light can follow inside have no &quot;up&quot; direction. Light generated outside can follow curved paths that do not intersect the event horizon.</p>
<p>Gravity doesn't get generated; it simply is. The collision of two black holes creates a complicated warping of space that relaxes to a (more) spherical shape fairly quickly. It's the non-spherical warping, and especially its motion, that creates gravity waves, which are fluctuations in the warping of space, and the effect of this warping is felt by external objects at later times. So nothing is &quot;escaping&quot; from the black holes; it's the change in their boundary and the space around it that propagates outward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem being, we don't know of any force that could withstand that pressure. Matter has already broken down with the degeneracy pressure of neutrons, so what's left to be &quot;very close&quot;? In the absence of any force to stop collapse they would shrink infinitely.</p>
<p>So in a way it's possible yes if there's some unknown force to stop collapse after matter breaks down, but we have no evidence of such a force (and even if it existed we may never be able to detect it).</p></div>		</li>
