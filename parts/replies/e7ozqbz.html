			<div class="markdown"><p>The article lists the method they used, but I can't really comprehend it without putting in more time than I am willing to. It probably was just one pulse of light and they used some very advanced techniques to get the frames.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, according to the text they're using something called a streak camera in conjunction with a static camera (basically a normal camera with a relatively slow shutter), and then doing a lot of processing with both of these sources of data to generate the video. A streak camera is basically a normal camera, except with a special mechanism in front of it. The camera only captures a single strip of light, and the mechanisms causes this strip to sweep across the camera's image, so that where it lands in the image changes with time, like how you end up with streaks in your eyes if you look at something bright and look away really quickly. So the streak camera captures some information about the image as it changes over time. Then it's a lot of math to convert all this into video</p>
<p>From a quick read of the paper, it is a little more complicated than this, and they're using a DMD, which is an array of a lot of tiny mirrors that they can digitally control, to modify the image on its way to both of the camera sensors</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Other approaches to femtosecond photography do use basically a souped up version of a traditional camera set up. They can't make shutters fast enough to work in femtoseconds, so instead they use a very fast flash to do it, and they just repeat the same scene thousands to millions of times (IIRC) with different flash timings to generate their video</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's the real question.  It seems like the answer is that people are sensationalizing it a lot, and it's more similar to how if you shoot a laser pointer through mist you can see the laser beam, because photons are being scattered and some hit your eye.  </p>
<p>People are saying they captured a photon on camera, that would only work if the single photon was shot at the camera.  Our eyes, and cameras need the photons to hit them, you can't see a photon moving perpendicular to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Anyone who claims to have captured the motion of a single photon is a liar for this reason. This isn't science, it's sensationalism. </p></div>		</li>
