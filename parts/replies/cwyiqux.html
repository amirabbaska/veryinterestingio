			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. Normally I'd say not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, but this isn't like a typo. This indicates that the person who has written this book does not understand relatively basic undergraduate physics, which would make me question the rest of the book. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm taking a class that uses this same textbook as it's primary source, but they explicitly corrected this in the lecture, right along side how we used to think that electricity flowed positive to negative, and not the other way around. Having finished through unit 14, there's only a few small mistakes otherwise, and I feel like that bit was written by an editor, and not an electrical engineer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you saying that it's a myth that we used to think electricity ran positive to negative? I've heard that for years as the basis for why electronic theory is difficult to read. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, and as a piece of advice if you're studying from this book; We still say electricity flows from positive to negative.</p>
<p>If you want to talk about electron flow, you have to clarify that you're talking about electron flow and not electricity.</p>
<p>The reason being, if I touch a + terminal of a stopped DC dynamo nothing happens, we're in balance.</p>
<p>If I touch the + terminal when the dynamo is producing 1000v, would you say that the earth supplied 1000v to the dynamo through me?</p>
<p>Well if the dynamo is being driven by a diesel engine, and P=IV then whatever current has passed through me is going to be multiplied by the voltage, and the diesel engine is going to have to drive that as load.</p>
<p>Now 'we' know what has actually happened here in terms of the physics. We've used the diesel to generate a potential, and nature is trying to fix that potential.</p>
<p>However, If you're at a baseline earthed voltage and your AC alternator is running with a 1000v - 0 - (-)1000v then you rectify the -ve side with a diode bridge. If you touch the wire, you're getting a 1000v shock still (or the rms, but anyway). The electrons are travelling the other direction though.</p>
<p>So 'Electricity' electrons are now flowing from the machine to you.</p>
<p>In those terms, what matters here is our reference point of zero, earth. The effect is <del>the same</del> comparable if the potential is +ve or -ve, so we could say that the machine supplies the electricity, it produces the potential, hence we put our switching as close as it can be to the machine and leave the rest of the circuit safely grounded until needed.</p>
<p>I'd never say electricity flow from -ve to +ve, only electrons do. So if you're answering a question be sure to clarify your terms and if the question is ambiguous then define electricity flow and electron flow at the start of your answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One more (but less important) way that this book is wrong:</p>
<p>I don't know why they chose a giant coil, but they created an inductor that will oppose the voltage pulse and help slow things further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the earth is a magnet. So if you pass current through the coil, it would push the earth out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Folks it appears that at some point in the construction of the maglev hyperloop equatorial train a slight error in calculations has caused the whole thing to be thrown into orbit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they didn't say how much current, and the coil would move a lot more than the Earth...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or it would just lob the core of the earth all at once.. like a huge coilgun. </p>
<p>It would be really cool to see.. yknow.. a 760 mile wide ball of iron hotter than the sun decompressing and splatting out antarctica. It would glow in the UV range, then fry everyone's retina. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the massive size of the earth, the low number of turns, and the relatively low currents that are likely, the inductive effects will be minimal, especially compared to the resistive effects. Though, both of these are irrelevant to a thought experiment (even an incorrect one).</p></div>		</li>
