			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, that probably explains me then. I'm mouthbreather as fuck, i broke my nose pretty badly when i was 3, so started mouth breathing then because it wasn't set entirely right, and then maybe the whole palate thing exacerbated the issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was &quot;helping&quot; my ma carry the groceries into the house because i was such a good child. She gave me 2 light bags and I took off to running towards the house, the ground was slippy because it had been raining. I inevitably slipped and fell towards the step, bags in hand so I couldn't catch myself. Face first into the corner of the step, broke my shit up.</p></div>		</li>
