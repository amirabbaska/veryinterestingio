			<div class="markdown"><p>The rear duals are also concave so that the studs can reach through two wheels. When the first wheel is placed onto the axle it looks a lot like a front wheel (convex) . Imagine how long the rear axle studs would have to be in order to secure them ( plus there wouldn't be enough strength in the studs to do that). <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/FtBdo?s=sms" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/gallery/FtBdo?s=sms</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer the question about Retreaded Tires in the US, they're only illegal if used on the steer axle in a people carrier application, a bus or transit type of vehicle.</p>
<p>While I would never recommend using retreads in the steer position on any vehicle that sees public roads, there is actually a good market for them in waste haul and refuse applications where long wear, durability, and puncture resistance are critical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea those spikes seem extremely stupid and dangerous... I could see the argument being &quot;well you shouldn't have been that close to my truck&quot;, but what if the situation arises where a truck hits a motorcyclists, and the wheel area is the point of contact? Rounded lugs would definitely do some damage, but spiky lugs could rip someone apart.</p>
<p>WHY IS THIS SHIT LEGAL?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen those in the US, and as a European the sharp lug covers surprised me very much. In the Netherlands it is illegal to have protrusions or sharp objects on a vehicle lower then 2m. Not surprising considering this is bicycle country. Since you are increasing the width of the vehicle by applying spikes, the chance of being hit gets higher.
And do people seriously think that when being hit with a sharp tough piece of plastic at 40mph, it won't cause any harm and it 'snaps right off'? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These aren't the lugs. They are decorative plastic covers and can be removed with a child slap. I won't say they're harmless but they are way less dangerous than everyone believe.</p>
<p>That said they are now illegal in Quebec. We now use long <a href="http://i.imgur.com/hA65m27.jpg" target="_blank">cylinder</a> instead because it's so much less dangerous /S</p></div>		</li>
