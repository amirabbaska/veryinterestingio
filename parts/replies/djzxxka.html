			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a believer in this theory as well.  I also think that modern society has compounded the issue.  Humans have introduced a lot of biodiversity over the years, and I figure that could complicate matters as <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Misc_pollen.jpg" target="_blank">pollen comes in all shapes and sizes.</a></p>
<p>That, and the fact we're a more mobile society, increases our chances of running into an allergen that cause a reaction.  Someone might grow up and not be allergic to the plants they were around as a kid, but then they move and now all of a sudden new plant sperm are raping their sinuses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what if you were always outside and never moved somewhere else? My pollen allergy started suddenly when I was ten years old, before that I never had any problems and always played outside and got dirty in the same general area, in a rural village. Our house also never was the &quot;super cleanly&quot; type. </p>
<p>I mean I 100% suppprt the hygiene hypothesis too because the people I know from big cities or with overly cleanly/protective parents generally deal with way more allergies than the rural folk, but still. I'm really interested in why my immune system suddenly decided out of nowhere that this one specific kind of pollen is an evil villain that must be eradicated. Allergies are weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might also be that some crop company introduced a new type of crop around that type which you were allergic to. Thanks to huge companies like Monsanto, there isn't that much diversity amongst the foods we grow, because they tend to come from very few companies, so they're all very much alike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ditto. I was outside in fields and forests, swimming in the creek, and rolling down a large grassy hill for fun- all that all through my childhood. We lived in the country and weren't well off, so the tv only picked up PBS when it rained anyway. </p>
<p>Yet I'm painfully allergic to grass and tree pollens- hygiene can't be alone here. </p></div>		</li>
