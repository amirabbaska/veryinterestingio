<p>For us, the main reason is so we can track changes in mental function.  If you were speaking clearly when we found you, but start slurring, that's a significant finding, and we might change treatment based on it.  </p>
<p>But if you take a nap, we can't notice the change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree. (Ex medic here). </p>
<p>I have always used this so I could observe status changes. </p>
<p>I agree with the doc in that in a hospital setting, there is not as much use for it, as they have many diagnostic tools available hat can be run quickly, and interventions made. A CT or MRI will pretty well show which direction the patient is likely to go (improve, stay the same, decline).</p>
<p>In the prehospital setting though, we don’t have that luxury, so we use what we can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is what I've been taught as well (er nurse here). Consciousness allows us to monitor any significant changes that happens to a person's cognition/mentation and can also indirectly/directly be used as information for a person's systems (ie breathing)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with “depends”. </p>
<p>Some scenarios, you want to stabilize or treat the person in the field.  But in other scenarios (loss of consciousness is one), the importance shifts to rapid extraction to a higher level of care. </p>
<p>Huge difference between someone whose sleepy and someone who falls unconscious due to head trauma or lack of circulation to the brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. In addition to monitoring decreases in mental status, if the patient can not wake up  the level of care required is higher. Unconscious means airway compromise and you’re getting a tube. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably the most overlooked yet obvious reason. Before you've reached the point of knowing what the specific problem is, the best way to get pointed in the right direction is to ask someone what's bothering them.</p>
<p>I'd also add that, as far as the outdoors are concerned, it's easier to prevent hypothermia if someone is awake and moving around. It definitely alleviates airway concerns as well.</p></div>		</li>
