			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't speak for OP but mine changed fairly significantly around the age of 21. I was born and grew up in London and although I didn't have a cockney accent or anything it was still pretty distinct. I moved to South Africa to study and was there for 5 years. It changed gradually because if I talked too fast or used too much slang it was like I was speaking a different language to English. I eventually slowed down my words and extended my vowels to match the accent  when I wanted to make a point as it meant no more repeating myself. By the time I left I was working bars and people kept asking where the fuck I was from. However, when I'm drunk it was and still is back to the London roots. </p></div>		</li>
