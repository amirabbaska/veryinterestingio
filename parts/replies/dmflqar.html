			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thank you. Do you know if you lower the volume, is that transmitting less voltage? I am completely ignorant to how electricity works, sorry</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it is. Audio signals from your computer represent the sound waves with electrical signals which vary in voltage. The variation of amplitude in voltage is linked with the variation of displacement of the speaker in your headphones. If you turn down your computer you turn down the amplitude of those signals and thus how far the speaker moves back and forth, changing the volume.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got it, one last thing: Am I correct in believing that the signal from a USB headset and the signal from a normal (3.5mm?) jack are different? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought speakers didn't go over voltage but amperage, am I mistaken?</p>
<p>I.e. louder volume more amperage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The signal going into your headphones is analog, meaning it is very similar to what you actually hear. More power = Louder, higher frequency = higher frequency, etc.</p>
<p>If it was digital then it would be easier to manipulate, and these relationships wouldn't hold</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct. The headphone port and cable carry an analog signal. The analog signal for no sound is just a wave with amplitude 0. That said, in the real world you will always have a small, commonly insignificant amplitude traveling on the wire. This is called noise.</p>
<p>That said, digital cables can have &quot;no signal&quot;. It is likely the DAC is receiving no signal as digital input when the computer is muted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont know if this is 100% correct. Normally i would agree but i have a pair of headphones that plug in with the two red and green, then a usb port. When i mute the pc and turn the headphones themself up i get an annoying sound that assures me they are still on (they turn up very loud)</p></div>		</li>
