			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense.  But you would also think that, public funding aside, better wages might also attract higher quality employees, but I can see how that would be hard to justify to a city or county.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well sure, but better wages requires more funding, which translates to more taxes or cutting funding from other places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed.  And since labor is one of the first things to be cut in any business, that's why I was saying it would be very hard to justify such increases to a city council, county, or even a state.  I live in Mississippi, and I remember a year or two ago that all teachers in elementary and high school were to be a given a raise, the first one in..I think four or five years.  Unfortunately I don't have an article in each reach to link, but it had been a long time since the last one.</p></div>		</li>

And how small Healthcare and education was on that pie chart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that they still are able to attract people who support the mission/cause regardless of the lower pay, so that eats into the incentive to raise it any further. If the public feels the job is getting done adequately, they are not likely to support an increase. If the job is not being done adequately, many will see a raise for workers as a promotion in place and question how that solves the problem. To me it's more complicated than that and I see a benefit of increased wages for civil servants to long term happiness, recruitment, and overall performance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very true in the case of the private school I work at. The teachers here are paid very well, 6 figures, and are high quality staff. The school also invests in quality training and has a mentor programme for teachers. The teachers get almost as much support as the students. However it is fairly cut throat as they fire underperforming teachers fairly quickly. Having said that, if you manage to prove your worth, you can stay for decades.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not a teacher, but a lowly support staff that doesn't get paid that well. :( I stay for the free lunches and snacks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is only helpful if employers can identify and are incentivized to select the higher quality applicants.</p>
<p>Evaluation of teachers and schools is an extremely challenging task. Test scores are an objective tool, but they are not a great measure of what the student learned or the value-add provided by the teacher or institution.</p>
<p>So it's not clear to me that increasing wages will lead to significantly improved outcomes.</p>
<p>From another perspective, let's consider applicants vary in two dimensions (skilled at teaching vs unskilled and motivated about teaching vs unmotivated), meaning there are four types of candidate:</p>
<ul>
<li>skilled and motivated (best)</li>
<li>unskilled and motivated (ok)</li>
<li>skilled and unmotivated (ok)</li>
<li>unskilled and unmotivated (worst)</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now low, wages biases our candidates toward lower skills but also more motivated about teaching. In other words, people who really want to teach will want the jobs despite the low pay, and people who are unskilled need to be less choosy about their employment and will take the jobs they can get.</p>
<p>Increasing wages will push the bias towards the skilled side, but it will also bring in people who are less motivated by teaching and are instead just seeking a pay day.</p>
<p>It's unclear to me which of skilled and unmotivated vs. unskilled and motivated teachers will be better for students, so it's also unclear to me that increasing wages without the ability to select good candidates is going to improve educational outcomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd suggest that identifying top quality applicants is a lot less important than identifying and weeding out the poorer quality ones, and likewise, regularly removing the worst performers from the workforce and replacing them with competent ones. </p>
<p>The differences in metric based performance between the average teacher and the top performers is usually small compared to the difference between the average and the bottom. We shouldnt look at the metrics to determine who is doing the best, but to determine who is clearly failing, and if the failures are fixable.</p>
<p>The main benefit of higher wages from that perspective is a larger candidate pool, which makes those decisions easier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This really helps explain why quality of teachers seems to drop so dramatically in college. The individuals may be extremely knowledgeable, but for some it's more a job than a calling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor, governments can get away with paying the lower wages because many people see these jobs as &quot;romantic&quot; ie, they're considered exciting and noble roles. Especially while TV and movies portray them as such. </p>
<p>I also suspect many of the people in these jobs grew up dreaming of becoming that particular profession, and do it for the love and passion of it. At least initially anyway.<br />
Governments all over the world take advantage of this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more accurate answer is that americans don't value the things they take for granted. Public school is a given, and the problem with their pay is layered.  </p>
<p>1) americans don't think of teacher as an important or difficult job, usually based on inaccurate assumptions like &quot;they have study periods and the whole summer off! They hardly even work!&quot;<br />
The reality is that public school teachers nearly all have summer employment, whether it's teaching summer school or working as a near minimum wage employee.</p>
<p>2) republicans here have done exceptionally well in driving a wedge between average citizens and public sector employees and their unions, leading many to believe that teachers are actually overpaid. This leads to the bigger topic: greed and selfishness.  </p>
<p>It's hard for average citizens in a country as large as the US to see where their taxes go, and everyone dislikes the idea of their money simply disappearing into the vast aether of &quot;big&quot; government. American citizens have been brainwashed into believing that government funded operations need to be profitable like a capitalist business, which is actually the exact opposite of what they should be doing. Capitalism, and how americans have been convinced to think their education system should work, entails the lowest possible labor costs, high turnover being acceptable, low overhead on buildings/supplies, etc. The focus of a social program such as public education is not to save money, nor make money like a business, but to educate the next generation of workers to populate the workforce. In this endeavor, you should realize you are making an investment in future gains, where a short term loss in order to secure long term gain is usually seen as a positive, but as its funding taken from taxes it is viewed as a vile waste of excessive expenditure. See, the problem isn't that teachers don't get paid enough, it's that capitalism based brainwashing has convinced far too many americans that they pay too much for education as a service (from salaries to supply budgets to replacing outdated textbooks to keeping up-to date with technology), when in reality it makes the most logical sense to have higher expenditure in all those things to help guarantee the future generation is well educated enough to work in the job market they will have.   </p>
<p>tl;dr - americans are viewing long term investments in education as unprofitable, ignoring that the purpose of schools is to educate, not make money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very well written.  I am a government employee and I see a lot of those same sentiments across many public sector jobs.  </p>
<p>The pay at most of these jobs has been flat for many years and raises (if at all) have not kept up with inflation and leaving people now making less money than they did 10 years ago.  One agency in my state has not received pay raises in 10 years and had administrators making 27K per year.  </p>
<p>The people you get working in those jobs are unskilled/unmotivated people that feed into the bureaucratic system and make government overall not that effective.  A lot of politicians fight to keep it this way to prove that government doesn't work.  Well of course if you defund it, don't pay accordingly, and make decisions based on political needs versus objective goals, it's going to fail.  </p></div>		</li>
