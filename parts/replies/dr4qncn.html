			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. I'll just add that this is why overhead power lines are very high voltage and low amperage. There's less power loss this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate on this, power lost over a conductor is directly related to the square of the current (amperage). The reason overhead and underground distribution and transmission lines are high voltage is because if you use a transformer to ramp up the voltage you ramp down the amperage.  P = IV (power is equal to the current times the voltage) so if you ramp up the voltage by a power of 10 then current becomes a tenth of what it was since power is conserved (minus losses in the transformer) so P = IV = (1/10)I(10V).  Since V = IR (voltage is equal to current times resistance) and P = IV you can substitute V = IR to get P = R(I^2 ).  Since I is now a tenth of what it was P = R((I/10)^2 ) = RI/100 so power lost is 1% of what it was before ramping up the voltage by a power of 10</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah but you can get around this limitation with extremely high voltage and/or extremely low resistance wires.   </p>
<p>Your typical hair dryer uses around 1500VA of power.  12AWG Copper extension cord cable can handle around 15amps.    We are capable of 500kV transmission in the US.   The voltage drop for a cable that size at 238,900miles is around 0.0064% at 500kV for 4000VA, conservatively accounting for the transformers needed to bring it back down to a usable voltage.  From an electrical standpoint it’s certainly doable, from a physical standpoint, impossible.   </p>
<p>Edit:  4000VA is 0.008A at 500kV.  Voltage drop on 238,900mi of Copper 12AWG is 32,055.68V or 0.0064%.  Conservatively accounting for a 25% loss in the transformers to get it back down to 120V, you would still have around 30A to play with, technically could power 2 hair dryers.</p>

<p>There's a bug in that calculator, but the voltage drop calculation was correct.  And 6.4% is an OK transmission loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sound like you know what you're talking about. Why is it that you can't run many appliances on long extension cords, but the wiring in your house isn't an issue? Shouldn't it have the same problem of losing power?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Within a house the issue usually is the amount of current drawn on a single circuit rather than line loss over an extension cord. You can run a 15A hair dryer on a 20A circuit, but add a second one and boom goes the breaker (or fuse). In a house and over an electrical cord, the other issue is overheating the power lines due to resistance. Your hair dryer may still run at reduced power, but if you use a long, thin extension cord, the cord will heat up. In the walls of your house, the wire gauge is matched to the load; thicker gauge wire is required for higher-load (amp) situations (longer runs, too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does, except:</p>
<ol>
<li>The wiring in your house is distinctly shorter than the 100' class extension cords where this starts to be an issue.</li>
<li>The wiring in your house was professionally sized to handle this, and is likely bigger than the extension cord.  14 AWG is common for 15A, 12 AWG for 20 -- though those sizes can be pushed up by a level if you're going to be running them longer distances.  Extension cords are commonly 16 AWG, sometimes 14.  You can get 12's and 10's, but those are usually special purpose for handling exactly that situation.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everybody’s answering you like you’re wrong, but you’re not wrong. There is a loss of power in your house’s wiring. That power loss ends up as wasted heat in your walls. It’s just that engineers have designed the system to have acceptable losses—so you as a consumer don’t notice them.</p>
<p>If your house was poorly wired, with very long wires between the service panel and the point-of-use, and the wires chosen had a small gauge, then you could absolutely notice the voltage drop. And if the wires were too small, then the wasted heat would build up to the point where the wires would melt inside your walls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this may work in theory, currently, as far as I know, a 12AWG cable rated to handle (insolation level) 500kV doesn't exist. Plus, NEC article 210.19A and 215.2 recommends (which means required for every utility I've known) no more than a 5% voltage drop. Cost of copper alone is roughly 100b. </p>
<p>Best bet would be to build solar on the moon!</p>
<p>Also, I know it was a hypothetical question, I just put some more info into it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have done <a href="https://imgur.com/a/0JmLx" target="_blank">several haunted hay rides</a> ( plus haunted observatory and party area) and have to stage the gauges of 100s of feet of electrical cord to ensure I have enough juice to run lighting far from the box. My buddy who throws these installed an actual wire run last time so we don't have to go through that again. Then he promptly made another 1/2 mile of trails so we can go larger next year.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you've already done so, but consider moving to 240 volt equipment if possible. buying new lights might be worth the savings on high gauge wiring. There's also some marginal reduction in electricity usage due to less energy spent heating the extension cables, depending on just how long those cables are.</p>
<p>You may also be able to go with groundless extension cables while driving another ground rod on the receiving end, of course depending on local electrical code and safety policies.</p></div>		</li>
