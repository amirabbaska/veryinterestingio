			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just here to praise this post for the OP so he can know this is the shit right here.</p>
<p>The technical part of playing music in an ensemble is daunting enough. But a good conductor, like the one in this post, must be a factotum, a total &quot;do-everything&quot;. To present a good interpretation of a piece means not only knowing all the history and theory, AND how each instrument or voice in the ensemble works, but then to have the charisma and communication skills and respect to get a story to the players.</p>
<p>&quot;Classical&quot; music has a MUCH freer sense of time and tempo and dynamics than most modern pop music. Proper expression of a piece means getting a large group of totally different people to express minutiae simultaneously.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your director sounds fantastic. Never thought I would see &quot;Eriks Esenvalds&quot; in a Reddit post!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's actually good friends with Eriks!  I sing with the Portland State Chamber choir under Ethan Sperry, and we're  about to release an all Esenvalds album featuring his Passion &amp;Resurrection!  My friend hosted him one of the many times he's stayed in Oregon and actually still has one of his sweaters :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My high school band director gave us a speech during a rehearsal and left us to play American Elegy by Frank Ticheli (piece written by the band director at Columbine after the shooting) with the lights turned off.  In the darkness you could hear everyone was crying. It was the most chilling sort of vulnerable feeling I've ever felt. </p></div>		</li>
