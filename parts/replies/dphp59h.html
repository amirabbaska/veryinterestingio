			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the legal definition of chocolate (by the contained percentage of cocoa solids/butter) varies between countries. This is why some American chocolate tastes awful to non-Americans, because it has much lower cocoa solids/butter content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US Government requires a 10% concentration of chocolate liquor. EU regulations specify a minimum of 25% cocoa solids.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The accepted wisdom is that the way Hershey’s traditionally processed milk resulted in the formation of butyric acid, which literally smells like vomit. This ultimately became the chocolate taste that Americans are used to. Other manufacturers add butyric acid to make their chocolate taste appropriate for the American market (Several sources). </p>
<p>In addition, they now also use polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) as a cheaper part-alternative to cocoa butter to make chocolate ‘smooth’, but that also means the rich chocolatey feel is reduced. </p>
<p>PGPR isn’t restricted to the US market, it’s a feature of cheaper mass market chocolate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything over 90% is an acquired taste, but it depends on the person. For me the limit is 85%, that's where it still tastes interesting and chocolatey. I know a couple of people who like 92%. By that I mean they'll eat a couple of squares and enjoy it, but not a whole bar.</p></div>		</li>
