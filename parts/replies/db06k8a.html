			<div class="markdown"><p>A balloon is a container. Thus it's shell is the boundary, the edge between it's content and it's surroundings, and will explode when the contents exceed the structural capacity of the container. The balloon analogy makes sense as long as we ignore any structural limitations. The infinite universe as it applies to expanding means <em>impossible to measure or calculate</em> rather than <em>limitless</em>. It cannot be considered expanding if it has no outer edge or boundary. In order to be expanding there has to be space outside the universe to expand into. And, if there is space to expand into then there has to be an outer edge.</p></div>		</li>
