			<div class="markdown"><p>I think Military flyovers of athletic contests are a better example than airshows. Airshows have more of a acrobat/stunt feel with not always the most up to date/lethal aircraft, while flyovers are typically the latest and greatest killing machines.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One could argue the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds are for nationalistic purposes, or at least they were originally. These days it's a lot more &quot;look at what this airplane and these pilots can do&quot; instead of &quot;God Bless 'Murica, join the military!!!&quot;</p>
<p>Now, the US did used to have military parades, back in like WWII and before that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the other hand, there are air shows like the <a href="https://www.daytonairshow.com/2015/performers/" target="_blank">Dayton Air Show</a> which include a mix of current military aircraft, antique military aircraft, and aerobatic acts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but air shows don't have missiles.</p>
<p>They definitely are a military recruiting tool.  Would have worked on me if I had better eyes.</p></div>		</li>
