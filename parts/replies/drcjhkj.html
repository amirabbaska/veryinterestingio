			<div class="markdown"><p>You mention using the monkey model.. Does that mean monkeys receive clotting factors, or have their blood supply cut off, to cause an intentional stroke for research? That sounds terrible. :(<br />
I am not saying that you shouldn't research this in animals however.. I trust that it is made as comfortable as possible if this is being done intentionally. I also would like to thank you and all research animals for advancing medical sciences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the least of the stuff they do to animal models. Laser eye surgery was developed by doing it on animals, who obviously didn't need it. They also tested the safety of airplane ejector seats in people who had had eye surgery by doing it to rabbits and then launching them out of ejector seats to see what would happen.</p>

<p>But, the total amount of suffering that occurs is reduced by the use of animal models. It's unpleasant but it's worse than famine and disease, or people getting their corneal flaps dislocated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate reading about it all, but understand the significance of animal models. Without animal experimentation, we would be propelled very far back in medical sciences...<br />
But given what you linked, it sounds like they probably intentionally caused the stroke for the monkeys as well.<br />
I wonder what kind of toll this takes on some of the researchers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stuff like this makes me wonder.. are some things really necessary to test? What percent of the population ever flies a plane, of that, how many are ever ejected from the plane, and of those, how many have had LASIK? Plus, with all the damage that would occur from being exposed to 9 times the force of gravity and being <em>ejected from a plane</em>, are your corneal flaps becoming dislocated a primary concern at that point?</p>
<p>Especially since the studies came back and said that their corneal flaps were stable, who even thought this was something that needed to be tested? I'm sure there were more common scenarios regarding the stability after LASIK that would have been a bit more beneficial to test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The monkeys are under full general anesthesia, and all procedures are reviewed and approved by the university's animal care committee.  We induce a stroke by causing a small clot on a leg vein, and then injecting that clot in a precise location by arterial catheter. We do constant imaging and monitoring for the next 16 hours. After that the animal is sacrificed according to approved procedures. The brain is then removed and sent to pathology.</p>
<p>We obviously can't do this kind of work on humans, but we hope that this work can help ensure that the next stroke patient who comes into the hospital at 5 or 6 or 7 hours isn't doomed to a wheelchair or unable to speak for the rest of his/her life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MR imaging uses strong magnetic fields to isolate and excite the nucleii of atoms that have a significant magnetic moment, specifically a magnetic dipole. That's just a fancy way of saying that the (spinning) nucleus responds to any external magnetic field by &quot;lining up&quot; with it, kinda of like a compass needle. Hydrogen nucleii have a very strong dipole interaction, and just so happen to be the most abundant element in the body. So when we say we are imaging water, we are really referring to the 2 hydrogen nucleii on every water molecule. Water is about 50 molar concentration in the body, so you don't need a strong magnetic field (relatively speaking) to get a good image. Most clinical magnets are around 1 to 1.5 Tesla (about 250000 times Earth's magnetic field).</p>
<p>Most other elements in the body aren't dipoles, so you can't image them (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen), but some trace elements--sodium, potassium--are dipoles (sodium is a quadrupole, but that is overcomplicating things). However the magnetic moment is weaker than hydrogen and it is way less concentrated in the body (150 millimolar), so the signal is several orders of magnitude weaker than standard water imaging. We use a 9.4T human-sized machine (1 of only a few in the world) to do our sodium imaging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mention two timeframes.</p>
<p>If you were to use sodium imagining, how long would it take to figure out a stroke had occurred, compared to the standard 24hrs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Figuring out whether a stroke has occurred and what type it is (ischemic vs hemorrhagic) is relatively simple and immediate.  The issue is determining exactly where, how extensive, and how damaged the ischemic tissue is, because this determines if and how the clot busting medication should be administered.  If given appropriately, you can completely reverse the stroke (break up the clot and restore blood flow) and save the patient from long term morbidity.  Current imaging can only tell use the size, location, and extent of the stroke after 12-24 hours, when the stroke has already resolved and the damage is irreversible.  This is why the current standard is purely time-based.  If the first observed sign/symptom of stroke occurred within the last 3-4.5 hours, the medication is given (assuming no contraindications).  After that window, experience (and clinical trials) tells us that in general too much tissue has been damaged (including blood vessels themselves) and breaking up any clots has a high risk of breaking blood vessels and causing a brain bleed (which is much more serious than the initial stroke).</p>
<p>Sodium imaging is only limited in the time it takes to perform the imaging and process the data.  It represents an immediate assessment of tissue viability--we can see the changes as they occur.  Right now, on our experimental magnet, our protocol for human imaging takes about one hour to image and another hour to process.  In an emergency, we could probably get the important bits done in about 40 minutes (we do no emergency imaging currently).</p>
<p>So instead of applying a single time-based, general rule on all stroke patients coming to the hospital (did you get here within 3-4.5 hours?), we can make an individual assessment using sodium MRI.  If our imaging shows that the patient still has viable tissue--even past 4.5 hours--the risk/reward for busting up the clots changes.  On the other hand, if a patient comes in at 1 hour but our imaging shows that the tissue is already dead, then we can forgo the clot-busting therapy because we know there's no viable tissue to rescue.</p></div>		</li>
