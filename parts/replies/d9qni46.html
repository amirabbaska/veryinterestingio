			<p>I wonder if they have mics set up before hand or if they just dub in some sound after the fact.</p>		</li>

			<p>They dub the sounds, big time. Sometimes it really hurts to watch because it's so obvious. Animals don't make much noise in general</p>		</li>

			<p>Things appear the same size in an image as they do from your eyes. It's around 43mm but 50mm is close enough that you don't notice much difference.</p>		</li>
