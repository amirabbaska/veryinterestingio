			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to <strong>understand</strong> it, I recommend Googling &quot;caltech chem 120.&quot;  If you scroll down near the bottom of the first page that comes up under &quot;reference materials,&quot; and look at the links labeled &quot;Goddard book,&quot; you'll find an online version of a book that is by far the best I've seen in terms of conveying what it all means.  There's some real &quot;aha&quot; stuff in Chapter 1 that gets sadly neglected in many if not most introductory quantum chemistry courses, and even if the math goes over your head that chapter in particular is really worth a read.</p></div>		</li>
