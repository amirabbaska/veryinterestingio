			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. A nuclear explosion has to have the bulk of its energy output come from nuclear reactions, either fission or fusion. (I'm sure there's some technical definition of &quot;nuclear explosion&quot; out there, and this is not it, but it gets pretty close I bet.)</p>
<p>Of course it's worth remembering that just because an explosion is nuclear doesn't mean it is automatically larger or stronger than a non-nuclear explosion.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So in that scenario it isn't a &quot;nuclear&quot; blast because no actuall fission or fusion takes place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct.  All the energy comes from the kinetic energy of the tungsten telephone pole.  It's as big a bang as a small nuke, but no radiation is released.  Basically, it's a man made meteor impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'd have to be traveling at speeds approaching a significant factor of c to do that (significant for us being still less than a tenth of a percent). </p>
<p>And no, it'd not be a nuclear reaction. </p></div>		</li>
