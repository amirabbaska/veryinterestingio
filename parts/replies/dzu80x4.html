			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US there are laws (don't remember if they're federal or state, probably both) that require signatures for credit purchases over a certain amount, usually $25 or $50. These laws aren't strongly enforced, and are really only used in the case of audits where they have been found to be broken (and even then, it usually has to be a crazy purchase like, &quot;Why didn't you get a signature for this $35,000 purchase?&quot;). Digital signature pads (actually the POS system) usually take care of figuring out whether or not you need to sign, but some places still use paper receipts for this. The cashiers in those places may be unaware of the relevant regulations, or often just don't care (since they won't get in trouble anyways, just their boss or the business owner).</p></div>		</li>
