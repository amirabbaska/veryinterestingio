			<div class="markdown"><p>The color-producing molecules in the DVD cases, which are prone to fading, are typically large <em>organic</em> compounds with significant conjugation and aromatic ring structures. The bonds in these compounds are photolytically cleaved via the mechanisms that /u/crnaruka pointed out.</p>
<p>The rocks and mountains you speak of contain colors originating from transition <em>metal</em> complexes and compounds with metal ions and <em>inorganic</em> counterions, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper%28II%29_sulfate" target="_blank">copper sulfate</a>. So, perhaps, the difference lies in this organic vs. inorganic distinction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of these materials are at greater risk from light damage than others. Generally speaking, organic materials—those derived from plants or animals—are more susceptible than inorganic materials. For instance, natural dyes, which are organic, generally fade faster than pigments, which are usually comprised of inorganic minerals. But even organic materials vary in their stability: materials made of parchment, which is a specially prepared animal skin, are less vulnerable than, say, silk and wool.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree. I think there is an underlying assumption that bleaching is associated with breakdown and oxidation, but that assumption is flawed. Pure elemental substances have absorption spectra (in the visible spectrum), and therefore color, and, at least in this context, pure or oxidized elements are the end of the line as far as breakdown goes. Also, some substances or mixtures will actually produce more colorful breakdown products as they oxidize. Basically everything has an absorption profile which is dependent on it's electron orbitals, and the diversity of underlying structures which determine absorption is too great to simplify into simple terms like &quot;things fade as they break down&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: but since op is asking <em>what determines the rate</em> of breakdown that is still a valid question in itself. I'm not sure I can answer that though...

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, colors arise from specific chemistry - how tightly bound is one particular somewhat-loose electron, in a chemical. If you alter the chemical a little, the electron becomes tightly bound or something, and it loses that color. That's called bleaching.</p>
<p>Sometimes, colors arise from a more general chemistry - any small change to the chemical, and it just goes back to the way it was. These don't really bleach much (it needs to be hit hard enough to change enough that it can't go back, which won't happen quickly).</p>
<p>Other times, the color is based on optical properties arising from shape (e.g. (almost?) any blue color found in the animal kingdom). Since this is based on a large-scale property, these will not bleach easily at all, though they can be crushed.</p>
<p>Other times, the color is based on electronic properties arising from shape (e.g. metallic nanoparticles). These don't bleach easily at all, and are hard to crush, but if they are shorted to something then they lose their color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are hundreds if not thousands of different industrial pigments and dyes, both organic and inorganic. Some fade faster than others. Maybe that cereal box fades after than your car paint, but it car paint costs considerably more than a cereal box, and is intended to last longer. The fading of dyes and pigments is light driving a chemical reaction from a compound that reflects colored light to one that doesn't. So one that fades slower is more stable, it takes more energy to change its chemical composition than sunlight can provide. </p></div>		</li>
