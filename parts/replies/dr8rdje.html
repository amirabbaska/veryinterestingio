			<div class="markdown"><p>The best explanation IMO. In memory at least, it's nothing to do with computers &quot;working in binary&quot;, and everything to do with the implications on the physical layout of memory using binary addresses. To use 1000 would leave 24 potential &quot;boxes&quot; that could be addressed, but are instead absent. In HDDs, manufacturers get away with using 1000 because their platters don't have the same constraint, so they just fit as much as they can and label it so it appears larger.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Using binary addresses has everything to do with computers working in binary. Why do you imply there's no connection?</p></div>		</li>
