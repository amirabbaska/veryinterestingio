			<div class="markdown"><p>I mentioned a few things everyone can do to helpâ€”reducing the amount of waste you generate so less goes to landfills and the environment, helping remove debris from beaches and rivers and making sure you pick up trash. Also, paying attention that the seafood you eat is caught sustainably. Learn more [<a href="http://www.fishwatch.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.fishwatch.gov/</a>]. Whales and all marine life can be impacted from climate change. For example, food that the animals eat, or their prey, can have drastic shifts in their distribution resulting in an animal needing to go further distances, thus exerting more energy, to find their food. A lot of the food chain is based on very small animals like zooplankton, which have found to be impacted from a changing ocean environment like temperature or ocean acidification.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My understanding is that most of us are consuming fish is a non sustainable way. How can consumers be sure they're buying from sustainable fishers? Is large-scale fishing truly sustainable? </p>

<p>In your findings, is there an estimated percentage of how much marine life is being impacted/eliminated by ocean dead zones?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(<em>note:  I consult with folks on the fish side of the NOAA house</em>).  There are many well-managed, sustainable fisheries in the world - as well as some not so well-managed.  In countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, great strides have been taken in the last 20-30 years to ensure sustainability of many of their stocks.</p>
<p>As a consumer, there's quite a bit of good labeling to go on to help you make good choices.  The Monterey Bay Aquarium has a <a href="http://www.seafoodwatch.org/" target="_blank">seafood watch list</a> to help consumers make sustainable choices; another label to look for in stores or on packages is the MSC-label, for the <a href="https://www.msc.org/" target="_blank">Marine Stewardship Council</a>.</p>
<p>Having served to help some fisheries get certified, I can say their reviews are scientifically rigorous and extremely constructive in documenting and recommending sustainable fishing practices, both for the industry and consumers, and takes into account effects and evaluates the fishery including the effects of interactions with marine mammals, birds, habitat, and other wildlife. </p>
<p>(<em>edit: I am not endorsing the above private labeling organizations in any official NOAA capacity, but I use them personally when shopping</em>).</p></div>		</li>
