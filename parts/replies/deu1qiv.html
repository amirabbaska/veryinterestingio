<p>I was just trying to give a more friendly, lively description of how I've seen it play out, though, in the spirit of ELI5 even though it's not for literal 5YOs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is a very narrow view of gentrification. there's definitely a lot more that goes on than people with 10 million dollar trust funds moving into old warehouses...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not an example of gentrification at all.  The very definition of gentrification is that a neighborhood becomes unaffordable to its <em>existing residents</em> due to the influx of wealthier outsiders.  Broke artists moving into abandoned warehouse districts is <em>not</em> what this is about.  This is a better description of how gentrification typically occurs in big cities:</p>
<p>Students and middle class young people supported by their parents move into poor, predominately minority neighborhoods because the rent is cheap -&gt; Over time, their friends begin to join them -&gt; Landlords realize that they can raise the rent in their buildings because the students' parents will pay for it -&gt; Landlords force their poor tenants out of their homes by raising the rent to an astronomical degree, hoping that wealthy students will take their place -&gt; As the neighborhood becomes &quot;trendier,&quot; local markets/bodegas and small businesses are bought out by larger, more expensive chains that are willing to pay big bucks -&gt; Now that the neighborhood is safer and trendier, real estate developers buy old buildings and create luxury apartment buildings -&gt; This creates a cycle of rent escalation, an increase in property taxes, etc., and finally you have a neighborhood filled with wealthy, young professionals.  The working class, mostly minority former residents have had to leave their neighborhood that they may have grown up in to find a cheaper and more dangerous neighborhood that they can afford.</p>
<p>That is gentrification.  Again, the key is that there is a displacement of long-time residents, which is why gentrification is not considered a positive thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the previous poster touched on that near the end. I think they were explaining how gentrification is set up, and how it plays out, rather than the negative long term effects. But again they talked about that at the end. Like in their last bolded paragraph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tldr of this perfect post is &quot;poor creative people live in poor areas which become attractive to rich people because it is poor and eclectic. Rich people spend money to make it nicer. And now average rents go up and poor people get pushed out.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Poor artists being pushed out of their neighbourhood definitely is an example of gentrification and it does happen.  I'm watching it happen to Wakefield, Qc right now.  It's not the only way gentrification happens but it's not unheard of either.</p>
<p>Funnily enough a lot of them moved there because they were pushed out of places like the Glebe in Ottawa.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's literally exactly what he said.  The poor artists are forced to leave after the wealthy folks move in and drive rents up.</p></div>		</li>
