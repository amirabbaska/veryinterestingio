			<p>I think this idea is dumb.  The audience &quot;wouldn't accept&quot; it?  What did they do?  Film a movie about horses with natural sounds, show it to a prescreening audience, and everyone said &quot;I can't get into this movie.  The horses aren't real.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>To add an example to this: During preliminary <em>Lord of the Rings</em> screenings, swords did not make the unrealistic <em>shing</em> sound when being drawn (leather against metal doesn't make a sound like that). This confused audiences, since they're basically trained to hear that sound when a sword is drawn. Thus, the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> films added the <em>shing</em> sound, even though it technically doesn't make any sense.</p>		</li>

			<p>Source? I don't believe they prescreened the movie to anyone but the production team itself for any of the six LOTR/Hobbit movies.</p>		</li>
