			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that much of art is symbolic.  Think of cartoons as the best examples.  Want to show that some one is going fast?  Add straight lines behind them.  Wiggle?  Use a series of curved lines on each side.  Shiny?  Straight lines pointed outward.  Once you internalize these <del>this</del> symbols, you don't like them being messed with.  Real sounds are often ambiguous, but the symbolic noises are clear.  We have symbolic actions used in movies as well.  Did you ever actually see someone hit the side of their head to indicate &quot;I just realized something that should have been obvious.&quot; Movies are filled with stylized facial expressions and actions that convey things in a quick and clear way that are hard to show realistically.</p></div>		</li>

<p>trope  noun: a figurative or metaphorical use of a word or expression.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable to expand this definition to include non-written symbolic representations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to simply following convention, folly is another component used to tell the story. In your example of The Coconut Effect, a muted thud on in the dirt does little to express the event of a horse walking through the wild west.</p>
<p>Similarly a punch to the face doesn't sound much different than a slap to the face. In reality a slap has a more pronounced sound than a punch; however a muted slap sound does little to tell the story of a punch to the face. This is why whipping and crunching sounds are added to the effect to better tell the story of the punch whizzing through the air and impacting the skull.</p>
<p>So in short it's not so much about giving people what they know and expect. Rather in both radio and movies these folly sounds do a better job at telling the story of what's happening than what the realistic sounds do on their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good explanation. In many, many ways movies and tv are unrealistic in order to convey the story to the audience more fully and clearly. Sound is just another one of those ways. It may not be realistic, but it tells you what the creator wants you to know.</p></div>		</li>

He tried various combinations of sword and scabbard materials but couldn't get more than a quiet swish-sound. </p></div>		</li>
