			<div class="markdown"><p>Truth. Also dead bodies have their features settle in weird ways. Jowels move back, ears lay flat, noses lat flatter too, lips look more thin. </p>
<p>Embalmers use cotton, vaseline, and § voodoo to prop faces up in a way that defys gravity in order to make a relaxed, and ‰ slightly lifelike appearance. </p>
<p>§ Voodoo means years of training in facial reconstruction and face setting, which is the art of setting a face before embalming so that it stays that way.</p>
<p>‰ Slightly lifelike means that embalmers make the person look comfortable and resting, rather than perishing and pallor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if they've been autopsied. If they just died of oldness then we definitely do not make more holes in them than what is needed. </p>
<p>If they had a trip through the me's office they are going to be a shitshow to fix. And it's not so much that they are &quot;stuffed&quot; with paper towels, it's more like they are lined with cotton batting so that their ribs don't puncture a hole in ther viscera bag and make a huge fucking mess. I don't miss working that job, just always came home dirty, tired, underpaid.</p></div>		</li>
