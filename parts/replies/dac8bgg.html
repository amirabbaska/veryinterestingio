			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the ear canal is not a straight tube, it's angled towards the front of your head, so the water that comes in can't easily go out even if you tilt your head sideways. That's the reason why doctors have to pull your ears when checking your ear canals, by pulling the ear towards them and to the front they align the ear canal so that they can easily see your eardrums. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They stay there because water likes to stick at certain surfaces, and the sticking force is strong enough to counteract the water's weight. Then the water is stuck inside. </p>
<p>You can drip a little bit of more water into that ear to let them accumulate and become heavier and then they'll flow out nicely because water likes to stick with each other moreso than with another stuff.</p></div>		</li>
