<p>There's nothing random about life. On the contrary, it's highly organized. </p></div>		</li>

<p>On a couple of trips, not necessarily on LSD, I experienced what is known as a Satori state, which is being in a state of understanding how perfect the universe is, with every piece fitting into one another perfectly in order to create a coherent universe and, eventually, conscious life as well. It's hard not to look at things spiritually after an experience like that. Alas, the more I thought about it the more I came to the conclusion that in a universe as absolutely massive as our own, enough trial and error would be able to create what we see here on earth, with all of its perfect imperfections and constant evolution. To me, everything is random to some degree, as in its coming about is random, but life in and of itself, eg living organisms such as ourselves, are in fact highly organized, with millions of little systems running together coherently so we can function properly. </p></div>		</li>
