			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent! But because he's five:</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you get sick, a little battle begins in your body. The bad guys are either bacteria or viruses... You can think of them as aliens that want to take over your body. Their goal is to make you feel lousy. They make you feel really hot, really cold, and sometimes, they even make your nose run. </p>
<p>When you're sick, your body sends out little soldiers to fight the aliens. These good guys are called anti bodies, and sometimes, they get dehydrated.</p>
<p>You get dehydrated sometimes... just like at your soccer games, when you get thirsty and tired. When you run around, chasing the soccer ball, you sweat, and lose a lot of water. When you drink more water, or sometimes gaterade, you get more energy so you can keep going.</p>
<p>In order for your antibodies to defeat the bad guys, you need to make sure they are well hydrated, which means  you are giving them enough water so they aren't thirsty...</p>
<p>When you're sick, your body uses up a lot of water, so it's up to you to keep your little soldiers hydrated by drinking more water than usual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small clarification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans are colonized by many microorganisms; the traditional estimate is that the average human body is inhabited by ten times as many non-human cells as human cells, <strong>but more recent estimates have lowered that ratio to 3:1 or even to approximately the same number.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still an amazing fact, but it's kinda sad that the 10 to 1 figure is no longer the accepted answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imma piggyback this one.</p>
<p>The lymphatic system (part of the immune system) moves water through it via pressure (hydrostatic pressure). </p>
<p>If you drink a little extra water while sick and dehydrated, you move your immune cells around a little more efficiently. This may lead to faster recovery and feeling less awful for the duration of illness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm haven't read evidence of that so I won't back it. </p>
<p>However, Intuitively it makes sense. For example, drinking extra water in the days after a hard workout can decrease muscle soreness slightly. If massages release builtup metabolic byproducts from muscles, I assume it would have a similar affect - to carry away those byproducts. (Although, to be clear, muscle soreness primary cause is micro tears in muscle tissue at the microscopic level, so drinking extra water likely leads to increased antiinflamatory products and increased repair).</p></div>		</li>
