			<div class="markdown"><p>Boolean algebra was created in the mid 1850's. The type of computer you are thinking of, a mechanical computer, works in an entirely different way than processors. They are designed for a single purpose, like the fire solution computer battleships used in WW2, and do not use boolean logic to operate. There's nothing stopping you from making a mechanical computer that uses boolean logic, but it would be quite large and not very useful.</p></div>		</li>
