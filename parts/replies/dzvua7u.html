<p>Go one step further: adding -1 times is subtracting 1 time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You define &quot;adding something negative n times&quot; to mean &quot;taking something away n times.&quot; In this way, you've translated an operation that involves counting with negative numbers into one of repeated subtraction. If the thing you're repeatedly subtracting is negative, then you must define what it means to subtract a negative number. And we already defined that as adding its opposite. Le voilà!</p>
<p>-2 * -3 = 0 - (-2) - (-2) - (-2) = 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 6</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Multiplication is a hyperoperator that iterates addition. Addition is itself a hyperoperator that iterates incrementation. Incrementation just means to take the next number in sequence.</p>
<p>If I start with 2 apples, and I increment, I get 3 apples. If I want to take a group of 2 apples, and combine them with a group of 4 apples, I can increment by taking one apple at a time and moving it from one group  to the other, until the second group is gone, and the group I have left will contain all the apples from the 2 original groups. In total, I will end up incrementing 4 times. When we increment multiple times, we call it addition. So instead of moving the apples one at a time, I can count that there are 4 apples in the second group, and &quot;add&quot; 4 to 2, which means moving 4 positions forward in the number sequence that we use for counting (natural numbers) to 6.</p>
<p>Multiplication is the next step. I have 5 baskets, each with 10 apples, and I want to combine them all and know how many apples I  have. I could start iterating, taking one apple at a time and moving it to a single group until all the other groups are gone, then count what I have, but that would take a while. I could add to combine whole groups at a time, adding a total of 5 times. When we add multiple times, we call it multiplication. So instead of adding one group at a time, I can count that I have 5 identical lots of 10 apples each, and make 5 successive jumps of 10 spaces each forward on the number sequence, straight to the answer of 50.</p>
<p>The next step would be exponentiation, which is a series of identical sets of jumps, and then tetration, which is repeated sets of sets of jumps, and so on.</p>
<p>Edit: a word mixup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually often use “of” to describe multiplication. 2 (groups) of 3 (per group) is 6. </p>
<p>The “opposite of” is a really great way to think about negative numbers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with this is that I could say &quot;I'm not not going for a walk&quot; and it could be interpreted by some to be different than &quot;I'm going for a walk.&quot; When you multiply by negative one you're moving your number to the opposite side of the number line, but when dealing with not statements there are many mathematicians who don't cancel double negatives (constructivists).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s valid. “Opposite of opposite” is better. “Not not” trades accessibility for accuracy, so it can be a quick ‘ELI5’ stepping stone to a more accurate understanding.</p></div>		</li>
