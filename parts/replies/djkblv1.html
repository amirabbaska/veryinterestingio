<p>What am I supposed to hear? I hear a &quot;oooooooooooooooo&quot; sound. The explanation says I should hear it moving or something, but I only hear a steady &quot;ooooooooooo&quot; until the end. </p>
<p>Edit: Risset's rhythmic effect. Forever accelerating beat.</p>
<p>I hear it accelerate, then start slow again after a while, accelerate, slow, accelerate, slow. Is that's what should happen?  </p>
<p>Edit 2: Binaural sounds.
I should hear a 3rd tone when using headset. I hear 2 tones, one in each ear.
I think my ears are broken. I don't hear what they explain I should hear... Why?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That ooooooo should sound like it's getting lower and lower pitched (other variations sound like it's getting higher and higher pitched). The trick to it is that it keeps repeating. It's often referred to as the auditory equivalent to a barber's poll (that spinning poll outside a barber shop where it looks like the stripes are moving up or down, but in reality they're just spinning). If you keep playing it for a long time and think of how much lower you think it should have gotten. But then start it over and realize it hasn't gotten lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effect comes from cleverly placed splicing to create an illusion of infinite ascension or descent in the tone, though it's actually a small loop. Check the pictures on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> article.</p></div>		</li>
