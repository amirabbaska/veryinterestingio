			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there is no &quot;override switch&quot; that causes a person to go into cardiac arrest, if accidently flipped.  &quot;Heart attacks&quot; happen when there is a blockage, within a vessel.  Because of that blockage, oxygen is unable to reach the heart tissue beyond the blockage.  If caught in time, the blockage can be removed or the vessel can be expanded/diverted.  If not caught in time, the heart muscle will begin to die.  However, it is important to note that while we cannot choose when or how efficiently our heart pumps, we can increase it or slow it down.  By stimulating the vagus nerve (blowing hard through a straw can do this or straining to go #2) we can cause our heart rate to slow.  Not enough to stop or reset, just slow down a bit, in healthy individuals.  On the flip side, I'm sure we are all aware of how exercise can increase heart rates.  </p>
<p>The heart is an incredibly interesting part of the human body.  It is the only type of muscle tissue to work autonomously.  In other words, your brain can be &quot;dead&quot; and your heart will still do it's job.  You can be paralyzed from the neck down, and your heart will still do it's job.  It's pretty cool stuff.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me that what's happening with biofeedback and other similar things is that we can learn to control things we have a conscious effect on, that then effect the things we don't have direct control over.</p>
<p>A really simple example is that I can make my heartbeat go way up by going for a run, and way down by taking a nap. Similarly I can make all kinds of stress hormones go down by meditating for a bit. That doesn't mean I can directly and consciously control when my heart beats or what kind of hormones my brain releases. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I thought about that after I posted it.  It is more indirect.  </p></div>		</li>
