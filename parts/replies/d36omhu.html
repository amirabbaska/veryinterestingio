			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh thank you! I did not encounter this before. But this is more of a limit of the known physics (QFT and GR) rather than the limit on the concept of statistical mechanics. I am extremely impressed by statmech (and terribly bad at it) because it is more mathematical modelling than actual physics; you can fit it to anything as long as you know the ground rules. In physics, beyond planck scales, known physics break down so we are not sure if gravity (or particles) is a valid thing to talk about even at those energy scales. We can speculate any how we want but no one is going to be sure, because we probably would destroy the earth if we ever could conduct an experiment of that energy. (This is exactly the reason why I think observational cosmology and astronomy will be paramount in particle physics in the coming years; we have hard limits on what we produce on earth but the universe is the real thing that contains what happened and what could possibly happen)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, but don't things emit electromagnetic energy when they are hot and its wavelength is inversely correlated to the temperature? In that case wouldn't there be a theoretical maximum temperature as the wave length can't be shorter than the Planck distance?</p>
<p>I guess this temperature is so much higher than anything we've ever seen, but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For all electrodynamic systems this is true. For example, lets say hypothetically, there were particles with no spin and charge; these particles would not emit any light no matter how hot they were.</p>
<p>What you say is true, and is analogous to the issue of Quantum Field Theory. QFT works in all energy scales that we can experiment (and most likely to encounter and measure) but it does have a built in limit where the energies become higher than the planck scales. However, this does not imply that things cannot progress beyond this. It just means that the physics description will change. Probably light emission will give its way to something else. These questions actually have to do a lot about the early conditions of the universe. (the 10^-30ish seconds old universe) But the concept of temperature still remains!</p>
<p>Thermodynamics (well mostly statistical mechanics) is awesome in that it can be applied to ANY model in physics. So no matter the physics of the system; be it quantum, classical, relativistic etc.; you can still talk about temperature and stuff. Things do blackbody radiation because we know how thermal energy is distributed among the atoms and atoms are electrical things.</p>
<p>An analogy would be a bunch of kids running around a hallway. Temperature describes to you how speeds are distributed among the running kids. And if they all have the same exact voice, you can hear a distinct distribution of sound when you are in the hallway; since doppler shift would shift the frequencies. Depending on how excited the kids are (higher temperature would equate into kids running around faster) you will have kids more likely to run faster so the sounds apparent pitch distribution will widen. But changing physics is like changing the kids into adults. They still might be running but they aren't screaming any more, so you don't hear the same sound. But they are still running thus there is a temperature.</p>
<p>EDIT: Though I wanted to calculate this one thing couple years back; in GR gravity couples to everything that has mass-energy; momentum pressure etc. In fact, very large stars, even though they have tremendous pressure trying to keep them large, also have massive curvature due to there being pressure and thus the pressure helps the collapse into a black hole. Since temperature is internal energy, I wanted to calculate the temperature at which the thermal energy would be enough to cause a collapse into a black hole; thus actually giving an upper limit for the temperature a star can absolutely have while maintaining a star status. I didn't know enough GR back then to answer this question but I might try my hand at calculating this when I'm done with my final on GR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Massive particles can approach the speed of light, but never reach it. Think about it this way, if you add 1 joule (any energy unit works for this) to a stationary particle, you take it to lets say 1% of the speed of light. (In science, it's customary to talk about speed in terms of speed of light. So 0 is 0 m/s, 1 is 3*10^8 m/s which is speed of light. For example, something travelling 300 km/s; we would say is 300000/300000000 = 0.001 = .1%)</p>
<p>So going back, for our everyday use, conventional speeds does not even reach 0.1; and for this regime linear increase works pretty well. We call this classical dynamics. As we approach higher than 0.4 however, you get diminishing returns on your energy investment. If from 0 adding 1 J of energy increased it to 0.1, then adding 1 J to a particle going with 0.5 would increase is to something like 0.55</p>
<p>If you want to get mathematical, the speed quantity is denoted by the variable u. What you increase when you add energy is G*mc^2. (G is gamma but I can't format it here) G = 1/(1-u^2 )^1/2 . For u is small, this is roughly equal to 1 + 1/2 u^2 (Which is where kinetic energy ~v^2 /2 comes from) but for higher speeds, no matter how big you make G; u stays smaller than speed of light (1). <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/rimg224.gif" target="_blank">This graph demonstrates it.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the long answer! What i dont understand is: if the velocity of the particle gets close to the speed of light but never reaches it, why would the temperature of the particle not also get close to a certain value since heat is defined by the velocity of the particle? Or does the heat increase linearly even though the velocity just get close to the speed of light, and in that case why?</p></div>		</li>
