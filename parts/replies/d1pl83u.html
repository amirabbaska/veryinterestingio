			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I went diving... I used to help teach it although you'd never know it now by how much I've forgotten... </p>
<p>At ~140 feet below the water, I don't recall feeling significantly different than at ~30.  Apart from equalizing my ears, why did it not feel like someone was standing on me when I went down that far?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part our skin and bodies are able to handle positive pressure pretty easily. That being said, the scuba tank's air has to be pressurized partially in order to reduce the effect of the pressure on your chest. If you tried to suck surface pressure air from a 140 foot long snorkel it'd be absolutely impossible. It's probably impossible from 30ft. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From reading online, it seems that the maximum length of a snorkel is actually capped at about half a metre, due to the mechanical difficulty of inflating your chest against the pressure of the water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relative pressure changes. Going from 0 to 10m deep doubles the pressure you feel and halves gas volume. Going from 20 to 30 increases your pressure by a 3rd (3 to 4 ATM). And the gas in our bodies goes from being 1/3rd of its volume in the surface to 1/4th , the need to compensate is not nearly as great and it doesn't affect your floatability nearly as much. Anything that is not a gas doesn't get compressed and so doesn't care about the pressure</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is why the last part of surfacing is the most dangerous for lung injury.</p>
<p>As you said, going from 30m to 20m only lets the air in your lungs expand by around 30%.  Going from 10m to 0m lets it double in volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are scuba diving, the regulator pushes the air into your lungs at the same pressure as the water around you.  There is no pressure difference, so you wouldn't feel abnormal.</p>
<p>When you are free diving, that's when you would feel the pressure.</p></div>		</li>
