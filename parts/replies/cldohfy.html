			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be possible to include links to the publications in the References section? Considering it's a digital publication, it makes sense to have a link to any publication you're going to reference (e.g. by doi). Much more useful than page numbers etc!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you thought about adding a TL;DR and an ELI5 for each page?  You could even crowd-source those as well.<br />
I could see that making it super accessible to everyone. </p>
<p>You could work backwards from TL;DR -&gt; ELI5 -&gt; Content -&gt; Scientific Sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think the content is a little too brief.  Plenty of the comment go into greater depth and it's sort of an arbitrary collection of only a couple top comments. :(</p>
<p>Not really a fulfilling read for someone in science.  I feel like the next version on oceans of the solar system should have vastly more content.</p></div>		</li>
