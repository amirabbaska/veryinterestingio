<p>The media is driving a stupid frenzy over this horseshit, so old people are afraid of them &quot;hackers&quot; with their new 1080p gopros attached to an easy to get drone.</p>

<p>Sometimes. But folks gotta stop screwing with the forest fire fighters. Seriously. Go get your red card and then decide how risky operating a craft there is. Yeah yeah FAA regs etc... The media frenzy is over the people who don't. This is why we can't have nice things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres certainly hyperbole but I've also seen people behaving terribly with their $100 quadcopters.  I saw one flying over a freeway in Seattle about a month ago, (highway 99 on queen anne if anyone is interested).  If it had crashed it could have caused a major accident.  The tech isn't scary; people who don't take the tech seriously are.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Honestly... I'd be scared shitless of a quadcopter being flown by a 13 year old... Until I knew the kid was a competent pilot.</p>
<p>I've logged maybe 1000 hours flying my drones, and I know enough to not fully trust anyone flying one, let alone a kid who most likely doesn't have a ton of hours logged fine tuning their control just yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fly 1/3rd scale planes and feel the same way. However with the new quads coming out, proto x, nano qx and the like we are seeing a new generation of skilled flyers. They are gaining the skill from video games surprisingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been hit by dozens of those mini quads you mentioned. 75% of the hits were from flyers under 18, and the rest were from first time fliers of all ages. Nothing against kids, I just have learned to not trust them until I've seen them go through a few batteries worth of air time.</p></div>		</li>
