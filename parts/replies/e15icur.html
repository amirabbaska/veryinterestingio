			<div class="markdown"><p>so what happens when an artery is tied off? the heart keeps pumping blood to it, yes? how does that blood go out of the new dead end and back into the circulatory system? sorry if this is a dumb question!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't think of it like a single pipe, think of it like a single pipe with hundreds of offshoots all along the track. Those offshoots go everywhere, around muscle, through muscle, into bone, etc. </p>
<p>When the end of, say, the femoral artery is clamped, the blood just diverts more to those other branches which eventually drain back into small branches off the femoral vein, then back into the main femoral vein and back to the heart.</p>
<p>After time, the body will adjust the vascularature to meet the needs of the tissue. Blood vessels vary widely from person to person because they seem to have a mind of their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well to the naked eye, artery branches seem to go into the tissue and disappear, but they're really just splitting into smaller and smaller branches.  Eventually they get so small that they're about the width of a red blood cell (tiny!) and these areas are called capillaries.  This is the place where the blood does it's work, dropping off oxygen, nutrients, etc, and pickup up waste from the tissues.</p>
<p>After the capillaries, the branches start joining back up together to make bigger and bigger blood vessels (kind of the reverse of the arteries).  This is the start of the veins, which eventually join together to make vessels as big as the arteries, but with the blood moving back to the heart.</p></div>		</li>
