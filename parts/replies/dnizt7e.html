			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple of “birthmarks” and how would it be explained if you started to “grow” more? I have two bigger birthmarks, one on the right side of my chest and one on my right bicep. The size of them would be the same on the end of a screw. Not until recently, smaller ones “grew” underneath them and more in other spots. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Birthmarks” typically mean nevi or moles. These are usually not present at birth and show up over the first ~10-20 years of life. It is normal for people to continue to develop more or them to change slightly until age 30 or 35, at which point they usually start to disappear and people develop solar lentigos and seborheic keratosis (again, normal). It is normal for them to start out flat then to become more raised over time in the case of compound nevi, a very common form of mole. The explanation for why these form is extremely complicated and not completely understood, but UV exposure is thought to be a main cause, along with genetics. If you are really worried I’d schedule an appointment with a doctor, but it is generally considered that the vast majority of small-medium sized nevi that have been present since a relatively young age do not transform into melanoma.</p></div>		</li>
