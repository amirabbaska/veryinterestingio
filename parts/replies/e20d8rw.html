			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I wonder.</p>
<p>I cook a fried egg every morning, and I can say for sure that the higher and firmer the egg, the less likely the yolk is to break open when you flip it. (I am a big fan of the exploding yolk in the middle of a sandwich.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m with you. It really kills my breakfast vibe when a yolk breaks when cooking. If it isn’t a catastrophic failure I sometimes will try to cook it in such a way then even with it broken I still get some runny goodness. </p>
<p>The worst is when the yolk breaks right when you put it in the pan. Then I’ll make that one scrambled and just crack open another. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, even if you eat them raw, any in-egg breakdown is immaterial when it gets broken apart to constituent amino acids in the digestive system. So, the firmness of the yolk or white has no effect on its nutritional value. </p></div>		</li>
