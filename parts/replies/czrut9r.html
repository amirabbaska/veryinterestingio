			<div class="markdown"><p>Balding is a process of hair thinning actually. Hair gets so thin that it can no longer penetrate the skin from the follicle. Bald men still have all their follicles. </p>
<p>Edit: Bald people of reddit. please don't cut tiny holes in your head looking for a thick set of hair hiding under the skin. I am just pointing out the mechanism of balding comes from hair miniaturization, and not shedding. Hair thins until it cannot penetrate the skin, by that point it would be so thin that even if it did you would still look bald. The process continues until the follicle is basically inactive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>MPB:</strong> In most situations balding is caused by a genetic coding for hair follicles that is susceptible to the hormone DHT. Hair follicles susceptible to DHT are coded by a recessive <del>gene</del> allele on the X chromosome. Because it is a recessive <del>gene</del> allele, it is uncommon for women to acquire both XX <del>genes</del> allele that create hair follicles that are susceptible to DHT, also women do not produce as much DHT since it is a sex hormone derived from testosterone. However, men are XY, which means that even if the X <del>gene</del> allele is recessive it will still be produced. DHT susceptible hair follicles shrink-up because of an allergic-like reaction to DHT, causing the hairs to be thinner and grow slower. Eventually the hair follicle shrinks into nothing and disappears altogether. </p>
<p><strong>Nutrition related hair loss:</strong> Hair production is also a low priority for survival compared to growing new skin or maintaining organs and tissues. If a body is low on a particular vitamin or mineral that is necessary for hair, then hair will grow slower or stop depending on the intensity of the deprivation. </p>
<p><strong>Chemo:</strong> In the case of chemotherapy, chemo drugs targets mitosis or cell replacement to target rapidly dividing cancer cells. Hair is grown by quick mitosis, which is why chemotherapy actually makes the hair grow weak and fall out. Fortunately, it does not target the hair follicle which is why chemo patients will usually regrow their hair.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>recessive <del>gene</del> allele</p>
<p>Sorry to nitpick, but this could be potentially confusing. Genes themselves are not recessive or dominant, nor are they features that you do or do not have (barring deletion or chromosomal abnormality). Rather, alleles, or versions of genes, can be recessive or dominant. Everyone has that gene on the X chromosome, but only a male with the recessive allele for that gene would exhibit the phenotype of the recessive allele (generally speaking, for simplicity's sake).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When i pull out my hair there's always this small part at the end, like 2-3 mm, where there's this clear/white stuff around the end of the hair. I always assumed that was like the follicle. What is that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the Outer Root Sheath. </p>
<p>&quot;The outer root sheath (ORS) is an extension of the epidermal basal layer which envelopes the entire hair follicle (HF). In addition, the ORS contains a number of functional compartments: the bulge, which serves as a reservoir for hair stem cells, and the sebaceous gland, responsible for hair lubrication. The upper region of the ORS is a site for attachment of ancestor pili, which are smooth muscles that enable the hair to remain in a vertical position.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bulb at the base of a plucked hair is made of connective tissue and the root sheath. It holds the hair in place, but it isn't the entire follicle. There are stem cells in the follicle that can regenerate everything needed to make a new hair.</p></div>		</li>
