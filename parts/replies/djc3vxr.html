			<div class="markdown"><p>Telecom guy here,   most of the issues finding scammers are due to spoofing and the decades old switches multiplexers and other equipment.   As the big carriers switch to voip products it will be easier to track.   But for now some of this equipment lacks the ability to store information for long.   Spoofing is where the caller sends a false DID number and or name.   For now during a call the only thing the end caller receives is what is sent not other network info.   The carriers have tables of what protocols and parameters that the other phone networks are speaking but that info isn't passed on to the customer.  And even if it was the equipment wouldn't know what to do with it.  The guy who was able to busy out the scam call center got lucky and the morons sent a real phone number.   Also there are privacy issues with allowing the government to track every call.   And most of the equipment doesn't store or even track connection info. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had something like this happen just a few days ago. I was in a meeting so I sent an unknown number to voicemail and a text that said something to the effect of 'I can't talk, text me' (love that feature in Android BTW). A few minutes later the <em>actual</em> owner of the number the texted me back saying they had no idea why I was texting them. Fairly sure the fake caller wasn't  a scam but rather one of the almost-as-annoying call center head hunters. </p>
<p>I knew the old switches were spoofable, I figured that had been fixed by now, though. It's been that way for decades. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only can you spoof numbers, you need to be able to.  </p>
<p>If you call an 800 number to buy something or get a service or repair and then they need to call you back, they do not want the caller ID to show up as one of the 150 DIDs that they own for outgoing calls. They, and you want that 800 number to show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a police station and we had someone walk in saying that they were called from our number telling him that had to turn himself in for tax fraud.
Nobody had called him from the station but someone spoofed their number to make it seem like it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why isn't there a universal #123 number we can dial after getting a spam or unwanted call. That would allow the telcos to log and possibly investigate mass spammers. There should also be a registry of users who have a legitimate reason to spoof their caller ID and ban all others from spoofing. If the telcos were fined for every bogus call they might have an incentive to fix it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cop here. </p>
<p>When we get these kinds of calls, most people either: don't really wanna talk to us, they just wanna report it, OR, we take a police report and then it's just documented.  </p>
<p>As the guy above stated, usually they originate from somewhere that's not our jurisdiction.  But also, we just don't have the resources or ability to track this stuff. Not every department is Chicago PD or NYPD with large departments dedicated to different kinds of crimes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What bother's me is that awhile back somebody was spoofing my number to make calls to people with similar phone numbers, the idea being that you're more likely to pick up a call if the number looks familiar. I probably got between 20 and 30 callbacks a day for two weeks straight. Most of the people who left a message just wanted to make sure it wasn't something important, but a handful were really upset and threatening to call the police. I made it a point to send out a text to the ones that left me messages explaining that the calls were not coming from my phone and that the number that was appearing as a callback was spoofed. Nothing ever came of it and eventually it stopped, but I always dreaded having to deal with some sort of legal hassle if people started reporting my personal number as a scam telemarketer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah that's shitty, I'd hope if they were to actually investigate that you'd be able to just show your call records and have that be the end of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be hard to say, I'm not privy to the financial information of the department, but we do have our own unit who's primary function is to get drugs, mostly heroin/meth/prescription.  </p>
<p>And actually our department is one of an increasing number who is attempting to help addicts by getting them into treatment rather than arresting them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue I see most often is I'm getting spam calls from people who are &quot;appearing&quot; to be from my area code but if I were to call the number back, then some normal person picks up their phone very confused to be getting a call from a stranger. Then I tell them I just recieved a call from this number that was spam advertising or whatever and they get really concerned but I don't understand how to help myself lr them because the number is legitimate and in use so I can't really report it as a spam number.</p></div>		</li>
