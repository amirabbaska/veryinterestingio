			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, mate. I was wondering, what's the speed of gravity waves? I mean, we observed black holes melting themselves x billions light years away: it happened x billions years ago, isn't it? We detected gravity waves some time after we saw black holes melting together. Is it right to state that gravity waves are slower than light's? Or they have the same speed but gravity waves &quot;moved&quot; time?</p>
<p>Ok, I suck at physics, and maybe I'm saying a lot of stupid things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational waves move at the speed of light, so we would &quot;see&quot; them at the same time as LIGO detects them - in both cases, about a billion years after the event, because it's a billion light years away. But this black hole collision is so small and distant that we wouldn't be able to see the light from the event with our current instruments anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is that they travel at the speed of light? If gravitational waves are a completely different entity, what's up with the coincidence that they have the same speed as light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You asked this some days ago, but I would like to point out that the &quot;speed of light&quot; is the &quot;speed of information&quot;.</p>
<p>Everything that travels, that we CAN figure something from it (example: from gravity waves we knwo two black holes collided), default to travel at the speed of light, or slower (if something interferes with it).</p>
<p>So gravity (let us now masses, and their location), light (let us see), magnetic force (let us know there is something magnetic, and its location), mechanic vibration (sound), heat, and so on, always travel at &quot;light speed&quot; or slower.</p>
<p>If we ever discover a even newer way to detect things, maybe a new thing that is not light, neither gravity, neither magnetism, it will still travel at light speed (or slower if something interferes with it).</p>
<p>This is related to &quot;causality&quot;, because physical objects can't go faster than light speed, the fact that information is faster than any object, means that object affecting each other (ie: sending some information, for example the Sun &quot;sending gravity&quot; to the Earth and pulling the earth), will always happen before the effect, ie: cause happens before effect.</p>
<p>If somehow for example you could go faster than &quot;speed of light&quot;, you would be able to time travel (example: since gravity moves at speed of light, if you could pick-up a black hole, and launch it faster than light to some other location, in the new location it would get affected by the gravity of the old location, thus causing effects on itself, thus this is time travel).</p>
<p>Now a simple example using light: you have a computer that only turns on if you hit it with a laser (ie: like any fiber optic machine of today), also when it turns on, it also emits a laser.</p>
<p>If you could move it faster than light, and you stumbled on the computer while it is already emitting a laser for &quot;some reason&quot;, you could surpass its own laser, and make the laser activate itself, after doing this, you find the &quot;reason&quot; that it was emitting a laser in first place, is the action you just did, thus what you did now, made the computer turn on in the past...</p>
<p>Since this obviously makes no sense, we consider it to be impossible, thus why &quot;speed of light&quot; is tied to causality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't really understand how gravity travels. Is it like a sound or light wave? For example, if we have just heard/detected the gravity from the merger of black holes, has that wave effectively passed through and around Earth and we'll never detect it again? Is there some resonance to it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a gravity wave, it's not electromagnetic radiation like light, it's just it's own thing that's what makes it so cool, we had no absolute proof that it existed besides theories of it but all of a sudden we detect a huge wave that stretched the entire earth by the size of an atomic nucleus. I know that's really small but it's amazing nonetheless</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, the 'wave' is a fold in spacetime itself.  As I understand it, gravity propagates to infinity, with the effect diminishing with distance.  If this is true, I'd assume that gravity waves do the same.  This implies that both space and time are always bubbling around us from the immense number of these kinds of wave emitting events.  I wonder if the gravity waves could collide and resonate?  I'm imagining rogue gravity waves that are dramatically amplified.   Now that we know we CAN detect them, I'm excited to see the refinement and improvements in our understanding of spacetime and gravity interactions.  Truly fascinating stuff.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would happen to earth if we were to be hit by a much stronger gravity wave that stretches the earth by, say a mile? In other words, how bad to us can a strong gravity wave be? (assuming no other radiations hits us)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but gravitational waves are carried by massless force particles (gravitons), correct? Any massless particle by definition must travel at the speed of light, so waves of gravitational energy being dispersed propagate through space at c, via gravitons.</p>
<p>I would be curious to get a deeper explanation regarding how that is reconciled with Einstein's GR equations regarding the geometry of space-time - or maybe that is the crux of the quantum gravity question; understanding both gravitons and more traditional space-time GR warping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the deal. We don't really know how gravity travels in the way we know how light or sound travels. General relativity explains gravity as a curvature of space-time: shape of the universe. Massive objects alter the shape the shape of space, so that's why the trajectory of other objects and light is altered.</p>
<p>Light exhibits a duality called wave-particle duality, which means that it behaves both as a wave and as a particle (photons). We don't have a particle that mediates gravitational interactions yet (if it exists at all). We have theories of how that would work, though, like string theory.</p>
<p>So, to make it short. We know how gravity behaves thanks to general relativity but we don't know why it behaves like it does, so all we can say is that waves travel as ripples through space-time. Imagine space-time as a lake and that the merger was a drop in the pond. The waves travel as a ripple through space-time like the ripples from the stone would travel through the surface of the lake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll use my bowling ball analogy again because it really helps me. If you placed a few marbles on a trampoline and then placed a bowling ball in the middle, they would all be &quot;attracted&quot; to it right? Well, if there were a ball that were big enough or far enough away to not get sucked in, but still feel the effect of the bowling ball and you then tapped out a signal on the bowling ball, the other affected ball would be able to listen for that over the medium (the trampoline in the analogy... gravity in real life).
So just like you generate audio by using a speaker to shake air or RF by using a coil to &quot;shake&quot; inductance, one could theoretically shake a planet or whatever and then &quot;hear&quot; that across the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a time dependency on this? I mean,  this  signal coming from this particular event passed through earth when it did and it was just a lucky coincidence that we were listening in that moment? If that is true, how could we possibly &quot;listen&quot; for waves originating on the big bang? How will we know when to listen for  those?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what I came here to ask, especially since based on the recording it sounds like a brief blip. </p>
<p>Are these gravity waves regular events and we just now got the ability to detect them, or have we been waiting x number of years to finally pick one up? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They just now increased the sensitivity of the detectors to be able to hear gravity waves.  I'm not sure of the exact timing but they didn't wait long.</p>
<p>As for listening past the big bang, we have the potential now, where before it wasn't even theoretically possible with just light.  Who knows if/when it is actually practical to do so, we don't know if we can push technology that far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(From what I've gathered reading these threads today).</p>
<p>Gravitational waves are dependent on timing. About 6 months ago, the measuring sensitivity of the two LIGO sites in Washington and Louisiana was increased and detected these waves 13 days later. They have detected other instances as well, but are still vetting those and eliminating possible sources of error. Germany/Italy/Japan have less sensitive sites that have not found anything yet, but some of them are being upgraded. </p>
<p>The sites are always listening except for things like maintenance, so it's sort of a sit-back-and-wait event. They work in all directions at once, so no aiming is required like with a telescope. It's nearly impossible to know when to listen because the gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Unless we can look at a system and go &quot;hey, these two stars are about to collide&quot;, there's no way to know of an event ahead of time.</p></div>		</li>
