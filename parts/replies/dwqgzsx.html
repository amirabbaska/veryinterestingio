<p>That sounds like a really slow decay rate, and like it should be impossible to measure. But remember, by way of comparison, that we know that protons have a half-life longer than ~10^34 years. Avagadro's number is large, which means we're watching MANY atoms at once for their decays. The biggest problem is usually not the absolute rarity of the decay by itself (i.e., that you could watch for a year and see none), but the presence of background signals that make it hard to discriminate the decay you are looking for from the rest of the signal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exa is a decimal unit prefix in the metric system denoting 10^18 or 1000000000000000000. It was added as an SI prefix to the International System of Units (SI) in 1975,[1] and has the unit symbol E.</p>

<p>19 exayears = 19 x 10^18 years, or 19 with 18 zeroes after it - 19,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exa- is 10^18</p>
<p>So, an exayear would be 1 followed by 18 zeros. To put the time frame the paper references in context, the observable universe is on the order of 10^10 years old. Another way is that <del>an exayear</del> the time frame discussed is <em>ten billion</em> <strong>billions</strong>. </p></div>		</li>
