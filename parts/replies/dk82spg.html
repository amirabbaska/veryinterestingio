<p>In OPs case, one would assume you don't normally feed young children oysters? Maybe the trained preference didn't stick and then they grew to dislike the flavour? </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wouldn't take it that far. Carrot flavored cereal in milk is not the same as normal flavored cereal in carrot juice. Someone who likes carrots would be much more likely to enjoy the former than the latter. The study (or the results section at least) doesn't mention if the carrot flavored cereal was even accompanied by milk. What I'm getting at is the study doesn't contradict the common knowledge that some foods just go together better than others regardless of if one enjoys the taste of the individual foods. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They compared cereal prepared with water vs. cereal prepared with carrot juice. It wasn't a different cereal. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's worth noting that they're almost certainly referring to baby cereal, which is not the same as breakfast cereal you're used to (unless you're a baby). It's more like a cold porridge, usually made from rice. I also think they compared carrot juice to water, not milk, as babies are not supposed to have cow's milk.</p></div>		</li>
