<p>Though 21 cm is really for <em>atomic</em> hydrogen. We generally detect molecular hydrogen through proxies like CO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you will see people calling them xasers.</p>
<p>As much as people are saying it's just the same thing as a laser at shorter wavelength, there are some substantial differences. Like it's damn hard to make refractive optics (ordinary lenses) for x-rays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might just add that for x-ray energies, the mechanisms for masers and UV/Vis/IR lasers don't really work in exactly the same way. It's certainly still all about exciting electrons and taking their energy, but x-ray lasers take some special work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with smaller transistor has nothing to do with X-ray lasers.  Although Deep UV lithography would be required in such transistors, the central issue is that for your basic MOSFET (the basic unit of a computer, of which their are billion in the CPU you're using right now), the core physical mechanism of how they work is no longer valid as quantum mechanical effects start to swamp their operation.  This issue is essentially fundamental (i.e. a basic fact of physics that can't be engineered around) for MOSFET design, and thus further miniaturization in the short term may be facilitated from a similar but different &quot;basic unit&quot; like FinFETs but in the medium to long term must come from either something very new, like Tunnelling FETs, or something like using MOSFETs but growing vertically to make 3D integrated chips (rather than 2D).</p>
<p>The semiconductor industry actually maintains a &quot;speculative roadmap&quot; of what sizes they intend to reach in each future year, which you can read here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.itrs2.net/itrs-reports.html" target="_blank">http://www.itrs2.net/itrs-reports.html</a></p>
<p>(just press ITRS 2.0 Publication and pick one of the reports).  For example if you look at the executive summary, on page 38:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3jfh5fq634b5yqu/AADYT8V2Nj5bX6C5q764kUg4a?dl=0&preview=0_2015+ITRS+2.0+Executive+Report.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3jfh5fq634b5yqu/AADYT8V2Nj5bX6C5q764kUg4a?dl=0&preview=0_2015+ITRS+2.0+Executive+Report.pdf</a></p>
<p>You'll first notice the row: Logic industry &quot;Node Range&quot; labeling (nm).  Where the quotation marks are theirs, which tells you that these &quot;22nm node&quot; labels are kinda a huge lie, and the numbers are basically made up.  But on top of that, you'll notice that for most of the graph, from about 2024 on, they're basically like: &quot;  <em> shrug </em> we don't know what we're going to do&quot; and either don't fill in anything or just repeat the same numbers over for each column.</p>
<p>They say some vague stuff about &quot;3D regime&quot; but really it means they have no idea what to do next.  In fact it's an even bigger issue because, you might just say: &quot;well they'll just figure out a new device like a TFET&quot;.  But the issue is that TFETs already exist, but to be worthwhile it's not enough that they work, they have to work BETTER than the current state of the art MOSFET before they even get off the ground.  So it's a capitalist case of short term gain destroying the long term, because no one's going to put big money into TFETs until they've been shown to be better than today's MOSFET, but TFETs are never going to improve relative to MOSFETs if money doesn't get put into them.  So basically you have a wall, where incrementally milking performance of working technology at the expense of bringing novel technologies to maturity will leave a huge disconnect when the milking runs out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic physics is the same, but you run into all kinds of practical problems.  A lens or mirror that works for visible light won't work for X-rays, for example.  </p>
<p>There is one fundamental issue that arises in that if I recall correctly, the ratio of spontaneous emission (inefficiency, in this context) to stimulated emission (the SE in laser) increases as something like frequency to the fourth power, and X-ray light is VERY much higher in frequency than visible light.  That MAY only apply to &quot;standard&quot; lasers based on electronic transitions, though - I do not recall where it comes from, just that the ratio is an issue.</p>
<p>I've wondered if it might be possible to build a gamma laser (the difference between gamma and X-ray is more technical than fundamental, having to do with what generates them rather than frequency) based on something like Technetium-99m where you already have the population inversion you need for lasing.  I'm sure it would be a royal pain in the rear to maintain, though.</p></div>		</li>
