			<div class="markdown"><p>Industrial radiographer here!  Surprised to see Geometric unsharpness so far down as this is the single most correct answer here since it directly affects the spatial resolution of a radiograph in much the same way as a camera lens being out of focus.  </p>
<p>Maybe this isn't as much of a factor for the medical people, but I have to calculate Ug factors daily depending on the type of parts that I x-ray.  Having the sharpest possible image is crucial to detecting flaws in welds and castings where acceptability requirements can be in the thousandths of an inch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing I can think of that's truly similar in basic concept is patient movement. Similarly to an exposure in photography, if there's movement during a longer exposure, it will be seen on the image in both modalities. It usually shows up similarly too, almost fuzzy. Either way, the shorter an exposure you use, the less likely that motion will be detected. </p>

<p>It's like radiography, except with light, and you can't see through objects!</p></div>		</li>
