			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you got me curious about what the difference between the gold and silver space blankets was - many of them are actually gold one side, silver the other.</p>
<p>It looks like the mylar has an orange/gold tint to it, so the side that was aluminised shows up as silver, the other side shows the silver layer trough the mylar and has the golden tint.</p>
<p>The direct aluminium side reflects better, so should be put on the side you want to reflect the heat on: inside if you're wrapping up a cold rescue victim, or outside to protect something from a heat source.</p>
<p>Or, as rescue teams put it, 'gold to the cold'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like the concept of aluminising is a common factor, but Mylar wouldn't have much resistance to heat or mechanical damage so I'd expect it to be some other base layer with an aluminium film over the top.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think firefighter turnout gear with a vacuum deposited layer of aluminum on the outer shell (ARFF gear). </p>
<p>The steel mill suits might not always have an insulation layer though, depending on role. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold is a better reflector of heat than silver or aluminium but apparently the gold foil on spacecraft isn't actually coated with gold.</p>
<p>The blankets consist of layers of aluminised Kapton polymer and as I understand it, the thin reflective layer plus the colour of the Kapton is what gives the appearance of gold.  That said, I think gold coated Kapton has been used on occasion in the past.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also known as space blankets...</p>

<p>I was always wondering if making an inflatable &quot;Space Bubble&quot; all around a satellite may be a more efficient way of keeping its internal temperature stable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trouble with that is that satellites are generally up there to have sensors and radio transmitters/receivers on them, so surrounding them in a block-everything blanket would get in the way a bit. The next best thing is to wrap them in foil <em>except</em> for the bits where the antenna/sensor ports are.</p>
<p>Which is pretty much what they do.</p>
<p>They are looking at inflatable structures for habitable space environments though.</p></div>		</li>
