			<div class="markdown"><p>Additional: Eyes first evolved underwater.  Most of the best/most ridiculous optics are in the heads of marine life.  When we crawled out onto land it took a bit to get around the whole &quot;the inside of our eyes is now a completely different medium than the outside'' thing.  A lot of our focusing mechanisms are centered around correcting this, and our waterbound gene-bros (such as the noble mantis shrimp) got way out ahead of us while we were still busy evolving our way into something other than a blurry mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it wasn't for the fact that you'd almost immediately pass out and the fluid in your eyeballs would start to boil? Yes it would be slightly blurrier than usual, but by much less than underwater. The difference between the vacuum-eyeball angle and the air-eyeball angle is almost nil compared to the difference with the water-eyeball angle.</p></div>		</li>
