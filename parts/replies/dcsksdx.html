			<div class="markdown"><p>And as someone older than 30, I will say that the 2-Liter and 3-Liter(It was a different time) soda bottle of the 80s were rounded like a scuba tank and had a separate plastic base glued on so they would sit upright. Presumably that went away so they could save an additional fraction of a cent per container.</p>

<p>The ideal base for a pressurized bottle would be a sphere, however this is not practical for keeping your pop upright</p>

<p>It's worth pointing out that this is how 2-liters used to be made, but then had a plastic &quot;cup&quot; glued on the bottom to keep them upright. Source: I'm old.</p></div>		</li>
