			<div class="markdown"><p>The outcome of cellular damage from ionizing radiation is summed up as 'Good, Bad or Dead'. When the cell reproduces it will either be a good copy(works the same as parent cell), bad copy: could be cancerous or otherwise 'different', or the cell itself dies failing to reproduce. </p>
<p>What the effects to the body are depend on the cells impacted. The reproduction rate of the cell is a serious factor. It's why certain organs are more susceptible to damage than others (Note: your skin is an organ.) Also, it also means that the person's age is a factor, as a younger person's cell development and reproduction rate make them at a higher risk to negative impacts of ionizing radiation exposure.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since 'free-radicals' are confusing to me, I like your answer better.  I would like to emphasize a few points though.</p>
<p>First, radiation vs ionizing radiation.  All energy transference is radiation.  Heat we are all familiar with and it simply increases the energy level of electrons in the valence shell, rarely causing any meaningful changes.  EM/light we are also familiar with and EM can cause immediate affects on a meta-molecular level and occasionally even molecular [microwaves].  </p>
<p>Ionizing radiation comes in in three forms: energy alone, particles flying at insane speeds and particles flying at insane speeds that also contain insane levels of excess energy.  Think of the energy as tidal waves on the beach and particles as base balls hurling at you.</p>
<p>You discussed the affect on molecules, so I don't need to go there.  However I want to point out that our proteins and genes and so on are molecules.  Also, when high energy gamma or alphas hit our extremely heavy and complex living molecules they usually rip them apart.  The excess energy moves around and distributes through those complex molecule chains and they almost never come back together in a healthy, functioning way.</p>
<p>But we have several redemptions.  First, we are made of billions of billions of these molecules so destroying a few doesn't matter.  Second, our bodies have evolved through significant periods of radiation and we have repair mechanism and mechanisms for recognizing and removing malfunctioning pieces.  Third, significant damage typically just kills the cell affected and we have lots of spares.</p>
<p>The problem comes from: </p>
<ul>
<li>Either long periods or insane levels of radiation can overcome the numbers issue.  </li>
<li>Any single strike can produce undesirable changes - like cancer.  Get enough hits and a few might survive.</li>
<li>Absorbtion of emitters into the body often never leave - exposing the body to continuous exposure in small regions of the body, gradually destroying any affected area.</li>
<li>Some cells in the body don't have good repair/replacement systems and any radiation can be devestating - like the brain, heart, lungs, bone marrow or linings of the digestive tract.</li>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Tissues whose cells are replaced very often (like the bone marrow or the stomach lining) are very sensitive to radiation, tissues whose cells aren't replaced (like neurons, or heart muscle cells) are resistant to radiation.</p>
<p>That's because cells are the most sensitive to radiation when they're dividing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, because the more splits, the more flaws?  Interesting.  But if the cells are destroyed and there aren't ready replacements then you have problems as well, right?</p>
<p>So more cancer in high replacement systems and more permanent damage in low replacement systems?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation oncologist here. You can't ignore free radicals, unfortunately. Most (at least 60%, probably closer to 80%) of the DNA double-strand break damage caused by ionizing radiation is due to free-radical interaction with DNA. Think of it this way: ionizing radiation --&gt; kicks an electron off a water molecule, causing an unstable hydroxyl radical --&gt; this unstable chemical group attacks DNA molecules, causing strand breaks, etc. This all happens VERY, VERY quickly, at VERY short distances. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard descriptions like that before.  But if we ignore beta and alpha and just talk gamma, then it throws a few thousand electrons off of their atoms, but those electrons are dancing around and being exchanged with their bonded atoms.  Wouldn't there just be a short term charge that quickly gets rebalanced as the electrons find balance?  And some water is + and some is -, so when we knock off an electron what does that mean?  Thanks,</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true for low LET (linear energy transfer) radiation. However for high LET radiation such as neutrons and protons, most of the damage is caused by direct action. This means for high LET radiation direct hits on DNA, proteins, and other important structures are the main cause of the damage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that this fact alone can already give you a hint about the biological mechanism of radioactivity: it is simply a mess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so would it be at all accurate to say that radiation causes cellular entropy (or chaos)? As a kind of semi-layman explanation of what happens?</p></div>		</li>
