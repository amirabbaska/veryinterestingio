			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a huge contributing factor to PTSD, even with extensive training it's almost impossible to be the same after deployment to a warzone. You don't even have to be shot at or see any actual combat, just the thought lingering in the back of your mind is enough to completely rewire your brain for years to come. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not military related but can agree with this.</p>
<p>Went through a situation years ago that was intently stressful and have never been the same since, still don't sleep right, have anxiety issues and now see dangers or actions where there is no danger.</p>
<p>In my case it was looking after someone who was hypomanic and having a pseudo psychotic breakdown (or psychosis symptoms but with the knowledge its all in thier head instead of believing its real).</p>
<p>Lasted 4 weeks before I got a rest but I still never fully relax now even years after it.</p>
<p>Wouldn't say its ptsd as such, but that stress changed me a lot in a short time. </p></div>		</li>
