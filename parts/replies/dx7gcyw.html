			<div class="markdown"><p>aside from hydration, you can also tighten your leg and stomach/core muscles to partially relieve the dizziness (from any orthostatic hypotension). i was told it helps force the blood back to your brain, but never researched it. it does work, though. </p>
<p>this technique is also used by fighter pilots (via their suits) to help keep them conscious while doing intense maneuvers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Abdominal binding has been extremely helpful for me. Can be the difference between being stuck on the couch to being able to dance. My orthostatic intolerance is quite severe so whenever I am upright I have presyncope.</p>
<p>For this reason I often wear compressive shapewear and it is super helful when I go out. I also have a russiuan g-suit for bad days at home lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High intake of fluid, salt loading and abdominal binding does wonders. Getting up slowly is also very important. Also strengthening the leg muscles and abdomen are very helpful as the muscles squeezing will help shunt blood back to the head.</p>
<p>Medication wise there are options like midodrine, fludrocortisone and dihydroergotamine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it more like height vs weight ratio? If you're very tall I would think you're less likely to ne overweight due to the sheer amount of food you'd have to eat. So short but skinny will do it too.</p>
<p>I had hypotension a lot before, and was very skinny. Put on some weight and ended up at a BMI of 23 and have zero such issues now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok but why such a specific effect on my hearing? It basically sounds like there's a low pass filter on everything I can hear, and as the headrush fades the cutoff is increased back to normal.</p></div>		</li>
