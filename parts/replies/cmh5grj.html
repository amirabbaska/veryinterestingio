			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of gravity as a series treadmills. As you get closer, the treadmills gets faster. For all objects, gravity gets stronger until you reach there edge. Black holes are the tiniest possible point but contain a ton of mass so you can get as close as you want. Eventually, with a black hole, the pull of the treadmill is faster than light so light moves inwards. This point where light would begin to move backwards appears black.</p>
<p>If the black hole were to disappear, the treadmills would not turn off all at once. The speed at which the treadmills turn off IS the speed of light. So if you were to blink a light at the center of the black hole the instant it disappeared, someone would see the light at the same time they stopped feeling gravity.</p>
<p>Let me know if that didn't make sense,. I am drunk and on my phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is a slope, like a hill you would toboggan on. If the source of the gravity down at the bottom of the hill ceased to exist, the hill would vanish and become level ground. The speed at which the hill vanishes is the &quot;speed of gravity&quot; that they are talking about, and it is the same as the speed of light.</p>
<p>This is separate from the idea that light can't escape a black hole. The hill analogy breaks down here, unless you have a very crazy imagination. A black hole sits at the bottom of a hill so infinitely steep that the hill curls like some sort of weird spirally Night Before Christmas hill. How long would it take to cross an infinitely curly hill? Well, an infinite amount of time. Even at light speed. So even light can't cross the hill around a black hole. Nothing we know of can.</p>
<p>TL;DR - the &quot;speed&quot; of gravity and light being discussed is the speed of changes in gravity and light fields. Light failing to escape black holes is a different topic, as it's caused by the <em>strength</em> of the gravity field, not the <em>speed</em> at which the gravity field changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Einstein was a genius, and his work should be used, but he is not the end all, be all of physics. You read this stuff before you understood it, because you wanted to quote the big headed dude of yore.</p>
<p>Quantum Electrodynamics handles interactions in instantaneous time, not treating time like a dimension in the manifold. You say relativity is for big things, and quantum theory is for small things? Well I say all is not yet brained out in the universe, and dogma is ruining science.</p>
<p>A photon is a mathematical construct, it is the sum of electric field vectors, and it is propagated by the entanglement of one object emitting light with the entire cosmos around it. That energy shakes out locally, because nearby matter is a stable receptor for the kinetic energy that has been scattered among charged mass everywhere.</p>
<p>Believe that last bit or don't, but don't stammer through a paper written by one of the giants and ruin his work by making it scripture.</p></div>		</li>
