			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine who recently died owned 231 doors. His way of saying how many units he owned. With so many properties, squatters are a real issue and he had a system for managing them. I had a detailed conversation with him a few years ago and essentially it worked like this.  </p>
<p>When someone moved into the property by trespassing or stopped paying rent or got left in the unit by the rent payer he had a couple of guys who would stake out the property. They would enter when the person left, remove everything they owned and usually just dispose of it.  Sometimes they would move in with a prepared set of furniture. This was to make it seem like they lived there now.  They would change locks immediately too. </p>
<p>Sometimes they would use physical intimidation. He did not say they would assault anyone, but he gave me a knowing look and said, &quot;They can be really unfriendly.&quot;  I met them and they were ex-cons who looked the role. They were very friendly with me, but I could imagine them being very persuasive with trespassers. </p>
<p>He said he had no mercy for &quot;squatters.&quot; By this he meant people who broke into an empty property and tried to establish tenancy  by using grey areas of the law.  It sounded like the eviction team would throw them and their stuff out the door. </p>
<p>He also had a construction crew who would sometimes descend on a property after the guys moved someone out.  They would immediately start turning the place over to start renting it.  </p>
<p>He never did this with his more pricey properties, he would go through a formal eviction process with that.  He had  a bit of slumlord in him, and he owned properties in 5 states and over 50 years so the properties would become more and less valuable over time.  He owned a trailer park in Arizona that was really profitable, but required a lot of thug management. </p>
<p>He died of a massive heart attack 2 weeks ago. I miss him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A coworker of mine has quite a few rental properties. He ran into a squatters right issue he did not see coming. </p>
<p>He signs a lease with a guy. Guy moves in, pays rent and all is fine. Several months later his girlfriend moves in, does not let him know and she does not sign the lease. </p>
<p>Couple of months later they get into a domestic dispute. Court orders guy not to come back to the house, so he has to move out. Girl does not, and stops paying rent. The landlord goes to the sheriff and asks if he can go and remove her. Sheriff explains that although she didn't sign a lease, she established residency and so he has to go through a formal eviction. She had squatters rights. </p>
<p>Just an anecdote on how this can be applied outside of just people occupying abandoned property. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard a similar story from a family member.</p>
<p>As he was going through court he found out that the woman has done this repeatedly. Find a dude with an apartment, shack up, get in an argument, call cops, he gets kicked out, she's not on the lease no one pays rent, wait for eviction, when it looks like landlord is about to win, find a new man.</p>
<p>You can't do any diligence on whether to rent to her. You have to rely on your tenant not shacking up with crazy.</p>
<p>I presume this is why most leases I've ever seen say &quot;adults can't be here longer than x days without being on the lease&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered about the legality of that.  Like, if my parents come to visit for 2 weeks then too bad landlord.  Is there precedence saying it's actually been upheld in court?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She didn't have squatters rights, she had tenants rights. They are there to protect people from being taking advantage of or being made homeless. They usually favor the tenant because society would rather have a few squatters than have landlords widespread who can take advantage of tenants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This response is perfect.</p>
<p>I just wanted to apply a bonus fact that i learned from experience, in Michigan, I'm not positive it applies everywhere else, but i assume so: </p>
<p>You can't be denied access to your own place of residence. So if you have some sort of proof of residence but you are somehow blocked from entering the residence (locks changed etc) you can do nearly whatever it takes to enter the residence... That could mean breaking windows, doors, locks etc... Basically the only thing you can't do is harm someone else in the process.</p>
<p>Granted, they might still be able to sue for property damages, but you won't be subject to criminal charges.</p>
<p>Source: my ex was nuts, her mom changed the locks. She was trying to break the lock on the door. Mom called the cops. Cops cited this law... My ex then broke a window and crawled inside. Cops stood there until the yelling stopped, then left.</p>
<p>Edit: typos</p></div>		</li>
