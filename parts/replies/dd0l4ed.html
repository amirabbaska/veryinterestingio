<p>Many of the answers in the thread are correct, but one of the big reasons everyone is missing is the fire rating of drywall. Drywall is made of gypsum, a hydrated form of calcium sulfate. When the gypsum is exposed to heat, the crystalline water begins to calcine off. This reaction consumes a TON of energy, and prevents fire from spreading across the sheet for considerable time. You can aim a flamethrower at one side of a typical 1/2&quot; sheet of drywall, and the opposite side of the sheet won't rise above 220F for about 30 mins. Hopefully the fire department has arrived by then. </p>

<p>Doesn't matter that much. The on average of 15 tons of petroleum products found inside the average house still means we have only about 15 minutes to get water on a working house fire to stand a chance of saving the structure. Add to that the fact that fire tends to get inside the walls through pesky holes like outlets and switches, door and window frames, often renders the fire ratings of drywall useless.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more about saving your life. If you're on the other side of a wall, possibly trapped, you'll want every last second until the FD gets there. There's an inevitably to a fire that loss of property will occur once it's beyond what could be dealt with with just a few extinguishers.</p>
<p>EDIT: People also tend to forget that wood itself is actually self-fireproofing. Once the outside chars, it burns very slowly and sometimes will even smother itself. A large wood beam would actually be better at supporting the structure in a whole-house fire once it has gone for a while, assuming it's oversized properly. Steel softens at low temperatures and I've seen a house fire turn the steel beam in a basement into a U-shape that reaches the ground. I've also seen a similar situation with a Glu-LAM beam (looks like a bunch of 2x's glued together, cause that's basically all it is) where it was oversized 2 inches horizontally and vertically  (up one nominal size horizontally and adding an extra ply vertically) and only the outside 2 inches all around burned before it suffocated the flames. This allowed it, along with the safety factors, to hold up the structure above it, which could have saved someone's life who was trying to get out.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem is that most newer residences I have seen have the engineered wood trusses. Those will fail fast. Plus gusset plates are used on damn near everything these days, so it wouldn't matter what the wood is because the gussets will fail first anyway. Modern construction scares me when it comes to firefighting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drywall has little effect on fire related deaths. It isn't the heat/fire that kills so much as asphyxiation from CO and other deadly gases like hydrogen cyanide. Again, all the holes and seams allow for the gases to easily move from one room to the other. Drywall is far from a monolithic cladding.</p>
<p>Scant comfort to know that the drywall stopped the fire from killing you. When the gases released by combustion had you incapacitated and then dead within a few minutes.</p>
<p>This isn't to say or imply drywall's fire rating doesn't matter. It does have a value, (mostly saving other structures). But it isn't nearly as great in the real world as you might think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, new construction is nearly a death trap. Older homes with plaster and lath walls tend to fair better during a fire than drywall. But quality of construction is more variable in plaster and lath.</p>
<p>Still, such events could nearly be eliminated if all new construction homes would have sprinkler systems installed. There would be an excellent chance that the fire would be extinguished before any threat to life or property was possible.</p></div>		</li>
