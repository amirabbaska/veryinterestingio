			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree and would like to add that, for me anyway, it kept my ego from sabotaging my own sales.  It took me a while to figure this one out myself but after I did my life in retail a 1000 times easier.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I believe product 'A' is superior to product 'B' because of reasons 1, 2, and 3.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The customer believes product 'B' is superior because of... well... nothing.  The customer has no supporting evidence, information, or experience.  None is needed as said customer is a natural born expert in all things.  </p>
</li>
<li>I agree with the customer that product 'B' is the greatest thing ever and product 'A' is total dog shit.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Who am I to tell this person what to think.  They are an adult of sound mind and it's a free country.  If they want to buy product 'B' who am I to say they can not or should not.  The goal is selling the products, not being 'right'.  </p>
<p>As far as OPs question about placating shitty customers with free stuff.  It's 'go away' money.  From a conditioning perspective it does seem to reward and reinforce 'bad' behaviors.  And, could cause a person to feel entitled to rewards they have not 'earned' (purchased).  </p>
<p>But the company does not give two shits about the customer being well adjusted individual.  They want the customer to, in this order;</p>
<ol>
<li>Give them money.</li>
<li>Go away and make room for someone else to give them money.</li>
<li>After they have left convince other people to give them them money.</li>
<li>Not to attempt stopping other people from giving them money.  </li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a customer, I want you to tell me about product 'A', but I don't want you to push it.  I may not be able to elucidate why I want B, but it's going to make me feel better when I buy it.  If your reasoning for 'A' is compelling enough, I might be steered... but we have our suspicions about such steering because we've been burned by other sales people.  I'm not saying <em>you</em> would burn me; but I don't know you from Adam.  I came in with some preconceived notions about B, and your steering is a bird in the bush to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one problem is that you're talking to the customer in features, and customers make decisions based on needs.  It's entirely possible that they aren't telling you what those needs are, but they exist.  You need to offer or explain features in a way that meets their need, and if you can't figure it out then you're performing suboptimally as a salesperson.</p>
<p>The customer has some reason for preferring product B, that product A is inferior in.  Maybe it doesn't look as cool.  Who knows.  It sounds like it's definitely not rooted in the main product features, but that's often the case.  What you need to figure out is why is B so appealing to them, and see if there's a C that delivers that aspect even more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. If your business ardently believes a is better than b the right time to have that fight is when you stock the shelves. </p>
<p>If you don't want to be responsible for selling an inferior product (because you believe it ia SO inferior) then don't even stock it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you recognize this, but it's not just about any kind of objective quality - it's also about intended use.  To stick with the boot analogy from above, the green boots might be awesomely warm and fantastically waterproof and cost $300.  The pink boots might be light, breathable, and cost $150.  </p>
<p>The customer wants to do some light hiking during the summer months only.  A salesperson can <em>offer</em> the green boots using things like &quot;what if you decide to go hiking in the winter?&quot; But if the customer declines and they start <em>pushing</em> those boots based on how the salesperson values them (or more likely the higher commission they receive,) it turns into a shitty situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lost track of how many times a customer straight up told me the price an item rang up for was wrong and made me hold up the line for like 5 minutes while I had to call another employee up to manually walk back to where the customer found the item to explain how the price is actually right. Then they throw a tantrum and ask to see a manager who inevitably will tell me to just give it to them for whatever price they thought it was. But then they change their mind about it because the whole experience &quot;left a bad taste in their mouth&quot;. Then I'd have to cancel the transaction and set aside the item to put back up at the end of my shift. I often stayed past when I was supposed to clock out because some people just pile stuff into their kart without regard to cost and then act surprised when each item rings up as more than they thought so they end up taking out half the shit. Don't even get me started on coupons.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. The reason this phrase is the bane of customer service workers everywhere (and the businesses that employ them) is that it is nearly <em>always</em> misused.  It is an axiom of <strong>economics</strong>, not one of customer service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the bane of customer service in that there are obnoxious customers who quote it at store employees in an attempt to get their own way. And the employees can't really tell them &quot;that's not what the phrase means&quot; or &quot;that doesn't fly here.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
