			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly believe Civ games, fun as they are, actually provide some cultural education to players. </p>
<p>You learn about great rulers, great writers and artists, you unearth ancient artifacts... There are some books that I've read because the snippet from the Great Writer was too good to pass. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow. Two thousands years later, their little love song is still played and still remembered. </p>
<p>Time, perhaps, is not the end that the lovers thought it would be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The strumming and lyrics are certainly from the historic record; but how much embellishment is going on in the singing? And how close are those pronunciations?</p>
<p>The singing here just seems very rich and detailed compared to the simplicity of the strumming.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's a great easter egg, not many will notice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Makes me appreciate the Civ V music suite even more. They have some fantastic music in there arranged by all sorts of composers from different backgrounds. Knowing this makes me appreciate it even more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea it's not an Easter egg. It's just the theme they went with Greece's music. All the music has inspirations somewhere. Bismarck's is titled FÃ¼r Elise, and just an arrangement of the classical piece. </p></div>		</li>
