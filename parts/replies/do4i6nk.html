			<div class="markdown"><p>Over the course of a year C3 will be more productive then. C4 is only better in mid-summer but in the spring C3 plants will grow more and so be further ahead of C4 plants. I'm fairly sure that farmers round you grow wheat rather than corn and this is why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The C4 and C3 terms suggest that there's at least 4 different kinds (C1, 2, 3, 4, maybe there's a C5?) of photosynthesis. What's the difference between these processes? Before today I had no idea there was any variation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because when dosed with CO2 produced from a different O2 isotope then normal CO2, they found the plant did not release that O2 isotope, Where as when it was fed with H20 produced from a different O2 isotope, that isotope was released as O2. </p></div>		</li>
