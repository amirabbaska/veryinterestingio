			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say 'explosion' what do you mean?  Is it just the object disintegrating or is there some sort of 'detonation' for want of a better word?   Also the shock wave - there is no atmosphere so what is being propagated - just the mass from the meteor?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A meteor flying around the solar system has a lot of kinetic energy. When it hits the moon it comes to a stop but that kinetic energy still exists and is effectively redirected back into the meteor. If that energy exceeds the energy binding the meteor together it breaks those bonds, causing it to explode.  It is the same thing that happens to snowballs when you throw them into a wall. </p>
<p>Edit: rephrased a sentence. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The moon actually does have an atmosphere, it is just incredibly thin, but it is there.</p>
<p>Compare Earth's atmosphere at sea level which contains 10 quintillion molecules per cubic centimeter to the moon at the surface which is only 1 million molecules per cubic centimeter.</p></div>		</li>
