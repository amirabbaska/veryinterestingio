			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of problems with how you framed this.</p>
<p>The main problem is that longevity can be adaptive if an animal is fertile throughout its lifespan (and many are). Just by living longer, animals can have more offspring, and by definition a greater fitness.</p>
<p>The reason we don't see more long-lived animals is tied to the rate a which animals die. Every animal is subject to death by accident or predation. This is its extrinsic mortality. Genes which would confer lifespan beyond the expected age of extrinsic mortality are not selected for because the animals die before the gene can confer any advantage.</p>
<p>In fact, the animals that do evolve longer lifespans tend to do so because they have found a way to lower their extrinsic mortality rate (evolving flight, growing larger, evolving to live underground etc.). Now, under these new conditions, there is selective pressure for genes which confer some longevity advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it is possible, but I have a hard time imagining how evolution would select for such traits.</p>
<p>The concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonistic_pleiotropy_hypothesis" target="_blank">antagonistic pleiotropy</a>, however, actually makes the opposite prediction. Namely, genes which are good for you while young, tend to be bad for you when old. The classic example is a gene may make you grow faster/larger young in life (conferring a selective advantage before extrinsic mortality) but may predispose to cancer later in life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two problems with that argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cheaters (those that don't age) gain huge selective advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>Natural selection has no problem working if ancestors are still in the population. If the ancestors become progressively less fit, they will contribute less to the gene pool. The speed at which this would happen depends on environmental factors.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't agree that more offspring from an individual animal has any bearing on fitness. From the perspective of a gene, there is no difference between a single animal producing 100 offspring over 100 years, and 10 generations producing 100 offspring at the end of 100 years.</p>
<p>In fact, the shorter lived animals have the benefit of being younger, replacing the injured, and the opportunity for compound mutation to more quickly produce fitter offspring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read about r/K selection theory (I'm on my phone, otherwise I'd summarize). It gets into the trade off between quality and quantity of offspring, and how environment plays into this tension. Short answer: some conditions favor short reproductive cycles, some favor longer cycles. All else equal, however, I still argue longer reproductive lifespan tends to be more fit than shorter reproductive lifespan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer surprised me.</p>
<p>Your argument is consistent, but is there any direct proof for this?</p>
<p>We are only talking about lifespans on the order of 1000's of years, whereas evolutionary time scales are much much longer, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP has his/her theory a bit backwards. There are plenty of examples of species which evolved longer lives in response to selective pressures. Any time a species finds a way to reduce its extrinsic mortality (the rate at which accidents and predation kill the animal), it faces selective pressure to live longer.</p>
<p>The correct answer to the original question is that extrinsic mortality limits longevity, and therefore genes which would confer a lifespan advantage never have a chance to undergo natural selection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised by that assertion, at least intuitively it doesn't make sense that there will be any reason to evolve longer lifespans for animals than is needed for successful upbringing of new offsprings. Can you point to some examples of this or some literature about this (thats preferably not done on bacteria)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the speed of evolution is related to lifespan. under a certain selective pressure, two animals might take the same number of generations to adapt to it. If one reached maturity after two weeks and the other after two years, the one that takes two years will take fifty times longer to adapt.</p>
<p>This is why mammals survived the extinction of the dinosaurs, we were small and bread fast. They had too long a lifespan to adapt to the huge climate changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's not like things choose how they evolve. If a thousand-year-living animal happened to come into being, natural selection itself would be the only way to kill it off (for the reason that it doesn't favor [good] natural selection). Seems paradoxical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not analogous, though.</p>
<p>The actual way to test this idea would be to allow the reproduction parameter to mutate, representing whether or not individuals are allowed to participate in the next generation, or perhaps die after X rounds to better simulate aging. </p>
<p>It seems likely that long-life would dominate as a strategy in that case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be true in many (if not most) circumstances, but it can't be the full answer to why animals cannot live millennia. If living a very long life were that detrimental, you wouldn't see any organisms with those life spans; however, plenty of trees have incredibly long life spans compared to animals, and they are subject to the exact same evolutionary processes we are. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, yes and no. Trees will be subject to alot of similar evolutionary pressures but the major difference is that once they establish themselves they have far less competition for resources than an animal would have. They collect their energy from sunlight, which actually becomes easier the older and larger they become. This is why in the rainforests trees become so tall and once they reach the canopy and establish themselves they will outcompete any new trees trying to grow beneath them by blocking out the sunlight. A similar thing can be said for their root system, once it is established they are able to drain the resources from a much larger area and outcompete new trees attempting to grow there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The organisms that do live that long tend to be more primitive, like jellyfish.  And they also metamorphose between different forms, in a way that makes them less like what we would think of as being immortality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolutionary convergence can happen. There are lifeforms that have remained relatively unchanged for a very long time, trees, reptiles, and jellyfish come to mind. These species don't need to mutate, because they've more or less perfected their evolutionary niche so their lifespans can start to grow without harming the species ability to adapt.</p></div>		</li>
