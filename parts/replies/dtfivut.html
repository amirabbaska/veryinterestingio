			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Central America for about 3-4 years. It’s pretty common knowledge there, just as the cartels in Mexico are.</p>
<p>There are islands in Honduras famous for having “white lobsters” float us on shore. Large bags of either drugs or money from missed pick up / drop off bouys. The locals all know that if you find one... leave it the fuck alone. You don’t want to deal with the people that show up looking for it. </p>
<p>Go check it out. You’ll be in these small islands like Utila or Guanaja, and run into these guys. They run a little dive shop that takes 20 tourists a month scuba diving, but always seem to have brand new nice clothes, expensive watches, $500 designer sunglasses. </p>
<p>Same story for Panama, Costa Rica, etc. It’s a perfect place for this operation: the San Blas Islands in Panama are a “Comarca”, basically an indigenous controlled area. No Police presence. </p>
<p>The whole Costa Rican, Honduran and Nicaraguan Caribbean coast are remote national parks. From Utila you can get through the Turneffe atoll or Lighthouse reef of Belize basically undetected. There are enough small fishing boats in the area to blend in. Then you make a quick run to Mexico where the big players have those ports under narco control.</p>
<p>A while ago, I was actually in Utila the day they busted a small plane with 150kg of cocaine. It’s was crazy, the tiny island was SWARMING with military. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking from someone who's never travelled to that part of the world but travelled extensively through South-East Asia, this astounds me. </p>
<p>Like, in Thailand if you wandered on a white floating sack of money, you'd know it was from the triads or various gang activity, but you'd still look around the beach to see if anyone saw you and if nobody was there take it back to your hotel. </p>
<p>I once (decade ago) came across a giant suitcase sized gladwrapped cube of weed. My dad thought it was hilarious, mum didn't want to touch it. We ended up dragging it up to the high-tide line and then cut a bit out to &quot;test&quot;. Ended up being shit quality ditchweed. A week later it was still sitting there but was now half-full and half the suburb smelt like MJ as every local kid and adult was blazed AF.</p>
<p>I guess it must be a cultural thing along with a lack of violence thing. Nobody gets their whole family killed over weed in Thailand, they might in the cities like BKK or Chang Mai, but still really respectful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cocaine is also well-suited to this compartmentalization. Making cocaine paste is straightforward and uses common equipment/materials. We're talking &lt;$500 equipment and it can be taught to a 12 year old. These labs can be easily setup among the farmland and convert tons of plant matter into kilos of paste. Even if some of the farmers and transporters get caught the Cartels have a steady supply of paste to buy at an insignificant markup with no real risk. Once the cartel buys the paste they'll bring it to their much larger, much more professional labs and actually make it ready for sale. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How difficult is it to make the paste into powder/market ready? Like is it similarly inexpensive and simple to do or much more complicated expensive? And I know you said the cartel labs are professional/larger but is that due to the work required or just the volume they do/the framework of their infrastructure kind of thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind I have a rudimentary, at best, chemistry education: synthesizing the paste into the sale ready form is a simpler chemical process to accomplish. It can be done by amateurs outside of labs. It's my understanding that &quot;washing&quot; street cocaine to remove impurities is essentially the same process as making paste ready for sale. However cartels can realize massive economies of scale with trained chemical engineers and professionally outfitted/maintained facilities.  The &quot;labs&quot; in the jungle are little more than tarp-roofed, dirt floor pole barns with some barrels, gasoline, and a weed wacker.</p></div>		</li>
