			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, just throwing this out there. I'm sure u just estimated but the atmosphere can only take up space where the water is, the shape of the ocean floor is strange and I'm sure the depth of sea level would not be an equal exchange. If you could some how take the top 10m of water from the ocean and weight it. It would weigh more than the next 10m, So on and so forth, because when you step in the water on the beach it's not a straight drop... at least not right away...</p>
<p>All this just to say if the sea level dropped 1000m, it doesn't necessarily mean the atmosphere dropped 1000m.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes,  but same can be said of the landmasses that the atmosphere currently conforms to. The land isn't universally at sea level,  and there isn't a universal depth of the ocean.   However the ocean covers the majority of the planet,  and on average (probably, didn't actually check) is deeper than the lands of the world are high.</p></div>		</li>
