			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha ha... DW's... I remember when I got my first DVD player in 2001 I made a special trip down there from OKC to get some wares.  The stuff on the Internet just wasn't good at all, just crappy 320x240 WMV files that were impossible to preview, and video cards didn't really give a smooth render.</p>
<p>That was the one and only time I went there.  I recall the register was this silly little platform thing about 3 or 4 feet up in the air, like pharmacists did in the ye olde days, and the DVDs weren't all that great, I think I watched them once.  Pro stuff isn't my thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. In Oklahoma it's against the law to sell porn that shows penetration. If you see any in those stores, they are actually censored or cropped to be more softcore. Christie's Toy Box statewide is the same. Even Pirates is edited. You can get hardcore from the free DVDs in magazines though. Loophole.
The magazine was what you bought and the DVD was free... So you technically didn't buy porn. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In OKC hustler opened a store that has full penetration porn available. Apparently Larry flynt or whoever worked out a deal with lawmakers. It's the only one I know of in the area though.</p></div>		</li>
