<p>The biggest part has been addressed by people already, which is that generators are designed to rotate at specific RPMs. Most generators rotate at 3600 RPM. To convert RPM to Hz, you divide by 60 (at least for a two pole generator, which the majority are) so 3600 directly translates to 60hz. When you drift outside of the frequency bandwidth you are changing the RPMs of the generator which can cause resonance and vibration that damage the turbine blades.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Big generators are certainly not operating at 3600rpm. Your typical diesel generator (2000w through 150kW) is usually a 4 pole machine, thus operating at 1800rpm which is usually right in the power band of the engine.</p>
<p>The 90 year old hydro electric generators I work with (250kVA) are 12 pole machines, meaning they spin at 600rpm, and when I visited the big hydro-electric plant in British Columbia (WAC Bennet), I think their generators are 48 pole, so are spinning at 150rpm. </p>
<p>The rotors on the generators I work with are about 2 feet in diameter, spinning that thing at 3600rpm would probably cause the material to fly apart due to rotational stresses.</p>
<p>The big generators at WAC Bennet are probably 15m in diameter. There is simply no way you could turn them at 3600rpm, the outside edges would be breaking the speed of sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you are absolutely right, I specifically avoided saying that <em>all</em> generators spin at 3600.</p>
<p>I was thinking more along the lines of Natural Gas turbines as they have the largest share of production of energy in the US (roughly 33%), supplanting even coal (at 30%).  Diesel generators on the grid scale are fairly rare (about 0.6%). </p>
