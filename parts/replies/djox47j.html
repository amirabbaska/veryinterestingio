			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a thoroughly corrupt sport, but I don't think that scenario is too common.</p>
<p>I think that the local boxing commission appoints the judges in most cases, but I'm not sure how much influence the promoters or sanctioning bodies have in that process. If there were two judges that had the appearance of being in cahoots, I think it would be pretty easy to figure it out........ And the real crooks behind the scenes are usually pretty good at hiding it.</p>
<p>The worst shit is usually on the lower level, non televised events....... Because those fights are not going to be televised in front of millions of people, and thus won't be scrutinized like a big time boxing match will be. </p>
<p>In the lower levels of boxing, there's usually a guy that's on the way up and a guy that's being paid to pad the up and comers record....... And the young up and comer will almost always be fighting in his hometown, and all of the judges will likely not just be from his hometown but likely also know the young prospect on a personal level....... Combat sports are typically a small circle of people within an area, and everybody knows everybody....... So if you're going into that guys hometown, you're not just fighting him you're fighting the judges, the referee and everybody on that local commission that knows him.</p>
<p>We have a saying here about fighting in someone else's hometown &quot;You need to knock him out just to get a draw &quot;......... And it's not far off from the truth. I have seen some shit. </p>
<p>Sorry for the long winded response :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most famous cases of dishonest scoring. Roy Jones Jr in the South Korean Summer Olympics absolutely dominated his competitor but lost the Gold Medal due to judges who received money to make sure Park won. </p>

<p>Edit: I guess they didn't know for sure if the judges were paid to make sure Park won, but two of them were banned for life from Olympic judging right afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least half of those bouts were fixed. I challenge anyone to watch the Olympic boxing medal bouts from 2016 and explain how the results were arrived at.</p></div>		</li>
