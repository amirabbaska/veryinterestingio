			<div class="markdown"><p>I just finished reading 'How Not To Die' by Michael Greger, and he cited an article stating that something like 97-99% of Americans are potassium deficient. So perhaps you're not deficient to the point that your heart stops, but you may be slightly deficient regardless.</p>
<p>It's actually quite hard to get enough potassium, I find. I tried tracking it one day, and even though I ate bananas, dried apricots, white beans and potatoes I was <em>still</em> slightly under..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Same goes for every other vitamin/mineral. </p>
<p>The &quot;100% DV,&quot; deemed by the FDA, is the minimum the average person needs to <strong>not</strong> be malnourished in that vitamin/mineral. </p>
<p>Being deficient in a vitamin can be bad, most people don't get 100% their DV of potassium every day. It depends. If you go a few weeks without getting 100% DV of vitamin C for example, you'll end up with Scurvy. </p></div>		</li>
