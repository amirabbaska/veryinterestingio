			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. </p>
<p>The latent heat of fusion for 1 kg of water at normal pressures is about 334 kilojoules. This is the energy needed to break up the crystalline structure of ice and rearrange water molecules into a liquid that can spread out on its own.</p>
<p>The energy needed to raise 1 kg of liquid water by 80 Â°C is almost exactly the same amount, differing by only about 0.2%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, for those following along at home, the specific heat of vaporization for water is 2230 kJ/kg.  That's 5 times more than it would take to get it from 0C to 100C.</p>
<p>Or, it takes roughly three times more energy to take 100C water to 100C steam than it does to take 0C ice to 100C water.</p>
<p>Water has a very unusually large ability to absorb heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is remarkably interesting, thank you for sharing!  </p>
<p>I remember in tenth grade applied.... something, science, the teacher made it a point to explain that when boiling water, the water is far hotter than the steam it produces. Of course back then, I was so far into anime I took that as a really cool way of saying &quot;I'm stronger than I look.&quot;  </p>
<p>Where was I going with that? <em>Oh yeah!</em> It truly is super neat knowing the actual numbers and units behind such a phenomenon! I know you likely have many more important things to do, but would you happen to like to share any other fascinating little tidbits?\^_\^</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on this, this is why ice is so effective at cooling down drinks. It's not just that it's cold, the way cool water absorbs heat from your body when you swim. It isn't just heating the ice up. Much of that heat energy is spent just on the state change.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Jesus Christ you guys. THANKS FOR THE FACT, OP.</p></div>		</li>
