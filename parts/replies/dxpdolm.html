			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact that you may already be aware of but didn't mention: Ivermactin at low blood concentrations can not cross the blood/brain barrier found in mammals. This prevents it from interfering with the nervous system of the host, while at the same time being able to disrupt neurologic transmission in parasite cercaria and insects which do not have a closed circulatory system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thank you. That’s a lot of information. When they do test things like antidepressants on animals, how do they know they are effective? Seems like the results are subjective and you can’t just ask the mouse if he’s feeling happier now.  Do they test the amount if seretonin in the brain or their cortisone levels or something like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part the animal tests are simply to make sure the drug doesn't have any horrible side effects. But they can be used to help discover whether something is an antidepressant. You're right, you can't ask a mouse if it's feeling sad. But you can watch the mouse to see if it behaves in an anxious manner.</p>
<p>Scientists who have spent far too much time staring at mice figured out that the mice change their behavior when something scary or stressful happens (such as being roughly handled, or seeing a predator, or smelling a cat, or getting into a fight with another mouse). This change in behavior sometimes persists for a very long time after the stressful situation.</p>
<p>Whether or not this is &quot;mousey depression&quot; (or to be scientifical about it, &quot;murine depression&quot;), is up for debate. But, we can also just give the mice human antidepressant drugs, and watch them relax back to their original behavioral patterns. So for all intents and purposes, we just call this the &quot;mouse model of depression/anxiety&quot;, and some scientists make a career out of scaring the piss out of mice, then giving them drugs to see if they stop being antsy afterwards. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd1825" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd1825</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the model systems for testing “depression” in mice is the hanging tail test- where a normal mouse will struggle for a prolonged period when hung my its tail and can even climb onto the suspension stand to escape hanging. Whereas Drugs treatments or mice with gene knockouts that result in mice struggling less and giving up- are interpreted as depressed.  Models of depression can then be used to screen for interventions.  I’m not an expert on this field, but learned about this technique during my PhD.  I share it for general interest and because i thought it was a funny model system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In short and easy words it’s like this mostly:</p>
<p>Monitor disease -&gt; look for target (receptor, enzyme...) -&gt; design stuff in PC that might work -&gt; make the stuff that might work IRL -&gt; does it work real life to the target?(test it on isolated target in some experiments) -&gt; can I put it in living things without causing harm? -&gt; does it make something in living things? -&gt; and at some point you try it on humans but that’s a long way to go. And an expensive one as well. </p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Find something interesting in clinical trial -&gt; test it further. You can skip a lot of steps by this. A bit like viagra. </p>
<p>To answer your question: you can observe the neurotransmitter movement and calculate there probable positions and patterns on simulations, which is very interesting if you compare not using the drug vs using. But lack of serotonine etc is still a hypothesis as cause of depression I think.
So maybe scientists can create depressive mice by knocking out some genes. But that would be inaccurate imho. Someone knows it better :) just wanted to state an easy to read way of general drug discovery </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that how a lot of drugs are discovered in the beginning? I think its ibuprofen that was being experimented with for something else and they found it helped pain and other things. If I remember correctly (which I may not) they still are 100% sure how it works in the body to do what it does. All they know is that it works. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could mean paracetamol. Ibuprofene is a known mostly unselective COX inhibitor. One knows what it does. Unlike paracetamol where every year someone finds a new mechanism </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup it's paracetamol that nobody really knows about.</p>
<p>It's often said that it would be a prescription only drug if it was discovered today due to how toxic it can be on the liver at higher doses and in overdose, and the fact they're not able to describe how it really works fully.</p></div>		</li>
