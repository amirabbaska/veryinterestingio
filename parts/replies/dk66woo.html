<p>So you're right that there is a huge amount of variation in accents in England. Obvious examples are midland areas, where you might hear more Brummy/Black Country/etc accents, the north where Mancunian, Geordie, Cumbrian, etc can be more common. By the same token there's a lot of variability in West Country accents, where someone from &quot;Brizzle&quot; might sound different from someone from Devon or Exeter.</p>
<p>But then if you spend a significant time in the south (areas like Cambridge, Oxford, Greater London, Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorset...) you tend to find quite a lot of RP accents, and that's not just down to &quot;schooling&quot;, although that can be a big factor in some cases.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Home counties accents are not RP. RP was the classic BBC World service accent and derives from accents of the East Midlands. It is/was often taught as a 2nd learnt accent in public schools hence why you'll come across it in the home counties but it is still quite rare with no more than 3% of the population using the accent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the first time I've heard RP linked to the east midlands.  Have you got a source for this?  I can't see a connection between RP and the accents of 'Notnum', 'Lestuh', and 'Dahbi'.  </p>
<p>Edit: wikipedia backs you up but I'm still not sure I believe it.  I've spent my whole life in the East Midlands and would never have made this connection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that respect it's much like the Midwestern accent in the US, which got accepted as the current Standard American, even though it's local to only a few states.  </p>
<p>In the Southern US, the high class accent is not midwestern, but a clearer variant on the general Southern accent (think of what Scarlett O'Hara used, or Jeff Sessions if you've been hearing him on TV lately.)  That's opposed to the rural or &quot;country&quot; southern accent, which has a strong lisp and deeper intonations in some areas instead of the musical lilt associated with the higher Southern US accent. Both accents put the emphasis on different syllables than the Midwestern accents and elongate the vowels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The posher half of BBC news are modern RP (not stereotypical RP like the Queen). The other half are from a definable accent as listen above or fitting into the general south accent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends how you define RP - sometimes people use it to describe the fancy 'posh' accent, other times people just use it to describe a standard 'neutral' southern accent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not exactly. If we are discussing the introduction of any European language into an area of the Americas that now lies within the modern political borders of the United States of America, the first European language would be Spanish not English.</p></div>		</li>
