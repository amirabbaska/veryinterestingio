			<div class="markdown"><p>Chlorine needs to be added to pools constantly, at a slow rate, to keep up with the evaporation as well as the chlorine that is &quot;used up&quot; or bound with the gross things, and later filtered out.<br />
If it isn't added fast enough, bacteria will grow and thrive. Resulting in ear infections and other similar stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes little to no sense. I am not quite sure, but chlorine isn't used anymore. Even if it would be used for disinfection, chlorine immediately reacts with anything. In case of water usually a solution of NaOH is used. The formula would be</p>
<p>Cl(lower case2) + 2 NaOH -&gt; NaCl + NaClO + H2O</p>
<p>The only thing which can evaporate here is water. The other components would be left behind, since those are salts. </p>
<p>This method would be tricky, because you use soda lye and also dangerous. I guess they just straight up use sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) which is responsible for the disinfection. Which is also written on the German wiki of sodium hypochlorite. </p>
<p>So I don't know why it could cause infections. But on the wiki is also said, that it's tricky because u need to use a designated amount of it to &quot;kill&quot; what you want to &quot;kill&quot;. Otherwise u can't guarantee a disinfection. U don't know how much u really need and u can't use to much because it's caustic. </p>
<p>From a chemical standpoint this is pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>Source: I study chemistry and I can read.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chlorine is the active agent, but what's added varies by manufacturer. As I mentioned below common commercial pool chlorine is usually a chlorine compound with acids added to it to bring it to an acceptable pH. The reaction of the basic chlorine compound with an acid causes a measured release of Cl2 gas. </p>
<p>It's also important to recognize the differences between outer and middle ear infections. Middle ear infections are common in children and have nothing to do with getting water in the ear. </p></div>		</li>
