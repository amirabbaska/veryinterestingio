			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most correct answer. Thread above mentioned how food poisoning can also be the result of bacteria growing in your stomach. While this <em>can</em> be true, it is far and away not the reason we vomit in the way OP described. Vomiting spaced by an hour is your body making sure that all bacterial toxin has been eliminated from the digestive tract, it is not doing it to get rid of remaining bacterial colonies. In fact, most bacteria that will cause food poisoning aren’t even able to grow in the acidic conditions of our stomach. The symptoms are actually caused by a buildup of toxin secreted from bacteria growing in the food <strong>before</strong> you even eat it. </p>
<p>In the case that bacteria are alive and growing in the tract, our body will produce antibodies against the bacteria. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about norovirus/stomach bug? Vomiting a few times once every hour or so.
And by this logic, would someone get over it faster if they just keep chugging water so our bodies can purge and we don’t have to wait? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drink water yes, but don't <em>chug</em>. You need more than just liquid in the stomach, your body needs the stomach secretions and bile to do its job.</p>
<p>If you chug, you'll puke, but you won't necessarily be helping your body expel the nasties. Just drink slowly and regularly to stay hydrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, in an attempt to hurry along the process and get on with your day, would it be best to immediately fill your stomach up again right after finishing a bout of puking? </p>
<p>Usually on hangover days like that, I don't eat or drink anything for fear of aggrevating the problem and prolonging the misery, but I still end up vomiting and dry heaving once an hour like clockwork for half the day. </p>
<p>But if my body needs me to puke 6 times before it's satisfied, maybe I should try to keep my belly constantly full to induce more frequent vomiting? Get all 6 times finished in two hours, rather than 6 times over the course of 6 hours? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an 11pm to 5am shift at the sink puking last December ( kitchen has room to lay down between sessions) . I drank water after every session of vomiting.  The next day I was no longer nauseous but felt more dehydrated than any time in my life.  I can't imagine how it would have felt without drinking water during the night.  Goddamn hotdogs from convenience stores... Anyway I don't have a point of reference since I never had food poisoning before so, maybe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, on a particularly bad event, I've done this. Vom, feel a bit better, neck pint of water, feel a bit better then start to feel ropey, vom, feel a bit better... More water etc. Usually finally felt better when the bile was eventually puked. Followed by swearing that you'll never drink again :). But by lunchtime (couple of hours after getting up), felt ok(ish). Suspect without the water, would take longer to rinse the stomach out and the whole day would be written off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, fluids will help the process along. Drinking lots of water and gatorade will speed the process up and has the added benefit of keeping you hydrated so you don't cause more problems elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can concur from a recent bout. Thought it was done, it was not. Had some Gatorade for the electrolytes etc etc. Didn't stay down long, came back out in projectile form. But the process was much easier, very little muscle straining. Also instead of tasting of vomit on the way out it tasted like Gatorade, so yay extra benefit.</p></div>		</li>
