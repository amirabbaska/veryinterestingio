They're not protecting us from their germs; essentially they're protecting their hands from germs because many of them rarely change gloves especially if they have a lazy shift manager. </p>
<p>I once saw a worker wipe the sweat from her brow using her gloved hand (the finger side, not the back of her glove) and continue preparing my food. When I asked for her to remake my food because of what I saw, she sighed annoyingly as if she was put out by my request.</p></div>		</li>
