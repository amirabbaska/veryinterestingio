			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure we don't need all that much He-3 for neutron detectors...We're  not going to need this sort of mining setup until we have He-3 fusion reactors that will use it in quantity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, I don't think anyone is proposing space mining for He-3 for neutron detectors.  We have a sorta decent reserve supply, and for the quantities needed for detectors it would probably be more economical to produce it in smaller quantities.</p></div>		</li>
