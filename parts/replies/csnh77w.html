			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, it humbles me a bit from my &quot;I'm so much smarter than those prehistoric idiots who worshiped Zeus&quot; etc.  If I were in an ancient culture and I found that I'd definitely think something like a Cyclops.  It wouldn't even be &quot;made up storytelling&quot; - it'd be damn science to me.  I mean, here's the physical evidence right here. </p>
<p>It's a damn sight more compelling than our modern mythologies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe Old Testament giants like Goliath are recorded as being between 6'6&quot; and 9'6&quot; tall. I would say the more likely explanation is that they were actually giants, and their height got inaccurately translated, or just exaggerated. Doesn't strike me as unbelievable that some dudes the size of Andre the Giant existed and were pretty solid warriors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, the first dinosaur to be studied by natural philosophers was when a bone first assumed to belong to a Roman war elephant was extracted from a quarry in the 17th century.  The fossil has been lost, but drawings of it were detailed enough that modern scientists are pretty certain that the bone was from a Megalosaurus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a lot of old finds were reburied in ancient times with the bones rearranged into more familiar configurations (like a Cyclops out of Mammoth bones)).  some of these were then later found again by later people.  that's a great way to keep a myth alive!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I learned in my Classical Myth class was that the Minotaur myths, also seen as the Cretan Myths, were the Greeks explanation for the ruins of a previous society found on Crete. The Greeks found ruins that had a lot of emphasis on bulls, and city buildings that were built on top of previously destroyed buildings giving it a labyrinth look. Basically because Myths were used commonly to retell history the Greeks created the Cretan myths. It included Greece because they were a powerful society that had to out live others and be part of other society's history. </p></div>		</li>
