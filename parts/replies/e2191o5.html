<p>Set it up so that the steering was reversed. Took the dude a long time to be able to handle it. Also took awhile to adjust back to a normal bike</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trouble with the reverse bicycle is that it inverts the self correcting mechanisms in a bicycle. Its objectively harder to ride when you reverse the steering.  Theres more to keeping a bicycle upright than just intuition. </p></div>		</li>

<p>a guy was able to completely adjust to seeing the world upside-down</p>

<p>I did this years ago in college.  Using a back-to-back prism pair for each eye, hot glued in a plastic mask.  I was bicycling around (off street) a few hours later.  Switching back and forth wasn't a problem.  It felt like the spatial world was only narrowly coupled to visual appearance.  There was a &quot;appearing <em>over there</em> means its <em>that way</em> now&quot; linkage.  Which would start out being very conscious, with a hesitation, but then quickly became automatic, with occasional relapses.  Physical skills mostly seemed to just use the unchanged spatial model.  Hand-eye coordination worked fine once the hand was moving, but would have hesitation and false starts at the beginning of movement - &quot;wait, <em>which</em> way should it start going?&quot;  My now fuzzy recollection is it was fun, but easier than I expected.</p>
<p>Here in the future, with a camera ducttaped to my head-mounted display for pass-through AR, flipping the world is just a CSS <code>transform: scale(-1 1);</code> on the <video>.  Progress! :)</p>
<p>EDIT: Hmm... I hadn't thought to try that... thanks for the idea!</p></div>		</li>
