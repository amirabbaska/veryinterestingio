			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes JW Marriott. For those unfamiliar with it, it's basically a high end Marriott that competes with other hotels chains like Fairmont, St Regis/Ritz Carlton (now that it's all under Marriott anyway), Four Seasons, Park Hyatt, Peninsula, Shangri-La, etc.</p>
<p>Anyway, this particular JW was the JW Marriott Bangkok. The service was top notch but after arriving at 8am on a flight they were able to get my room ready while I ate. I showered immediately but the towels were awfully rough. I only remembered it because the hotel I was at last night had very soft towels and the W isn't even considered that high end. I was just surprised with the soft towels and triple ply toilet paper they offered.</p></div>		</li>
