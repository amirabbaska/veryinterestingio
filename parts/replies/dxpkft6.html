			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, although the headlights are on, the tail-lights are often not on.  I've seen many a car on the freeway at night with no tail-lights.  Designing/manufacturing a vehicle in such a manner should be illegal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my country it became mandatory to drive with lights a couple of years ago. Car-car accidents decreased a bit but car-pedestrian accidents increased (because they of course had no lights and were less visible now compared to vehicles). So they recalled the law. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the model of jetski whether or not the same water being used to cool the engine is shot out the back into the air. Your jetski definitely has a &quot;coolant circuit&quot; though.  </p>
<p>When I worked on them we'd frequently plug the 'pisser' as we called it with some hardening clay and found that on average you got an extra 1mph from having that little bit of extra water to propel you forward. </p></div>		</li>
