			<div class="markdown"><p>The yeast isn't necessary to spoil the honey, just the water. You only add the yeast to control what's growing in your honey; in the case of mead that type of yeast that produces ethanol and doesn't taste bad.  </p>
<p>Like I said if you don't keep your honey <strong>dry</strong>, aka add water, and cool it will spoil.</p></div>		</li>
