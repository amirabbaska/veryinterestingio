			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking the same thing.  The liquid would go up the edges much higher than if it wasn't spinning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further disappoint OP, the liquid doesn't stay together like a gyroscope. Where centrifugal force is equalized by a symmetrical solid object, it will tear a liquid apart as soon as it can. So while your liquid is closer to the rim of the cup and therefore a bit easier to spill, you will also spill more of it should that occur.</p>
<p>Then if you aren't careful to correct it smoothly, it may rebound when destabilized and cause you to spill coffee back and forth a number of times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there were some reason that you'd be setting up a harmonic oscillation with a wave sloshing from side to side, I'd imagine that it'd avoid that.</p>
<p>Guess that's probably not how I actually spill things, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, no. </p>
<p>Because the cup and liquid are not attached, any positive benefits of the liquid swirling would not be transferred in any meaningful capacity to the unattached cup in this scenario. If we had spinning ice it would be a different story. Meanwhile the higher liquid levels, because of centrifugal action pulling liquid to the sides, would decrease the available tipping angle tolerances. </p>
<p>So, not only would it be of no benefit,  it would actively serve against your goal of decreased spill-ability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a better answer than the top voted one which does not consider that the gyroscopic effect works best in rotating rigid bodies. In an open top container with rotating liquid, tipping the cup will cause the liquid to deform rather than transferring the forces across the rest of the material in a way that would resist the tipping motion. </p>
<p>There is some gyroscopic effect because the bottom of the cup prevents deformation of the coffee there, so those forces are directed to the liquid above it, ultimately transferring to the top surface. At the top, the liquid has plenty of space to do as it pleases (spill). If it were sealed tight with no air bubbles, the liquid would have nowhere to go and behave much more like a rigid body, but then spilling would not be a concern.</p>
<p>In the end, any amount of gyroscopic force will not prevent you from tipping the cup and the coffee being pushed up the sides of the cup will increase the risk of spilling.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, if we didn't care about spilling, would the spinning liquid resist cup tipping forces or make it worse overall?</p></div>		</li>
