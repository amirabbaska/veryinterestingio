			<div class="markdown"><p>that being said, it is extremely outdated given MOST of the modern situations that trigger this... it is from our primal days of surviving animals.  Back then it was like, &quot; Oh shit I have to run or fight to survive this.&quot; now it's like, &quot; FML my boss is about to confront me about a poor evaluation&quot;. The primal instincts tell you it's just as serious, but in reality it isn't.  We've not evolved as fast as we've progressed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! I used to have serious anxiety concerning death. In 2013 I was 10 and had it the worst, id wake up and dread death and how there is no consciousness after life etc. Then there's times when I'd think about it as hard as possible such as these, and wouldn't feel at all bad about thinking it, not even slightly. But it does come back sometimes, like last week I had a couple of days when it was really bad, constant anxiety attacks, didn't want to eat, couldn't sleep, constant sleep paralysis.</p>
<p>But the thing is. Is that somehow the things that used to severely scare me don't so much anymore, perhaps it's because I'm older? When I was 10 I was terrified of space and the vast expanse of the universe, and how small we truly are. Now, I embrace it. I guess at the end of the day it's just our experiences interacting with our daily lives. I'm no scientist, just guessing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also think there is nothing wrong with this comment, and I'm sorry people are being mean to you about it. And I'm an old married lady with Life Experience. ;) </p>
<p>Death anxiety is common for people with anxiety problems, so if it does come back or keep bothering you you should reach out for help. But I think occasional existential dread is perfectly normal - the stress response discussed in this thread is designed to keep us alive, but unlike (some?) other animals, we're conscious enough to know we'll eventually fail.  Hence, extended stress response that can keep us up at night. It sounds like you've gained some good perspective on it, though!</p></div>		</li>
