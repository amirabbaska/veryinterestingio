			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgot that one. Especially since often the voice track was separate from the instrumental track you can just re-record whichever was of poor quality instead of having to do everything over again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a source either, but I can tell you there's two separate licenses needed when using music you don't own in a film/tv show. One is for the rights to use the composition of the song, you need this because you can't claim to be the person who wrote the song(unless you did, then you don't need this license). The other is for the recording of the song, because even if you wrote the song somebody or something like a record label might own the recording- they paid for it, it's their's not your's.  </p>
<p>So, you can pay the artist, who owns the rights of the composition a lot of the times(sometimes the record label owns that too, it just depends), then pay to have it rerecorded instead of paying the record label for the original recording. Sometimes it's cheaper to do it that way, so sometimes it's done that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 doesn't include sources largely because that requires a more nuanced answer than an ELI5 answer.</p>
<p>Besides it isn't like anyone else does either (for example the &quot;high quality recording&quot; answer doesn't include one). So go troll someone else.</p>
<p>Cleaning up recordings isn't that rare just go look up remastered Google.</p></div>		</li>
