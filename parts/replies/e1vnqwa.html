<p>DNA does not care about chromosomes like that. Men do not have separate DNA from women.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many situations, virginity and fertility are &quot;soft&quot; correlated. Younger women with higher estrogen levels are more likely to be fertile, but since they're young, they're also more likely to be virgins.</p>
<p>Virginity isn't sought after, since there's no way you can tell if women are virgins. However, correlates to Virginity can be seen, and these correlates are valued by men. It's why some cultures marry off women at 13 years old, but that never happens with men. It's because if your wife is just entering puberty, you can mate guard her until she's at her most fertile, while ensuring that no one else can have her.</p>
<p>These ideas are aren't easy to take, but human evolution isn't a pretty thing. It's ok to aknowledge it and to move away from it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't my take on it. I'm a huge David Buss fan boy, and he's the one that first presented these ideas. I can link you his publications if you'd like. </p>
<p>Edit: I'm a behavioral neuroscientist, and David Buss is an evolutionary psychologist. I read every paper he publishes, and I recommend you guys to do the same. His work on human sexual behavior is just... genius and fascinating</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, for curiosity's sake. It would take a lot to convince me it wasn't about women oppression at first and moved on to general mass control with easy arguments (purity yada yada), but reading more about a subject, whatever sense it makes, never hurts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This and women have a smaller reproductive “window”. A man is capable of impregnating many women into older age, a women cannot have children and the likelihood of complications increase a lot as she ages. So young women maintain the highest sexual value to men.
This also impacted the virgin value of women. Men are essentially in a race to get to youngest women first to ensure she’s likely a virgin. </p></div>		</li>
