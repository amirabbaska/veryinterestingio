			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely no faster than you would in a desert. Human skin is generally very waterproof, and the only way it looses water is through sweat. We also lose water through our lungs (depending on the relative humidity), and that would be unaffected by being buried in salt up to your neck.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be comfortable, what with sweat-brine against your skin, but it wouldn't hurt you like it would with a slug.</p></div>		</li>
