			<div class="markdown"><p>Most often though, the methods you describe are either not feasible or simply wont work.  For example good luck finding the originating IP when someone is spoofing, bouncing off multiple proxies, going in and out of TOR multiple times etc.  Especially if they bounce through machines that are not in your jurisdiction or not in a friendly jurisdiction to your country - you won't be getting usage logs out of them.</p>
<p>A lot of the time the really big busts like Silk Road or Lulzsec etc are actually achieved by social engineering (eg: causing or waiting for someone to fuck up) and/or matching the profile of users you can't identify with other users that you can.  The latter can be one of the easiest ways to find someone, or at least narrow the possible identity of a user down to a small enough number of people who you can then, as law enforcement, raid and seize equipment from to confirm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They found Ross by tracking down an online profile he created with the same email that he used for the Silk Road (I believe).</p>
<p>Also, they use good old fashioned detective work.  They try to find a pattern, look for clues about active hours, accents, language, cultural references, motive, skill level, etc.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah exactly.  And I believe Lulzsec was something like they found one of the guys logging in to a chat room without going through his proxies by mistake.  Then they flipped him to help them find the others for time off his sentence.</p>
<p>A lot of the time it's stuff like this rather than actually trying to trace back through shit or break encryption.  </p>
<p>Put it this way, if someone really knew what they were doing, and never fucked up - they'd be pretty much impossible to find.  But people mostly fuckup at some point.</p></div>		</li>
