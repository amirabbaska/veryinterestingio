			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my guess, as well.</p>
<p>The price of entry in music is small. Anyone can produce a record with their instrument and a laptop. Yes, most wouldn't be as good as mainstream recordings, but some mainstream songs have been recorded cheaply.</p>

<p>The price of completing a film is much higher, even for the known exceptions to that rule. The Blair Witch Project won awards and was shot digitally and cost $60k. The cheapest Oscar winning films are still between a few hundred thousand and a few million.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like you're using conflicting numbers here: the albums released includes every indie album out there, whereas the films released only includes big-time feature films. Correct me if I'm wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you're right, but feature length English-language indie films that have been commercially released are fairly few.  Even if you double or triple the number of films, you're still in the same basic scenario.</p>
<p>This actually calls out something, though.  It's easily possible for a single person to produce a quality album, and it happens all the time.  But a single person making a movie is a near impossibility.  Most movies at least require multiple actors, and seldom do you have people fulfilling multiple disparate roles.  Most movies, even the smallest ones, have dozens of people.  As an example, <em>Clerks</em> was recently brought up somewhere as being made on a tiny budget, but even it has at least a dozen people behind the scenes, not counting its couple dozen <em>on</em> the screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the assessment; I'm just a stats geek who saw a discrepancy in numbers and couldn't stop himself lol. I see no problem with comparing the 15000 to 700 though, which is still a mind-blowing gap.</p>
<p>Edit: used a semi colon. Feel meta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there are anywhere near 100,000 movies released commercially. Like the poster said, the 700 number doesn't include every movie, but it includes the vast majority that would get serious consideration, just like almost every record that gets consideration is on a label, even if it's an independent label. </p>
<p>Some artists release multiple albums per year every year, and there are thousands of moderately well-known artists. The scale is just completely different for film. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly doubt that 100,000 albums even have a shot in Hell of consideration for a Grammy, esp. since of the 75,000 released in 2010, 60,000 sold less than 100 copies.</p>
