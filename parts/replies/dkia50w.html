			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel weird. Everyone says cold showers wake you up, and they do for me...while I'm <em>in</em> the shower. Immediately afterwards I get sleepy. If I use straight hot water the entire time, I feel relaxed/sleepy the entire time. But, if I start hot and gradually turn the water colder and colder, I emerge feeling pretty awake.</p></div>		</li>
