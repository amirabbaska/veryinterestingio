			<div class="markdown"><p>My Samsung has smart network switch, which uses whichever is faster, but it also has &quot;Download Booster&quot; which uses both at the same time.</p>
<p>I don't use smart network switch because I have several devices (e.g. action camera, dash cam, and drone) that connect to my phone via Wi-Fi direct and smart switch will disconnect them because it doesn't detect an internet connection on the wifi network.</p>
<p>But I use download booster fairly often.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a bad experience with this. Wifi assist gets turned on unknowingly or you expect it to use the 3 bar wifi and your get a 90% data usage notice on day 3 of your contract. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ohh yea definitely, this is never a recommended option for people with very limited data packages.(Infact I myself keep it switched off) However, the aim of the question here was  more about: an uninterrupted internet access with the best possible performance</p>
<p>Wifi assist serves that purpose precisely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I block various apps (like YouTube, Netflix) from using cellular data. That way if my wifi got disconnected these apps will not use my data package.</p>
<p>Will Wifi Assist use 4G in apps that I blocked from using cellular data?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not the same thing. It doesn't start taking 'help' from the data package, it switches fully to it until the wifi signal becomes stronger than the data signal, at which point it switches fully back over to that. What OP described is using both wifi and data at the same time to help boost performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When i think of it. Yea you are right. but still turning on that option gives you a better internet experience. Your phone becomes intelligent enough to choose which form of connection will serve the purpose better and then chooses between the two.</p>
<p>If the option is turned off and you are connected to Wifi. Your phone will not use your data package at all. Even if your wifi is not providing you with any internet connectivity, it will keep trying to connect through it, which often becomes annoying. </p></div>		</li>
