<p>The short answer is that an exact differential is the one which, integrated along a path, gives a function which depends only on the path's endpoint (and not the path itself).</p>

<p>I find this to be far more understandable than the original explanation. But then my background is more engineering than pure math/physics.</p></div>		</li>

<p><del>The only gripes I have with that explanation is that that is essentially the definition of a <em>closed</em> differential rather than an <em>exact</em> one. Now, all exact forms are closed, but not necessarily the other way around.</del></p>
<p>Edit: I could be mistaken here. Will edit again when I find out if I messed up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is the definition of an exact differential. A closed one is the one which has a zero exterior derivative. For 1-forms locally the correspondence is obvious and stated above, in higher dimensions this requires more tricky integrals and discussed in the Poincare's lemma.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not quite true: you can check locally whether a given form is <em>closed</em>, not whether it is <em>exact</em>. (A form ω is closed if dω=0.) Now, not all closed 1-forms are exact. But if your space is simply connected (&quot;has no holes&quot;), like ℝ^3 for example, then all closed 1-forms are exact and your statement is correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Locally every closed form is exact. If it isn't then you're not local enough. More precisely, a closed form is exact in any open disk in R^n . Since I don't know OP's background, I have omitted some details. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but being exact is a global property, not a local one. A form that's locally exact need not be exact, and integrals over such a form may depend on the path.</p></div>		</li>
