			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds nasty but is this guys grandpa hauling IC photoetching chemicals to a tire plant back in the day? (If grandpa hauled it today or more recently I suspect he’d be much better informed on <em>exactly</em> what he was hauling.)  Either way, thanks for crossing TMAH off my list of pizza toppings. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HF is also used for etching but primary in the silicon and semi conductor industry. A small drop of that on your skin will kill your bones first and then the rest of you, not to mention the bad contact burns you'd get from the acid. </p>
<p>Dimethylmercury is probably one of the nastiest, a pin drop will fatally poison you and make you go crazy before you die. And the chemical will go right through any kind of latex or rubber PPE. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It wrecks your bones and targets the calcium in your nerve cells, which makes them unable to send any signals. Which of course results in death. That's why a tiny dose can kill you - it very specific.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HF is dangerous, but it's not that lethal. As others said elsewhere in the thread, it takes roughly a handprint-sized area of contact to be lethal, and also, the immediate response would be slathering calcium gluconate. You might not die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People were a lot more secretive. A majority of people working to construct the first H-bomb didn’t know what they were doing. They all had menial tasks that didn’t seem like much alone. Like one guy was waving a device in front of uniforms and keeping track of when it made ticks or not, e.g. a geiger counter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For reference on the manahattan project (not the H-bomb), a quick google search showed that it employed around 130,000 people. </p>
<p>Grqnted, most of those people I'm going to guess were pretty indirectly linked and were closer to factory builders than trucking radioactive materials. Still, I'd go so far as to say that it's almost likely that fewer than 1 percent of those people were actually aware of the project. </p>
<p>Anyhow, that concept kinda bugs me, but I get the idea that nowadays people with a hazmat license are fairly aware of what they are getting into when they are driving across country. I'd hope they did something a little safer than a truck though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use TMAH strippers and developers on a daily basis, and while we're required to wear multiple layers of protective gear while working with it, no one ever told me it was this deadly; they're dilute of course, else they wouldn't really work as a developer because they wouldn't be selective.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they have a whole 2 hour course that you're required to take that explains the deadly properties of hydroflouric acid, which will absolutely kill you if you get your hand dipped in it unless you rinse, treat immediately, and get calcium gluconate injected into your hand and arm and possibly even an IV, and then you're still definitely losing the hand even with prompt and perfect treatment.</p></div>		</li>
