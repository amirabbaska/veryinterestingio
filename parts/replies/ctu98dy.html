			<div class="markdown"><p>Towards the end of the steam car era, after petroleum had pretty much already taken over, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doble_steam_car" target="_blank">a steam car was developed that could be fired up in just a few minutes</a>, and didn't have the problem of building up too much steam and rupturing like the first Stanley Steamers did.</p>
<p>But, even those had some real issues compared with internal combustion.  Imagine what could be done with hydrazine powered flash-stem systems powering an advanced steam turbine driving an efficient modern electric generator in a hybrid?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm sure you know this but for everyone else, the time it takes to bring the steam cycle up to steady state is dependent on the thermal inertia of the components. So a smaller steam cycle would reach steady state sooner.</p></div>		</li>
