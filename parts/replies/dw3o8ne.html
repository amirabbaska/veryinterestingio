			<div class="markdown"><p>They insert the catheter into your urethra (the tube in your dick or vag-adjacent) and then push the catheter in until it reaches your bladder (so that it can drain the urine)</p>
<p>Then they inflate a little balloon on the end of the catheter so that it stays in your bladder instead of sliding out. Here's a diagram that will help:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ballon helps keep the catheter in place in your bladder. </p>
<p>When they insert the catheter, the end of the tubing goes into the bladder. When the nurse finally gets urine after going in, they will insert a small amount more. Then they fill the balloon with saline. </p>
<p>You don’t want to pull it out, because it’ll be like pulling a grape sized ball through your pee hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can say from experience that pulling an IV out can be quite painful. I was being put under for a surgery and hate needles, so my somewhat impaired mind decided that I should yank the needle out of my arm. The nurses weren’t very happy about that one.</p></div>		</li>
