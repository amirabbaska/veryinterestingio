			<div class="markdown"><p>I've met someone who worked on neutrino detector to &quot;spy&quot; nuclear power plant (for example in Iran). The conclusion of her Ph.D work was that it's feasible but only very close to the detector meaning that (again for example the Iranians) could just build nuclear weapons 100 meters away. </p>

In the sense that the &quot;first&quot; iteration of the technology has low resolution, short distance, inefficient energy use/conversion, or some other serious drawback that takes a century of improvements to make viable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is, but the fundamental problem with neutrinos is that we aren't talking about detecting millions of them or even hundreds.  We're talking about detecting one.  Just one single neutrino.  They just don't interact with most matter most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually the main problem is that it was a short distance detector not suitable for the intended application (finding remotely whether a nuclear reactor is used for civil or military appliation).  However, I think the Japanese had a research project in Neutrino physics measuring neutrinos from multiple power-plant with a detector in the middle of the country. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that some countries have seriously investigated using neutrinos to detect nuclear submarines but it's quite likely that acoustic detection is still easier. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that meters or miles?</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for clarifying. I wish Burma, Liberia, and the U.S.would adopt the metric system so we could do away with these problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Questions about that picture:</p>
<p>Since neutrinos are only produced in the core, is that just the core with the wisps some stray fusion in the radiation zone, or is that the whole sun with the wisps being the corona?</p>
<p>And two, how did they focus this, or determine the source direction of a neutrino at all?</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The detector that took that image--Super Kamiokande (super-K for short)--is a water Cerenkov device. It detects neutrinos by imaging the Cerenkov cone produced by the reaction products of the neutrinos. Mostly elastic scattering off of electrons:</p>
<p>Then you reconstruct the direction in which the lepton was moving (which is correlated with but not identical to the direction the neutrino was going). This indirect pointing method accounts for the very poor angular resolution of the image.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That photo actually represents a pretty large chunk of the sky, with much of the neutrinos appearing to come from points other than the sun, because the &quot;lensing&quot; technique was pretty poor.</p></div>		</li>
