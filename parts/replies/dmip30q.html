			<div class="markdown"><p>You're severely underestimating misogyny in conservative Japanese culture - the chances of women succeeding the throne for this generation is literally 0. Even though she is the eldest child, she has a younger brother who is crown prince and HE has a son as well.</p>
<p>The only reason why those conservative idiots are concerned about a woman becoming empress is because the U.K. had this problem several times in the past 2 centuries and changed their rules slowly so that it's now first born child rules, regardless of gender. Such a change is scandalous and horrible - women are weak and not fit to rule.</p>
<p>If the throne had any actual power, it's conceivable that palace intrigue could put her in power. But this is the modern era and palace intrigue is negated by democracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing Princess Mako, the one getting married, with her aunt, the former Princess Nori. Mako is the eldest and has a younger brother who is 10 so he has no children. And he's not the crown prince. The crown prince is Princess Mako's uncle, Prince Naruhito.</p></div>		</li>
