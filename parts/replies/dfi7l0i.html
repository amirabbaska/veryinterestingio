			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Iron fusion is endothermic. It takes more energy to fuse iron than the resulting reaction. Once that happens, fusion stops, the star can no longer hold its structural integrity and everything collapses under its own weight. The entire mass of the star crashing into the core in less than a quarter of a second at 70,000 meters per second is what makes the heavier elements. It's like what we do with particle colliders, just on an insanely massive scale. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they can go a little further until the fraction of fusion of lighter elements cannot support the mass of the star anymore and they die in a blaze of glore a.k.a. supernova</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more specific, the reason this is necessary is because the early universe had no elements heavier than lithium. So heavier elements must have come from a star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, supernovae are not the sole distributor of stellar material into space. Most stars do not die as a supernova, and instead release their material during a late red giant phase (AGB stars). This ejected material is later seen as a planetary nebula. Both supernova remnants (e.g. Crab nebula) and planetary nebulae (e.g. Helix nebula) are responsible for the distribution of material which eventually becomes part of new solar systems (including us).  </p></div>		</li>
