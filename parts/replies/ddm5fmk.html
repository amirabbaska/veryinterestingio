			<div class="markdown"><p>This! Wearing gloves often fosters a false sense of cleanliness in the workers wearing the gloves. In other words, &quot;I'm wearing gloves. I can make this sandwich and also open this cash register and also shake hands with a dog and then make another sandwich and it's all cool cause I'm still wearing gloves and gloves mean that my hands are clean...&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries.  My parents introduced me to it (mine were perpetually dried out as I sanitize and wash my hands nonstop at work) and I haven't found anything that works quite as well.  I'm convinced it's some sort of black magic. </p></div>		</li>
