			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird question, but vaccinating salmon is a fairly of concept anyway - what do you vaccinate them for and where do you vaccinate them (where on their body)?</p>
<p>I feel like I'm going to have several follow-ups, but... It never really dawned on me that fish get vaccinated. Cows, whatever, but fish? Mind blown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Ex heroin addict. We call it registering. Nothing worse then missing and wasting the dope. And if your veins are all shot it can take hours to find a good vein. That’s why people shoot into there neck or dick.  It if you go
I’m on the neck and there is too much air in the gear. Instant brain aneurism. Living like that is hell on earth and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. Glad I got my shit together and got out before fentenal became super popular and started killing people left and right. I take suboxone that drug saved my life. If anyone has any questions about recovery or suboxone is be happy to answer them.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you deal with the suboxone? Do you tamper down? I have friends who got clean with it and are still on it 5 years later, but I absolutly understand how great this tool is for addicts, that being said, it kind of seems just like trading evils. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took suboxone for about a year, ideally it should be used to get off of opiates completely but I know of people who took it for years. The reason why is simple: it's a fucking miracle drug. I am 100% sure I couldn't have kicked heroin without its help or something extreme (like prison).</p>
<p>It doesn't stop mental craving completely although it does help. But it <em>does</em> eliminate all physical symptoms, which is mainly what a lot of people are looking for. I am a weak man, and weak willed. No matter my mental fortitude the physical pain was too much.</p>
<p>Edit: I just want to mention that I had a lot of help, and was very lucky in my circumstances that allowed to beat my addiction. Some of my other friends weren't so lucky, and some of my friends were so wild that any chance at help was a moon shot. I had a loving supporting family, access to mental health professionals and doctors, strict monitoring for over a year, and a heavy jail sentence over my head and becoming a felon if I didn't reform myself. I didn't do it by myself and not many people can kick addiction without help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big difference is that injecting heroin puts users at serious risk of dangerous infections (endocarditis, hiv, hepatitis c, etc.) That risk doesn’t exist with suboxone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to say this. I am over 3 years clean (second time) first one I did subs and still felt like an addict. I had to have it and I worried about it. This second time I did a 3 day detox on them and never looked back. I recommend this. But I’m not a doctor. This is just what worked for me. Subs and methodone are a slippery slope in my opinion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long were you on subuxone for? How hard was it coming off subuxone? How bad were the cravings after you stopped taking subuxone? I took subuxone to get off benzos and completely see why opiates are so addictive. Luckily it made me really sick, so opiates never really got the chance to &quot;take hold&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cravings coming off of it can be pretty rough, I'll be honest. But the year I spent using suboxone allowed me to prepare myself for them, instead of always trying to play catch up with my addiction, I was actually ahead of it and prepared. It's a miracle drug. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been going in my groin for the past 15 years. Because it deep and so fat it doesn't retreat or collapse like surface veins. I van hit it every single time without fail in about 5 seconds.</p>
<p>And i think when people say they see people shooting in their dick its actually the groin they're hitting, it just looks like they're going in they're dick because their hands are down there.</p></div>		</li>
