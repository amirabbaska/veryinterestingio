			<div class="markdown"><p>Ethanol fuels can cause carbureted vehicles to run lean, or in older vehicles cause deterioration of the seals. It has a lower BTU than gasoline. It's a real concern for vintage auto and motorcycle enthusiasts, as many stations are making a switch to E-10 or E-85 blends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sorta.  The gasoline is still exactly the same.  The <em>recipe</em> is what's different, but it doesn't really have much to do with the station.  Keep in mind the below definitely applies to the USA, not sure about Canada (but I'm guessing it's very similar).</p>
<p>When a truck goes to the supplier to receive a load they enter a fuel recipe into the loading system.  For regular gas (N-grade) at Phillips 66 the recipe might be 90% Regular + 10% Ethanol.  Or, it might be 100% Regular.  Or, it might be 80% Sub-N (shitty 85oct gas) plus 10% Premium plus 10% Ethanol.  Or, maybe 90% Sub-N plus 10% Ethanol + octane booster additive.  </p>
<p>There is no such thing as Mid-grade gasoline, only Regular and Premium.  Mid-grade is created by mixing Regular and Premium 50/50 in the truck.  Or, maybe 50% Regular + 40% Premium + 10% Ethanol.  Or, any number of other mixtures. Suppliers will change these recipes every day depending on prices and what's available closest to the delivery destination because they pay by the mile to have it delivered.  </p>
<p>Suppliers are not required to tell anyone how or when they do this as long as the quantity of ethanol is less than 10% and the octane level of the fuel meets the label on the pump handle.  And unless the pump (and it <em>has</em> to be on the pump itself) specifically says that a certain mixture (for example Premium) contains zero ethanol, you can count on it containing up to 10% ethanol at least some of the time, depending on what pricing &amp; availability was that day.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Well something has to be different.</p>
<p>I almost always go to the same gas station to get gas and never had problems. One time I got gas somewhere else and the pump just stopped pumping gas when the tank was only 3/4ths full. I didn't think much of it and went on my way. Months pass by and I'm getting gas at my usual place and everything is fine.</p>
<p>Then again I go to this other gas station and the same problem as before, I only have about a quarter tank of gas yet the pump keeps stopping every half gallon or so. Even if I hold the handle manually without the auto switch thing it keeps shutting off, I can't get the car filled.</p>
<p>I go to my usual gas station and the same problem. I decide to let the tank run almost completely empty and go to my usual gas station and no problems again. Been going to this same gas station ever since and have never had a problem since.</p>
<p>The reason it makes me think it's the gas itself is because when the bad gas station's gas was still in my tank it caused problems at my usual gas station, it wasn't until almost all of that gas was gone until the problem went away. Something in the gas must have been tripping the pump's sensor that tells the pump the gas tank is about to be overfilled and come spilling out. I'm admittedly not an expert in any of this so have no idea how any of this works.</p>
<p>And neither of gas stations are small Mom and Pop shops, they are both large brand names, and I was using the same octane level at both stations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason the pump clicks off us due to a mechanism inside the pump handle, it would work the same with water or any other liquid, doesn't really have to do much with what type or brand of gas.  There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3phjAQZdGg" target="_blank">neat video here of how it works</a></p>
<p>My guess would be they were having pump handle issues, it's pretty common.  There are also a number of additives and recipes that can cause the fuel to foam up more than it usually does, this foam traveling up your filler tube can often trip the sensor and make the handle shut off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with most of what you said, however, I would ask that you not go around telling people that peanut butter is a parity product.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right? I immediately thought of the gross peanut butter we bought recently that seperate into oil and mush when left. Even if you ignore taste and texture and only focus on functionality, it still differs. Spread straight onto your bread vs mix it in the tub and then spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a ton of difference between different Peanut Butters. Definitely not buy the cheapest Peanut Butter because they are all they same.</p>
<p>Even his other examples are false. Nails? There's so many different kinds of nails. Hurricane​ nails, Roofing nails, finishing nails. A lot of nails will fail if used in the wrong application. Gasoline? There's high Octane and ethanol free. Try putting a low Octane gasoline in a performance car and see how that works out for you, and try to put ethanol rich gas in a boat and see how long your motor lasts. Soap? As someone with sensitive skin I cannot use every soap and after trying a bunch I can say some are a lot better than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for nails, sure there are tons of different types meant to be used in different situations but what I think /u/bubonis meant that there are no differences between Company X and Company Y within the same type of nails. i.e. All Hurricane nails are the same no matter which company manufactures them, all Roofing nails are the same, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I would ask that you <em>not</em> ask people to speak untruths because you don't understand the concept at hand. To wit...</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Which has <em>nothing</em> to do with the definition of &quot;peanut butter&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>But as long as they meet the definition of &quot;peanut butter&quot;, they're all the same.</p>
<p>You are correct insofar as peanut butters vary widely in taste, texture, etc. But what you're missing is the fact that none of that matters to the definition of &quot;peanut butter&quot;, which means that none of them are inherently better at being peanut butter. One brand may be smoother than another, another brand may be less oily than another, and another brand may have less salt or sugar than another, but <em>that doesn't make them better</em>. Those are essentially superficial variants of the same product. You <em>can</em> say things like &quot;Jif is the smoothest peanut butter&quot; or &quot;Skippy Super Chunk has the most chopped peanuts of all peanut butters&quot; because (assuming that's all true) you can measure and test those claims empirically. But being the smoothest or chunkiest doesn't make it the <em>best</em> in anything other than the consumer's personal opinion, and that's where parity product marketing comes into play. &quot;Choosy mothers choose Jif because it tastes more like fresh peanuts&quot; is allowed because it's <em>not</em> saying &quot;Jif is the best peanut butter&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
