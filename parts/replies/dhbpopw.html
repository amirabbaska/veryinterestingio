			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct on the first. Insider trading is when some trades securities of a company based on non-public company information. Congress generally doesn't have any more access to that than anyone else.  They do know what laws are coming down the pike, but a) for the most part that's public, and b) even when it's not, that's technically not non-public <strong>company</strong> information.  </p>
<p>You're not correct on the second, though.  To get Obamacare through Congress and take away a GOP talking point, Obamacare specifically out members of Congress and their staff on the exchanges.  They get subsidies equal to the employer portion that they would otherwise get, but they do have to go on the exchanges (or otherwise get insurance, for example through a spouse's employer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they don't have to &quot;go on the exchanges&quot;.  Only those without insurance had to go on the exchange to get insurance.  I have health insurance through the government.  We have &quot;qualifying&quot; health insurance when it comes tax time and have to check the &quot;do you have health insurance that qualifies under the ACA&quot;.  I've never had a &quot;plan&quot; to choose from.  I just have a health insurance plan, simple.  Same with Congress.  They don't have to go on the exchange to get insurance, because they already have insurance.  No, they are not &quot;exempt&quot;, but they are as close to it as possible, as am I.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you a Member of Congress or a member of their personal staff? I am guessing the answer is &quot;no&quot;. Because that group of people do, in fact, purchase their healthcare from the DC Healthlink exchange. It's been that way since 2010. Now, the key difference here is that their employer, the US government, pays the same portion of the premium as they do for all other government employees. But they 100% do buy their healthcare from the exchanges (unless they opt to be covered by their spouses' insurance plans which many of them do). </p>
<p>Edit, here's OPM (the government's HR department) <a href="https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/changes-in-health-coverage/eligibility-enrollment/#url=Members-of-CongressStaff" target="_blank">verifying that fact</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've never had a &quot;plan&quot; to choose from. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm starting to wonder just exactly what you are talking about then. Tricare? Because Federal employees have <a href="https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/plan-information/compare-plans/" target="_blank">dozens of plans to choose from</a>.</p>
<p>If you are on Tricare, you need to understand that for many, this is the Holy Grail of health coverage and is something that they would like to see the entire country switch to (single payer), but that is unlikely to happen in any of our lifetimes. </p>

<p>No. They are literally ON the Obamacare exchanges, unless they opt for coverage through a spouse.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What I was referencing was the discussion prior to the laws passing. When the law was passed it required Congress to be on the exchanges.</p>
<p>Having said that it also furthers my point. Congress is not, and was not ever, exempt from the ACA.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't the issue at hand their exemption from changes introduced by the AHCA, not the existing ACA?  </p>
<p>The fact of the matter in the case of AHCA is that the bill DID exempt members of congress from the effects of the proposed legislation. Where the public seems to be misinformed, however, is why this was done in the first place. It was not a sneaky attempt to screw the citizens while protecting themselves; in fact, it was a specific attempt to evade the bill's blockage in the House under something known as the Byrd Rule.  </p>
<p>To summarize roughly, had they not exempted members of congress according to the Byrd Rule, the bill could have been blocked on technicality. As a result, they included the exemption and followed it up with a separate amendment that would retroactively nullify the initial exemption clause.  </p>
<p>The bottom line is it was included as a tactic to ensure the bill could even make it past a vote in the House.  </p>
<p>edit - AHCA, not ACHA</p></div>		</li>

<p>The reality is that Congress, while passing the AHCA, has exempted themselves from the AHCA stripping their own ACA protections away.</p>
<p>They DO have the ACA, they WILL have the ACA.</p>
<p>And they pushed forward the AHCA - while keeping their ACA benefits</p></div>		</li>

<p>Considering that the amendment which did that was put forward by Sen. Chuck Grassley, who voted against the final passage of the ACA, I don't think that's <em>why</em> that change was made.  I think Grassley saw his amendment as a poison pill that would cause Congress to vote against the ACA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not insider trading. Insider trading is a term that applies to both legal insider trading and illegal insider trading. Technically speaking, any trading of securities by officers of the company is insider trading; those trades are subject to a restricted window and must be disclosed to the SEC. The colloquial definition typically refers to illegal insider trading, and the legal requirements to satisfy illegal insider trading are that the information must be both material and nonpublic. If information is material but public, it is actionable and not illegal to use for trading. Additionally, the recent case law generally requires either a personal benefit or a quid pro quo (I use material and nonpublic information under a confidential relationship to benefit myself, or I give it to someone else to benefit them in return for some benefit to myself).</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, members of Congress do not satisfy the requirements of being &quot;insiders&quot; because they do not have confidential relationships with companies, and while the information they come across might be material, it is <em>not nonpublic.</em> There is a serious legal bar between &quot;difficult to find&quot; and &quot;nonpublic.&quot; &quot;Nonpublic&quot; implies a confidentiality requirement to keep the information private, such as what officers of a corporation might have. They are free to trade on information they come across because it is material but <em>not nonpublic.</em> Let's illustrate this with a few examples.</p>
<p>If an analyst for an investment bank calls an executive at a company and asks specific questions about the company's upcoming earnings, and the executive answers 1) honestly, 2) without suggesting a quid pro quo and 3) without requiring a promise of confidentiality and non-use from the analyst; then the analyst is free to use that data for personal gain, because legally the executive has effectively made this information public. There is a legal grey area of an executive giving information without that requirement, then calling the analyst up and trying to enforce confidentiality <em>after the fact</em>, but that's really an edge case and isn't relevant here.</p>
<p>If I am employed at a semiconductor company and in the course of my professional work I discover that a publicly traded company lost a huge contract, and I lead the way to securing that contract for my company, then 1) it is illegal for me to trade my own company's stock in response (I am an insider and have a confidentiality relationship), but 2) it is perfectly legal for me to short that other company, because I have no confidentiality relationship with them (assuming my employer doesn't restrict this, which they might - read your NDAs carefully.)</p>
<p>If your work involves heading out to solar panel fields to repair them, and you've been all over the country and draw certain well-founded conclusions about the health of a company that manufactures these things, <em>yes</em>, you are allowed to trade on that data legally (again, in the absence of another employment agreement requiring that you do not, which establishes confidentiality). If your company is set to profit from this, <em>no</em>, you can't trade your own company's stock - that generally constitutes illegal inside trading.</p>
<p>If I am sitting in a Starbucks and I overhear two executives who happen to be talking about their companies merging, and this information has not yet been released to the public, I am allowed to trade on this information. The information was obtained in a public setting without a covenant of confidentiality established prior to my discovery. Conversely, if I see them in the Starbucks and bribe them for information, I am not allowed to trade on the information, because I established a quid pro quo with people who <em>do</em> have a confidentiality relationship.</p>
<p>Insider trading is extremely nuanced and extremely widely misunderstood. It is so misunderstood and so nuanced, that Matt Levine (a columnist at Bloomberg who writes &quot;Money Stuff&quot;) has a habit of writing about all the weird developments in insider trading case law and odd edge cases that come up, because they're complex enough to make a frequent appearance in a finance column. The media (as an aggregate group reporting on this subject) has fixated on the idea that Congress is exempt from insider trading, but that is not factual. It doesn't help that there is a strong ideological sentiment against the finance industry which, regardless of whether or not it's well-founded (I'm not going to comment on that), somewhat muddies the water when laypeople are looking for legitimate misconduct; this is especially prevalent when combined with the fact that most people simply don't understand what Wall Street does aside from the odd picture of a bunch of guys yelling in the middle of an exchange floor here and there (it does quite a lot!). As an academic concept in the legal and financial spheres, insider trading and mundane research could be thought of as a Venn diagram with some, but not total (nor even majority) overlap. The public conception of insider trading is that anything you find out in a professional context that, say, your friends and family don't know is illegal to use. This is made worse by the portrayal of insider trading in movies and television - that's absolutely not the case.</p>
<p>The STOCK Act in 2012 actually imposed restrictions on members of Congress that are much stronger than what ordinary citizens are subject to, in that it meant members of Congress couldn't use any information they discover in the process of their work, even if it isn't subject to a confidentiality relationship. That's a much higher standard than traditional insider trading law. As a member of the general public, you are allowed to trade on anything you find out in the course of your work that does not 1) specifically involve the confidential information of your employer, and 2) break a confidentiality agreement with another entity.</p>
<p>I am not making a comment on ethics here, and I think your opinion on the ethics of the matter is fine. But I am making a comment on dialectic <em>precision.</em> Don't dismiss insider trading and the behavior of Congress as the same thing, because that draws a false equivalence that undermines your actual argument. Congress has never been allowed to conduct insider trading, and therefore has never been allowed to do what ordinary citizens cannot (at least in this context, I don't know about others like healthcare). This is a meaningful distinction between the claims, <em>&quot;Congress can legally conduct financial trades that the general public can, but there are adverse incentives and conflicts of interest not ordinarily present when the public does so&quot;</em> and, <em>&quot;Congress can legally conduct financial trades for personal gain that are ordinarily illegal for the general public because they constitute insider trading.&quot;</em> The difference is not one of semantics; not only is only one of these factual, but the set of arguments that would be raised about each is completely different.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the information is &quot;public&quot; because the same executives who would never even answer a phone call from me just so happen to share information legislators who <em>totally</em> won't take that into consideration when passing laws that affect their companies?

<p>CFA Institute Code of Ethics actually addresses this type of situation directly (and other grey-area cases like you mentioned); and I don't think that the interpretation given here is quite right for a few reasons: </p>
<ol>
<li>The topic of the call is material and still considered non-public, even after this call occurs - the information on upcoming earnings would likely move market prices and any reasonable investor would want to know what was said before trading; the earnings haven't been published by the company and aren't considered public because the information was only shared with one person. </li>
<li>Management is typically incentivized to curry favor with analysts in order to get favorable ratings on company stock. They themselves might have options in the company or have a compensation structure that is directly related share price, etc. </li>
<li>Private calls (even conference calls) involving company management and analyst(s) are not considered public because it's an invitation-only situation. If it were a public earnings call, where anyone can call in and listen, I believe that would be different.</li>
</ol>
<p>TL;DR Even if the Ethics guidelines that CFAI lays out for analysts err on the side of caution (for ethics sake, sure; but, also mostly to keep you out of federal prison), I'm still inclined to believe that this would constitute trading on insider information by the analyst because of the materiality and non-public nature of the earnings at the time of the call. </p>
<p>Is it material? No, then proceed. Is it non-public? No, then proceed. If it's yes to both, you shouldn't act on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They get to make the stock trades long before the proposed law is made public.</p>
<p>The congress persons decide to get a certain stock higher valued, so they buy a bunch of stock then set about writing laws that will increase those stocks values, then a year or two later, they present that new law. Even if it's obvious that the law will be advantageous to the stocks they bought a year or two earlier, by the time the law is public, the stock prices will have already gone up.</p>
<p>So by the time you can know about it, it's already too late to make similar valued trades, even if you catch onto it when the law is first made public, you're already buying the stocks at much higher price.</p></div>		</li>
