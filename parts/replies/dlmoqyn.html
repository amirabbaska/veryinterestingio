			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there is a &quot;tuner&quot; out there who can come up with some adjustments but its not something that is relatively known how to do at a dealer level, and really not known to do  by many at all. Really not worth it to be honest. Dealers release flash updates to help assist with it. I know the engine braking in CRV's was so bad people complained of the engine revving high and being stuck in gear, they released a update that pretty much got rid of it so i'd think its possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife and I test drove some cars with CVT and they made her feel car sick and uneasy because it never felt like the car settled into gear.  I imagine it's something you get used to, but we weren't going to take the chance.</p></div>		</li>
