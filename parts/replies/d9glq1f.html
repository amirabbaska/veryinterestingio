			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you store it and transport it? Is it in great demand, like as soon as it's able to be &quot;sold&quot; someone is on a list and waiting for its arrival to maximize its &quot;half life&quot;?</p>
<p>How is it disposed of?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As it is highly radioactive, you need to store it as you would any other radioactive material; i.e. lots and lots of lead lined shielding.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/CfShield.JPG" target="_blank">Here</a> is an image of a 50 ton storage cask that can ship 1 gram of californium.</p>
<p>As so little of it is synthesized per year, I understand that it is sold on demand as it is created. You don't want spare radioactive materials going unused.</p>
<p>Disposal is the same as any other radioactive material, although I am not familiar with the specifics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's amazing how the answers were so similar, but because the other guy posted a couple minutes before yours posted, all of the upvotes are going to him.<br />
Your answer is just as good, and maybe even a little simpler of an explanation with your summary.  Both did a great job, but you get my upvote.  </p></div>		</li>
