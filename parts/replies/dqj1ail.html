			<div class="markdown"><p>Lubricants refinery engineer as well:  I thought I'd add that with today's modern group 3 (or 3+) oils (like Mobil 1 synthetics, Shell PurePlus, or PCLI PURITY) are specifically manufactured by combining blend-stocks of many different components, with different molecular structures, to meet the requirements of the product.  While we hydrotreat the bajesus out of these oils to give them the most oxidation resistance possible, they are still made up of several components acting together to create the properties you want (like say viscosity index).  That means that when the oil eventually does oxidize, it can quickly lose all those wonderful properties we have come to expect from these oils.</p>
<p>Basically, when your high end, zero weight, synthetic begins to oxidize and break down, it loses protection capacity, because now the zero weight oil acts like a zero weight oil at all temperatures due to the oxidation (read destruction) of viscosity modifiers, which basically means it won't lubricate engine components properly across a broad temperature range anymore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: this got some pretty good answers, however I have questions about products such as seafoam for engine flushes as well. How does it affect the oil? How does it affect the health of the engine on a long term scale when oil is serviced every 3000-5000 miles? What is the best oil on the market, particularly for older vehicles (~296,000 miles)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lucas contains very little additives itself so essentially you are diluting the ad pack of the oil you are using by adding it to your oil. As someone mentioned it's pretty much great for an engine on it's last legs it's not meant to be added to a normal healthy engine. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What about those new oils that are changed every 40'000km? (25.000 miles) (ACEA C4 Oils if i remember correctly, for diesel dpf engines) </p>
<p>Is that 'true' and should i follow it, or should i shorten it to 20'000km ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask a stupid question... what has changed in engines that they can go so freaking long without major repairs now.  When I was a kid, 50K miles is time for a repairs.  Now... Im on 300K miles and except for maintenance my car hasn't had any major issues.  Im really amazed and shocked!  These engines work with 1/10000th of an inch tolerances.  How do the metals (even with really good lubricants) not just grind the parts down when you have piston going up and down 3000 times a minute?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technology is to blame which is driven by customer expectation.  As a child of the 80s, I remember the mythical 100,000 mile mark being when you had to buy a new car due to car death or fear of death.  Today, my Subaru sits at 260k miles and I'm driving it 4 hours one way tomorrow with zero fear.  This is actual progress and its a good thing!</p>
<p>As to grinding...that's not really a thing in engines.  If the engine is mechanically sound, at a nano level, 100% of the metal parts are riding on an extremely thin layer of oil so there is no metal on metal wear and what actually happens is film dynamics of metal/oil/metal.  That's an oversimplification, but it gets your mind right.  Tribology is the specific topic if you want to get your mind scrambled.  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't so much about the oil, although oils are far better than they used to be and that's a factor.  One reason is that the surrounding components are so much better and more reliable than they used to be.  Modern fuel injection has far less reliability issues than carburetion.  FI can have problems, but they're not common and they're not inevitable like with a carburetor.  Fuel injection is also much more precise than carburetors (especially over time when the carburetor starts to get out of whack and needs adjusting/cleaning/rebuilding) and that's better for the engine as a whole.  Also, ignition systems are pretty much all solid state now.  Before the 80s, most cars had an ignition system with points in the distributor.  These systems could get finicky pretty quick, and that's where the whole idea of &quot;tune-ups&quot; came into play.  Points had to be adjusted just ever so precisely, and they'd fall out of whack after a while.  In the late 70s/early 80s electronic ignition became common place, so instead of points you would just replace the distributor cap and rotor, but it still needed to be done periodically. It only took minutes - just make sure you label your wires! Now, it's all solid state ignition.  Set and forget. Unless a coil goes bad, you won't have to mess with it for the life of the car. Just change the spark plugs and wires at recommended intervals and you're good.  With fuel injection and current ignition systems, the car's computer can continually monitor and adjust exactly how much fuel is delivered and how the spark is timed.  More efficient, less stress on the engine, and less fuel byproducts that end up in the engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll weigh in here because I like to think about this question quite a bit in relation to other mechanical systems, and because I have a PHD in mechanical engineering. </p>
<p>You asked specifically about engines, so I'll try and limit myself to that. The engine is pretty unique in that some of its components (like the crankshaft and camshaft) experience &quot;completely reversed cyclic loading&quot; - meaning essentially that they spin in one direction - and other components (like the connecting rods) experience cyclic loading that is NOT completely-reversed. </p>
<p>For the first type, Engineers have some tables  about completely-reversed cyclic loading that allow them to design engines to break after a certain number of cycles. They got these tables from running engines in a lab environment until they broke. The reason they can use the tables like this for completely-reversed cyclic loading has to due with how stress and strain work. </p>
<p><strong>Attempt at brief stress/strain explanation</strong>: When you apply stress to something that means you are stretching it (tension) or squishing it (compression). If the stresses are low enough, stretching and squishing over and over again doesnt change the shape of the part - meaning the part is still working. </p>
<p>Completely-reversed just means the stretch and squish have the same MAGNITUDE (Pop, pop!). Because this is easy to replicate in a lab, the tables are really accurate, and engineers can choose how long they want to engine to last. Typically, they will choose the &quot;infinite lifetime&quot; which is a fancy way of saying that the engine will break due to abnormal stress instead of cyclic stress - like hitting a deer. So the engine is good forever because the tables only get better with every data point!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this! I work as a calculation engineer for oil systems in transmissions, but our oil 'expert' is on the brink of retirement and can't explain this properly.</p>
<p>What I don't understand: High viscosity is regarded as benificial to avoid metal-to-metal contact, as far as I know. How come the sludge both increases the viscosity and deteriorates the lubrication ability at the same time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High viscosity and good lubricant aren’t exactly the same thing.  Although oil is designed to mitigate friction between metal surfaces, there is still friction that occurs within the lubricant from the hydrocarbon molecules or chains sliding past each other.  In a new lubricant, these chains should be relatively uniform in size and structure and slide past each other fairly easily.  There’s an optimal viscosity for every application where you have a lubricant thick enough to resist the pressure of the two metal surfaces, but no so thick that you’re wasting a lot of energy making larger hydrocarbon chains slide past each other.  What happens when the lubricant starts to break down is those hydrocarbon chains begin to fracture and the remaining pieces conglomerate together creating sludge.  Sludge gets absorbed back into the lubricant and ruins the uniformity of the hydrocarbon chains in the oil and impeding their ability to move past each other (increasing the viscosity).  The ruined uniformity also reduces how effective the lubricant is.  This is best explained through an analogy.  Imagine you have a bunch of golf balls on the floor and you place a board on top.  The board should slide over the golf balls fairly easily.  Now add a bunch of ping pong balls or baseballs to the mix (sludge),  it becomes much more awkward.</p>
<p>This article does a good job explaining it:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was really well explained, thank you.  Add-on question: does heat damage this process by ruining the hydrocarbon chains, therefor increasing viscosity, or is it more a product of increasing oxidation and just plain breaking down the oil?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main factor is actually film strength. Unlike what this guy says, an engine does not receive lubrication by &quot;splashing&quot; anything. Instead oil is pumped at pressure into bearings and such. The idea is that the oil is continuously flowing through the bearing under pressure and the whatever floats on this film. For example, in your older, sloppier engines you might have .005&quot; of clearance between the big end and the bearings, and you'd need a higher viscosity oil there- in order to keep the oil from flowing out of the bearing too quickly and allowing babbit to start rubbing up on steel. In modern engines you'll see clearances of .001-.003&quot; there and you need a lower viscosity to allow the oil to flow out without oil pressure going through the roof, but the film strength actually needs to be higher. This is because now with your tighter tolerances your film (the oil surface on which the whatever floats) cannot collapse as much without having lubrication failure. Film strength (and I'm a mechanic, not an engineer, so bear with me here) refers to the amount of pressure the oil can take before it is pushed out of the way and you have metal on metal contact. If you've ever placed a cover glass on a slide with water in the sample, you've got a pretty good idea of what this actually looks like. </p></div>		</li>
