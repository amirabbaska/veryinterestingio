<p>And Alabama lost about half the state's crops because there was nobody to pick the crops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue isn't that people don't want to pick the crops.</p>
<p>The issue is that people don't want to pick the crops for the $1-$2/hour the illegal immigrants were making. </p>
<p>Industries being run on essentially slave labor is not a valid reason to allow other laws to be broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I love how people defend illegal immigrant labor with the claim that americans don't want to do the jobs. They want to do them, but they want to make a legal living wage. </p>
<p>This is most often people on the left parroting this idea, the people who say the rich are too rich and there aren't good opportunities for regular americans. I get that they don't want to come across as xenophobic, but illegal labor does have a chilling effect on american wages. That's literally why they are hired, because they will work for a sub-legal amount. Even if an actual citizen was willing to work for that little it wouldn't be legal for the company to pay them that much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's back breaking work. (Source:  picked strawberries in family garden for years.)  No matter how much a farmer could/would pay an American to do the job, I suspect many Americans would be unwilling to do it for very long, if at all.</p>
<p>I think if one wants to bring jobs to Americans, then we should insist that corporations bring jobs back to the US.  It's not Mexicans coming to America for seasonal work that has impacted our middle class; it the trend of outsourcing American jobs to countries where $1-2/day is a fortune.</p>
<p>I actually look for items made in America.  I'm always excited when I actually find something, and often end up paying a few dollars more for the item, but I don't care.  I'll support an industry that is supporting Americans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then let's have an agricultural guest worker program.  Government determines the shortage of how many agricultural workers we need, and then establishes an equivalent number of work visas for these people.  They get to come in, work <strong>legally</strong>, pay taxes, be protected by all our laws, and then go home when the work is over.  </p>
<p>Naturally these visas may only be applied for in the guest worker's home country.  Lots of other countries do this.  It's not innovative.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is a good point the issue isn't really people sneaking over, it's people staying after their visa is expired. All the Mexicans that I know came here because they were running from drug and gang violence.  The older generations miss Mexico and want to go back but the younger ones don't even remember it.</p></div>		</li>
