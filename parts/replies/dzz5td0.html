			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Acacia tree vs giraffes:</p>
<p>The first line of defense for an acacia tree is the fact that it's covered in huge spines.</p>
<p>Giraffes get around this with their massive prehensile tongues, which they can use to avoid spines and still strip leaves.</p>
<p>The next line of defense for the acacia is tannin. Tannin tastes terrible (it's also toxic, and can kill other herbivores), when a tree senses it is under attack, it ramps up production of tannin in order to make it less attractive to eat.</p>
<p>The simple solution to this for the giraffes is just to rotate trees.</p>
<p>Now multiple trees are at risk, the acacia plays its next trick: it communicates with other trees in its vicinity by releasing chemicals into the air (fun fact, the lovely smell of fresh cut grass is also a distress marker). As the trees pick up these chemical markers they all ramp up production of tannin until the threat is gone.</p>
<p>It's at a point where giraffes now need to stalk acacia trees, approaching them only from downwind to avoid the trees that have been alerted.</p>
<p>The acacia has one more trick up its sleeve: Some species have developed heavily modified spines which house aggressive ants. The acacia have developed a symbiotic relationship, feeding the ants on nectar and housing them, in return the ants aggressively defend the tree.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on the top comment, plants can “hear” a caterpillar munching on their leaves and deploy a toxin to ward off the threat. </p>
