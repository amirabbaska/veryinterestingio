			<div class="markdown"><p>Candles are surprisingly complicated from a chemistry perspective. Cande wax isn't just any mix of hydrocarbons, they have to all be saturated, which makes them very unreactive compared to other organic compounds. (I believe their name came from a Greek or Latin phrase, something like &quot;para affinis&quot;, meaning &quot;next to no activity&quot;.) </p>
<p>Saturated hydrocarbons burn cleaner in a candle, because their single bonds can be broken by lower temperatures, meaning that they're less likely to escape a candle flame as carbon particles (soot).* They can be pyrolyzed with a carbon catalyst though, to make a flammable mix of gases. Cellulose string, when burnt, forms a porous mass of carbon at the end that can catalyze this decomposition. It does this when you light a candle, with the flame growing as it liquefies more and more wax. But eventually the catalytic tip is overwhelmed by molten wax and slows down, creating an equilibrium.  If you blow out a candle, you'll often see a glowing bit on the tip that's releasing smoke.  This is the catalytic carbon part of the tip, oxidizing the candle wax into the mix of smaller molecules that are found in smoke.</p>
<p>So, why are some natural oils saturated and some unsaturated, anyway? It all comes down to what temperatures they experience, of all things. Birds and mammals have high enough body temperatures to keep saturated fat from solidifying. Fish, on the other hand, do not. So their fat molecules have kinks in them, in the form of carbon-carbon double bonds, to keep them liquid at cold temperatures. This goes for plants too. Most plants grown in temperate climates have kinks in their fat molecules, to keep them from solidifying. But plants that grow only in tropical climates, like coconuts and other palms, have saturated fat molecules that solidify when they get cold.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why soy candles are able to be solid at room temperature, even though soy grows in temperate climates. Well, that's because soy candles are actually made from &quot;trans fats&quot;, or &quot;hydrogenated fats&quot; like margarine and shortening are made from. These have had the kinks chemically removed from their fat molecules, so they're solid at room temperature. This is supposed to be slightly bad for you if you spend your life eating it, but there's certainly no harm in burning it in a candle.</p>
<p>* Double bonds can release more energy, but also require more activation energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Want to really blow your stack. Sit in a room with very still air. Turn off fans and heaters. Light a candle, wait till it's nice and burning, with a lighter in hand, gently but quickly blow the flame out. There should be a long column of smoke now gently without disturbing the smoke, lower the lit lighter down the line of smoke. At some point depending on the wick material and how hot it burns the heat from the lighter will travel down the smoke, sometimes several inches and light the recently blown out wick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For an insight into what is happening with a lit candle hold a ceramic plate upside down a fair way above the candle. The gases from the candle will cool down as they hit the plate and then move round the side of the plate, as it does this a fair amount of soot will collect on the plate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: This is what the &quot;science&quot; of barbeque and smoking is all about. The fire has to be the right temp to burn the wood just right to make the right kind of smoke. Too hot and there's no smoke. Too cold, and it's bitter. Thin blue smoke and good air flow is what you want.</p>
<p>This is also why if you ever hear someone say they soaked their wood chips, you should immediately punch them in the face. This physical altercation will cause a rift in your relationship, thus preventing you from having to eat their carcinogenic food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Randomly arranging the molecular bonds in food, by grilling it, can theoretically form new carcinogenic compounds.  The danger is minimal, but some people think that certain types of wood and types of wood treatment make a much larger contribution to formed carcinogens than they actually do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Burning wood has a tendency to form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon" target="_blank">polyaromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs</a> in varying configurations.  Basically they're fat soluble so they can pass through your cell membranes easily, and they get turned into gene toxins by your liver.</p>
<p>How your liver works is it contains a bunch of enzymes that add molecules to make it easier for another enzyme to break apart larger ones. You put a little bit of energy to jumpstart a bigger energy breakdown, kinda like the primer in a bullet. The problem with this is your liver enzyme can't actually aim the &quot;bullet&quot; to the next enzyme that's supposed to break it down so the newly created unstable compound has a very small chance to waltz out of the liver and go into your blood and futz around until it reaches another cell's DNA. Or a liver cell's DNA, it doesn't really matter. Either way there's another very small chance that unstable molecule will blow up your DNA in the right spot to give you cancer. Maybe you get even luckier and that spot needs to get blown up twice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those very small chances gets rerolled for every single one of those molecules that got inside of your body over your entire lifespan. If you're lucky the mutation is pretty obvious and your immune system notices and kills the mutant cell. If you're not the mutant cell lives long enough to clone itself, and those clones can get even more mutations(stealth mode, mobility, faster cloning, etc) that turn it into some kind of cancer.</p>
<p>And that's just for PAHs. Think of everything that you've heard of that can cause cancer and this process repeats itself until the mutations get lucky enough to survive and kill you.</p></div>		</li>
