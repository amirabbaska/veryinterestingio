			<div class="markdown"><p>The Slow Mo Guys on YouTube created a video explaining the way screens display images to us and how they use the way our eyes and brain process images to show us movement and color. They use really high speed camera recording equipment to slow down what a screen does to display their images. This is also true for pictures since they capture a split second of what the screen is showing at that moment, they almost never look like what your brain sees because your eyes/brain are looking at a constantly changing image. <a href="https://youtu.be/3BJU2drrtCM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/3BJU2drrtCM</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this imply that an intelligence's perception of the passage of time is directly linked to how many FPS it can perceive?</p>
<p>EDIT: It seems that the answer is yes?

			<div class="markdown"><p>This article is misleading.</p>
<p>What they're talking about is actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold" target="_blank">flicker fusion threshold.</a> However, this doesn't necessarily mean much; it simply is the brain distinguishing between a rapidly flickering light and one that is constantly on.</p>
<p>A human can actually see an image that is flickered on for less than 1/250th of a second, possibly as little as just a single millisecond, and some motion artifacts are visible even at 500 FPS.</p>
<p>But the brain &quot;only&quot; really processes somewhat north of a dozen full images per second, but sort of blends them together, like a short gif or something similar.</p>
<p>All of this doesn't necessarily mean that humans perceive time as being different from flies, though; after all, watching something and only seeing 6 frames out of every 60 doesn't make it run any slower, it just changes the fidelity of motion and of the image.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the screen is made up of one of three very tiny red, green or blue color spots, that end up being similar in size to the red, green, or blue samplers in the camera. That creates moire.</p>
