<p>Or China would ask Australia, who would ask us</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most data is not under the direct control of the US government. Most data is technically under the control of a corporation. If, for example, China wanted to access the contents of a Gmail account owned by an American, they do not request the US government for this information, they request Google for it. If Google then finds that the email data is stored in China, they will likely comply with this request. If the Chinese government decides to go mad and wants to arrest this person, who is currently based in the US, this bill does absolutely nothing regarding extradition, and they would have to go through the normal legal process with the actual US government regarding that.</p>
<p>Let's say, however, that a crime happens in the US, and police obtain a warrant to search a suspect's Outlook account. Microsoft hands over all data stored in their US servers, but actual email contents are stored in Ireland, and they refuse to hand it over until the US goes through the Irish government for it. Nevermind that you can access them easy enough in the US, it just so happens that because the data is stored in a completely unrelated country, the standard legal process is subverted completely.</p>
<p>That second example is the subject of a Supreme Court case heard a month ago, and every single side in that case (tech companies, the state and federal US government, and foreign governments (who overwhelmingly submitted amici curiae in favor of neither party)) agrees that something like the CLOUD Act is the best course of action, because the current law for this situation literally does not exist, and an SC decision in favor of either side would be problematic to say the least of it.</p>
<p>If you thought your data was safe before this, then you have no idea how this system works. Your emails were never private to begin with. Their contents were always in the hand of whichever company you created an account with. If you don't like it, find an email service that stores data in a country that will refuse to honor any foreign request for your email information. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also very much for the converse. US companies store US customer data abroad, where US subpoenas/warrants don't apply.</p>
<p>Another big reason this is making news is that it allows these agreements between our government and others without any congressional oversight or approval whatsoever, which is basically unprecedented.</p></div>		</li>
