			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question for you...I was in St Louis and had a lucky spot where I was picking up WBBM 780 (50k clearchannel out of Chicago) over the HD signal.  What is the range of HD radio in real world terms in comparison to the actual normal broadcast swath?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May not be a factor of HD or not. Depending on time of day, season an atmospheric effects, AM broadcasts can travel very far due to skywave propagation - also known as skip - where the signal travels up and is reflected off the ionosphere back to earth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I guess my question was really more pointing towards the range of HD radio in relation to the base signal...I'm guessing it's not quite as good because of the generally harder to gather digital signal issue at the edge of signal strength.  I was on my way back from Chicago, and lost HD signal generally somewhere between Bloomington and Springfield, IL...and then mysteriously it appeared in St Louis at this one spot.  </p>
<p>I love the 50k watt power boost on the long distance AM's.  Right now Chicago goes full power at 415pm and even in full daylight 440 miles away I get them loud and clear.  It's really cool to pick up stations from Denver, Minneapolis, Detroit, Atlanta, Dallas, New Orleans, etc like they were down the street.  </p>
<p>Farthest skip I've gotten on the FM side is kind of a tossup between a station in North Carolina and a news-talk station out of Baltimore.  Both were during the prime skip time...June.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For AM propagation the digital sidebands will become too corrupted. Skywave is the term used for night time propagation of medium wave frequencies; at night the ionosphere is reflective and signal &quot;skips&quot; or bounces over a greater distance. In the daytime the ionosphere absorbs signal instead. Think of the signal as going in every direction off of a vertical radiator (AM antenna tower). So you get upward, downward (look up AM ground systems) and of course forward and backward signal...</p>
<p>In any case, you can receive the analog modulation mostly decent even over skywave, depending on other noise sources. BUT there still is more noise. The digital signal isn't robust enough to deal with all this noise and is unusable. AM HD radio coverage is close to the DAYTIME signal coverage of the analog, but still not as good as the analog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the right angles and more luck than anything you can propagate a skywave from one side of the earth to the other.</p>
<p>Skywaves are weird though, I knew a friend of mine doing radio maneuvers in the marines, she got a 5/5 signal to Canada when she couldn't reach the station 5 miles down the road.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One question, how is it that the FM band is configured different in the US? Do stations transmit with more power, or have repeaters in the same frequency spaced apart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its more about the difference between our Federal Communications Commission and how other countries handle their own public airwaves. The terrain and populations density characteristics also dictate the reasoning to some degree as well.</p>
<p>In Europe you see things like national (BBC), regional and local radio formats. BBC Radio 1 is transmitted at many large and small transmitter facilities over coverage areas of interest. Each site receives the same audio and aux services and repeat. BBC programming is funded by the government, and other services like this exist all over the place.</p>
<p>In the US, you have maybe a few government funded national services. Think NPR, except NPR only has NPR, not NPR 1 or NPR 2 with Jazz. You have NPR affiliates that carry mostly the same programming but are allowed to have their own programming inserted. So NPR affiliate stations, while they are all over the US - they are unique and not 100% centrally programmed like a BBC Radio 1. The rest of the stations are not part of any government funded program, they exist to make profit. You have companies that own large amounts of stations with cookie cutter formats though. Like KISS FM, but even those have local talent for certain day parts, even though the music programmed may be the same for all their other markets. </p>
<p>To directly answer your question on frequency spacing:  (taken from wikipedia page) &quot;While all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand. So it's more about the content and ownership of the stations rather than something technical.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p></div>		</li>
