			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. The catch all is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery" target="_blank">dysentery</a> but it doesn't have a single causative agent, much like regular diarrhea can be caused by many different organisms. </p>
<p>But basically this is not something you typically encounter in non-third world countries because you often get it from areas with contaminated water, and corresponding poor hygiene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also lactose intolerance, too. It can give you diarrhea for awhile once it hits (up to two afters after ingestion).</p>
<p>Going to go into TMI territory here, but if I don't take a Lactaid before I eat certain dairy products, my lactose intolerance can give me horrid diarrhea long enough to become best friends with the toilet stall in my dorm (maybe 5, 10 minutes? Never kept track of just how long, but definitely no longer than that.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that's not a pathogenic diarrhea, that's an osmotic diarrhea.</p>
<p>What happens is that the undigested lactose causes water to come back into your intestines, and at some point that causes your intestines to expel the contents. So it's not the dairy per se that causes the diarrhea, it's more that it triggers a physiological reaction in your body, but a similar effect can be caused by drinking Metamucil. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yeah.</p>
<p>Someone else who had replied to you mentioned food intolerances, so I figured I should reply to you with one example since you likely wouldn't see them if I tacked it onto them.</p></div>		</li>
