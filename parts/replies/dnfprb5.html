			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, there's just a lot of universe out there, that we can never see, at all - and the amount of universe we can't ever see again is only getting bigger every day, until eventually, in the very distant future, it'd be impossible to see outside of the galaxy, then the solar system, then the planet, until eventually no two particles can interact with each other, and it'll be like nothing ever even existed at all.</p>
<p>Or atleast that's what I got from the hours of watching YouTube videos about space, I could very easily be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curvature of the universe tells us that. You don't need to wrap a tape measure around the earth to figure out how big it is after all.</p>
<p>The universe could have positive, negative, or no curvature.<br />
We can measure the curvature by working out the mass energy density of the universe, and then comparing it against a critical value. That gets you a number usually lableled Ω. </p>
<p>You can also do stuff to measure angles and see how they add up, positive curvature means the angle of a triangle can add to more than 180, negative means they can add to less and flat means they are exactly 180 always. </p>
<p>if Ω&gt;1, there's positive curvature.  In which case we have essentially a spherical universe. There's a finite size to the universe we could calculate from the curvature, two parallel lines will eventually meet at a finite distance and if you go in a straight line long enough you'll end up back where you started.</p>
<p>if Ω&lt;1, negative curvature. That gives our universe a sort of saddle shape  to it. The universe is infinite in size, two parallel lines get further away from one another and all the other properties of hyperbolic geometry apply.</p>
<p>Ω=1, space time is flat, and geometry follows the euclidean rules you learned in highschool. Again the universe is infinite.</p>
<p>As best as well can tell, the universe is flat. The current error is something like 0.4% and every time someones figured out a more accurate way to measure it, all they've done is narrow the range around Ω=1. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interact meaning nothing outside of that radius can cause any effect here. The boundaries of the observable universe are a causality horizon which mean not only can we not see past it but nothing can possibly be different because of it. In a very real sense that means it is the boundary for what science is capable of explaining, so it can also be seen as the scientific horizon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the multiverse theory, nothing is outside the multiverse. Our universe could possibly be a distinct point in spacetime with other universes outside the boundaries that we can never access. Ones where matter ceases to be matter, energy manifests in ineffable forms, or other universes potentially more similar to ours than we'll ever know. </p></div>		</li>

It may even wrap around and the edges meet..</p></div>		</li>

<p>The universe includes everything. There's no outside the Universe, just like there's no time before Big Bang, no edge of a sphere, and no end to the infinite numbers between .999... and 1.</p>
<p>They're all concepts we've put words to, but don't really grasp easily.</p></div>		</li>
