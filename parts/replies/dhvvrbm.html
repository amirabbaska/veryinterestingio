			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, all I did was find some other comment pointing out that the correct answer isn't as easy as it's presented here. However, since I don't really know anything about the topic, I am not really going to give answers here.</p>
<p>But I am glad that at least some people did click through, because it's actually quite interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most correct answer. I don't know what the hell everyone else is on about. The hot water rapidly warms the air around it, causing the air to movie upward and out of the shower space. Colder air then rushes in, pushing the curtain with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know, but <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/" target="_blank">the article</a> he mentions is about how this hot water theory is wrong, as the effect also happens with cold water. So maybe that's what they're on about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, someone want to try this with cold water?</p>
<p>The hot rising air theory send solid to me- I moved the top of the curtain to within an inch of the ceiling so that the hot air would have a harder time escaping, and that helped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humid air is less dense than dry air. This could be a factor as well. The effect is likely much stronger with warm water though, as it can release more water into the air through evaporation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity likely plays a significant role as well. Humid air is much less dense than dry air at the same temperature and pressure. H20 is far lighter than the N2 and O2 it displaces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the curtain won't suck in with nearly such force if you leave a gap on the side for the air to rush in. I've tested this many times on many showers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is based on Bernoulli's principle since it shows higher velocity creates lower pressure. The hot water creates a convection current that pushes the curtain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've thought thsi could have something to do with it but even when I am blocking the water flow so there is no airflow the effect happens. As a physicist this leads me to think it has to do with heat. Higher temperture air will expand and will result in a lower density, higher volume. And thus the high density and pressure air will lpush the curtain in. Idk though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the Bernoulli principle and airflow induction. Essentially, any quickly moving fluid will pull other fluids along with it via induction. In a shower, the primary fluid is water and the secondary fluid is air inside the shower, which convects around the flow of the spray. This causes a situation where the air inside the shower is moving faster than the air outside and here the Bernoulli principle takes hold: faster moving air has a lower relative air pressure. Suddenly, the higher air pressure outside is pushing the curtain in, similar to the way the higher pressure of slower air under a wing pushes it up.</p>
<p>This compounds the effect of the hot air rising out the top of the curtain and creating a chimney effect in the shower.</p>
<p>To see a simple demonstration of this effect, just get a drinking straw and a strip of paper. Hold the paper vertically in one hand and blow air on one side, and watch as the paper shifts towards the stream of air!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure the Bernoulli principle is applicable here as it is only valid along a streamline. If I recall correctly, all it states is that for air to speed up there must be a negative pressure gradient along the streamline in the direction of the flow, which is disarmingly intuitive when you think about it. However, taking the example of the straw and paper, the air sources for the top and bottom of the sheet of paper are completely separate - the former starts in your lungs and the latter is ambient air. Therefore, the streamlines are disconnected and Bernoulli's doesn't hold. </p>
<p>I can't actually remember why the paper is seen to deflect towards the moving airstream though as it's been a while since I read up on this, so I'm happy to be corrected if it turns out I'm wrong.  </p>
<p>Edit: Found my source. It's from a short paper called &quot;How Wings Work&quot; by Holger Babinsky, Professor of Aerodynamics at Cambridge University:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the fact is often overlooked that
Bernoulli’s equation applies ONLY along a stream-line. There is no explicit relationship between the
pressure and velocity of neighbouring streamlines.
Sometimes, all streamlines in a flow originate
from a region where there is uniform velocity
and pressure (such as a reservoir or a uniform
free-stream) and in such a case it is possible to
apply Bernoulli’s equation throughout the flow.
But in the ‘demonstration’ of Bernoulli’s equation
shown in figure 2 the air moving along the upper surface of the paper originates from the mouth
of the person performing the experiment and thstreamlines can be traced right back into this
person’s lungs. There is no connection with the ‘streamlines’ underneath the paper and Bernoulli's equation cannot be applied to compare the pressure
in the two regions. In fact, the pressure in the
air blown out of the lungs is equal to that of the surrounding air (and this is proved when blowing
over a straight sheet of paper—it doesn’t deflect towards the moving air). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A wide spray of water will certainly pull air along with it. I used to be a firefighter and I know that you can push smoke out of a room by shooting a wide spray out of the window.</p>
<p>Back before there were Self Contained Breathing Aparatuses (air tanks and regulator masks), the old leather-lung firefighters would get fresh air by spraying a wide cone and leaning down next to the water and breathing right  near the back if the cone. This worked because the spray was drawing in the fresher air from behind them.</p></div>		</li>
