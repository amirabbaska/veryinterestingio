			<div class="markdown"><p>Those sounds are probably cartilage, bone, and tendons catching on each other and being &quot;plucked&quot; like the string of an instrument. Because the sound is coming from inside the body near a joint space, it has very similar qualities to the sound of a knuckle cracking. My ankles do this sometimes too, but it happens less often as I get older. </p></div>		</li>
