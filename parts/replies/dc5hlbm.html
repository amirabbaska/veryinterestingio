			<div class="markdown"><p>With regards to brand recognition, there's a great show on CBC called Under the Influence that explores the way different brands got people to buy product.<br />
For Example, toothpaste wasn't really popular when it was first introduced and it didn't need a minty flavour to work. However, advertisers started promoting how toothpaste cleans your mouth and gives it a minty smell. This increased sales significantly.<br />
Another example is how Minute Maid began advertising orange juice as a part of breakfast and now it's a staple.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I heard a story about a guy who said he could increase tooth paste sales by a huge amount with one simple trick, he just wanted 50% of the increase in profits. His secret was to make the hole a bit bigger so people put on more tooth paste and had to buy it more frequently. </p>
<p>It's tricks like that, which you don't even notice, that convinced me we'll never be living in a sustainable way if things that last are products nobody wants to sell because it's &quot;too successful&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my case, my dad is the cheapest, tightest, most frugal person in the world, and apparently now so am I (thanks dad). I would read the back to check if they had the same chemical then buy whatever was cheaper, even if by a penny. If necessary I will calculate the price per ounce. </p>
<p>Grocery shopping takes a while for me :( </p></div>		</li>

<p>On the other hand you have the crappy-ass system where they only add taxes at checkout so you don't really know how much exactly what costs. </p>
<p>Tough life!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have noticed a lot of stores put price per kg for some and price per g for others to throw people off. E.g. I was once buying prawns and couldn't decide between a small or large one (both same brand). Turns out the price per g was cheaper for the smaller ones, but they had them at kg vs g. You have to be on your toes!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most frugal people, there are brands which are recognized for this.</p>
<p>Some brands coast on that brand recognition, and for frugal people who WON'T calculate the cost each time, eventually the behavior will become rote and they'll pick up the 'cheap' brand, even though over time the cost of the product may increase.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the fact that the company can spend this kind of money means that customers most likely retain the habit of buying that brand.</p>
<p>It's kind of like when a construction company keeps buying more equipment. You know they're doing well since they can afford stuff, which means they most likely are doing a good job.</p></div>		</li>
