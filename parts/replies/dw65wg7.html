			<div class="markdown"><p>They have to be navy blue, and all of the buttons and pins need to be in the correct place. They have rules about when you can wear short sleeves vs. long sleeves, so in the summer, you can't wear your long sleeves - there is a department wide notice that tells them when they can switch over. Technically he isn't supposed to have the outer carrier, because it isn't standard issue, but no one says anything because they get it through a company that mimics their work shirt so it looks pretty uniform still, and wearing your vest inside your shirt in the summer gives them terrible heat rash on their chests and stomachs, which all the higher ups know.</p>
<p>Their shoes have to be solid black, but I've seen them wearing leather boots, gortex boots that look like sneakers, tall boots, low boots, it doesn't matter because their pants cover them. </p>
<p>The army-style pants are also not standard issue, but as long as they're the correct color, no one says anything. Just make your tweaks, but try not to stand out. While he was on his probationary period, he had to wear all standard issue stuff. Now he has a little more freedom. But if you wanted to wear like, white running shoes with your uniform you'd be out of luck. </p></div>		</li>

<p>and he's upgraded his boots as well to ones that are waterproof </p>

<p>If he'd polish the bloody things, they'd be waterproof.</p>
<p>Besides, goretex boots have the downside of being much hotter and containing the sweat inside.  They also take <em>forever</em> to dry compared to old school non-goretex boots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He polished the old boots all the friggin time. They were shitty boots. I’ll bet they’re hot in the summer, but then he’s got his old boots to wear - and I haven’t heard a complaint about dry time. </p></div>		</li>
