<p>Source on this? I thought we were coming out of a little ice age. This article says an impending ice age is a myth</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like average temperature is an unhelpful metric to use when describing the effects. It seems like it just dampens the actual important part of the message (being extreme temps in certain places). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the difference between water that is 32 degrees vs. 33 degrees Fahrenheit. You wouldn't be able to perceive the one degree difference, but it is the difference between water and ice. Think of how many areas on the planet may be just barely cold enough to maintain ice. Now add a couple degrees temperature, consistently, over a period of many years. </p>
<p>That is as ELI5 as it can get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I keep saying.</p>
<p>It's like turning your freezer from 31° to 33°. Still cold, but now all of your food will spoil, and the ice cream is melted in a puddle on the bottom, so it's a mess, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>think about the times we've complained about 45°C in major coastal cities. Now keep adding a couple of degrees every year, and think about the non-desert towns that already went past 51°C 2 years ago.</p>
<p>How fucked are we when the next major heatwave comes along? What happens when our roads melt, our train tracks/tram lines twist out of place and our major buildings start to warp? What happens when your feet start cooking if you go barefoot?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another simplified way to think about  this is to realize that the difference between frozen ice and liquid water is less than 1 degree. If the average temperature increase is 2 degrees warmer then this means that areas and days that were just below freezing temperature are now above it. If you think about it geographically, then <em>on average</em> this could mean that ice caps would retreat many 100s of miles to the <em>new</em> freezing line and glaciers will retreat up mountains many 100s/1000s of feet. You can also think about it <em>seasonally</em>. If the freezing days happen and end on average at certain days of the year, a 2 degree warmer global temperature will result in fewer freezing days and more melting days. Over time a few weeks difference each year will add up causing ice caps and glaciers and permafrost to melt more than they grow. Plant growth and animal migration patterns will also be thrown off causing ecological disruptions as well. This is a very generalized way to think of changes in <em>average</em> temperatures. In reality local and daily changes will become much more erratic and extreme depending on the location and day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Earth was once about 12C hotter than it is now and life endured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, some life did.  The Eocene was ~12C hotter, and it ended with a major extinction event.  And it cooled off because carbon sequestered into... oil and natural gas.</p>
<p>Kinda funny we're in an extinction event driven by reversing that exact process.</p>
<p>But on its own, it'd take something like meteoric bombardment to get back to that temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way you said that, it kinda sounds like you're implying the higher temperatures caused the extinction event. Actually the higher temperatures lasted for millions of years before an extinction event was caused by <em>cooling</em> temperatures.</p></div>		</li>
