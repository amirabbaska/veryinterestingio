			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's my question in this regard, if you exited and somehow manually managed some expansion of the parachute, isn't the ISS a low enough orbit that the increased surface area would cause more drag from the traces if atmosphere that high?</p>
<p>Obviously not enough to exit orbit quickly enough to make any difference, but enough to ensure a fiery funeral for the remains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You realize that the surface area of a parachute is <em>smaller</em> than the surface area of the ISS, right? ;) You'd get to earth faster staying inside the ISS, which is basically a huge parachute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the reason the stations and satellites eventually de orbit, so yes but your relative drag compared to the ISS would be pretty low. You would probably de orbit after the ISS ( assuming they stop making corrections on the station)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you push yourself off from the ISS towards the earth? You would eventually get back to the earth as the gravitational force is larger than the lateral force, you would circle the earth until you slow down enough and enter earths orbit and die</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would still have almost exactly the same velocity as the ISS and so would orbit at about the same altitude. Unless you can push hard enough to counteract a significant amount of the ISS' velocity your orbit wouldn't change much. Realistically, your orbit would eventually decay due to resistance with the thin atmosphere up there and no way to correct it but you would run out of air far before that happened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you had two chutes, and you pulled your main after jumping out against your orbit? Could you bleed any significant amount of velocity that way? Let's assume the chute opens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't push yourself towards the Earth absolutely, as the direction &quot;towards the Earth&quot; changes as you orbit. If you do push yourself towards the Earth as one point, you will have pushed yourself ahead of the ISS a quarter-orbit ahead. then above another quarter orbit later, then behind, and back to your original position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youâ€™d be in an orbit slightly offset from that of the ISS. Your orbital speed did not change.</p>
<p>Remember the ISS is up there because it is continuously falling (gravity), but with speed enough that it would land beyond the horizon. </p>
<p>If you jump towards earth, you will move the orbit. Yes <em>eventually</em> you will hit atmosphere, but that might take years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't you take a much higher orbit because your mass is way lower than ISS'? I mean, you'd need a much lower speed to achieve a stable orbit around the earth, and with ISS' speed you'd just fly away from the Earth or at least take a way less circular orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Gravitational force is proportional to Mass so it really doesn't matter what you weigh, once you're up there. Everything, regardless of mass, orbiting at the same altitude has the same speed</p></div>		</li>
