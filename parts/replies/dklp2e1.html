<p>Don't most jobs that have high level classifications choose from people in the next few levels down? In general at least. For example, iif Area 51 needed a new engineer, they'd choose from engineers who'd already had access to similar levels of clearance, instead of looking at civilians with no background of clearance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what's being worked on. The information at that level is compartmentalized so that only very few people know. So even if an engineer is brought in with a security clearance that high, they're almost certainly only going to be aware of what they and their subordinates are working on. </p>
<p>Think of something like a smartphone, with each engineering department working on specific parts. So one engineering team is working on the processors, another the touchscreen, etc. None of them would necessarily even be aware of the others, so no one would really be able to figure out what the end product is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that it's all abstracted so they can work with minimal knowledge, but if I had, say the security clearance of an FBI consultant, would I not have an easier job getting the clearance to work in Area 51 then the guy who had the security clearance of none, because he worked in the private sector?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting security clearance, even the lower levels, is a HUGE pain in the ass. It takes months, so presumably, higher level clearance can take even longer.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.. I was offered a government job that required stupidly high levels of clearance.  I got an offer from the private sector while going through all the hoops and took it.  You'd be stupid not to take the private sector job even if the government job was literally your dream job.  You can fail the clearance process anywhere along the line and they'll leave you in the dust without second thought.  I was also told they hire multiple people for every job and just take the first person who gets through the clearance process (assuming only 1 position is available)... My point is that even if you are qualified and squeaky clean you can still get declined 6 months into the clearance process for reasons completely out of your control.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And you have to re-up all the time. And you can be randomly screened for issues. And (nowadays) you have to assume someone somewhere is reading what you are doing online. Or, at the very least, computers are trolling through it. You have to surrender <em>all</em> social media handles, and give blanket permission for all things you do everywhere to be documented if you get high level clearance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is still the need to bring in people without previously holding top secret clearance as that pool has to grow over time. My ex used to come home crying from her interviews for top secret, and she couldn't even talk to me about it. I honestly think it played a huge role in our break-up.</p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>Compartmentalization. Just because you're working at one of these sites or on these programs you probably are not privvy to every detail. </p>
</li>
<li>Pride in what you are working on and how important it is that outweighs pride of bragging about it. </li>

<p>Honestly I just use Google, and add the word <em>eli5</em> to the search words. For a really interesting question I may try googling a few different times, using different but similar words, to see what else comes up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice! Dedication to the Reddit cause. Reddit search itself really sucks and interestingly is not often (for me at least) that Reddit comes up in the search results. Would be nice to get the Reddit top comment for a tech support answer rather than some random forum post from 2005.</p></div>		</li>
