			<div class="markdown"><p>This is extremely fascinating. Probably a dumb question, but where are CYP2E1 enzymes located in the human body? Could a blood test for CYP2EI be used to estimate how heavily someone drinks? </p>
<p>It's also interesting that MEOS requires more calories because it gives off some heat... if there was a clinical way to cause the dehydrogenase pathway to become overwhelmed sooner and to encourage MEOS, would this result in gaining fewer calories from alcohol consumption? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(Not a professional medical person) Well, you could inhibit the action of alcohol dehydrogenase by the usage of Fomepizole, which inhibits ADH.  </p>
<p>However, usage of that drug for this purpose is pretty reckless, as doing so results in ethanol staying in the body unchanged for longer and inhibiting the formation of acetaldehyde (delaying the onset of hangover-like symptoms and potentiating/extending the effect of alcohol intoxication).   </p>
<p>It's also a pretty damn expensive medication.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not the other guy, but I’m in my final year of undergrad studying biochemistry. In response to your first question about CYP2EI being used to determine how much someone drinks, it appears that this wouldn’t work particularly well as it is primarily expressed in the liver. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0027510704003756" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0027510704003756</a> Also, even if it does appear in excess levels in the blood, there’s no guarantee that it can be isolated from other proteins easily enough to make it useful.</p>
<p>As for your next question, in theory yes. As it says in the article, 9 calories are burned through the breakdown of 1 gram of alcohol and 7 calories are gained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Previous Biomedical Researcher here, I focused on CYP2E1 enzymes in my work.
CYP2E1 enzymes are located in the liver and are also responsible for metabolizing drugs and small molecules, so a CYP2E1 enzyme count wouldn't tell you what you're wanting to know about a person's alcohol use (the count would be affected by drugs and other molecules).
Also CYP2E1 enzymes aren't the only liver enzymes responsible for alcohol metabolism, so I'm interested in why you chose those enzymes specifically....?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>people actually think they don't have an alcohol problem if they drink 2-3 beers a night, 7 days a week, month after month. told my friend/s to stop for 6 days, they rationalized the fuck out of it (argument) why they don't want to take a break. lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to this, one reason why she could have been able to reach such a high BAC is due to down regulation (or up regulation) of the neurotransmitters affected by alcohol. Your body wants to maintain homeostasis, so in a person that’s constantly drinking, it will start to reduce or increase the number of receptors affected by alcohol to try and get back to “normal.” At this point having some alcohol in your system becomes the “normal” and they have to drink more to get the same effect. This is also the basis for physical addiction and why it’s actually possible to die from alcohol withdrawals.</p></div>		</li>
