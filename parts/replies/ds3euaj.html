			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have oral allergy syndrome, along with most of my family. When I was growing up, my older brother (1 year older) shared a lot of my mom's allergies, but I didn't have any. At about 14 or 15 I started to develop all the same allergies they had. One thing I have noticed is that my allergies to fruits and vegetables are exacerbated in high-pollen years - OP, was it a high-pollen year in your area?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have Oral Allergy Syndrome as well. I grew up with allergies and eczema, but didnt have an actual reaction to food till I was an adult. It started out with just an itchy mouth from some fresh fruits and vegetables, but now certain ones make my lips swell.</p></div>		</li>
