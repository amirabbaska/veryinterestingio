			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the system compare with traditional techniques?</p>
<p><em>There are many possible metrics; In accessible terrain, it should be much faster than a sapper spike.</em> <em>For minimum metal mines, it will have much higher Probability of Detection (PD) than a metal detector.</em> <em>For all targets, the holographic radar should reduce the False Alarm Rate (FAR).</em></p>
<p>Is it capable of operating in active conflict zones like South Sudan?</p>
<p><em>It should be.</em> <em>For this project, we are specifically designing for humanitarian de-mining in post-conflict Eastern Ukraine.</em></p>
<p>Does it have a SIM card that can be stolen to make phone calls?</p>
<p><em>Haha! No.  Those poor researchers!</em></p></div>		</li>
