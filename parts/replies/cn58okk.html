			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, the haplotype groups for all humans have some groups dating back 13,000 years and more.  Everyone is comprised of one or more haplotype combinations.  I think the articles that claim we have &quot;one ancestor&quot; really mean we have at last some genetic information from a common ancestor (ie. spreading down the tree).  It does not mean we all came from the same person, just that we are all somehow related to a theoretical person by having touched that genetic tree.</p>
<p>If you are 78% haplotype R, and 13% B, you would still primarily have the R-aged DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going back this many generations, you don't necessarily have any actual genetic information from your ancestors. Going back just 32 generations (650 years), one grandparent is only one four billionth of your ancestry, and there are only 3 billion base pairs in the human genome. Granted, if they're contributing any genetic material, they are probably at the top of many different branches of your family tree.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, ALL of your genetic information comes from your ancestors... by definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically (assuming the hypothesis is correct), I believe it does mean we all &quot;came from the same person&quot;. It's just a matter of how far back in our lineage each of us joined that person's lineage. For example, my mother was not at all related to him, but my father is his descendant. Maybe for you it was one of your grandparents. More likely, considering the hypothesis is that <strong>everyone alive today</strong> is his (her? or did they say it was a man?) descendant, this happened hundreds, if not a thousand, years ago.</p>
<p>Your mother isn't a descendant of your father's father, nor your father of your mother's father (or mother, in either case), but you are a descendant of all 4 of those people. And out of those 4, one of their parents was a descendant of that one person a few thousand years ago.</p></div>		</li>
