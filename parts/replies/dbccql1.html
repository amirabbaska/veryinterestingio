			<div class="markdown"><p>Tangent: I once spoke to a chemist who worked in formulation of laundry detergents at a multinational company. She said that they fine tune the amount of foaming agents for each market, as consumers in different places have different expectations about the amount of bubbles to expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of that fine tuning is trying to account for how &quot;hard&quot; the water is. Many soaps precipitate out of water in contact with 2+ ions in the water, Mg(II) and Ca(II) are pretty common ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting.  I often dump a bunch of mag citrate in my tub as a muscle relaxant, but it makes the tub really hard to rinse afterward.  So am I getting cleaner or dirtier when I bathe in bath salt water? (compared to generic city water)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colours are also important. I was at a Procter and Gamble factory when I was younger on a trip. The guy was telling us about how washing powders sold in different countries have those little coloured bits but in different countries the colour is different. The west associates colours like blue and white with cleanliness. While in places like India, they prefer the colour orange. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense to me. Especially when we buy dollar store dish soap (name brand) and it doesn't  perform in the suds department all to well. It makes me wondering why the soap is sold so cheaply. My guess is the soap didn't do well in those markets and got pulled from the shelf. Then said dollar store buys at a discounted price and we get it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suds/bubbles can be used to keep air out. Look at a no-rinse sanitizer called Starsan. It's acid based but also has detergent, supposedly for this purpose. Brewers and wine makers use it. Stuff has been around for quite a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It possible that the dollar store is buying in bulk and redistributing across markets. So chances are you getting a version of the soap meant for somewhere else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Foaming agents are added to soaps as a marketing strategy, as people erroneously believe that bubbles are more than just air pockets and actually have an effect on how clean things get. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes and no. Foaming agents help cause flocculation, which helps if you are continually rinsing particulates away (like manually washing dishes, showering, or filtering bulk water/washing coal/purifying pharmaceutical agents/etc.) It can help weaker surfactants &quot;get around&quot; fine colloidal micelles or break emulsions.  </p>
<p>But this doesn't help you if you are sitting in a bathtub full of bubbles, or in dishwashing or laundry machines.</p>
<p>So no, it's not <em>entirely</em> useless, but a lot of it is futile.</p>
<p>Edit: Source: was a biochem grad student, used flocculating agents and soft detergents (and lots of excrutiatingly painful HPLC) to burst cells and separate phospolipid-membrane-bound proteins from cell surfaces for studying. (Man, I miss those days... much more fun than Software Engineering most of the time.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert but this sounds reasonable -- same reason fur is so warm, the hairs trap air which is a poor conductor and thus drastically reduces convective cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might, and it definitely sounds reasonable since you're capturing a layer of air over the water... but I was talking about cleaning efficacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia, so always late. Yes it helps distribute surfactant, which bust lipids. Also the presence of bubbles is a good indication that the surfactant is still working.
No one's mentioned &quot;enzyme power&quot; for breaking down proteins.
Not sure what those enzyme are, but they help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think bubbles can also serve as an indicator of which items/areas have been cleaned. If someone is interrupted while hand washing the dishes, is taking a shower on auto-pilot, or forgot whether laundry soap was added to the washer, the bubbles can be a visual aid to help with staying or getting back on track with the task.</p></div>		</li>
