			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine not. A gamma ray burst is a distinct event. It's possible to have a gamma ray resulting from annihilation with the same energy as we would expect from a GRB, but GRBs last a couple of seconds and involve way more than billions of gamma rays, whereas an annihilation event of similar magnitude probably hasn't occurred since the beginning of the universe. You wouldn't class a single gamma ray resulting from annihilation as a GRB. They are much rarer and more distinctive events.</p></div>		</li>
