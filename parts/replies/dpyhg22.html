<p>Can you hand type a program in 1's and 0's?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in the 80s there were magazines that had programs published this way.  For example, <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/machine-code.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>

<p>Oh man, that's awesome!! I love how you can just abstract these things, though. Once you had that program saved somewhere, you could use the high score initials inputter for any program you wanted!! (Bless copy/paste though)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can type your 0s and 1s in a simple hex editor, save it with an exe extension and run it. No need for compiling. You can open a small exe in an hex editor and manually retype it in 0s and 1s on another hex editor, and you'll end up with an exact same file.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hexidecimal is often used to represent binary since it is much more compact and each hexidecimal digits maps out to exactly 4 binary digits (unlike base 10).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a hex editor is probably more accurately named a &quot;raw byte editor&quot;.  Hexadecimal is a common format used to represent bytes because each hex digit (0-9 and A-F) is exactly 4 bits, making it a nice middle ground between &quot;human&quot; (decimal) and &quot;computer&quot; (binary) representations</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, &quot;.doc&quot; was a straight up memory dump. They took whatever memory had been allocated and used since &quot;New File&quot; was clicked, and write it all to disk.</p>
<p>To load a file, they'd allocate however much memory, and read from disk straight into memory.</p>
<p>This is all to say, there's no &quot;file format&quot; or structure, like, say, XML or HTML.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda, but it's more like a little filesystem according to Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each binary word file is an OLE Compound File,[44] a hierarchical file system within a file.[45] According to Joel Spolsky, Word Binary File Format is extremely complex mainly because its developers had to accommodate an overwhelming number of features and prioritize performance over anything else.[45]</p>
<p>As with all OLE Compound Files, Word Binary Format consists of &quot;storages&quot;, which are analogous to computer folders, and &quot;streams&quot;, which are similar to computer files. Each storage may contain streams or other storages. Each Word Binary File must contain a stream called &quot;WordDocument&quot; stream and this stream must start with a File Information Block (FIB).[46] FIB serves as the first point of reference for locating everything else, such as where the text in a Word document starts, ends, what version of Word created the document and other attributes.</p>
