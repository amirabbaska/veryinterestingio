			<div class="markdown"><p>What an efficient way of &quot;cleaning&quot; the mucus? I'm currently have this issue myself and I'm drinking water and hot tea with honey to get rid of it. It has helped a little but is there any other efficient home remedy that could help? </p>
<p>And what about smoking, that's not recommended at all or am I on the wrong here? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, keep yourself hydrated which will make the mucus moister and less sticky so that it is easier to bring up.  There is an OTC medication called Mucinex that will do the same thing by pulling A Lot of moisture out of your own body to do that.  So if you take Mucinex, then you srsly need to over-hydrate, far more than you would normally drink</p></div>		</li>
