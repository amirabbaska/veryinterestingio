<p>edit for clarity:  Todd Bertuzzi is another player who got criminal assault charges for something he did on the ice, not McSorley's victim</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The story was that Bruce McNall (LA King's owner, trying to land Gretzky ) was on the phone with the Oiler's owner, Peter Pocklington. Gretzky told McNall to ask for McSorley as well. Pocklington reportedly hesitated, and Gretzky allegedly whispered to McNall.. &quot;Are you going to lose this deal over a f*****g thug?&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
