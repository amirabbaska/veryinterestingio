			<div class="markdown"><p>The eighth bit allowed for alternate character sets. In the IBM family the alternate set was international money, greek, box characters (corners and sides in single and double). In the Commodore alt character set, these characters were box graphics and symbols used for character-based arcade games, artwork etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a variety of extended ASCII codes using values 128-255, where the most significant bit is 1.</p>
<p>The most common one is <a href="http://www.ascii-code.com/" target="_blank">ISO 8859-1 or Latin-1</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eighth bit allows for more modern character sets which allow for special characters such as accented vowels (most common in the French language). The previous standing character set, ASCII, only used 7 bits, which meant there was only 127 different possibilities for letters, 8-bit character sets allow 256 possibilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, the NNTP protocol uses ASCII in this 7 bit form, so accessing binaries on Usenet, which is still a thing, requires UUencoding them to/from 7 bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that the majority of the world's NNTP servers and clients are 8-bit clean, the only untransmittable character is the null byte, and there's a general limit on line length which makes CR/LF characters problematic. Hence, the modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YEnc" target="_blank">yEnc</a> encoding which has mostly displaced uuencode, although not as much as MIME with Base64 encoding (essentially a standardised uuencode) has displaced both of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No longer true for quite a while, usenet started using 8 bit ASCII over a decade ago, so 'new' encoding formats like <a href="http://www.yenc.org/" target="_blank">yenc</a> are used pretty much everywhere and add very little overhead.</p>
<p>Since the overwhelming majority of usenet traffic is binaries these days, this is a good thing for everyone concerned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it wasn't ASCII that was used on the System 360, the machine which popularised 8 bit characters.</p>
<p>It had it's own charater set, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBCDIC" target="_blank">EBCDIC</a>, which did use all 8 bits.</p>
<p>I think the practice of padding 7 bit ASCII into 8bit chars and then adding an extended set came later. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the vacuum tube modules are cool. I've been trying to power up an IBM 705 tube module similar to your &quot;byte&quot; picture, so I can give some details on how it works. You'd think that the 8-tube module would be a byte, but it doesn't work that way because one tube isn't one bit. The module I have <a href="http://imgur.com/a/o7GsJ" target="_blank">photos</a> stores three bits using 8 tubes. Three tubes are delay lines for the bits, which are stored dynamically, not in flip flops like you'd expect. Other tubes provide AND-OR logic for selecting inputs, output buffers, and shape the clock pulses. (That's how the module I have work; other modules have totally different functions.)</p>
<p>And I echo EtanSivad's recommendation on &quot;IBM's Early Computers&quot; - it has tons of information on the pre-360 computers. (The delay-based storage I mentioned above is described in Appendix C.)</p></div>		</li>
