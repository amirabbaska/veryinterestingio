			<div class="markdown"><p>Otto von Guericke is one of the more important early scientists that people have never heard of.  He was responsible for both the first work on vacuums as well as the first electrostatic generator and the early work on electromagnetism that resulted from that.</p>
<p>He almost didn't get to do any of it because he was a resident of Magdeburg in 1630-1631, during the 30 Years War.  Magdeburg is famous because the soldiers attacking it effectively went wild and the city was destroyed so totally that, for a century afterward,  &quot;Magdeburgization&quot; became a common shorthand in military parlance for utter devastation.  His diary is rather harrowing, one of few first-hand accounts from a resident of the city.  Only 5,000 of 30,000 residents survived.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only in print.  However, it just so happens I have the book next to me.  Here's a tiny excerpt about everything that went on after the city's defenses were overpowered.  The following is part of his account, translated into English:</p>
<p>...then General Pappenheim brought a good number of troops onto the rampart by the Neustadt, and from there into the alleys of the city, and von Falkenberg was shot and fires were set in every corner.  Then the city was lost, and all resistance came too late and was useless.  For although citizens and soldiers in some places tried to put up some opposition and come to arms, meanwhile the imperialists always had more and more troops to help them, as well as enough cavalry...and finally they opened the Kröcken Gate and let in through it the entire army of the imperialists and Catholic League...</p>
<p>Thus it happened that the city, with all of its inhabitants, fell into the hands and under the power of its enemies, whose fierceness and cruelty came partly out of a common hatred of the adherents of the Augsburg Confession [Lutherans], and partly from the fact that people had shot at them with crossbar shot and other things from the ramparts, belittling them, provoking them, and leading them to become enraged.  Then there was nothing but murder, burning, plundering, torment, and beatings.  </p>
<p>In particular, each of the enemies sought more and greater booty.  When such a party of looters entered a house and the head of the household had something he could give them, then he could use this to save and preserve himself and his family until another soldier, who also wanted something, came along.  Finally, however, when everything had been given out and there was nothing left to give, then the misery really began.  For then the soldiers began to beat, frighten, and threaten to shoot, skewer, hang, etc., the people, so that even if something had been buried under the earth or locked away behind a thousand locks, the citizens would still have been forced to seek it out and hand it over.</p>
<p>Through such enduring fury - which laid this great, magnificent city, which had been like a princess in the entire land, into complete burning embers and put it into such enormous misery and unspeakable need and heartache - many thousands of innocent men, women, and children were, with horrid, fearful screams of pain and alarm, miserably murdered and wretchedly executed in manifold ways, so that no words can sufficiently describe it, nor tears bemoan it.</p>
<p>...in this time the fire, which had originally been ordered set by Count von Pappenheim in order to perturb and frighten the citizens and inhabitants, but which had afterward been used by the common soldiery without discretion or pause, took the upper hand by means of the sudden appearance of the wind, so that by ten o' clock in the morning everything was afire; and by ten o'clock in the evening the entire city, including the beautiful courthouse and all the churches and cloisters, had been reduced to ashes and heaps of stone.  Thus the imperial army, lest it incinerate itself, had to withdraw from the city and retreat to its encampment.</p>
<p>Thus this renowned and genteel city, the ornament of the entire land, went up in flames and smoke in a single day, and its remaining inhabitants, with their wives and children, were taken prisoner and driven out by the enemy, such that the shouting, crying, and howling could be heard from far away, and the seething embers and ash from the city were transported by the wind as far away as Wanzleben [ten miles southwest], Egeln [seventeen miles southwest], and other places.</p>
<p>Almost four thousand people were in the cathedral church, where they had retreated and holed themselves up; and although, in the beginning, some of the imperial troops had gotten in, killing several people and raping two women, soon they set up a watch and further violence was averted...</p>
<p>...as for the number of those slain and dead in the city, since many people were devoured not only by the sword, but also by fire, one cannot really know...for almost an entire year after this time we found many dead bodies - five, six, eight, ten, or more at a time - in ruined cellars where they had suffocated and died...thus no one can name an actual number. Altogether, however, one could say that including the two suburbs and those imperial troops who had died and were burned, it was about twenty thousand people, young and old, whose lives were ended in such cruel conditions.  The dead corpses, which had been carried out to the Elbe in front of the Water Gate, were not soon able or willing to flow away...some with their heads out of the water, others reaching out their hands as if toward heaven, giving onlookers quite a horrible spectacle.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Barometric pressure in any given location fluctuates day-to-day, and those fluctuations can be used to predict the weather to some extent. I would imagine that barometers already existed for that purpose. It wasn’t that people didn’t have a concept of atmospheric pressure; it was just that nobody had yet thought to take a barometer up on a mountain to see if that had any effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick summary of the thinking process and development of the barometer around the year 1645:
Engineers were building new big fountains for the Italian city Florence, which was basically building pumps which pressure.
They would have water in upstanding cilinders with their bottom in a water basin.
However, they found there was a problem with sucking up water inside these column higher than a certain height (12 meters or so) </p>
<p>This is obviously a barometer. The height of the water in the column is determined by the atmosphere pressure on the basin. </p>
<p>After investigation en research by a guy named Torricelli, a lot of things where concluded about the nature of air and the existence of lack of air (vacuum). </p>
<p>As others have said, it is all on the barometer Wikipedia webpage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The invention of the barometer was accidental. In fact, many things we know about physics (especially, from that time) weren't known until someone inadvertently stumbled onto an effect they didn't understand. You could say it was the barometer which proved air pressure exists.</p>
<p>Around 1630, a man named Giovanni Battista Baliani couldn't get a fairly large siphon to work. He essentially built a large barometer, but air pressure wasn't considered as a potential cause. Galileo (who had be consulted about this) thought an interplay between the forces of a vacuum and the weight of water might've produced the unexpected results. Consequently, others trying to replicate the effect as explained by Galileo also (accidentally) made barometers.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that around this time, Descartes is known to have proposed an experiment for measuring atmospheric pressure, so it's incorrect to think that no one considered the possibility of air having weight. It's just that the dominant conception (the 'Aristotelian' understanding) simply assumed air was weightless.</p>
<p>Things changed with Evangelista Torricelli (the person credited with the actual invention). He decided to question the weightless air assumption. His open mind allowed him to make sense of what was, before then, confusing data. (His use of mercury was a result of him trying miniaturize his experiment. Water requires a much bigger apparatus.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I can tell, people actually seemed to think for a long time that the moon had an atmosphere. There is the famous story by Jules Verne where they were able to breathe on the Moon.
