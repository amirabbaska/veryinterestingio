<p>Except in Cuba where every year we send them a check to rent Guantanimo and they don't cash it and remind us that they want us to kindly GTFO.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That one is the big exception. </p>
<p>Fun fact, until the 1953â€“59 revolution, thousands of Cubans commuted daily from outside the base to jobs within. In mid-1958, vehicular traffic was stopped; workers were required to walk through the base's several gates. By 2006, only two elderly Cubans, Luis Delarosa and Harry Henry, still crossed the base's North East Gate daily to work on the base, because the Cuban government prohibits new recruitment. They retired at the end of 2012, ending the crossing of Cuban workers. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Signed by a government that doesn't exist anymore. It's of questionable validity at best after the revolution.</p>
<p>In business terms a bankruptcy and new landlord taking over would invalidate the prior leases and in International relations, it's generally accepted that a completely new government disconnected from the old one is not bound by the contracts of the old one afterward unless they reaffirm them.</p></div>		</li>
