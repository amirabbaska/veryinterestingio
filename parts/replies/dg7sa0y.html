			<div class="markdown"><p>one way to think about this is that:</p>
<p>Imagine a brick wall, made of bricks. </p>
<p>The bricks themselves can regenerate if someone chips away at them, graffities them, or otherwise rain erodes away at them. </p>
<p>But the shape of the wall itself, if something incredibly heavy leans on it - there's nothing to lean it back the other way. It doesn't matter how much the bricks themselves individually regenerate, that almost doesn't matter, the wall will be bent and mis-shapen and no amount of regenerating will fix the shifting, it'll be a shifted over wall with perfect bricks for all intents and purposes. </p>
<p>for us to regenerate eyesight, you'll need a whole wall that can regenerate, not just the bricks. In other words, it's not good enough that the eye cells regen, we need the lens to regen as well. </p></div>		</li>
