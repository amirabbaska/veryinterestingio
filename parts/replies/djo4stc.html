			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another thing that might surprise people in a similar vein.</p>
<p>You can say the same thing about finger prints. They are probably given more weight than they should have as evidence.</p>
<p>The claim that no two people have the same prints has never really been proven.</p>
<p>It's actually quite likely that several people will have prints that closely match to the point of being nearly identical because there are only a few pattern types on finger tips.</p>
<p>Generally, the more fingers on a hand you can get prints from, the more reliable it is as identification. However, even then it's not infallible. It's also worth pointing out that getting an entire set of clear prints is very rare. Commonly only one or two fingers will leave distinct prints, if that. They also frequently overlap other prints.</p>
<p>There's also the fact that skin is elastic and prints are made by contact that will differ slightly even when the same person touches a surface several times. They are rarely applied cleanly to any surface, though there will be some consistency.</p>
<p>Finger print identification does have some value, but finger print scanners and people who examine them for forensics look for a limited number of points that match records. Once again, television is lying to you with those fancy computer databases that instantly identify people based on their prints.</p>
<p>It is not unlikely that the prints of several different people might match those points.</p>
<p>It isn't as concrete as identification as many in law enforcement and security would have us believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there's a frontline episode about how a whole lot of &quot;forensic evidence&quot; is total garbage and the &quot;experts&quot; in court often have no real expertise at all, just online diplomas from unaccredited bullshit websites. it includes the story of a dude from portland who was held in prison due to his fingerprint matching one found on a bomb in spain, despite him never having been to spain and not being involved in it whatsoever. </p>
