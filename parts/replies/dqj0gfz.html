			<div class="markdown"><p>Saliva evaporates quite quickly, while taking any moisture with it. Thus, the cycle continues and each time you lick your lips, you strip them of even more moisture. The end result is “chapped” lips and they can crack. (Think of cracked lips like a dry desert floor- lack of moisture = dry cracking)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is nonsense. Saliva doesn't break down the chemical structure of water. It <em>does</em> do two other things that cause your lips to dry out: irritates the skin and washes away natural oils that serve as liquid permeability barriers. It irritates your lips because it is slightly acidic (the acidity helps with food digestion when you eat) and your lips aren't well protected, but the irritation isn't typically strong enough to notice. When your lips dry out, they become more sensitive, especially if they crack. Saliva in the cracks equals no bueno, mi amigo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Saliva has a lower concentration of water in it so licking your lips causes the water inside the cells to leave your cells to make the concentration of water equal on both sides of your cell walls. This means water is pulled out of your lip cells faster than normal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your saliva does not have bits of stomach acid in it. The cells that produce the HCl in your stomach are not in your mouth. Furthermore, the enzymes that aid in digestion in your mouth are distinct from those that appear in your stomach. Furthermore, these enzymes work optimally at drastically different pH levels. Saliva contains salivary amylases which break down starch and work best at fairly neutral pH levels (close to that of water). Your stomach, on the other hand, is very acidic and the digestive enzymes there serve a different purpose (i.e., the breakdown of proteins).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>building upon this, one could argue that &quot;chapstick&quot; should be used to prevent chapped lips but doesn't do much to aid in the healing. one would require a lip balm to moisturize then a &quot;chapstick&quot; to seal in the moisture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chapstick is a brand of lip balm. Similar to how Kleenex is a brand of tissues. There is no difference ingredients wise between preventing chapped lips and &quot;aiding in healing&quot; because all moisturizers are going to be made of the same three basic components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an occlusive (e.g. petroleum, wax) to &quot;seal&quot; in water and prevent transepidermal water loss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an emollient (e.g. argan oil, olive oil) to soften the skin and &quot;feed&quot; the stratum corneum fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides which are the building blocks of our skins barrier</p>
</li>
<li>a humectant (e.g. glycerin, aloe vera) draws moisture (i.e. water) from the air around you into your skin</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna ask you my question since you're an expert.</p>
<p>What's your opinion on using Vaseline instead of chap stick and other lip balm brands?</p>
<p>For me, it seems to work way faster, and it's also cheaper. Are there any drawbacks to using Vaseline? I'm asking because it hasn't been mentioned yet in this thread, so I'm thinking there's a reason people don't use it for chapped lips.</p></div>		</li>
