			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more, Voyager's electrical systems will begin to shut off in about 5 years.  By 2030 Voyager will likely be totally out of juice.  Worst of all, even if Voyager still had power by the time it was to pass Planet 9 around 400 AU, it'd likely be out of range for us to receive a usable signal.  I just checked the <a href="http://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html" target="_blank">Deep Space Network</a> this morning and Voyager 1 was checking in.  The spacecraft is currently checking in at download rate of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/RrYAMj0.png" target="_blank">160 b/sec</a> at 133.8 AU away.  That signal will continue to degrade. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Voyager mission today presents an unequaled technical challenge. The spacecraft are now so far from home that it takes nine hours and 36 minutes for a radio signal traveling at the speed of light to reach Earth,&quot;said Ed B. Massey, project manager for the Voyager Interstellar Mission. &quot;That signal, produced by a 20 watt radio transmitter, is so faint that the amount of power reaching our antennas is 20 billion times smaller than the power of a digital watch battery,&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if all variables with inclination were close, there's still an almost zero percent chance any of the probes would ever end up anywhere near it. As Douglas Adams put it, &quot;Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is.&quot; The chance of NASA just happening to send a couple probes on a trajectory to end up close to a still hypothetical planet, 40 years before even indirect evidence of its existence was found, is off the charts unlikely. The scientists who planned that trajectory should be playing Powerball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting - from my understanding of how planets form, there's a very good reason why they all orbit on the same plane of inclination. What kind of factors could account for such a radically different orbit? Could 9 actually be a captured object, for example? </p></div>		</li>

<p>so that puts the planet at a 400 AU distance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to put that in the perspective of another mission, if a dedicated mission similar to the New Horizons probe was launched at similar speed to NH it would take 115 years to travel that far.</p>
<p>Powering something for that long becomes probably the biggest issue, taking New Horizons as an example again it's unable to perform practical scientific observations further than around 55AU because the decreased power output from its RTG makes it difficult to run instruments and the increased distance hampering receiving data. The Voyagers are currently further than that, but they're only sending back minimal data with many of their instruments turned off.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the media says this planet orbits at 20x the distance to Uranus. Uranus has a 20 AU orbital radius, so that puts the planet at a 400 AU distance.</p>

<p>I believe the planet is theorized to have an orbit with high eccentricity, so 400 is probably just an average. I've read it gets as close to 200 AU to the sun, and as far as &gt;1000. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can anyone theorize about how such a large planet would have ended up with a perihelion so far out from the Sun?</p>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, but 200 AU is well beyond the range in which it could meaningfully interact with the other (known) large planets. So, if it originated so much closer to the sun--as I understand it--and was ejected, how could it have shed enough velocity when reapproaching the sun?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it have needed to interact with some other mass either near 200 AU, or somewhere else along its broad orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the 400 AU is what they estimate the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qJ7BfRM.jpg" target="_blank">semi-major axis</a> of the theorized orbit to be. Semi-major axis is the equivalent to the radius of a circle, if the circle was an ellipse and you were measuring between the two farthest points from the centre. In a circular orbit, the periapse, apoapse, semi-major and semi-minor axis would all be the same. For an elliptical orbit, the central point where the semi-major and semi-minor cross would be ahead, behind or off to the side (depending on your point in the orbit) of the celestial body you are orbiting.</p></div>		</li>
