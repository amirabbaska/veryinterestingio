			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree that it's all about the casing. There's a physics issue: some elements resulting from fission can absorb neutrons and thereby prevent further fission. If too many neutrons are absorbed, the fuel can't sustain a fission chain reaction (subcritical) and is useless. This is called &quot;poisoning&quot; of the fuel, and requires reprocessing (removing the fission products) to fix. Molten salt reactors would do constant reprocessing of the fuel at an on-site reprocessing plant. In theory current nuclear plants could use on-site reprocessing, but it would be harder since they would need to take apart the fuel rods in order to reach the fuel and the re-fabricate them. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit and preface: please read the comments below. I had a misunderstanding of the multiple kinds of reactors, and while molten sodium ones are prone to fires, molten salt reactors are much safer. Thanks to everyone who helped out!</p>
<p>Molten salt reactors are great! Until you get a fire. I am not against them, I am definitely pro nuclear power and vastly in favor of making more advanced plants. I just think it’s important to say that salt fires are the opposite of fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are confusing molten sodium metal and molten salt.<br />
Molten salts are extremely stable.  This is because the constituent atoms are very electronegative (fluorine) and electropositive (lithium,beryllium).
It takes a lot of energy to break their bonds and once you do they can simply recombine.  This is why they are so useful in reactors.  The neutron damage that occurs in other materials doesn't happen in molten salts.  This is why the fuel can be left in the reactor until it is largely consumed.  Comparatively, the fuel rods in a light water reactor must be removed after only a few percent of the fuel is consumed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people actually get sodium cooled and molten salt cooled mixed up, but MSRs are not nearly as reactive with oxygen as sodium is. All that would happen is the corrosion rate of the metals would increase, hence why they put effort into keeping oxygen out. </p></div>		</li>

<p>sodium chloride isn't the salt that's used in thorium molten salt reactors.</p></div>		</li>
