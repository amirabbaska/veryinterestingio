<p>This sounds very specific, do those two numbers mean something in this context?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember seeing somewhere (maybe it was Nova) that the coldest temperatures were achieved using laser cooling, and this was used to form BECs, it won the 2001 Nobel prize in physics? Is this something different or is the technique you mentioned newer/better/more effective?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The technique you are describing is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_cooling" target="_blank">Doppler cooling</a>. This method is rather different from magnetic refrigeration since it uses pulses of light to cool a sample instead of magnetic effects. The reason I discussed the other method was simply because it happened to produce the lowest temperature in a lab (as far as I know). With Doppler cooling you can also get things very cold, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_cooling#Limits" target="_blank">you do run into a limit</a> called the Doppler temperature.^(1) For example, for Rubidium this occurs at ~150*10^(-6) (150 microkelvin), quite a bit &quot;warmer&quot; than the record of 100*10^(-12)K I mentioned in my original post.</p>
<p>Having said that, I don't think it's fair to say that one method is better than another. There is still active research in both types of refrigeration as well as in additional methods. The trick is just to choose the right tool for the job you want. If you want to cool a gas down very low then laser cooling works really well, if you want to cool down chunks of magnetically active material close to zero-K than magnetic refrigeration is the way to go, etc, etc.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  For the sake of completeness, let me add that you can get below this limit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Doppler_cooling" target="_blank">using other laser cooling methods</a>, but it gets even more complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Edit.</strong> My answer above was incomplete. As /u/Nje1987 describes below, to see Bose-Einstein condensates you have to go down below the Doppler temperature by combining the laser cooling I described above with another technique called [evaporative cooling](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooling_(atomic_physics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooling_(atomic_physics</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually to achieve condensation you have to go well below the temperatures laser cooling can get you to. You have to use what is termed evaporation, where you essentially preferentially lose high energy atoms from your trap in order to cool down. The development of these techniques and subsequent research on condensates was what won the 2001 prize. Recently, temperatures as low as 50 pK have been demonstrated with atomic vapor of rubidium. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you do the maths it turns out that Doppler techniques can still get you below to sub-Doppler temperatures through a method called <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/sisyphus_cooling.html" target="_blank">&quot;sisyphus cooling&quot;</a>. As far as I know, this method was discovered completely by accident, as the group only used a Doppler stage and didn't expect sub-Doppler temperatures at all!</p>
<p>All of that said, I think sisyphus only gets you down to the nanokelvin regime with rubidium so you still need an evaporative, low-power trapping scheme to achieve picokelvin.</p></div>		</li>
