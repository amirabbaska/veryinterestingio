			<div class="markdown"><p>Also many populations don't have balanced diets and have pretty ok life spans. The Inuits can live quite happily on a 90% meat diet while the Indian do fine with nothing but vegetables. The in the developed world we are probably encouraged to eat a balanced diet because poplar processed foods have less nutrients than we need. They have to add vitamins back into bread because it loses do many in the processing of the wheat. </p></div>		</li>

<p>About 30% of Indians are vegetarians, but even they eat dairy which supplements their B12 and some other vitamins difficult to get in plants. Being 100% vegan is not very common anywhere. </p>
<p>Doesn't invalidate your point I was just throwing that out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had the pleasure of working with some very old people. A 72year old man died under my management. He was the hardest worker I had too. He didn't have to work, he needed to feel productive. I spent many a philosophical hour with him. He only drank water &quot;It is the only thing that can wash out your insides,&quot; he would say. He had a diet limited by weight, no more than a pound a day. If the food was heavy it is likely not good for you. And finally he had a size limit too. His food for the day had to fit in a child size lunchbox. The good steel kind you only see in novelty stores. His had the Lone Ranger on it plastered with Union stickers. That was his diet, but I think his philosophy is what kept him living and not just alive.</p>
<p>He told me he retired in his late 50's to spend time with his wife and go places and see things and be people of the world together. Soon after his only son died with his family in a horrible freeway pile up. This is a sadness I can not imagine. He tells me he wanted to have more children and in between feeling grief and regret he was feeling resentment to his wife. She sent him back to work, because she knew him and loved him and knew the distraction of work would settle even this grief as it had other lesser times in the past. Again, he said he retired at 68, 10 years back to work and he was comfortable with himself again. And now with less time and more money, they were going to travel. But, after two short holidays she fell I'll had a stroke, comma, &amp; died. He threw himself back to work immediately, she would have wanted it. He said, &quot;a person needs a purpose, a belonging, a reason to continue.&quot; He would also say, &quot;if I stop moving I'm probably dead. I don't stop moving.&quot;</p>
<p>The rest of this has nothing to do with longevity, I just have to finish the story.</p>
<p>He one day found me out on the floor and asked to go home early. He had never been sick under my management that I recalled and the punk kids I had would just disappear without saying boo. I let him go of course and never saw him again. His sister called after a week to say he passed that last night I saw him &amp; enquire about any remaining pay. She said he was in bed but had his coveralls on. He had his lunchbox uneaten when she found him. I didn't get an invite to a funeral. We were coworkers at best. But I decided I wanted to go out like this guy. Being productive till the end. I won't be my dad (still alive) and holed up in his house because he retired to early. My dad loved what he did, but retired as early as possible, afraid now to live life because his fixed income. I love what I do too, I don't have any hobbies that I would rather be doing just like my dad. I'm going to keep moving, because if I don't I'm probably dead. I also eat shit food just like my dad. Dieing early hasn't worked out for him.</p></div>		</li>
