			<div class="markdown"><p>To break (most) standard-thickness sized car windows, especially with a blunt object, and in this specific instance, a metal tipped baton... </p>
<p>You need to flick the wrist back upon impact. A single forceful swinging motion that carries the inertia and follows it through on the forward stroke isn't bueno at all. Flicking is better. Just for your future reference, because medical bills suck to get unexpectedly or otherwise.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would only break if the window wasn't closed all the way. When they are closed, they distribute the force along the edge of the glass into the car body. If you lower the window, you reduce the amount of contact, making the glass more vulnerable to shattering.</p></div>		</li>
