Look at one finger as close as you can to your eye while still being crystal clear focused, focused edges.
Hold up two fingers in the background and put them together, you can see the dark lines forming again.</p>
<p>Conclusion: it has to do with unfocused edges overlapping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most correct answer I've seen.</p>
<p>The light/dark areas OP calls &quot;lines&quot; are simply where the out of focus &quot;cross eyed&quot; images are aligning.</p>
<p>If you slowly draw your 2 fingers away from your eyeball while maintaining focus on a distant object, you will eventually observe the &quot;line&quot; splitting and re-merging with the two independent fingers.</p></div>		</li>
