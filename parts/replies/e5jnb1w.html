			<div class="markdown"><p>Randall Munroe actually did a really comprehensive explanation of what would happen in his book what if. Tldr for lots of those is that it doesn't end well. In this particular case the crazy high speed winds rip anything not underground up, only those at the poles or in underground bunkers would live</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only the poles? Doesn’t the perceived rotational speed decrease as one moves away from the equator towards the poles. So the chaos would be greatest at equator and be reduced more and more the further away one goes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However you'd rocket off at 1000 mph and probably gain quite a bit of altitude too....and then we'd all come crashing back down.  It wouldnt be pretty</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably wouldn't gain any altitude, or imperceptibly little. You'd fly off <em>exactly</em> tangent to the surface of the Earth. You'd hit an obstacle or hill first. Consider, how far would you move in one second? Then consider how far you can fall in one second. You'd be ground into the ground. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would not gain altitude.  Since you have not achieved orbital velocity, gravity will pull you into the ground faster than your momentum will pull you away on the tangent vector.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If Earth were to spin fast enough for its equator exceeding escape velocity, it would have partially disintegrated. The centrifugal force would exceed gravity near the equator and make it appear as if there is negative gravity with everything flying into space. The planet itself would get somewhat flattened at the poles, shedding some of its mass into space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's the momentum you already have, it's just that the Earth is moving at the same rate as you. But yes, if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning, then you would suddenly be moving very fast compared to the Earth's surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And your momentum would be essentially 'horizontal' right? So you wouldn't just be tossed away from the ground, but at a tangent to the earth's curvature, and you've still go gravity, so you're just going to get shot across the ground basically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a much smaller scale, I'm reminded of an accident involving the attack submarine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_San_Francisco_(SSN-711)" target="_blank">USS San Francisco</a> which struck a seamount while moving at nearly 35 knots.</p>
<p>For those inside the sub, in their own reference frame, they would have felt relatively motionless, like sitting in an office building. When the sub struck the side of an undersea mountain and came to an abrupt stop everyone on that sub was suddenly hurled at the nearest bulkhead at nearly 40 mph.</p>
<p>Everyone on board was injured, though amazingly only one sailor died. </p></div>		</li>

<p>After all, the planet takes a full day to spin 360 degrees. That's basically sitting still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact in your discourse: escape velocity = earth's circumference / 1 hour. Is this just coincidence, or is there something magical about the moving the distance of the planetary circumference in 1 hour that makes it the escape velocity?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Astrokiwi" target="_blank">Astrokiwi</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah it's a coincidence. The rotation speed at the equator happens to be about 5% of escape velocity, which is ~1/20th. We divided the day into 24 chunks because 24 is a nice number with a lot of factors. 1/20th is just sort of close-ish to 1/24th.</p>
<p>Venus has about the same escape velocity as Earth, but is tidally locked and rotates once every 240 days. The rotation speed at the equator of Venus is about 6,000 times lower than its escape velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Venus isn’t actually tidally locked. Its rotational period is longer than its orbital period, meaning that its day is actually longer than its year. </p>
<p>Mercury, however, is tidally locked. It’s not a 1:1 resonance though it’s a 3:2 resonance which is still considered tidally locked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha! Just a coincidence (it's also not precise). The units end up the same, which is helpful, you're going to have a speed when you calculate EV, and circumference/hr is a speed.</p>
<p>And EV is based (in part) on the radius, and circumference is as well, of course, so you've got at least one common variable. But it stops there.</p>
<p>The mass of an object affects EV, so if the planet was denser or lighter, the relationship would be thrown off without the circumference changing. The hour is also arbitrary here.</p></div>		</li>
