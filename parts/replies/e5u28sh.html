			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question: a while back I switched almost entirely to Vibram &quot;toe shoes&quot; which have no inclined heel. I started working on improving my posture through stretching of muscles and releasing their opposites on a daily (okay maybe at least several times a week) basis.</p>
<p>The new warehouse we're using at work banned them, so I went back to normal running shoes with an inclined heel. Almost immediately I noticed my lower back hurt at the end of each day where it hadn't before. I can't imagine it would be anything else, but could standing and walking with the higher heeled, more unstable sole take its toll on the lower back?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had you spent anytime on the new warehouse floor before needing to make the shoe switch? If its a hard surface(concrete, etc.) that could also be the problem. </p>
<p>Otherwise, it could be the shoe change. Heels cause you to lean forward slightly, which forces your back to curve more so that you stand up straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered why my job never seemed to get easier on my lower back. Some days I walk some days I sit all day long yet no matter which one I do it always seems my lower back is sore by the end of the day. After years of service I assumed the muscle groups would get stronger yet this has yet to happen for me.</p></div>		</li>
