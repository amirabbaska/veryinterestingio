			<div class="markdown"><p>So where does the energy &quot;boost&quot; come from? I understand that &quot;caffeine stops your body from feeling tired&quot; but that sounds like you would just continue to feel normal. But when most people drink coffee, they feel more energized than the moment before. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The not ELI5 is that caffeine also causes more calcium to release in muscle cells. This calcium bonds to parts of muscle cells to contract the muscle. So with caffeine you have more/stronger muscle contractions, at every muscle where caffeine is present, including the heart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I didn't know that bit. Are the effects of caffeine on muscle training well characterized? In other words, has caffeine ingestion before regular weight-lifting regiments been quantified in terms of 'gainz'?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of exhaustion like pain. Morphine doesn't make the pain go away, you simply can't feel it. Likewise caffeine doesn't make the exhaustion go away, you simply can't feel it.</p>
<p>In both cases, it's more ideal to not be injured or exhausted than it is to chemically dull your symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know for sure, but it could be because caffeine increases circulation / blood flow. How you feel is kind of relative too. If you felt tired and now feel less tired, you're effectively energized.</p></div>		</li>
