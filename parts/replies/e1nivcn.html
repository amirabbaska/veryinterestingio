			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the second thing we tested, in the first <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/01/16/013896" target="_blank">report</a> of a CRISPR-based gene drive (the first was that our containment safeguards worked). We wanted to be sure that it is possible to undo the changes caused by a gene drive with a second one that overwrites the first, which we call a “reversal drive”. Technically, you would want an “immunizing reversal” drive that overwrites the unwanted change and immunizes the unaffected population against it. It may indeed be wise to have one of these available before releasing a self-propagating gene drive <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/33423" target="_blank">anticipated</a> to spread to most populations of the target species. </p>
<p>A major area of our current research is on our <a href="http://www.sculptingevolution.org/daisydrives" target="_blank">daisy drive</a> <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/06/057307" target="_blank">technology</a> (which should finally be published very soon). This creates a daisy-chain of genetic links, each of which uses CRISPR to cause the next in the chain to be copied. Since the link on the end isn’t copied, it’s a normal engineered gene, meaning half the offspring don’t inherit it. That causes the next link to be lost, then the next, and so on. A daisy drive is self-exhausting because it depends on these daisy links as “genetic fuel”. We’re working to build a daisy immunizing reversal drive and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/21/115618" target="_blank">combine</a> it with frequency-dependence, which we hope will allow us to remove any given engineered gene from a wild population. If successful, rogue gene editing or even gene drives would become much like graffiti: annoying, but erasable. (Taking a break for a bit after this, but I’ll be back later tonight to answer more questions - thanks all!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey another study (published by Kenneth Oye and Kevin Esvelt) provided a nice overview of some regulatory points for gene drives <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6197/626.full" target="_blank">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6197/626.full</a>. Also, NASM published a book called gene drives on the horizon which provides a nice overview of gene drive technology (research, case studies, regulation, governance, application, human interest etc) <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK379277/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK379277/</a> However, the ETC did point out a few risks that were not addressed in this report <a href="http://www.etcgroup.org/content/stop-gene-bomb-etc-group-comment-nas-report-gene-drives" target="_blank">http://www.etcgroup.org/content/stop-gene-bomb-etc-group-comment-nas-report-gene-drives</a> </p></div>		</li>
