			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks alot, you really opened my mind about the need for sleeping. I do feel a constant kind of &quot;pressure&quot; on my head. I guess it's because I am sleep deprived.  </p>
<p>One question though, considering I naturally wake up after 9 and half hours without an alarm, is it still bad if I cut it to 7 hours, in your honest opinion?</p>
<p>Thanks alot!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Answer is always: it depends. 8 is ideal, 7 is okay. 6 is not good, 5 is terrible. But mostly it depends on your body. If 9.5 hrs is what your body craves then take 9.5 hrs. After that you're at your peak. But make sure that you're always getting at least 7. You probably won't need 9.5 but you could be so deprived atm your body wants this. It all depends.</p>
<p>Also remember that you won't see results immediately. &quot;Catching up&quot; to sleep is not going to work. You need consistency. Think marathon, not sprint.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll try to get 7 hours regularly, but is there a specific way to check or calculate my normal sleep requirement, like maybe a Sleep tracking app, or should I not trust those? I fear sleeping without an alarm as I risk oversleeping. However I guess that would give me an idea how much I need if I do it consistently. </p>
<p>Another way I could imagine is sleeping maybe 3 hours early of what I think I might need (say 7h), and if I wake up too early, I can just start working at that time. If I wake up sleeping 10 hours regularly, that's okay too I would have known how much sleep I need. Not sure if I phrased that well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The ideal way to determine your sleep need is to see how long you sleep without waking up with an alarm.</p>
<p>If you want to improve your sleep, it's more important to have a set Wake time then a set bed-time to regulate your circadian rythm.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the length of time needed to sleep and feel &quot;rested&quot; then there are some factors to consider. One is your circadian rythm. Night Owls / Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome people who go to bed earlier, even if they manage to get to sleep, will have lighter and more fragmented sleep during the first part of the night until they get close to their &quot;natural&quot; bed time. Even with the use of melatonin. Regular Bright Light therapy in the morning can &quot;push back&quot; the circadian rythm however.</p>
<p>As well avoiding electronic devices or strong light 2 hours before bed prevents melatonin suppression and consequent lighter fragmented sleep. This is preferable to trying to just take &quot;more&quot; melatonin OTC because your body just flushes it with your regular melatonin. Blue Light Blocking Glasses that fully cover your field of vision are the only really significant option if you must use electronic devices close to bed.</p>
<p>A healthy sleep environment with the absolute least amount of light and possible environmental disruptions is a must. Even a brief arousal that doesn't cause you to wake up can disrupt your sleep cycle and result in you missing deeper restorative stages.</p>
<p>Reducing stress associated with your sleep environment is huge. Three key points - Your bed is only for sleeping and sex, to prevent associating it with anything else.</p>
<p>You only go to bed when you're sleepy, trying to sleep is contraindicated because it actually stimulates you when you focus on something. It's better to just go to bed later and wake at the same time as usual because then you should be tired at the appropriate time the next night. </p>
<p>Finally since once again trying to sleep doesn't help, if you are awake in bed still after 30 minutes get up and out of bed and do a light non-stimulating activity until you feel sleepy again and then return to bed. This prevents associating frustration and wakefulness with your bed and also distracts your brain from focusing and agitating itself because of the failure to sleep, allowing it to relax and enter the sleep state.</p>
<p>The last thing you can do is see a sleep doctor and be screened for primary sleep disorders. Some, like High Upper Airway Resistance or Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, aren't screen able by respiratory therapists or respirologists using at home sleep apnea screening studies and mat result in false positives for mild OSA. Other issues like hyper-vigilance or alpha intrusion require EEG screening. Finally chronic pain or mood disorders such as depression or GAD can affect pts sleep need. It's quite common for people to be in denial about these issues however they are one of the things sleep physicians are trained to screen for and they might offer something like Seroquel or more likely Trazodone which do have sedative effects but also can help regulate patients moods if they're treatment resistant regarding possible mood disorders. </p>
<p>Essentially sleep is complicated and the only way to be able to reduce your sleep need is to ensure you are getting optimal quality contiguous sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this informative post!</p>
<p>I did do EEG a month ago, and no problems were shown, also did a brain MRI scan, and complete CT scan. Got prescribed Seroquel for lack of focus but the doctor was not convinced I had some attention problem, he linked it to sleep deprivation. I did not take Seroquel because my psychiatrist said it may be too strong for my age, I got prescribed Quietapine and Wellbutrin instead. 3 weeks in, and no improvement in mood/sleep. </p></div>		</li>
