			<div class="markdown"><p>Former prosecutor:</p>
<p>California's statute is actually pretty narrow. Florida's stalking statute has two parts: credible threat (basically the same as California's), or repeated violation of an injunction, no contact order, etc.</p>
<p>Most of the stalking charges we deal with are the second type (victim is harassed/followed by stalker, gets a restraining order, stalker continues to stalk victim)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The jury instructions are usually more helpful to look at than the actual statute. Here are the instructions for stalking:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The defendant willfully and maliciously harassed or willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly followed another person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The defendant made a credible threat with the intent to place the other person in reasonable fear for (his/her) safety [or for the safety of (his/her) immediate family].</p>
</li>
<li>The defendant's conduct was not constitutionally protected.</li>
</ol>
<p>A credible threat is one that causes the target of the threat to reasonably fear for his or her safety [or for the safety of his or her immediate family] and one that the maker of the threat appears to be able to carry out.</p>
<p>A credible threat may be made orally, in writing, or electronically or may be implied by a pattern of conduct or a combination of statements and conduct.</p>
<p>Harassing means engaging in a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that seriously annoys, alarms, torments, or terrorizes the person and that serves no legitimate purpose. A course of conduct means two or more acts occurring over a period of time, however short, demonstrating a continuous purpose.</p>
<p>Someone commits an act willfully when he or she does it willingly or on purpose.</p>
<p>Someone acts maliciously when he or she intentionally does a wrongful act or when he or she acts with the unlawful intent to disturb, annoy, or injure someone else.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to remember that while a lot of celebrities claim to hate the paps, some actually do business with them.</p>
<p>It's been well reported that many of the candid/secret shots of the Beckhams were all by the same photographer - basically he had a deal with them, and they would all get a share of the sale of the pictures. </p>
<p>I think Paris Hilton used to do something like this too. The lower league celebrities just need the exposure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's likely, considering the statute's language, however, it's still a crime to harass, which may not have the element that the victim has to fear for their safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the wording of that law either this is true in California or they'll just assume the perpetrator was trying to scare the victim purposely if it's a pattern of behavior.</p>
<p>That is interesting, though. I have a feeling that language probably isn't universal. It may even be a protection against things like paranoid people assuming they're being stalked by someone who lives in the same neighborhood as them and works in the same neighborhood as them. </p></div>		</li>

Why the massive zoom lens for a tit shot when bathing on a private beach?  Why do people continue to buy the publications?</p></div>		</li>
