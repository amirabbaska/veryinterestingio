<p>Many people that have suffered a heart attack are left with a damaged heart. They can mostly fix that by reinvigorating the heart with stem cells. It's only a matter of time before we can use similar techniques on things like hearing, diabetes, vision and stroke. (Brain damage can already be treated this way, just not very fully at all)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: so it seems stem cell research is coming along. I was just lazy and went off of what I heard a while ago and was going off of very incomplete information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Virtually all the major break through are with adult stem cells, which don't have the restrictions embryonic ones do.  It is best anyway.  It is just a matter of time before we can just use someone's own cells.  You don't want to have enough donations in a lab somewhere when someone needs them.  Research is best directed in adult stem cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you're right. They already have implantable beta cells that produce insulin, they just haven't come up with a safe way to protect it from your immune system. People have been 'cured' but have to be on immune-suppressant drugs for the rest of their life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but there's some research to suggest that fasting/fasting mimicking diets are able to &quot;reset&quot; the immune system, in mice at least. Furthermore, it seems that it may also have an impact on the gut microbiota, that's been implicated in T1DM pathogenesis. </p>
<p>As I understand it, pancreatic cells <em>can</em> regenerate, but at a slower rate than they are attacked by auto antibodies.</p>
<p>Resetting the immune system then stem cell therapy (using induced pluripotent stem cells, adult &quot;self&quot; cells) would be the best way from what I understand of stem cells and the immune system. </p>
<p>It's possible that dietary restriction may work in some people too, but the factors in the gut are not fully elucidated yet and this is where a lot of research is going, on understanding host:microbe relationships and how our microbes affect disease state. Hth!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't know about stem cells, but if autoimmune diseases are written in genes, we can probably fix it by fixing genes, can't we? Are there any experiments done on rats?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not limited. The problem with brain damage is that brain cells grow much slower than scar tissue, and scar tissue is too thick for the brain cells to grow through. So basically the brain puts up permanent road blocks before the road can get repaired.</p></div>		</li>
