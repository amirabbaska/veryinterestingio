			<div class="markdown"><p>Pre-rinse is good, but you want to leave a bit of sauce, at least. I scrape rice and egg, big chunks of meat, and anything that I wouldn't swallow voluntarily. All the other food gets swallowed up by the machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that dishwashers are mostly applied chemistry not applied hydrology.  The detergent is what does the work, not the water pressure, so the machine itself is about how to use the detergent most effectively.  </p>
<p>I've also read that it's taken a while for detergent makers a while to get a formulation as or more effective than the old formulations that relied on phosphates.  </p>
<p>So there's kind of a weird dynamic where dishwashers were designed with more effective phosphate detergents, then the designs adapted to be effective with less effective detergents (which probably added run time) and then as detergents have recently gotten better, the machines have probably begun to slightly reduce cycle times. And all the while, they have been trying to design machines that use less energy AND water. </p>
<p>I'm on my third machine in the 18 years I've lived here.  The most recent one is about 3 years old and I think it's faster than the last by about 20 minutes and probably the most effective one.   But it's hard to know where the improvement is, but my guess would be on the detergent side.  We use those little paks and they seem ideal for delivering both the optimal total amount of detergent and the optimal mix of chemicals which might be more difficult in either a single powder or liquid.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern detergents use enzymes to clean, so they actually need food to kick off the process. The water spray does help, and it's needed to clean off the dishes, but it's the enzyme and surfactant properties of soap that does most of the work. </p>
<p>It is more efficient to run the dishwasher every night, with only scraping off dishes, than to run it every 2-3 days with rinsed dishes. Presumably, there would also be enough room to put the pots in there too, rather than hand wash those (I've lost this argument every time with my wife, and I'm a former appliance engineer too).</p>
<p>The caveat is that the dishes can't have dried food on them them (especially egg), so again, every night. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't even get my wife to load the machine in a way that doesn't result in poor water flow.</p>
<p>I agree with you about the pots and pans, too, but IMHO dishwashers are pretty inflexible about internal organization.  I'd like to see an ISO standard for dishware, pots and pans and dishwasher racks...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every goddamn (home) dishwasher I've ever used, from ultra-cheap apartment crap to my current supposedly decent Jenn-Air has done an absolute shit job unless the dishes are essentially &quot;cleaned&quot; before putting them in.  There would ALWAYS be bits of food that stayed in the machine and ended up dried and stuck to at least a few of the &quot;clean&quot; dishes.  Piss on that, I'll continue to pre-wash my dishes. I figure I'm not doing it right unless it's hard to tell if the dishwasher has been run or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a Kenmore that's got this like turbo boost feature. I can put a pan with baked on crap from the oven in (facing the back which us where the turbo jets are) and pull it out sparkly clean. I laughed at the sales guy but was beyond shocked when it actually worked. I clear solids but don't rinse my dishes at all. Also I use the little finish tabs that are blue and white with a red ball.  When I used the powder or gel stuff we had issues.</p>
<p>Source: have two kids and love to cook. Sometimes I run the dishwasher twice a day.</p></div>		</li>

If I so much as miss half a noodle when loading said noodle will sure as hell be stuck to a drinking glass at the end of the cycle. Sigh. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a whirlpool dishwasher made for Sears. I have the same feature, they call it target clean. It works great on those 9x13 glass baking dishes! Macaroni and cheese bits come right off. I actually think whirlpool makes a great cleaning dishwasher, but all the racking pieces fall apart in short order. </p></div>		</li>

There must be some mysterious dishwasher buyers guide somewhere that I’m missing. I’ve tried consumer reports so that ain’t it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why use the dishwasher at all then? Seems you pre-wash them right after use and/or soaking (so no caked-on food), and use detergent and sponge, so all that's left is put 'em on a rack and air dry, right? Honest question, because growing up where I live I'm used to hand washing.</p></div>		</li>
