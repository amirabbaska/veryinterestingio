<p>However after, the six pack was like two of the cans in the middle had been pulled apart.</p>
<p>I'm 40 and this is still the case. The muscles are there, but the connective tissue is not.</p>
<p>That's because it's connective tissue, not muscle, that protects from diastasis recti. Even body builders can get it, if they are predisposed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for pointing out that diastisis recti is not inevitable. I have 2 under 2 and after both babies I had a gap of less than 1 cm. My core certainly is not what it used to be, but it's strong enough to do what I need it to, and I'm not limited in the types of activities I can do. I'm sure it's mostly genetics. But having a baby won't necessarily destroy your abs. </p></div>		</li>
