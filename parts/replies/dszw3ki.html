			<div class="markdown"><p>The way banks usually try to sell me on a savings account is they say it's safer to not keep all your money in an accessible place like your checking account in case someone steals your debit card/pin. Is this a realistic precaution?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  Especially with many institutions offering web banking and easier access to savings, it's a great way to prevent fraudsters from accessing all of your hard earned funds. </p>
<p>Whenever you send a check through mail or use your debit card, you are putting your sensitive information out there for people to potentially access. But having a savings account that you do not access daily with a bulk of your &quot;long term&quot; money in it, you are protecting your wealth if someone ever misuses your information that is put into the world. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should never have any money at all in a savings account. If you're ever thinking of putting money into a savings account put it into an investment account instead. Even buying a Treasury bond is better than savings. If you can't handle the three or four days of illiquidity that an investment account includes then that money should be in your checking account. </p>
<p>In a savings account you are losing money every month as the interest rate isn't even close to keeping up with inflation. You're just flushing your money down the toilet for no reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck yes. I have customers who open 'dummy accounts' just for PayPal transactions, etc. They've been burned enough times that they'll transfer over the exact amount when they make an online purchase, and only that amount. Then, if their account is compromised, the fraudster isn't getting anything. </p></div>		</li>
