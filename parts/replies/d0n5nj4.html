			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but it's not steam that's being fed into the European grids but hot water. I sort of thought that's what OP is asking but I'm really confused after reading this thread. Is OP really wondering what district heating is or is he asking why they use steam in NYC instead of hot water like in the rest of the world...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had the same understanding that the question is about why is NY using steam rather than central hot water as most other countries.
It seems more efficient to run hot water system as the power plants waste heat can be lower temp and so more energy can be harvested for primary (electric) generation. Distribution losses are lesser too.
Also does this mean that every building has its own heat-exchanger or how do they keep in house radiators at safe temperatures below 60 C degrees.
Unfortunately I did not find answers in this thread yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Found it finally: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating#Heat_distribution" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating#Heat_distribution</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The common medium used for heat distribution is water or pressurized hot water, but steam is also used. The advantage of steam is that in addition to heating purposes it can be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature. The disadvantage of steam is a higher heat loss due to the high temperature. Also, the thermal efficiency of cogeneration plants is significantly lower if the cooling medium is high-temperature steam, reducing electric power generation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: So what I got from this thread was that, NYC is using it because of the benefit of using steam in industrial processes, NYC steam system was build long time ago and maybe that Americans are too stubborn to change their way of things.</p></div>		</li>
