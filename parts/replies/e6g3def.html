The bolt occurs once two feelers meet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Feelers are composed of the collective charges that are being drawn towards the opposing charges from the storm. And these feelers branch out from the highest points (lowest for the top), this is why we are told to stay low and away from trees. It is also possible to tell when a bolt is about to strike, as you will feel your hair stand on end as the charges gather for the oncoming strike. Advice is to get as low as possible and cover your head, it's a small chance but this change in height may divert the bolts to meet elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is easier to avoid harm by picturing charges coming up from the ground.  It's an electrostatic ground pulse that is pretty widespread too.  I've been a few hundred feet away from a strike and had my hair jump.</p></div>		</li>
