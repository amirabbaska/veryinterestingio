			<div class="markdown"><p>okay this is making more sense now. Hypertrophic exercise is actually tearing and rebuilding the parts of the muscle that engorge with water(or glycogen to be specific) to allow more contraction strength, and not necessarily training the fibers themselves to grow larger in diameter, or is my reading of that off? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's not exact. Sometimes bad at explaining stuff because I forget or guess wrong what somebody might already know. Let me try clarifying.</p>
<p>A muscle fiber is made of bundles of muscles cells (myocytes), which are basically long tube shaped cells filled with the normal stuff cells have (cytoplasm generally, but sarcoplasm specifically, in this case), and also myofibrils, the parts that contract.</p>
<p>Hypertrophy inducing training exhausts the muscle cells, draining all their reserves to the point of damage. This signals the body so that when the cell is repaired, it will be reconstructed with more sarcoplasm, which can't easily be more dense than it already is, so the cell has to be made larger in diameter too. Even at rest the endurance enhanced muscle fiber is larger than other muscles.</p>
<p>More sarcoplasm allows the muscle to do more work without being exhausted because it has more glycogen storage space, but also more ATP storage, more oxygen storage, more mitochondria to use the oxygen and glycogen, etc. Hypertrophy allows more <em>endurance</em>: the same strength of contraction, but more times before exhaustion.</p>
<p>More &quot;strength&quot; oriented training does not tend to make the muscles much larger because it rebuilds cells so that they have extra myofibrils, which can be packed densely, unlike sarcoplasm. More myofibrils means more contraction strength.</p>
<p>Of course, another point of confusion is that there's no such thing as pure strength lifting or pure hypertrophy lifting. If you're lifting to the point where repair (and thus adaptation) is required, both will be improved, just one more than the other based on the type. I'll add that to my first post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>understood. so the demand for ATP is what drives the &quot;size&quot; as much as the demand for myofibril increases &quot;strength&quot;; and heavier weights at lower reps, puts a larger demand on myofibril production during repairs, than ATP stores, and vice versa</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have a source on that mate?</p>
<p>read below:</p>
<p>In accordance with the principles of training specificity, resistance and endurance training induce distinct muscular adaptations. <strong>Endurance training</strong>, for example, decreases the activity of the glycolytic enzymes, but <strong>increases</strong> intramuscular substrate stores, oxidative enzyme activities, and capillary, as well as <strong>mitochondrial density</strong>. In contrast, <strong>resistance or strength training reduces mitochondrial density</strong>, while marginally impacting capillary density, metabolic enzyme activities and intramuscular substrate stores (except muscle glycogen). The training modalities do induce one common muscular adaptation: they transform type IIb myofibres into IIa myofibres. <strong>This transformation is coupled with opposite changes in fibre size (resistance training increases, and endurance training decreases, fibre size), and, in general, myofibre contractile properties.</strong></p>

<p>Much like how skin that is worked raw by physical labour or hours of guitar practice will toughen up with microscopic collagen fibers to grow calluses, muscle cells (often called &quot;muscle fibers&quot;) will respond to being torn down by growing more contractile protein fibers within the muscle (called &quot;myofibrils&quot;) so that after healing the muscle has a greater capacity to exert force.</p>
<p>Imagine a Boeing 747 being dragged across a tarmac in neutral gear by a small army of 100 midgets pulling their own individual ropes, and this is a metaphor for your muscle.  After being torn down, say a few of the midgets' ropes snap, not only does your muscle repair those snapped ropes it responds by attaching a few new additional ropes and hiring more midgets so you end up with an army of 102 midgets.  You work out again, tear down, repair, and the next week you get an army of 104 midgets, and 106, and 108, and so on, and so on, until you have an army of 500 midgets with 500 ropes who can collectively pull 5 planes across the tarmac.</p>
<p>This would be called &quot;myofibrillar&quot; hypertrophy and happens more with low-rep, high-resistance training.  The sarcoplasmic hypertrophy more associated with low-resistance, high-repetition training would be more akin to upgrading all of the midgets from only a 1/2 liter water bottle and a few crackers in their backpacks for their job of dragging 747's across the tarmac all day, to instead getting them all a few bottles of gatorade and a 2 liter water bladder on their backs to help them do more work.</p>
<p>In that second scenario their total mass has increased because of the load in their backpacks, but there's still only 100 of them so they aren't any stronger as an army, but thanks to the additional fuel and water they'll be able to do more work at the end of the day.</p>
<p>EDIT: I can't take credit for the midget metaphor. It was inspired by this ridiculous one-off special on cable TV years ago: <a href="https://youtu.be/VHf05dXzdEQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/VHf05dXzdEQ</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>as a greek, allow me to am confuse :|</p>
<p>sarca is flesh (as in sarcophagous) and plasma is &quot;something that has been made&quot; but is commonly used to refer to &quot;living organisms&quot; <em>or</em> &quot;fake things&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LOL, thank you. I was attempting humor, especially since I didn't remember and didn't want to look up what -plasm actually meant. &quot;sarco-&quot; does seem to be used a lot to refer to muscle and muscle components though. Plasma is also a cognate of plastic, from a meaning like &quot;something that has been/is capable of being molded&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>exactly! πλάθω means &quot;to knead/make/mold&quot;. Πλάση is &quot;all that has been made/molded&quot;/&quot;all of creation&quot;. Πλάσμα is &quot;that which came into existence by molding&quot;/&quot;a creation&quot;. You, as a person, can be affectionately called πλάσμα, as in you, too, are a <em>creation</em> of god (nature, brahma, or whatever), able to feel pain, love, etc and deserve to be treated respectfully. In the context of medicine, it means something slightly different however.</p>
