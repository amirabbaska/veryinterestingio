<p>There are debates about the <em>interpretation</em> of these phenomena, but very little doubt about the outcomes of experiments.</p></div>		</li>

He said that there was research into <em>how</em> the electrons communicate - i.e. a delineation of a mechanism underlying the process that is more complete or more generalising. This is a totally valid goal that a scientist could have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is exactly what the Copenhagen interpretation of QM does not predict, which is why Einstein in the EPR paper said QM must be incomplete.</p>
<p>If you measure an isolated particle, its properties should be random. However if you &quot;know&quot; that it was part of a system with bulk properties that you do know, such as zero total spin, then measurement of the other particle must give the opposite result due to conservation laws.</p>
<p>The mystery remains that the two independent measurements appear to  not give random results, but give correlated results, even if the two people measuring are not aware of one another, or the original system.</p>
<p>EPR suggested there must be hidden variables, carrying the true value that is not random. Bell rules out some mechanisms for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I may be able to answer your question in a different way that may help.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics is a system of mechanics/physics based in math.  The reason people are struggling to answer is that these behaviors were predicted by math but we don't necessarily understand the physical mechanism that causes it.</p>
<p>That is, the math says it will happen, but we don't necessarily understand the full meaning of that math.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>We've built a mathematical model that makes accurate predictions, which means we understand the mechanism. We understand how it works. We've modeled it. We can make predictions based on that model and we find them reproduced in nature.</p>
<p>What you are conflating this with is the fact that our model uses some basic assumptions and it doesn't explain those assumptions. No model does explain the foundation it's built on. That's not a flaw of the model and is not one of its task.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of you making the assumption that the probabilistic wave-function isn't physical. It's pretty straightforward how two waves interfere in a particular way to result in entangled states. Though, I suppose, the mechanism describing the collapse of the wave function is pretty mysterious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the answer you gave is highly simplified but perhaps you can expand on it? </p>
<p>I read it like this:</p>
<p>You have two numbers of unknown value. But you know that they sum to zero. You inspect one of them randomly and its value is +1. Magically the other value will always be -1. </p>
<p>This doesn't really seem like &quot;entanglement&quot; to me as opposed to... math? </p>
<p>That said, my understanding of the mystery is that if you change the charge of one of the electrons, the other will flip to keep the sum to zero still.</p>
<p>If that's the case, my follow-up would be is there a time delay (speed of light) or is it instantaneous? If instant, could we use quantum entanglement - theoretically - to glimpse inside a black hole?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, you're thinking of it in terms of lack of information. Which was a theory for quite some time.</p>
<p>It is just simple math that if you have conservation of, say, spin or charge, you start out with zero, and produce two particles, if one is +1, the other must be -1. Simple, and completely explainable by replacing &quot;superposition&quot; with &quot;this particle is either +1 or -1, I just don't know yet&quot;.</p>
<p>Turns out it doesn't work that way.</p>
<p>Say you take one of these particles and put in a situation where it would behave differently if it's +1 vs -1. Certainly it'll behave one way or the other, right? But it doesn't. It behaves in a third way that's characteristic of a mix of the +1 and -1 states. (This is a gross oversimplification, so bear with me.) That's the superposed state. It's not the +1 or -1 state, it's not 0, it's not &quot;I don't know&quot;. It's it's own weird thing.</p>
<p>So, both your particles are in this superposed state (but opposite phase), so they'll behave similarly in this test that shows they're superposed. But then you measure one of the particles directly, and you find it's +1. From then on, it acts like just a +1. Superposed state is gone now. Further, you know that the other particle must be -1, even though you've done nothing to it.</p>
<p>There was a lot of argument about this in the early quantum days. The &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; doesn't fit well with how the rest of physics works. Einstein didn't buy this behavior. Bell came up with an empirical test that shows that it's true. (Again, I'm summarizing heavily.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you measure particle a and find it is +1, and now acts like it's +1 instead of superposed....does particle b start acting like -1 instead of superposed based on the observation of particle a?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, it's not just that it was always +1 and we just hadn't measured it yet. It really was that it hadn't decided yet itself but, now that it has, the other has to start being the other one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you saying that the moment you observe it being +1 it will change from its own weird thing to acting like a +1?</p>
<p>The act of being measured forced it into one way? Is this because the measurement it self is affecting the electron?</p>
<p>It's very odd that as soon as you measure it and know what it is it is always that and acts accordingly unless the measuring it self influences the electron .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an even weirder bit.  In the &quot;many worlds&quot; interpretation, it wasn't even spin-up after you inspected it.  Instead, you've entangled it with your measuring equipment, yourself, and soon the entire Earth.  So by measuring the first particle, you change the state from</p>
<p><code>a|up,down,no-measurement&gt; + b|down,up,no-measurement&gt;</code></p>
<p>to</p>
<p><code>a|up,down,measured-up&gt; + b|down,up,measured-down&gt;</code></p>
<p>where (a,b) are complex numbers such that |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is a &quot;measurement&quot; basically the particle interacting with another object of sufficient energy to knock it out of its entangled state, and in turn gain some information about it?</p>
<p>I've heard the explanation dozens of times and I still don't have a clear image in my mind of what determines a valid observation. Quantum computers try to maintain entangled particles by isolating them from any perturbations (in the electromagnetic field, etc. etc.) but aren't there neutrinos everywhere all the time anyway? Why don't these destroy quantum computers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no uniform consensus as to what constitutes a &quot;valid observation&quot;. The process of observation enters the formalism in a fairly clunky ad-hoc way. It's generally pretty clear in practice what an observation will be (macroscopic measurement systems are ~28 orders of magnitude larger than quantum systems), but the question is totally one where different experts can legitimately disagree.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but if <em>any</em> information about a system in superposition escapes that system, then it collapses right? Like schroedinger's cat is dead before the scientists look inside, it dies as soon as enough cells in the cat's body have been exposed to the information that it is dead to collapse the entire cat as a dead cat.. if I understand anything about superposition collapse correctly (I probably don't.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I'm very confused by this. Are systems only in a superposition depending on whether you have come in contact with information that &quot;leaked&quot; out of that system? So as information spreads, the universe becomes in-sync about certain things, but depending on where you are in spacetime, different parts of the universe will always be out of coherence with you?</p></div>		</li>
