			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of the title &quot;Distribution Expert,&quot; maybe you're the guy to answer this question. Why does my power bill include a &quot;delivery charge&quot;? I don't recall ever seeing a power delivery truck come to my house, unpack a jug of electricity and refill my house's electricity tank. Also, my power company is the only one in my area, so it basically seems like this is just some bullshit additional charge added to the bill to suck more money from the customers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im in Houston with power right now. Water hasn't gotten into my house yet, but ive seen plenty of people with a foot of water in their living room with power still on. It actually seems as if almost the whole city still has power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two feet or more in my garage, with our crawl space over half flooded at the worst point and we never lost power (flood plain).  Water was maybe 2 and a half feet from main breaker box (single fuse for entire home) and the circuit breaker box (one you go to when a breaker is tripped).  Group of about 20 nearly identical homes and nearly identical flooding also never lost power.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just read on another thread someone who had friends whose house was flooding, and they described the man as sitting on his stairs waiting to flip off the power just before it got high enough to touch the breaker box. </p>
<p>That seemed really scary, and it sounds like they should have already turned the power off. I mean, I'm sure it sucks worse to be in the dark as well as the flood, but electricity+ water terrifies me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and if we have generators here in Houston you don’t hook them up to the “whole house”, you use it for the fridge. Most of my friends with flooding still have power with no generators. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree its extremely dangerous, but to answer OP's incredulity directly, about HOW this is possible. I would add that  It is wholly due to freshwater flooding from rain storms, it wouldn't be possible with a storm surge or salt water flooding. </p>
<p>The most likely outcome of a flooded house under power is a wiring fire and not electric shock to all the inhabitants (although the risk of that is much greater than usual).</p>
<p>Rain water conducts, but very poorly. This means there will be current leaks in flooded sections where there is exposed wiring, for example - flooded plug receptacles and junction boxes. Depending on the salinity, this may be as low as a few hundred <code>milli-amperes</code> of leakage current, but likely higher.  In this case, evidently, not enough to trip the breaker or kill the generator. But enough, possibly, to cause a fire.  </p>
<p>One particularly nasty danger is the build up of steam, and in extreme cases - hydrogen gas, in closed spaces. For example inside a metal wiring conduit filled with water from below and sealed above. This can act like a pipe bomb and cause further destruction and fire potential. </p>
<p>At the very least it will greatly increase the rate of corrosion that you point out, as this current also represents a flow of ions in the water, some of which is removed from and deposited onto exposed wiring in the house subject to this leakage current. </p></div>		</li>
