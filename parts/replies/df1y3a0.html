			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of times it is because the functional utility (how a house works compared to modern standards) is too far degraded to cost-effectively fix.</p>
<p>A lot of old homes were not plumbed for multiple bathrooms, the walls do not allow large open kitchens, the HVAC systems are not efficient, and it is simply cheaper to start over.  </p>
<p>I was just in a very old house in my town.  It was 6,000+ square feet, built for the owner of the town's largest department store, and beautiful on the outside.  The inside had a tiny servant's kitchen, a parlor, 2 living rooms, a huge dining room, no outdoor space, a 1/2 bath on the main level, 1 bathroom upstairs for 4 family bedrooms to share, and a servant's wing above the kitchen with a low ceiling, small rooms, and completely detached from the rest of the bedrooms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some cases, government regulations and restrictions might make it easier to build a new house rather than restore an existing one. Or perhaps the blighted area is undesirable for home buyers, because it blighted and at a given point in time it's less risky to build in another area that is currently in demand, rather than buy up the cheap and blighted land on the hope you'll find buyers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also add that in many cases where these streets are designated social housing, you need to build new housing next to or near it to decant the existing residents into before redeveloping those streets. </p>
<p>It is also often a matter of development appraisal combined with the restrictions or requirements of the local planning authorities. If the developer requires to build and sell a particular density of housing in that area to justify buying that piece of land and the numbers don't stack up, they will look elsewhere. </p></div>		</li>
