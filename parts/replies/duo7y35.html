			<div class="markdown"><p>What effect does the size or mass of the star have on this? Jupiter for example has 53 named moon's, and many more. They are orbiting a body which is itself orbiting the sun. From the data it seems like &lt;10 planets for stars, but it also seems like &gt;10 body orbits can be stable too like with moons of Jupiter or Saturn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Distance between these &quot;harmonic&quot; zones where matter aggregates would definitely be a function of Star mass (specifically the gravitational force). I know enough math to know I can't predict very well what that relationship would be, but my guess would be that heavier stars result in larger distances between such zones, as the planets would remain relatively the same size and thus need to be further from the star to get the same gravitational effect, compared to a less heavy star. An analogy would be dropping a heavier object in water; to get the same &quot;ripple height&quot;  (which would be the gravity at which a planet-sized object can sustain orbit), you need to let the wave travel further away because it starts stronger than with a lighter object, and at that point the waves are also farther apart from each other. Not sure if it would be a fractional (number/mass), linear (number <em> mass), or quadratic proportion (number </em> mass^2 ).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, is what you're saying similar to orbital resonance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a good answer for that one. My only thought is that a substantial amount of Jupiter's (and Saturn's) moons are captured asteroids that have existed for a relatively short period of time. Given enough time, perhaps they are doomed to a shorter fate (this is speculation though)</p>
<p>Alternatively, there could be some minimum Moon/Planet ratio to fit into the model.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don‘t think its likely that the majority of Jupiters or Saturns moons are captured.</p>
<p>A highly elliptical orbit would suggest an asteroid capture. However most of them are in regular orbits with nearly no equatorial inclination suggesting they formed at roughly the same time as the solar system in exactly that place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter has 4 small moons orbiting very close to the planet (Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, Thebe), and 4 big moons orbiting at intermediate distance (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto).  All of them are in approximately circular orbits, similar to the 8 planets orbiting around the Sun.  Farther out from Jupiter there are small moons orbiting in irregular orbits with very high inclination and eccentricity, similar to the Kuiper belt around the Sun.</p>
<p>This pattern repeats for every set of gas giant moons in our solar system.  Small moons in circular orbits close to the planet, then large moons in circular orbits at a medium distance, then small moons in irregular orbits farther out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the paper you link claims that most planet pairs are near a mean-motion resonance, but doesn't at all talk about the physics behind why this might be the case. There are reasonable physical reasons to think that resonances are important in forming planetary systems, but there is no orbital or disk dynamics in this paper beyond Kepler's laws. Some simulations of planet-forming disks show that planets tend to capture into these resonances. However, if this is true you then need to talk about why planets are mostly no longer in these resonances, as most of the systems we see are not today in resonance or near-resonant (e.g. <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...790..146F" target="_blank">Fabrycky et al 2012</a>).</p>
<p>They also include Triton when talking about the Neptune system. That's a little weird because Triton didn't form in a disk around Neptune, it's likely a captured Kuiper Belt object.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This would be accomplished through Harmonic-Resonance which would cause all matter in an accretion disk to get pushed/pulled into bands at specific intervals from the parent-star.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should also say that this is not a physical way for planets to end up in resonances. Resonances usually clear gaps in disks (many of the gaps in Saturn's rings are at resonances), not bunch things up in them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My point was merely that there probably aren’t systems with <em>many</em> more planets out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think we can say that. For one categorizing star systems into categories like many or few in a potentially infinite universe isn't helpful. There could be billions of star system with 20+ planets with them still being extremely rare.</p>
<p>Also our definition of planet is exceedingly unhelpful as it doesn't specify the creation process. Our own sun for example is a rather low weight star, yet it has objects gravitationally bound to it well over 1ly away. Under the right conditions a star in a less dense neighbourhood than ours could probably collect rogue planets(which are supposedly rather common) like Jupiter did with its many moons, there could be hundreds of mercury sized objects within its gravitational sphere(several ly), each dominating its own orbit and thus fitting our definition of a planet.</p></div>		</li>
