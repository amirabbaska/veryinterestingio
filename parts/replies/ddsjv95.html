<p>a lot of collectors preserve things that would be nice to preserve, and if you took everything in private collections and moved them into museums overnight, they would go into vaults and not be cared for... collectors do play a role in preserving art and artifacts as well as museums of course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>museums don't have infinite space and do sell off items from their collections and use that money to acquire new things... without private collectors to buy up what they want to offload, what happens to it? </p>
</li>
<li>collecting on your own can be an opportunity to learn about something. If you are actively interested in the subject at hand, having first hand access and a desire to research what you have, is basically your own mini university/museum... obviously it doesn't apply to maybe things like beer bottles or whatever, but it does apply to other areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a big grey area between a public museum and a private collector, as some private collectors also do loan art or historical items to museums for public display. Doing so allows the public to enjoy and learn from these items, gives the museum extra reasons to pull people in, and doesn't force the museum to give up money to acquire those things. It's better to return to the private collection afterwards than to go to a basement vault for 10 years.</p>
<p>Don't read this as anti-museum, just this idea that collecting anything makes you mentally unsound is wrong. Museums are great places but can't do everything on their own. </p>
<p>Last comment: consider for a moment that some things like Superman #1 still exist. Those things wouldn't exist now if not for collectors. They would just have been disposed of as trash. Beautifully maintained antique cars would not exist: they'd have been left to rust. </p>
<p>It takes someone who is devoted and passionate to preserve things at  the very outset of their lives through the point where the item is considered just some out of date junk. </p>
<p>So many old books, old paintings, old writing of any sort, old sculptures, these things <em>exist</em> today hundreds to thousands of years later because there was always another set of hands to hand them to and cherish them. So many of those magnificent artworks and books that got lost were because individuals stopped caring, or caring enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, arrowhead collecting is a big thing where I'm from. I find it hard to believe that all those people (including my roommate and myself when I was a kid) are mentally unsound. It's more of a genuine interest in history, especially the history of our local community. </p>
<p>Some of the more avid collectors I know attend seminars with presentations by actual archaeologists, anthropologists, and grad students. Many of them will bring selections from their collections to display and discuss. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody said that collecting stuff makes you mentally unsound.
Just that there is a point on the continuum of collecting that is absolutely rooted in mental unsoundness, or at the very minimum a very frail ego and a deep desire to impress people. </p>
<p>A ton of 'collecting' (and endless acquiring of crap) comes from a superficial sense of achievement that comes with owning practically irrelevant but otherwise amusing things.</p>
<p>An interesting example is, say, the modern art market. When a casino magnate pays $100,000,000 for paint abstractly splashed on a canvas, it's not because he perceives a deeper meaning that has $100,000,000 worth of intrinsic value. It's because in his world, owning that particular bauble is impressive to people he competes with. It makes him the 'winner' of the high end art market. If he were Chinese, he'd be the guy buying Jadite or ivory. If he were an African tribesman, he'd have the largest herd of unproductive goats. </p>
<p>The desire to impress other people by acquiring status symbols that have some nexus with the opinions of people who you want to impress is absolutely a huge driving force in collecting. It's not all collecting, but it's a shit ton of collectors, particularly when things leave the fun realm of 'affordable' and get into that weirder realm where people try to distinguish themselves from the pack via purchasing novelties of increasing cost. </p></div>		</li>

<p>People don't always collect things of &quot;value&quot;. Sometimes it's just 'cause. </p>
<p>Edit: Upon reflection, obviously this falls into the obsessive-compulsive category of collecting. Never mind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah there's absolutely nothing wrong with this. I like hummingbirds. Sometimes, I buy stuff with hummingbirds on it. From time to time you see a tiger you like, you pick it up and add it to your collection. That's fun collecting. That's collecting at it's absolute best and most rewarding. </p>
<p>Now if you made $35,000 a year but spent $20K a year on toy tigers and were relentlessly trying to assemble the finest of collection of toy  tigers in your country, that's the obsessive kind that can get unhealthy and completely ludicrous, very quickly as you divert funds from your 401K to place bids on a toy tiger that came from the estate of Fred Astaire. </p></div>		</li>
