			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the reason that herbivores have to eat so much is that their diet provides fewer nutrients AND their digestive tract is actually worse at breaking that food down? I watched a video a while back showing that carnivores absorbed 40% of the energy in their food while herbivores only got 10%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because while animals can develop all kinds of methods to prevent being eaten (for example, running/swimming away from predators) plants are much easier targets and so getting eaten is often inevitable.</p>
<p>A lot of plants survival strategy involves making themselves difficult to digest, to dissuade predators from eating what now amounts to expensive and difficult food.</p>
<p>Many herbivores have developed complex digestive systems (multiple stomachs, long digestive tract, specific bacteria in the gut) to try and make the food source viable anyways. They still struggle to get much out of it, but make up for this by eating a high volume of plants to make it worthwhile overall.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that any organism has a limited amount of resources it can devote to growth, reproduction, <strong>or</strong> defense, and while some plants focus heavily on defense this comes at the cost of growth and reproduction speed.</p>
<p>Trees have thick bark which has little nutritional value, but take decades to grow large and reproduce.</p>
<p>The algae that krill eat are the opposite, they focus nearly all their energy into reproduction with little left over for defense, so while they are easy to eat and digest, they reproduce so fast that even the krill can't eat them faster.</p>
<p>Similarly the krill focus most of their energy in growth and reproduction with little left over for defense, so they serve as an easy tasty meal, but they're still highly successful because they still reproduce much faster than they can be eaten.</p></div>		</li>
