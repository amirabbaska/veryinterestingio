			<div class="markdown"><p>The only study I've seen on that suggests that depression and short term memory loss are somehow connected. This could mean depression causes memory loss or that brains that are prone to one are prone to the other. Correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes essentially. Neurons in the hippocampus can regenerate and produce new neurons. Stress and depression slows down the process of regenisis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this a little bit, the hippocampus is thought to perform a few operations in order to encode and retrieve specific episodic memories (see <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Episodic_memory" target="_blank">http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Episodic_memory</a>). This includes performing pattern separation (orthogonalizing inputs to keep otherwise similar experiences distinct), pattern completion (somewhat like denoising the input to create a representation that may look similar to a previously seen representation), and binding. These are thought to potentially occur in particular subregions of the hippocampus (<a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(16\)30043-2" target="_blank">Kumaran et all 2016</a>). These regions are connected in recurrent ways such that they receive each other's outputs as inputs. The hippocampus is also constantly communicating with cortical regions so their representations are contributing to the current state.</p>
<p>Memory is not simply a lookup of prior information, it's a reconstruction based on models of the world and specific bindings the hippocampus creates constantly and obligatorily. In some cases, you may have only partial memory for a particular event and your ability to reconstruct the remainder of the information is impaired because you may also have meta-knowledge of what knowledge you believe you have. All of these things can contribute to a sense of remembering without the contents being fully available. </p>
<p>This ignores the difference between recollection and familiarity (see this for a discussion of the difference <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251874/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251874/</a>) which seem as though they could be mediated by different brain processes, but it's a start for understanding the phenomena.</p>
<p>I personally have always imagined it like a spaceship orbiting the moons around a big gas giant like Jupiter (where the gravity wells of the objects are all attractor points in the network's dynamics a la izhikevich's work) in a temporarily stable way rather than crashing into a planet (i.e. remembering).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never heard that, haha. But, I'm just a college kid taking a psychology class so I'm not the authority. From what I understand, the hippocampus is the part of the brain associated with long-term memory. Violent, sexual, and impulsive behavior sounds like an underdeveloped frontal lobe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She sounds like a nut.  That is an odd way of describing any biology.  I realize that many teachers make no money but you would think the requirements of the job would make odd statements like that less prevalent.  Anyway, check out that series it's a really fun time.  </p></div>		</li>
