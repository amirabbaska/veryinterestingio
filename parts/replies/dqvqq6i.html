			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not why.  I don't understand the science behind it, but apparently staples <em>are</em> safe for microwaves.  Apparently staples are shorter than the frequency of the waveform for microwaves, so the &quot;microwaves&quot; ignore 'em.</p>
<p>Don't believe me?  Believe science foodie Alton Brown, whose microwave popcorn recipe calls for a staple.  Sorry, I can't find video of this online, Food Network clamps down on that sort of thing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metal as such is not a problem with microwaves. It's some special cases, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unopened tin can. Metal reflects microwaves, and if not enough hit the food, too much go back into the emitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tin can that's open, but not full. Same problem as above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anything with small gaps (ie forks). Gaps case sparks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aluminium (or aluminum for the cave men over the Atlantic). It has a covering layer of oxide, with tiny holes in ut. This creates gaps between the holes. Gaps cause sparks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decorative metal decorations on plates and cups can come loose. When they heat up, the metal comes off.</p>
</li>
<li>Propane tanks. When heated up, they can explode from the pressure, then all that propane in the sparks of a blown microwave can cause a secondare, even more powerful explosion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, it's hard to teach people details like these. People will not remember, and will start &quot;I'll just try and see what happens...&quot; and boom goes the propane tank and sends a house into orbit. So, manufacturers do it the easy way, and simply say &quot;No metal, or else!&quot;.</p>
<p>So, having a spoon in a cup won't be a problem. A staple have tiny gaps, but it's also submerged in water, so it won't create arcs.</p>
<p>The reason for tea bags are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Taste. The tea can get a bitter tinge.</p>
</li>
<li>The dangers of superheated water. The water can be heated above the boiling point without starting to boil. I don't know why, but I suspect it's surface tension. However, a tea bag (or powdered soup) can cause it to start boiling, and when it's superheated, that can mean that you get super hot boiling water splashing all over the place, and you, which is bad.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To get superheated water you need water that is mostly free of impurities and a cup with a very smooth surface. Now when it reaches boiling point there are no convenient little rough points for bubbles to start forming, but as soon as you add in sugar or or otherwise disturb the water it all suddenly boils.</p>
<p>Realistically it's not likely to be a problem with a typical household mug and water, and if there is a teabag in the cup in the microwave it's definitely not an issue.</p>
<p>Like the &quot;no metal ever&quot; rule it's easier to just tell people not to do it than to explain the exact circumstances and the precautions needed; the rule becomes &quot;never microwave plain water then add something to it in case it is superheated.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You cant get superheated water if you have the teabag already in the cup, because the bag contents act as <del>nuclear</del> <em>nucleation</em> points for boiling. It's microwaving <em>and then adding a teabag</em> that can lead to sudden, neaely explosive boiling.</p>
<p>Also, don't teabag boiling water. It hurts the scrotum</p>
<p>Edit: I swear to god that was autocorrect's fault. I know it's a nucleation point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suggest doing chinese style brew instead of western brew</p>
<p><a href="http://i57.tinypic.com/2wrm5w7.png" target="_blank">http://i57.tinypic.com/2wrm5w7.png</a></p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>higher quality</strong> loose leaf tea, compared to tea bags</li>
<li>
<p><strong>more economical</strong> usage through multi-steeping</p>
<p>example: high grade chinese puh-er tea (black tea) allows for up to 20 infusions, each 150ml, that's 3L of high quality puh-er black tea by using 5g. To get the same amount by western brewing you need 25g of tea (bags) for 3L</p>
</li>
<li><strong>less bitter compounds extracted</strong> due to short brewing time and water not being too hot and thus no milk or sugar needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Some disadvantages of gongfu style brewing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More time</strong> needed to do</li>
<li><strong>More utensils</strong> needed</li>
<li><strong>Learning curve</strong> to do proper gongfu style. I do it in 3 minutes, but the first few times I spent 30 mins to get things right lol</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>bascially when westerners found tea in china, they brought it back home and didn't <del>know how to prepare it correctly</del> didn't follow the traditional way of the inventors of tea (china), and it turned to be very bitter (due to wrong amounts of tea, too long steeping time and too hot water). Leading them to add sugar and milk to it. </p>
<p><del>correctly brewed tea</del> original brewing methods, nowadays mostly called gong-fu style or similar japanese/korean tea brewing methods lead to much less bitter tea that doesn't need to be sweetened.</p>
<hr />
<p>And here's my favorite explanation for all of it, and why I moved from western brewing to gongfu brewing:

<p>The western method uses 2 grams which can be steeped twice. The Chinese method uses 5 gram which can be steeped 5 times. How is that more economical?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't really do electric kettles over here. Most people would microwave the water and then put the tea bag in after, but I've known a couple that throw the teabag into the cup of water first and then microwave it all together. Then you've got my boyfriend who does it on the stove in a stovetop kettle even though he has access to a Keurig which is way faster than stove or microwave. Keurigs are expensive though, so not everyone has one. I'd say they're the most convenient method for getting a cup of hot water in my experience. I've never seen an electric kettle in my life, it was reddit that taught me that the British &quot;put the kettle on&quot; wasn't referring to slowly waiting for an old school kettle on the stove to boil and whistle.</p></div>		</li>
