			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that it takes a three-body collision for a bond to form, as the third atom can carry off some energy (as its kinetic energy). I guess it would be possible to calculate the frequency of three-body collisions for a given concentration and temperature. But the actual reaction rate would have to be measured experimentally, as not all collisions would result in reaction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>there is no way to dissipate the energy released if a bond were to form.</p>

<p>What is stopping them releasing it as a photon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same question. And I don't remember the answer. Maybe it is spin-forbidden?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in order to get some anti H2 it would have to be a half step in an exothermic reaction? Or released via a photon?</p>
<p>(Sorry, if this seems terribly worded.  I have only taken basic Chemistry) </p></div>		</li>
