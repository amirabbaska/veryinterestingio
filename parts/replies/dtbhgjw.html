			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact! What little extant fabrics we know about Viking women’s clothing comes from ship caulking found in Oseburg! They found a rich piece of silk wedges between the planks and were able to reconstruct that it was likely imported Byzantine silk used to trim a hanggerok, or apron dress. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What amazes me about this is that goods were traded over such vast distances so early in history. In germanic chieftains tombs from the smaller ADs, silks and other wares from the far east were found. So even in the earliest, darkest middle ages, when human civilisation was sparse and rough, the people in China were somehow connected to the people in central Europe. And that although 99% of them probably never once in their entire lives journeyed more than a day's travel away from their villages. Still some of them knew that the world out there was far and wide, and that there were people far away beyond deserts and mountains and jungles who looked different and talked different, and from whom the silk came through so many hands.
Edit: My first Gold! Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually in a group called Oseberg Tekstillag, we research, reconstruct and show the craft techniques of the Oseberg grave. The group is a part of the Oseberg Foundation that recently built a full scale replica with authentic equipment and materials entirely by hand, the sail was hand vowen by the group before I joined. So many talented and passionate people in this group. Viking crafts is my hobby now and im so amazed at the very sophisticated and advanced techniques they had to make such beautiful details and garments. I grew up next to the Oseberg mound, always been fascinated by the vikings. </p></div>		</li>
