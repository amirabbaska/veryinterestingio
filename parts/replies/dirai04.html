			<div class="markdown"><p>The zoo I worked at, all animal parts must be incinerated. You cannot hold onto samples. Same goes for when rhinos have their horns trimmed rtc - the <del>ivory</del> horns must be incinerated. It's to prevent anyone from profiting from illegal trade in animal parts, as well as presumably to stop spread of any potential diseases. </p>
<p>It's interesting that your Science Centre does not have to do this.  Maybe the above regulations are just for Europe/the UK. It does make me wonder though, as I'm guessing it's useful to have specimens and samples, so perhaps there's special dispensation for that which I simply never knew about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the record Im not personally involved in that particular area, mainly up until the deceased is placed in the transport. But this is as much as I know from the staff that are more involved: </p>
<p>Any samples to be preserved require permits and must undergo a specific preservation process (fun fact: we have a preservation specialist on site, though his work is mainly with marine invertebrates), though this is not necessarily part of our standard operating procedure.</p>
<p>Usually we, as a facility, would requisition a full necropsy be performed at a nearby zoological centre (usually at a university) from which we only recieve the results. We are no longer &quot;in charge&quot;, for lack of a better term, of the body after that; which is where I presume the cremation comes in.</p>
<p>Bear in mind this is a simplified ELI5 version of the process from my understanding of it. </p>
<p>Edit: Turns out we have in our storage a preserved sample of Beluga blubber from an Arctic population! Its apparently almost a decade old. Insofar as I know, this seems to be quite unique. We also share preserved specimens and samples with a local University, with which we have close ties to.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For lack of a better answer, they do unfortunately pass away, separate from the other animals that would have shared their main habitat with. I said this in another comment but essentially we would need to quarantine them as per medical procedures. But if they do pass they are surrounded by the people  that have cared for them the last few months or years of their life. They do recognize the people they work with on a daily basis (I believe), and I personally think that it comforts them. I'm unsure of how much they 'love' us per se, but I can guarantee you that every animal we care for we love very much, and every passing breaks our hearts.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they die in a communal tank the ammonia levels with go up as they rot putting all other animals in that tank at risk. If your able to pull the corpse out fast enough this isn't a problem but its to much of a risk that the body wont be taken out fast enough.</p></div>		</li>
