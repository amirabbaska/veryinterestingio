<p>The idea does have quite some support in solar system formation models, where it's theorised that the Earth and Moon were created from a proto-Earth and another object named &quot;Theia&quot;, a trojan planet located in one of the proto-Earth's lagrange points, which became unstable and collided: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet\)" target="_blank">Wikipedia link</a>.</p>

<p>thus far none have been observed in the Kepler data</p>

<p>I've heard rumours this might change soon...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that part of the requirements for lagrange points is that the object in the point must be of insignificant mass compared to the two main bodies. If not, its gravity becomes significant enough to tug on the other two and would likely destabilize the whole system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if so, the smaller body could not be considered to be a planet per se, because it has not cleared its orbital neighborhood. (Which, really, is true of any answer to this question, and to my knowledge we don't as yet actually have official scientific language to describe such a twin world.)</p></div>		</li>
