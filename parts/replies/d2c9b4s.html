			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body tries to promote one-way flow of food. If E. coli did manage to get to the stomach it probably couldn't live for very long (because of the acidity) unless it had a way to protect itself (which some strains do). There are not many white blood cells actually within the tube of your intestines, but they're right outside of it preventing bacteria from moving across. Instead, there's antibodies within the tube that help keep pathogenic bacteria out. </p>
<p>They generally attack bacteria that try to cross, but there are also some bacteria that have proteins on them that activate a strong immune response and some others (that I guess we term &quot;good bacteria&quot;) that have proteins that cause no immune response. </p>
<p>E. Coli should really only be in one place of your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is an excellent question, and actually an active area of study. Until a few years ago, it was generally believed that bacteria from your digestive tract remain &quot;outside&quot; of your body — in the sense that they are inside cavities in your body (mouth, stomach, intestine), but they are isolated from the &quot;true&quot; inside of your body (basically, where blood is), by various barriers (stomach lining, intestinal walls, etc). </p>
<p>So in that model, the view was simple: bacterial stay outside, and if they get inside, your immune system fights them inside. (Or doesn't, and you die.)</p>
<p>More recently, we have learned that there is actually a tremendous amount of communication between the bacteria in your digestive system and the cells of your body (by means of signaling chemicals), and that some cells of your immune system do, in fact, &quot;exit&quot; your body and &quot;enter&quot; your intestine, where they participate in the complex dance that is regulation of your intestinal bacterial friends. </p>
<p>To answer some of your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your stomach has one type of lining, and (with a few exceptions), bacteria don't survive well in the stomach. So the stomach is mainly protected by its acidic content. That is, your stomach is not very permeable.</li>
<li>Your intestine, on the other hand, is quite permeable, because that's how nutrients get out of food and into you. The permeability is jointly regulated by your cells and by the bacteria in your stomach. The lining of your intestine is covered in a mucous layer that is patrolled by your immune system and that keeps bacteria from your intestine from entering your body. (But it does not keep chemical excreted by those bacteria from entering your body, which is how the bacteria can communicate with cells inside you.)</li>
<li>Your immune systems knows what cells to attack based on the usual immune system learning mechanisms, and also because it chemically communicates with cells in your intestine. But honestly, we have very little idea how the latter actually works; it's an area of active research.</li>
<li>One major mechanism that keeps &quot;bad&quot; bacteria from growing in your intestine is that there are a lot of &quot;good&quot; bacteria in your intestine already, and therefore &quot;bad&quot; bacteria can't get enough nutrients to survive. This is why broad-spectrum antibiotics (that is, antibiotics that indiscriminately target a wide range of bacteria) can cause problems — they kill off all the &quot;good&quot; bacteria in your intestine, and then the &quot;bad&quot; bacteria can take over and make you sick. One very promising treatment for this problem right now is a fecal transplant, which is exactly what it sounds like. A doctor retrieves poop from a healthy person (which contains some amount of &quot;good&quot; bacteria) and has a sick person swallow this (these days, we can do this in pill form). The &quot;good&quot; bacteria then get into your intestine and start fighting for nutrients with the &quot;bad&quot; bacteria. If the &quot;good&quot; bacteria win, the person gets better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mind. Blown., amirite?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's less of knowing what to attack and more knowing what not to attack. Your own cells have unique molecules on their surface that kind of act like signs that say &quot;hey don't kill me I belong here!&quot;. As white blood cells develop they are &quot;trained&quot; to differentiate between self and non-self cells (and if they fail to do this, they are usually killed before being allowed out in the wild). If a white blood cell runs into something that doesn't have the right &quot;don't kill me!&quot; sign, it dies.</p>
<p>When white blood cells take up residence in a certain place (say, a lymph node, or a nodule in the colon) they undergo further &quot;training&quot; to be able to detect when cells are somewhere they shouldn't be, or doing something they aren't supposed to do. This is why some bacteria are tolerated in some areas of the body but not others, although I believe the exact mechanism behind it isn't well understood yet. </p>
<p>I hope this makes sense. I simplified it a bit as immunology is a pretty complex subject, but this should kind of give you the gist of it.</p></div>		</li>
