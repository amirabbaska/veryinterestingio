			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one of those details that's true, but can be sort of irrelevant.</p>
<p>Typically we divide matter into 3 states.  Solids, liquids, and gases.</p>
<p>Now, if you heat up gases enough, you will start to provide enough energy to free their electrons from them, at which point your gas becomes a soup of positive and negative ions.  We call this a 'plasma'.  But plasma physically behaves very similarly to a gas.  Where it differs is in its electrical and chemical properties, which is fairly irrelevant to this process.  It's like the difference between a ceramic and a metal.  One insulates, while the other has a free sea of electrons and conducts electricity. But they're both solids.</p>
<p>In this instance plasma is really just a byproduct of something like a campfire fire - the heat makes the gas (and more importantly, the particles floating in the gas) hot enough to emit visible blackbody radiation, and that's also hot enough that it becomes a plasma.  The gas being ionized or not really doesn't contribute to the fire-system.</p>
<p>However, other types of flames, like gas-fueled flames on your stoves, work a little bit differently.  A good chunk of their light comes not from glowing fuel vapors, but from specific emission spectra of chemical reactions.  For instance, your stovetop flames burn blue. But the flame's temperature of about 1500C means it should be releasing blue light, but also a lot of yellow and red light, so it should just be <em>white</em>.  But instead it's a distinct blue - so a bunch of extra blue light has to be coming from somewhere.</p>
<p>In a perfect combustion of a hydrocarbon (CH4, C2H6... etc) with oxygen, you're supposed to get water and carbon-dioxide as products. (H2O plus CO2 in some proportion).  But in reality, nothing is perfect, and you'll get a lot of carbon-monoxide (CO). This is called 'incomplete combustion.'</p>
<p>If the flame is hot enough, and there is enough oxygen, you'll get something called 'complete combustion' where most all carbon-monoxide (CO) produced receives enough heat to then become carbon-dioxide (CO2), and this process emits blue light, just like those highschool chemistry labs where you burned salts that glowed red or green.</p>
<p>These <em>chemical</em> reactions of the gaseous byproducts <em>could</em> be influenced more by the gas being ionized, but frankly I'm not sure. Hopefully someone else can weigh in. For a campfire though, it's safe to call the presence of plasma a fairly irrelevant byproduct, rather than something integral to the flame itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may add to this: This is why a very pure and nearly completely combusted alcohol fire has almost no visible flame - there's almost no soot for their to be very much visible blackbody radiation.</p>
<p>(I make ultralight, alcohol burning backpacking stoves called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=penny+stove&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" target="_blank">Penny Stoves</a>. You know you've made a good one when it produces only deep blue and stable jets of flame, but still puts out enough heat to boil a couple of pints of water in a few minutes.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the flame is not what we think of (the glowing orange part), but a thin spherical-ish region inside of that where the fuel and the oxidizer meet at the stoichiometric level (the exact number of each molecule necessary for complete combustion) and create mostly carbon dioxide and water. That part is at the highest tempeature because there the products are the most stable compared to all the products of constitution, so the energy released from the highly exothermic reaction can go the most into raising the tempeature of the carbon dioxide and water, rather than the energy first going into forming less stable molecules (molecules with greater enthalpies of formation).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation, except for the idea that the soot is what is evaporating from the wood. There are lots of flammable, volatile hydrocarbons that can combust in wood, and these are evaporating from the wood and burning. The soot is a combustion <em>product</em> from these hydrocarbons. </p>
<p>There is a nice link u/Hypothesis_Null added to a video showing you can &quot;light&quot; the soot after a candle goes out, so why isn't the soot a product instead of being burned completely in the flame? Ideally it would be. The hydrocarbons would combust to form just CO2 and H2O if there was enough O2, but if they don't have enough oxygen they also form soot. Add more oxygen back and the soot can burn further. If you have worked with a bunsen burner, you have probably seen this. If you don't get enough oxygen to mix with the gas, you get a yellow orange flame (from soot). If you adjust the burner to mix more oxygen in, you don't form soot and the flame looks blue. Note that the blue flame comes from chemiluminescence, not blackbody radiation. The flame would need to get <em>really</em> hot to emit blue blackbody radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite correct.  </p>
<p>I mentioned it some of the subsequent responses, but its' good to address it directly.  This is why your gas stove at home is smokeless while your campfire isn't - the gas stove is running off of a mostly pure hydrocarbon gas, while a campfire has a ton of crap in it that won't have any chance of burning - so you still get smoke no matter how well built it is.</p>
<p>Likewise, blue flames from things like stove-tops are actually only hot enough to glow white (little bit of blue, but also a lot of yellow and red black-body radiation).  Hell, our Sun isn't even hot enough to glow blue - it's white as well once you get beyond the atmosphere and look at it directly.</p>
<p>But when you get a flame hot enough, and you have sufficient oxygen (not a problem with pressurized gas mixing with regular air) the conditions enables the further combustion of the carbon monoxide (CO) formed from incomplete combustion into Carbon Dioxide (CO2), a process that has a blue spectal emission.  So white flame with fewer glowing impurities and extra blue light, gives you the blue-white flames on your stove top or in your furnace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im sure youve noticed this as well but when you burn long enough you actually burn out the hydrocarbons in the wood. The fire takes on a very distinct appearance after this point. Much shorter flames and it appears to burn much hotter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taken to the extreme, this is what occurs during a backdraft explosion when a structure fire is ventilated. Sudden addition of oxygen causes suspended particles that have been heated above their ignition point to suddenly combust. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood starts out as a 'carbohydrate' with 30-40% oxygen.  The hydrocarbons released in pyrolysis are often called &quot;tar&quot; and &quot;tar gas&quot;.  One source of (carbon) &quot;soot&quot; is the incomplete combustion of highly-stable double-bond hydrocarbon rings aka &quot;benzene&quot;, and related higher-order tars.  The C-H bonds can be broken easier than the C=C bonds.  The &quot;soot&quot; that remains is highly-stable and resistant to combustion and cracking.  This is one of the reasons why it's challenging to make a clean burning stove, even in a well designed gasifier.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add, not all fire is visible. It depends on it's source fuel. Good example is the methanol used in race cars, here are a couple of cool videos of invisible fire:</p>

<p>pit crew, car and driver on fire and jumping around.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/1a3MD5s0mKc" target="_blank">Fuel track accident</a></p>
<p>You can only see fire/smoke on this one because of other shit like tires burning. Infrared camera shows the flame.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  Methanol will pretty much burn clean - there are no extraneous particulates involved, and since it's flame is only around 2000K, if memory serves, it's going to emit very little visible red light anyway.</p>
<p>In a dark room you can feel the heat, and might see a little glow, but in broad-daylight?  Stuff's invisible. </p></div>		</li>
