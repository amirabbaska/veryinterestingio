<p>...Could we? If you had a large enough mass, would you be able to view it? In principle I understand that the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;, but in practice, surely not; you couldn't have a view inside the trap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's only true of matter/anti-matter pairs, e.g electrons and positrons, protons and anti-protons, etc. Photons have no anti-matter equivalent since they have no charges than can be reversed (I think that's the reason), so would interact with anti-matter in the same way that they do with normal matter</p></div>		</li>
