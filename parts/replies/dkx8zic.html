			<div class="markdown"><p>I expect carbon fiber would be dangerous because it would not conduct.  Maybe the current would follow the water around the outside, or maybe the carbon would conduct just enough to explode, but I think the same problem would exist for plastic bodies.  There might be a metal roll cage, which might protect.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Carbon (in it's graphite form) is a good conductor of electricity- they ake resistors out of it for example. The  resin that binds the fibres will insulate (so you wont see it with a multimeter) but once that is broken down and the current reaches the actual carbon fibres the car body will conduct pretty well. You cannot use it very easily for a chassis ground like you can in a metal car, but that is due to the resin, NOT the carbon. Carbon fishing rods can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10PZ_0GK_bU" target="_blank">extremely dangerous</a> if used under power lines or in an electrical storm.</p>
<p>In a lightning strike, a carbon body will protect you as well as a metal one (although the body might well get destroyed in the process).</p></div>		</li>
