			<div class="markdown"><p>Microbiologist here, and yup. What you said. Also bacteria, and as another commenter mentioned, parasites. A lot of pathogens actually have genes, proteins, toxins, etc that become &quot;activated&quot; by mosquitos, flea, etc saliva or through the temperature changes between living in an insect to living in a mammal. Fun fact: Yersinia pestis, i.e. the bacteria that killed most of Europe during the Middle Ages (The Great Plague, Black Death, etc) does this super well. It actually changes the structure of sugars on its cell surface when it hits human body temp (37C) to cause disease in humans, but not the flea. It also senses the temperature change to adapt its metabolic pathways to survive in different hosts. Fleas have diets rich in proteins, so the bacteria eats proteins when it's in the flea. Humans have diets rich in fats and carbs, so it eats fats and carbs when it's in the human.
TL;DR some pathogens are really good at adapting to different hosts to survive multiple environments, be transmitted between hosts, and keep the disease cycle going; while other pathogens just like one host so they don't adapt to be carried by mosquito AND human</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had the Black Death and it changed it's metabolic pathways based on your &quot;Human&quot; temperature (at least I understand from your post that it changes based on temp), then would you be able to &quot;starve&quot; the disease by eating a nearly pure protein diet? Or would it still be able to process protein in that environment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately no. While the bacteria shift their metabolic networks away from a protein diet, they can still utilize protein at 37C, just not preferentially. And your body still creates carbohydrates and fatty acids regardless of your diet, so the bug would happily eat those up first anyways. So if you only ate protein when you contracted the plague, the bug would still kill you. Plague usually kills in about 48 hours, so maybe with an all-protein diet, you <em>might</em> get another couple hours, but without antibiotics, youâ€™d still die. </p></div>		</li>
