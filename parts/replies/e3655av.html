<p>some of your internal tissues do a very good job of keeping organs, muscles, and bones effortlessly sliding past each other, or held in place so they don't rub.</p>

<p>Can confirm. </p>
<p>I had pleurisy three or four weeks back. That's a condition where your lungs and chest cavity lose the ability to smoothly slide across each other. It was miserable. Every breath I took it felt like my chest was on fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother was in the hospital a few months ago for this exact reason. She thought she was having a heart attack(she is a nurse, some symptoms of pleurisy is replicating a heart attack, especially if it's on the left lung), so she proceeded to finish her shopping and drove home 3 miles away to call a friend to drive her to the ER. I thought she was metal; turns out she's still kinda metal, just not as much as originally thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, my doc was super-cautious about it too. He ended up giving me an EKG, chest X-ray, heart ultrasound, and blood tests to rule out other more serious causes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had this happen to me semi recently. Definitely agonizing. I thought I had a collapsed lung or something; it was like something was gripping my lung and squeezing it. Had EKG and X-rays done, thankfully it wasn't anything super crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got pleurisy during/after pneumonia a while back. Lasted months. Terrible pain with almost every breath. It finally cleared up. End of last year. Got a cold/flu. Pleurisy back in the exact same spot. This time worse. Fuck that pain. Lasted months again. Sometimes literally in tears while just breathing. Don’t wish it on anyone. </p>
<p>Point is. Don’t fuck around with your lungs kids, you need them every second. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also can confirm. I dislocated my wrist a few weeks ago and have an internal splint + anchored ligaments. There's now friction with the metal so I can feel things moving.</p></div>		</li>
