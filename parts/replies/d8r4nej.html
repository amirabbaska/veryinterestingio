			<div class="markdown"><p>lots of things are super rare, and we will not observe them. the point was that in this case it seemed to happen often enough that we saw it's effects, like a small bump with a lot f surrounding noise. unfortunately, after taking more data, it seems to have just been noise that looked like a bump, simultaneously at two different experiments, at the same point...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be really infuriating to me. </p>
<p>To have a &quot;ghost&quot; signal/bump and not return later or show up. </p>
<p>I wonder what the chances of it having happened twice are, at the same point!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This applies to most fields: you don't. If you suspect something special happened you can test that scenario over and over and see if that result comes back with a high enough frequency for it to not be a fluke but other than that you just can't know</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yet. The LHC collected about 1% of the expected full dataset by ~2035, and the experiments only showed results with 1/3 of the collected collisions up to today. It is too early to tell what will happen with a dataset 300 times larger than the one shown so far.</p></div>		</li>
