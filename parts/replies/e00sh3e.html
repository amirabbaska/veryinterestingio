			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not an optical illusion. Your brain isn't tricking itself into seeing a blue hue. Snow is very reflective, and it reflects the light that is scattered by the air above, which is struck by the sun's light from beyond the horizon. The only source of light is from this rayleigh scattering, which is the natural source of the sky's blue color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“What were the skies like when you were young?” </p>
<p>“They went on forever. When I, when we lived in Arizona the skies always had little fluffy clouds in them. And they were long and clear and there were lots of stars at night. And when it would rain they would all turn . . . they were beautiful, the most beautiful skies as a matter of fact. The sunsets were purple and red and yellow and… on fire. And the clouds would catch the colors everywhere. That’s unique, ’cause I used to look at them all the time. You don’t see that.”</p></div>		</li>
