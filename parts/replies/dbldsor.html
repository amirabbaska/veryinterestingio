			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically a neutron star doesn't have to spin, but realistically practically all neutron stars do spin around its axis of rotation. For a neutron star to be considered a pulsar it must have a very strong magnetic field with an axis that is not parallell to its axis of rotation. And for us to be able to figure that out if a neutron star is a pulsar or not is if the magnetic axis lies in the plane of observation.</p></div>		</li>
