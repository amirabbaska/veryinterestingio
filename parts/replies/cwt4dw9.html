			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually those bags are not airtight. They are often micro perforated to allow airflow because the lettuce needs to breath. Other bags that aren't perfed use intentionally low barrier property plastics to allow passage of gasses through the packaging. When your lettuce can't respire, it switches primarily anearobic process and begins to break down. </p>
<p>Edit: To clarify, the target O2 concentration is lower than that of the atmosphere, but in order to keep it at the optimal level the packaging needs to have OTR (oxygen transmission rate) as close as possible to the respiration rate of the lettuce. If O2 is too high, it causes damage, and if CO2 is too high, it also causes damage. Gotta keep it just right, goldilocks style.</p></div>		</li>
