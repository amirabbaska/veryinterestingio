			<div class="markdown"><p>The ice age ended 10,000 years ago. The strongest evidence that we are causing the global warming that is happening now is due to human activities is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are rising in concentration due to human activities.</li>
<li>Increases in greenhouse gas concentration cause warming (because they trap heat leaving the Earth's surface and send it back down again). </li>
<li>When we simulate the effects of observed increases in greenhouse gas concentrations (and changes in particle = aerosol concentrations) in climate models, sure enough we can reproduce the observed warming.</li>
<li>If we drive the same models with observed natural changes including sunspot cycles, volcanoes going off, etc, we can't reproduce the observed warming instead we actually get a slight cooling predicted.
That's the crux of it but there's plenty more on this in our MOOC <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-change-challenges-and-solutions" target="_blank">https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-change-challenges-and-solutions</a> especially weeks 3 and 4.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other layman here. I believe there is proof &amp; fear that a lot of those would be released from areas like permafrost zones &amp; the like if the place keeps warming up. This is partially why there's so much push around it all. It's easier to do than to fix the damage &amp; many have said that we could reach a point of no return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately there is no easy and simple experiment we can carry out at home to prove these gases are warming the climate because the models rely on the impacts of climate which concerns weather recordings for over 30 years, so its difficult to replicate this at home in such a small timescale. Furthermore, anything chemistry is difficult to practice at home especially when it involves looking at molecular scale changes and how they absorb radiation. However, a useful example to see this for yourself would be going to a city. Cities are a lot warmer than the country side, this is partly due to the dark coloured building and concrete that absorb more heat, but it is also due to the higher levels of green house gases from the congestion, buildings etc. This helps visualise it better, but of course still can't show the complexities of the system that the models represent. I hope this helps! If you wan to find out more have a look at the course on future learn as Tim said, there are plenty of examples to help visualise and better understand the role of the green house gases, as well as the city example I've used (known as heat islands if you want to find out more), which is also exemplified on the course.

<blockquote>
<p>In the last 650k years, Earth has gone through 7 periods of glacial advance and retreat. The last was 7k years ago, marking the end of the Ice Age.<br />
CO2 was demonstrated to trap heat in the mid 19th century. In the course of the last 650k years, Earth atmospheric CO2 levels has never been above 300ppm, and we know that through mineral deposits, fossils, and arctic ice leaving telltale predictable signs of how much CO2 must have been in the air at the time. Today, CO2 is over 400ppm. Not only have we kept fantastic records pre-industrial revolution, especially the Swedes for centuries, but arctic ice has acted as a more recent history of the last several dozen centuries. CO2 levels has been growing at unprecedented rates and achieving levels higher than we've ever known to occur that wasn't in the wake of planetary disaster and mass extinction. It follows that if CO2 traps heat, and there's more CO2 in the atmosphere than ever before, it's going to trap more heat than ever before.<br />
Sea levels are rising. 17cm over the last century. The last decade alone has seen twice the rise of the previous century. So not only are the oceans rising, but the rate of rise is increasing exponentially.<br />
The Earth's average temperature has increased since 1880, most of that has been in the last 35 years. 15 of the 16 hottest years have been since 2001. We're in a period of solar decline, where the output of the sun cycles every 11 or so years. Despite the sun putting out less energy, the average continues to rise and in 2015 the Earth's average was 1C hotter on average than in 1890. That doesn't sound like much, but if we go some 0.7C hotter, we'll match the age of the dinosaurs when the whole planet was a tropical jungle. That's not a good thing.<br />
The ice caps are losing mass. While we've seen cycles of recession and growth, you have to consider ice is more than area, it's also thickness and density. Yes, we've seen big sheets of ice form, but A) they didn't stay, and B) how thick were they? Greenland has lost 60 cubic miles of ice and Antarctica has lost at least 30 cubic miles, both in the last decade. Greenland is not denying global warming, they're feverishly building ports to poise themselves as one of the most valuable ocean trading hubs in the world as the northern pass is opening, and it's projected you'll be able to sail across the north pole, a place you can currently stand, year-round.<br />
Glacier ice is retreating all over the world, in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.<br />
The number of unprecedented intense weather events has been increasing since 1950 in the US. The number of record highs has been increasing, and record lows decreasing.
The ocean absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere. CO2 and water makes carbonic acid, - seltzer water! The oceans are 30% more acidic since the industrial revolution. 93% of The Great Barrier Reef has been bleeched and 22% and rising is dead as a consequence. The ocean currently absorbs 9.3 billion tons of CO2 a year and is currently absorbing an additional 2 billion tons annually. Not because the ocean is suddenly getting better at it, but because there's more saturation in the atmosphere.<br />

In the 1860s, physicist John Tyndall recognized the Earth's natural greenhouse effect and suggested that slight changes in the atmospheric composition could bring about climatic variations. In 1896, a seminal paper by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first predicted that changes in the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could substantially alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not my AMA, but...</p>
<p>A huge piece of evidence that climate change is human-driven is that our data shows that while the troposphere (lower atmosphere) has been warming up in recent decades, the stratosphere (upper atmosphere) is cooling down.</p>
<p>Almost all previous warming periods have been caused by changes in the amount of sunlight, usually due to subtle variations in the orbit and axial tilt of Earth. That kind of change produces a top-down heating process: more sunlight means the top of the atmosphere heats even more than the bottom.</p>
<p>With a warm lower atmosphere and cold upper atmosphere, though, this is clearly a bottom-up heating process. You only see this kind of heating process when there's an increased number of infrared absorbers in the atmosphere blocking escaping infrared radiation after incoming sunlight has already been absorbed and re-radiated by the surface. In other words, exactly what theory predicts would happen if we started increasing CO2 in our atmosphere. </p></div>		</li>

<p>By the way, isnt it kind of good we are balancing the upper atmosphere cooling?</p></div>		</li>
