			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose I could've phrased it better, but the point I was trying to get at is that if demand for that kind of car (budget performance, luxury appearance) was high enough, a market would arise to either build the kits for people, or manufacturers would begin to design stock vehicles that fill that specific niche.</p>
<p>The demand for this sort of thing isn't high enough to warrant anything like that, though, so it still remains just a hobbyist thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor is, most people don't even know about them.  I actually want a retro kit car, but of course you have to explain what a kit car is, plus the bank won't finance anything you need to get in parts(they'll sooner finance a $20k Mac Pro than they will a $5000 PC you have to build yourself for the same business).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even kit cars a real car company would be shooting themselves by releasing a cheap but sexy sports car since most either make or have partnerships with people in that segment and it would negativity effect them. Even real super cars effect it years ago Dodge Jeep and Chrysler has competitions against each other. Jeep made the hurricane (google it) Dodge made some bike with a vipers engine and Chrysler made a relatively cheap super car about Lamborghini cost but a true multimillion dollar car competitor it almost went into production till Mercedes had it killed since it was cheaper faster and worked when their own super car was not working well big cost overruns and was meh in comparison plus I think they even fixed the transmission Mercedes was using but having issues with in their super car.</p></div>		</li>
