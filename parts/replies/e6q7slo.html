<p>Basically the system is acting like a bouncer, asking you if you want to let this program in to potentially run amok.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not entirely true for EXE installers. It depends on what rights and resources the application is requesting. Not sure if this is still the case but Spotify's installer used to not trigger UAC or require admin privileges by installing into the users profile instead of Program Files. This is also how a lot of malware client's get their payload to execute which then exploits a privilege escalation vulnerability (if there is one). After it achieves that, it can basically do whatever it wants.  </p></div>		</li>
