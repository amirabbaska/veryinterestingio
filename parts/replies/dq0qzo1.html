			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask you if this nervous system adaption occurs in the same or similar ways when developing this &quot;tolerance&quot; in other substances (opiates, prescription medication, marijuana, etc). If so, would it also then cause similar problems in the withdrawal from the substance? And finally, do the issues with whole sections of the brain dying occur for other substance withdrawals? I imagine that there's a spectrum of damage related to the physiological toxicity of the drug, but please, lay your knowledge on me! </p>
<p>tldr: is it just alcohol that does this or is it any substance you have a dependence on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depressant drugs are more commonly associated with life-threatening withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>Why? Think of them like a brake on your car. Once you get used to driving around with something constantly slowing you down, you start pushing harder all the time. Suddenly remove that brake and you’ll end up way too fast.</p>
<p>Similarly, the brain gets used to a depressant slowing its activity. Remove the depressant and neural activity speeds up, causing tremors, seizures and even death. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all depressants, very specifically the GABA receptors-- all full GABA agonist drugs can cause life-threatening withdrawals but no non-GABA drugs can.</p>
<p>GABA drugs are mostly benzodiazapines, alcohol, barbituates and atypical antipsychotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is anecdotal, but I’ve read similar reports</p>
<p>I was a heavy marijuana user (a bong rip every 30 minutes, literally high all day) and had to stop for a few months because I had a drug test for a job.</p>
<p>I had terrible insomnia for about a month and absolutely no appetite. If I didn’t eat for 24 hours, I’d get headaches but I would never get hungry.</p>
<p>Edit: also I’m not sure if it was caused by the withdrawal, but I had some bad anxiety spells (extremely anxious all day, nervous to the point where you think you’re going to faint) during this time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, the mechanism for tolerance is similar across substances! What is different comes down to what receptors that substance activates. Say you take an opioid, which activates receptors that recognize opioids and cause pain relief. If you do this enough, the body recognizes that it is getting more of this pain stopping signal than it used to and will decrease the number of these receptors. Now, it takes more drug for you to feel the same result. </p>
<p>Sometimes drugs work on enzymes instead, usually making them less able to do their jobs. In this case, the body will make more enzymes to compensate. </p>
<p>In all cases, the withdrawal symptoms depend on the substance in question. Since alcohol is a nervous system depressant (it slows the conduction of signal in the brain, which is what causes lack of coordination and inhibition, and so on), when you withdrawal from alcohol the brain becomes overactive. One sign of an overactive brain is anxiety. One of the more serious effects of alcohol withdrawal is seizures, which happens when signals in the brain become uncoordinated and fire repeatedly. </p>
<p>If you withdrawal from opioids, you feel pain because the pain stopping signal is gone. Interestingly, opioid withdrawal is less likely to cause death that alcohol withdrawal. </p>
<p>I haven't heard much  about withdrawal causing cells to die, but there was an interesting case in 1982 known as the &quot;Frozen addicts&quot; where 6 people used opioids contaminated with a toxic substance called MPTP. This caused some brain cells to die in the same area of the brain where people with Parkinson's disease loose brain cells. Therefore, these people appeared to have advanced Parkinson's disease. </p></div>		</li>
