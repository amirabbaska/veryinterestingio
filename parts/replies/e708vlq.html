			<div class="markdown"><p>Yay for experimentation!  As for theory, I think the umbrella is acting as a really poor thrust reversal device.  An ideal reversal device would be a nice tight duct that changed the airflow 180 degrees.  The umbrella is a horrible duct, but it still manages to redirect some of the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that is true for any thrust reversal device. After all, if thrust reversal devices could be more efficient than the original blower, then airplanes would have their engines mounted backwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for theory I think I recall something from one of my physics classes that this shouldn't be able to propel itself forward. The demonstration we had was a fan on a sail floating on water but the conclusion was something along the lines of Newton's third law and there not being an external force so forced should balance and cancel out unless the blower is separate from the system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you learnt is an extremely ideal case where the system is closed, essentially the blower and sail are in a closed box. In reality, the system is open and mass can enter or leave the system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that the specific example you were given doesn't work.</p>
<p>A fan pushes air from 0 to V, the air pushes the sail and goes from V to 0. The velocity change is the same, the momentum transfer is equal, the forces from the fan and the sail are equal and cancel each other out. The boat does not move.</p>
<p>In this case, imagine that this the boat, but that the fan is not directly pointed at the sail. So the fan pushes the air from (0,0) to (V,W). The air hits the sail and goes from (V,W) to (0,W). And so the air is being pushed away from the boat at (0,W) and the boat will move sodeways.</p>
<p>To take this further, say the fan was blowing air at (-V,0), ie directly away from the sail. Air is being pushed away from the boat at (-V,0) and so the boat moves forward.</p>
<p>The only time the boat doesn't move is if you point the fan directly at the sail.</p>
<p>In the video, because the umbrella is curved, the blower pushes air forward at V, it hits the umbrella, and then the umbrella actually curves the air around so that it is travelling backwards at a very small velocity. Air is travelling away from the tub, and so it moves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The air would have to be included in the system for that to be the case. I mean. Even if it was the case energy is conserved because the powering source of the blower would be converted into mechanical energy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy!<br />
For completeness, you could do it again with the blower attached to the cart but without the umbrella. I wanna see if your blower has enough thrust on its own to move the cart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also again with the blower taken off and aimed at the umbrella, but with a weight equivalent to the blower added to the platform. Plz /u/1158pm</p></div>		</li>
