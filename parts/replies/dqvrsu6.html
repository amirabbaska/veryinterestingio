			<div class="markdown"><p>My flashlight is 4000 lumens and it's about the size of a roll of quarters. It's probably the most powerful single 18650 light you can buy at the moment. It is unbelievably, blindingly bright. If you turn it on turbo in a dark room you could easily damage your eyes, it's like turning on the sun. I was actually able to light a piece of paper on fire with it and it will only run on turbo for about ten seconds before its too hot to hold. </p>
<p>Emisar D4 if you're wondering.  It is a fun toy but you need to be careful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Automotive halogen bulbs are 700-2100lm each HID and LED are 3600lm, so even the lowest rated bulbs provide 1400lm total for a car. </p>
<p>The reason your bike light illuminates trees far away so well is:</p>
<p>They are not NHTSA compliant.</p>
<p>Automotive headlamps are required to provide a wide, even illumination, limit the amount of light that other drivers see, and limit the amount that illuminates traffic signs and objects outside the lane. Except for 2-3 lights that were recently introduced, LED bike lights have flashlight beam patterns (tight circular pattern with a focused hotspot). Throwing a lot of light far away is the nature of that design, but it's not good for two way traffic, and it doesn't provide better vision for cycling. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Thats the technical side of the explanation. The other side is that manufacturers lie. A lot.</p>
<p>To compare with another real-world product that takes buyers for a ride, look at those huge, generally brightly coloured boom boxes made by the likes of Sony that they sell at Best Buy and have stickers on them that claim 5000 watts of power. Well, look at the actual power draw and you'll see that 5000w isn't remotely possible (which even a marginally intelligent buyer should suspect).</p>
<p>Flashlights are the same: who has the gear to test a flashlight's output against the claims of the manufacturer? One out of 10 000 people maybe? The risk of getting caught, then of being hit by a lawsuit, then of being bankrupt by said lawsuit is incredibly small, so it's worth the risk.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a formalized testing protocol, the ANSI FL1.  All serious flashlight brands send their lights off to a 3rd party to be truthfully measured.  And there are entire communities of people who test flashlights for fun.  It turns out most manufactures are honest.  Candlepowerforums, Budgetlightforums and our own /r/flashlight are full of people who can confirm manufacturer rates to at least one or two decimal places and can catch blatant lies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What, you can't draw 5000 watts at 120 volts on a 15-amp circuit?</p>
<p>Ohm's what?</p>
<p>But the sticker says 5k.</p>
<p>Yeah thanks for the advice, but I'm just gonna trust the sticker, thanks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They lie for regular fixtures too, which is why we have certification agencies that actually list tested results. And then I get electrical contractors up my ass because I can't approve rebates for non-DLC/Energy Star fixtures. No, that Chinese spec sheet claiming 200 lm/W for a $200 high bay isn't real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR below...</p>
<p>That's not why the numbers are so high. Cheap flashlights coming out of Asian markets almost always list the LED's maximum rating (as published by the LED mfg), regardless of how much current is pushed through the LED by the driver.</p>
<p>As an example, Cree XM-L2 LED's are rated for up to 1000lm at 3A. Anything beyond that is overdriving the LED, which requires a really good cooling setup, and sacrifices longevity.
XM-L2's are a popular LED, so you see a lot of single LED lights rated at 1000lm, triple LED lights rated at 3000lm, etc.</p>
<p>The reality is you cannot achieve those lumen outputs without quality design and materials. I'll use my Gloworm bike lights as an example. </p>
<p>X1: 950lm/LED (1), $85
X2: 750lm/LED (2), $120
XS: 833lm/LED (3), $175</p>
<p>Those prices are several years old, and do not include battery packs, which are another $60-$100 each. These are typical prices for quality lamps. It's also typical for only single LED lights to approach the 1000lm mark, due to thermal requirements. </p>
<p>TL;DR
Many cheap LED lights are 'rated' using the max approved output of the LED, but most output closer to 50% of that, while quality lamps with better cooling tend to push 80-90% of max.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never understood the logic behind some of those myths. Guys would buy a &quot;1000W&quot; amp for a &quot;5000W&quot; car audio subwoofer and realistically blow a cheap sub with 250W RMS and think they're actually pumping more than 1000W because the speaker says 5000W.</p></div>		</li>
