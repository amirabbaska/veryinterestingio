			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the idea that Keurig cups are recyclable is absurd.  Each of the layers might be recyclable on its own, but fused together?  Basically impossible.  In practice they either get buried or burned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, I'm fine with burned. Its done a lot in Europe and with the correct filtration of the fumes from incineration it works very well. However, there are only a handful of incineration plants in the US. </p>
<p>In Sweden they burn a lot of trash to make electricity and actually have to import trash to keep the incinerators running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only about 30% of the energy created by those plants is electricity. And they generally only run them in winter because they use most of the energy to transfer heat created by the burning of waste to their district heating grid. You need to have the right infrastructure to make burning anywhere near a sensible option</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small rigids that are tough to separate often make sense being ground and used as fuel in cement kilns. But incineration is a little more complicated.  Euro incinerators usually have heat/steam capture systems that make them much more efficient than those operating in the US. There’s also the issue that you need to feed the incinerator perpetually which acts as a disincentive to finding higher/better uses for those materials and supporting recycling markets. Also, most plastics are petrochemical rather than bio based and while incinerating them may be displacing other fossil fuel sources, for some materials it has more negative climate impacts than sequestering in a landfill. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did you get into this line of work? Recycling has always been a passion of mine and I've been through several MRFs from large Waste Management facilities to small sort lines from local haulers. The current Chinese recycling crisis, recycling education, and programs like Terracycle to achieve zero waste is absolutely fascinating to me. </p></div>		</li>
