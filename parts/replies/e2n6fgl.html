			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also unclear whether that's an anomaly or a trend.</p>
<p>If earnings are down 3% because of extraordinary expenses in launching a new product, generally the market will be expecting that and there won't be a penalty (or at least the penalty will be priced into the shares before the announcement)</p>
<p>If earnings are down because demand is dropping for the product or competitors are muscling into the market then it'll warrant drastic action because nobody wants to risk them being down 6% next quarter.</p>
<p>Netflix is suffering from a bit of that now. There aren't many easy to reach subscribers left - from here on out (in the US at least) any new netflix subscriber will have to be fought away from a competitor and that's a much harder strategy to win at. Will numbers be up next quarter, maybe, but i'm not sure even netflix know the answer to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well their current strategy seems to be to just constantly raise the subscription price without actually adding any value. Since they drop content at the same time while adding it, a Netflix sub is always about the same but it is almost twice the price it used to be (at least here).</p>
<p>Also Netlix has somewhat effectively blocked VPN usage, further decreasing the value from a non-US user point of view. TBH i don't even know why I'm paying for it anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on what you are taking the 3% from. If it is 3% of profit, it could be no big deal, if it is 3% of total company revenue, that is likely extremely bad...  As &quot;earnings&quot; is a little ambiguous between &quot;money coming in&quot; and &quot;profits after expenses&quot; it's hard to say what number is really being cited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have that flipped the wrong way. Profit is what it’s all about. Profit is real dollars before expenses. If you lost 3% top line, that’s nowhere the alarm that 3% profit loss would be. If a company were operating at 13% EBIT and then dropped to 10% in a calendar year, that would almost be a death knell. </p></div>		</li>
