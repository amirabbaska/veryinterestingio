			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I'm the same way. One time I went to the chiropractor and didn't even realize how it could sound sexual after the guy cracked my back all up and down til I was a loose noodle. He kept clearing his throat which I thought was weird and all the other people seemed to look at me weird when I left the small office. I didn't realize until a couple of hours later... I am a younger, attractive woman and he was in his mid forties.. It probably sounded like we were doing it!! I was so embarrassed i never went back again!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I had just started smoking pot, we were simply exploring every new thing that we could enjoy. I remember when the first time I encountered a specific winamp visualization I as a man let out a deep moan that all my friends heard and we never saw visualization together again. I watched it with alone later at time, but that moan never came...</p>
<p>EDIT: I am actually surprised that people have simply assumed the moaning thing is all about sex. It most definitely is not because I doubt that for the first timers, a moaning partner might raise an alarm but that surely doesn't happen. So I am sure people have their experience of 'moaning event' but they don't want to talk about it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this problem a lot as well if being given a massage. I am loud as hell.</p>
<p>I am honestly not a fan of them so it could be more of a pain response, but it is just how my body responds to the pressure. It took me far longer than I want to admit to figure out why people insisted on giving me back and shoulder rubs in high school even after I told them I do not like them...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same way. I used to joke with my first boyfriend about how he'd probably never hear me moan cuz I believed girls who moaned were always faking it. </p>
<p>Fast forward a few months and apparently I'm LOUD. Especially if we have the house to ourselves. I also make noise purposely to let him know I like what he's doing, but there are other times when it's 100% involuntary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't moan during sex, I find that I end up holding my breath half the time and I'm pretty quiet throughout. My fiance doesn't really moan in the traditional way either as she kind of whimpers instead.</p>
<p>I can't remember really groaning when being hurt either to be honest. I actually remember one instance when I fell off scaffolding onto my back but that was mostly because I had the wind knocked out of me and couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>I grew up with an abusive step-dad and learned early to hide my emotions and to not show pain when hit so I think that is why I'm like this which makes me think it's a learned or social trait in people. I could be an extreme case but that's my experience with it anyway. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry to say this, but  due to the origin of this learned behavior, I am wondering if it really is a type of psychological damage. Perhaps there's a range of intensity in what can cause it.. but I've often felt that my quiet or unnaturally loud partners were acting this way out of some irrational and subconscious fear. </p></div>		</li>
