<p>Also with 1.5g, the organelles and components of every cell in your body would weigh more. Who knows how that could effect cellular functioning.</p>

<p>I doubt the extra weight would have much of a direct affect on human biochemistry considering it all takes place in water, and changes in the relative buoyancy of the chemicals involved would be very negligible compared to the concentration gradients already present.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In all seriousness nasa did a long term test on chickens living multi-generationally in a high gravity centrifuge.</p>
<p>No negative long term health effects were noted, however the chickens were ripped. They also had denser, stronger bones, and a remarkably strong and efficient cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>The body adapts over time, just as an athletes body adapts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It appears that: yes, indeed NASA has raised chickens in a centrifuge.  More results indicate that this was not the only experiment.  As far as the claims made here on the affect to the chicken, I couldn't find any confirmation.  </p></div>		</li>
