			<p>That depends on the mode of &quot;destruction&quot; you're trying to achieve and the wavelength of the beam, but for something like a visible laser it's typically more than enough.</p>		</li>

			<p>Simply put energy is equivalent to mass, so enough photons in a certain volume will eventually form a singularity just like ordinary mass would.</p>		</li>

			<p>See above descriptions that describe how a system of photons (propagating in non-identical directions) can result in a non-zero invariant mass. With mass comes the distortion of space-time (Ã  la general relativity). I suspect this might be where he was going with this.</p>		</li>
