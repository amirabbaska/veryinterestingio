			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the Apollo Guidance Computer used a better approximation of pi using clever data representation in a compute capability without floating point hardware.</p>
<p>The Chinese had apparently developed the fraction 355/113 as a better approximation of pi than the 22/7 or 666/212 groups.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I'm not convinced. The page you linked makes no mention of spheres, and in a brief search it seems Archimedes is usually credited as the first person to give &quot;the volume of a sphere&quot; (though that phrase is badly vague). Really, the formula we have in mind is V=4/3 pi r^3, which relates the volume of a sphere to that of a cube. In this form it's as recent as Euler in the 1700's. Archimedes on the other hand just related the volume of a sphere to that of a cylinder. I've seen nothing to suggest that relation was already known before him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look, you have to be able to read Egyptian, so that not being possible,  you can't be convinced. The precise computation of a hemisphere was given in the RMP, and from that clearly a sphere's volume is very easy to figure.</p>
<p>Because many can't read Egyptian and don't know about the Rhind math papyrus.....</p></div>		</li>
