			<div class="markdown"><p>No. S will never see the influence of R on B. S will only ever see signals sent from B before R had time to send a signal to B.</p>
<p>(This assumes we are observing B at some sufficiently large time after the big bang. For early enough times, it is possible for the particle horizon to be <em>inside</em> the cosmological horizon, and so what I said would not be true. However, in the current epoch, it is true that the cosmological horizon is inside the particle horizon and not the other way around.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that makes sense.
As a followup,
Given enough time, will the particle horizons of S and R continually expand until they overlap each other? Or does expansion prevent this from ever happening?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't that an artifact of defining the event horizon in terms of an observer at infinity?  Individual observers still have their own observation horizons.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the frame of reference of an in-falling observer.   If the event horizon were also that observer's observation horizon, then said observer would be crossing his or her own observation horizon in finite proper time, which is absurd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The horizon is not defined in terms of an observer at infinity, although Schwarzschild coordinates do make the location of the horizon rather evident. The horizon is defined in terms of the global causal structure.</p>
<p>Different observers may assign different coordinates to the black hole event horizon, but the actual set of points in spacetime is the same for all observers. Everyone agrees that any event in the region behind the horizon is not in the causal past of any event outside the horizon. This is in stark contrast to a particle horizon in the FLRW metric or any of its analogues. Each observer's horizon is a different set of points.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't understand the distinction.  The history of an event doesn't depend on the observer.  For example,  there is no event outside my cosmic horizon in the history of any of the events inside my cosmic horizon, and every observer would agree about that.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Sure, but that's true in the Schwarzschild geometry too:  Someone who falls into the black hole gets to see what's inside.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This cannot be true.
If the object's state is correlated with the state of S, then an observer in region R can deduce some information about S. That makes region S influence region R.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If my understand is correct,  which it probably isn't. We could only deduce the distance from the particle horizon as the particle horizon is a function of distance on time.  </p>
<p>If I understand correctly. It would be similar to two individuals looking at the same point on the horizon from different points on the earth.  </p>
<p>Am I correct in this analogy? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The analogy is sort of correct, as all analogies are. You're trying to say it's possible for two observers on Earth to be looking at the same building, say, but not be able to see each other.</p>
<p>The major problem with this analogy is that it's still possible for one person to send a signal to the building, which then relays it to the other person. So the two people <em>can</em> talk to each other. But now think of these observers as galaxies that are receding from each other. It's possible for one galaxy to send a signal to the &quot;building&quot;, but for the relay to never reach the other person because the space between them has already expanded too much and is expanding too quickly for the signal to ever get there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in that analogy though can might be able to deduce what lies just beyond the horizon.  If the limits of your vision show a body of water flowing towards you, you can assume that there is water on the other side flowing in the same direction in some shape or form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also have to remember that in our exponentially expanding universe, the cosmological horizons about each point are monotonically shrinking in co-moving coordinates. (The particle horizon asymptotes to some finite radius in co-moving coordinates.)</p>
<p>So here are the observers S, R, and B right now in cosmological time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S --------- B ---------- R</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's assume they are all isotropic observers, so they all have the same cosmological time, call it <em>T</em>. Suppose also B is exactly halfway between S and R in co-moving coordinates and that this is the exact time that B crosses the particle horizon of both S and R; so this is the first time B is observable by S or R. If T is sufficiently large, then the cosmological horizons about S and R should be well within the particle horizons at S and R.</p>
<p>Recall that the particle horizon is the distance beyond which light emitted at the big bang cannot have reached you yet. The cosmological horizon is the distance beyond which light emitted right now will never reach you. So let's add those horizons to this diagram.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(-------[-----S ----]---(--B--)---[-----R-----]-------)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The square brackets denote the size of the cosmological horizon and the round parentheses denote the size of the particle horizon. So at the moment depicted in this diagram, both S and R can see B, which is to say that B is causally influenced by both S and R. Light from the big bang emitted at S and R has just now reached B.</p>
<p>As time goes on, the round parentheses will get larger, but asymptote to some finite limit. The square brackets, on the other hand will shrink to 0. So it's possible that a light ray emitted from S at the big bang will never reach R. But it has already reached B.</p>
<p>The question you are asking then: if R can see the effect of S on B, how is it that R is not causally influenced by S? Well, let's ask: what is R <em>actually</em> seeing? Is R, in fact, seeing the effect of S on B? No. What R is seeing is light emitted from B <em>at the big bang</em>, well before S was able to influence B. So R is, more or less, seeing the birth of the galaxy at B. In fact, R will <em>never</em> be able to see the influence of S on B because that takes a time at least equal to the time it takes the signal from S to reach B <em>plus</em> the time it takes for the signal from B to reach R. In other words, it would take at least the time it takes for a signal from S to reach R directly. But we know that S and R are outside of each other's particle horizon. So they will never see each other.</p>
<p>Yes, this sounds a bit bizarre. But this is true only because the universe is expanding and only because the expansion rate is large enough. For a matter-dominated universe, for instance, this would never happen. You can send out a signal at any point in space and it will eventually reach any other point in space. But for a dark-energy dominated universe with exponential expansion, that doesn't happen. For each point in space, there is only a bounded region of space (in co-moving coordinates) from which you will have ever received a signal. To all other parts of space you are <em>completely blind</em>.</p>
