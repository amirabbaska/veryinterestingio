			<div class="markdown"><p>But when wind hits your face, gathers in your mouth, isn't it sitting at a low psi,due to the wind pushing the air not allowing the escape. Why can I not allow that air in? My throat feels as if it closes off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's a misunderstanding here somewhere. The stream of air has low pressure. Our lungs work on a negative pressure system to suck air in. Air moves from regions of higher pressure to lower pressure. So to breathe, you have to decrease the pressure in your lungs even more than normal, so its lower than the already low pressure air outside</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait how does moving air have lower pressure? I mean, higher kinetic energy, more force, bigger pressure...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a property of fluids. Water flowing through a pipe fast exerts less pressure on the walls of the pipe than slow moving water for example, everything else equal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pressure is a form of energy, too. if you have moving air, it has mostly the same energy as the air around it, and for that to work the pressure has to be lower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this were true you would have trouble breathing regardless of the direction you were facing.  Wind to your back, side, or front would all result in a lower pressure around you and trouble breathing if this were what was driving the difficulty.</p></div>		</li>
