			<div class="markdown"><p>Had to scroll forever to find this. Analog video is frameless. There is only one pixel and its chroma and luminance adjust continuously. The illusion of frames come from that pixel being raster scanned over a 2D phosphor tube. If the recording were made with one moving pixel the whole process would be frameless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda, if you look at analog video data discrete frames separated by sync pulses (aka black bursts) are visible. You'd need to significantly modify the equipment to make an analog single pixel recording system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, NTSC and PAL have a continuous series of brightness and color values transmitted to your TV, which draws them as the electron gun in the CRT scans across the phosphor screen.  VHS, Betamax and Laserdisc all record continuously as well, and moves stored on them must be telecined.</p></div>		</li>
