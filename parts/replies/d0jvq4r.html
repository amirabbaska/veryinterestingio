			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is similar to the action of a single-phase motor. A motor which requires a jump start to get near the rotational frequency of the motivating magnetic field.</p>
<p>The trouble is that if you can't get close to the rotational frequency of the magnetic field then half the waveform will act as a brake with the other half accelerating the magnet. Thus for large differences in frequency there will be little net acceleration on the rotor and for some modes of interaction between the excitation field and the rotor there can even be a braking effect which would cause the rotor to seize and vibrate rather than accelerate.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for this braking effect can become pronounced while the rotor spins if the excitation power is low enough since the exciter will not be able to stop the rotor. Instead the rotor will appear to vibrate or shudder as it rotates, though for a radio wave such vibration may not be apparent to the naked eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, no.  A rotating magnetic field generated by electricity is not the equivalent a radiowave inducing torque on a magnet.  However, an inductive electric motor uses electromagnetic field similar to how a transformer works, but even then, thats not a radio wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also how MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) works.  Each of the hydrogen atoms in the patient is a miniature &quot;stationary magnet&quot;, and RF pulses are used to align them in different directions.  When the RF pulse finishes they will realign, with the time taken to realign giving information about the tissue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well not quite. In an MRI or NMR you've got a strong external field to align all the nuclei with net spin, and if you do nothing at this point , they spin forever without generating any signal at all.</p>
<p>The signal comes when they get pushed perpendicular to the external field. </p>
<p>I really haven't thought much about what a spinning magnet would do in a vacuum without external influence, but in an MRI there is a very strong external field and this field is essential for the signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather off the wall question, but if you could theoretically spin that magnet at say ~1.5 x 10^18 RPM (roughly the frequency of red light assuming a two pole magnet), would it start to emit light? This is of course assuming some super special magnet that wouldn't rip itself apart at such speeds. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It would also have to be small, otherwise the ends would be travelling faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Rotation, r = 1.5 x 10^18 RPM
Time, t = 60 s
Max speed, v = 3 x 10^8 m/s</p>
<p>The end of the magnet would move around a circle of circumference c.</p>
<p>Distance traveled (by end of the magnet), d = r x c
Distance traveled, d = v * t</p>
<p>rc = vt
c = vt/r = 1.2 x 10^-8 m</p>
<p>Max length of magnet = c / pi = 3.8 x 10^-9 m</p>
<p>So, in addition to being super special, the magnet would need to be smaller than 3.8 nm to even be able to rotate it at 1.5 x 10^18 RPM</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You did a really interesting back-of-the-envelope estimation, as there are some dye molecules 1-2 nm in size. Their rotational bands are far less energetic, however, than electronic transition frequency that can be red, green and blue in visible spectrum with no problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A bit of an extra problem is that, assuming a normal fridge magnet, this magnet would radiate <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sqrt(mu_0%2Fepsilon_0\)+%2F+(12+pi\)+*+(2*pi%2F(700+nm\)\" target="_blank">6 * 10^28 watts</a>%5E4+<em>+(1+A</em>m%5E2)%5E2), or about 150 times as bright as the sun.
