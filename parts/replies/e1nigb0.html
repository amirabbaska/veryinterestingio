			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to edit every cell in the body, you’re out of luck – delivery is still the big challenge. But if you edit a reproductive cell that will go on to make sperm or eggs, every cell in their offspring will have those changes. That's why gene drive is powerful - it repeats editing in the reproductive cells of each generation, ensuring that all offspring inherit. But it still only spreads vertically, from parents to offspring, so it's slow. For us already-existing organisms, we’re stuck waiting for a breakthrough in delivery. There’s a reason why it’s hard: we have to prevent viruses from hijacking our resources. So let’s be cautious about that breakthrough and just how accessible easy DNA delivery becomes, because that would be easy to misuse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be surprised to see substantial improvements in anything unless that outcome requires only editing a small fraction of cells, which some therapeutics applications do. Haven't looked into that particular application so I couldn't say for sure. I'm skeptical of many of the current clinical trials because they're designed to kill cancer cells, where you need to get every last one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about recombanent dna (i totally spelled that wrong) i heard it can change dna sequences. As for total body changes couldnt we theoretically engineer a virus to create changes to dna body wide. I recall a theroy that something like this could be used to do small things at first like remove genetic illneses.</p></div>		</li>
