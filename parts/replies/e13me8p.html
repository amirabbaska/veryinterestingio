			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna go with a no on that one.  100% humidity air happens all the time in the Southeast US.  It's not damp, it's just muggy.  Not enough liquid to sustain a fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but gravity causes the gill tissue to collapse, thats the key difference here. In zero G the gills could theoretically stay extended. Im curious about this myself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But maybe gravity is not the problem. The wet surface tension might cause the gills to stick together. This kills the fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The assertion is that on Earth away from liquid water, the fish's gills would collapse and presumably not be able to extract o2 from the 100% humidity air. 100% humidity in a low g environment could keep the gills from collapsing. In this case, would the fish's gills be able to function without immersion in water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume if the gills are still wet after removing the fish from the water then they would just stick together in air and the fish would still suffocate. However if you could somehow dry its gills.... Interesting question, hope someone can answer this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gills are supported by water flowing through them, keeping them seperated and maximizing surface area in contact with water. Out of water, they stick together and flatten (collapse), not allowing enough oxygen to permeate for survival. In zero-g, the gills might not stick together, but it is doubtful that they would be able to survive due to a number of factors, but mainly that gills need something flowing through them to keep them seperated and oxygenated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like it's worth an experiment... 100%humidity, 100% oxygen in a cylindrical tank with circulating jets like a jellyfish tank. Perhaps a labyrinth fish for the first try...</p></div>		</li>
