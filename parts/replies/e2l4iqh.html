			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that, it's that the letter A is a stop-word in most search engines. It's something that is skipped over, much like &quot;to, an, are, as, at, be, by&quot;, etc. So, Google is just looking for &quot;battery&quot;, and that's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>B is the plate voltage battery in vacuum tube (thermionic valve) equipment.  Usually some whacking great figure like 45 or 68 volts.  This is why you will still see stuff marked &quot;B+&quot; on schematics even though there haven't been things that actually used a separate battery for plate voltage in decades.  For Instance, a buddy of mine told a story of a guy who got a bad electric shock off a television set doing the &quot;There's the problem, right there&quot; routine on the live, open set while wearing a metal watch and crossed B+ to ground, which, in a color television set, can be truly ridiculous voltages like 50,000 (relatively small amperage, 'cause otherwise he'd have been dead, like, super-dead).  They came in a bunch of different sizes and were used for the weird &quot;wink-light&quot; flashgun that was used with Polaroid instant cameras; real electronic flashes were expensive and flashbulbs were a pain in the ass, and Polaroid had one of the fastest film formulations available at the time (3,000 ASA IIRC... your DSLR may not be able to be set so high!) so what they did was make a cheap flashgun by driving a 14v Chevy taillight bulb with a 45v &quot;B&quot; battery, the reasoning being that a fraction of a second at 3x over-voltage wouldn't kill it yet would be pretty bright.  it worked well enough for film that fast.</p>
<p>A was the filament heater, C was the grid bias.  A would run down really quick (the most inefficient way to heat something is through electrical resistance) while since C was providing little more than reference voltage, it more-or-less never wore down.  This was not the &quot;C&quot; you think of now (&quot;Dildo batteries&quot; as my Ex's daughters refer to them as...) but another big box looking thing.  While using a battery to provide this bias voltage was quickly superseded, they still make grid batteries today for laboratory use.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>The question remains why B batteries aren't used outside of European lanterns and flashlights.</p></div>		</li>
