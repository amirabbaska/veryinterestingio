			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhhh, okay that's downright fascinating, that is. I get these ALL the time. I was sitting at home the other day playing a video game, and all of a sudden I shivered like a medium walking into a murder house. I finally decided to internet the matter. Thanks for the response! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting, I didn't know they were seizures.  My girlfriend is epileptic and gets these all the time.  Could the epilepsy contribute to this happening more frequently?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like it! </p>
<p>According to Wikipedia: &quot;Myoclonic jerks occur in healthy persons and are experienced occasionally by everyone. However, when they appear with more persistence and become more widespread they can be a sign of variousÂ neurological disorders.&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there is a little bit of confusion here. Myoclonus is contraction of skeletal muscle</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Myoclonus describes a <strong>symptom and not a diagnosis</strong> of a disease. It refers to sudden, involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It occurs more often in people who are epileptic <em>while experiencing a seizure</em> because it is a <em>symptom</em> of seizures. </p>
<p>I think the problem is /u/bearpics16 used &quot;myoclonus&quot; in a misleading manner.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just google some videos</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPNVYFRhthg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPNVYFRhthg</a></p>
<p>EDIT2:</p>
<p>Essentially OP asked what the shuddering was/what caused it and /u/bearpics16 responded with &quot;muscle contraction&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have primary generalized epilepsy (very seldom have grand mal seizures) but I definitely feel like I have more of a propensity towards them.  Maybe I'm just self-centered haha.  Usually stems from sonic or binaural triggers (a.k.a fire ass beats) and also having to piss really bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have tonic-clonic epilepsy, however I am very fortunate not to have frequent seizures at all. In fact, I just made it to the year seizure-free mark :)
But yeah, I seem to get these jerks (which run down my neck/spine and to be quite honest feel quite pleasant!) with a much greater frequency than anybody I know who is non-epileptic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have epilepsy and have these several times a day. How often do most people have them? Before I had epilepsy (mine became onset within the last year) it wasn't nearly as frequent. It could be I just didn't notice it but who knows!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Epileptic too.  I'd say probably no more that a handful (for lack of a more specific number).  But they are always triggered by a physical stimulation (stubbornly having to piss or listening to a certain sonic/binaural combination).</p>
<p>Could be worse, I have friends (I have photosensitive) who can't listen to music with certain headphones or bass drivers because it triggers seizures :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to have to disagree with you on this one.  Myoclonus is as you described (kind of), but it doesn't cover the whole &quot;shudders&quot; thing.  When I sleep I randomly jerk my legs and arms to the point where it sometimes wakes me up.  That is an example of myoclonus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your input.  I spent some time researching this months ago because I didn't understand why I would wake up with my body thrashing around.  A hypnic jerk is a form of myoclonus.  In other exciting news, I have had several lucid dreams in the past year where I realize I'm dreaming.  It's usually because suddenly I notice the dream doesn't make sense and it's not &quot;real&quot;.   I can't control the dream after that but I do know I'm dreaming.</p>
