			<div class="markdown"><p>There's wakefield accelerators, which are smaller and way more efficient. They work by using a laser pulse to create very strong electrical fields in plasma. Electrons then <a href="https://youtu.be/S94m95wm-hE" target="_blank">surf this wake</a> to very close to the speed of light.</p>
<p>That can't test string theory, but a GeV particle accelerator that fits in a single room is kind of neat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just finished a plasma physics course by a colleague of someone who works on this, super super interesting. He said they could be very useful in the GeV range for small scale experiments but for his money they probably won't be stable enough to work on enormous scales. Daydreaming though, if it could be made to scale up, you could fit CERN inside a departmental building. Do you know anything about ways this method could be more scalable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: Very big accelerators aren't that much of a pipe dream - we still need some pretty big advancement that would bring price down to reasonable levels, but designs exist already, for accelerators located in space.</p>
<p>They aren't enormous constructions - they are just a constellation of satellites, each of them a single &quot;accelerator module&quot; accelerating particles passing through towards the next one. Vacuum of space is good enough to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot;, you just need a whole bunch of satellites, each with own BIG solar power array, superconducting magnets, very precise ion thrusters to keep it aligned with other satellites, and so on.</p>
<p>We have - or are very close to having - pretty much everything that would be needed. (colloid thrusters, needed to keep the constellation in alignment are still in final phases of development, the rest is pretty much ready.) The one problem is a single such satellite would cost a good few hundred million. And you'd need several hundred of these to make an accelerator in Earth orbit. Probably several million of these if it was to work in solar orbit. How far is that from what would be needed for the String Theory, I don't know, but it would definitely leave LHC in the &quot;tonka toys&quot; territory.</p>
<p>So the &quot;breakthrough&quot; we need is significant reduction of cost of space launches and space technology. We have all the know-how, but the cost is impossible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought the limit to the particle energy is that small acellerators can't fit enough magnets to turn them in a circle?</p>
<p>Don't you need to use the same amount of (identical) magnets regardless of the acellerator size?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you build an accelerator around the photosphere of a black hole, such that the accelerated particles are traveling along geodesics? I've thought about this before but don't know enough about how GR and Electromagnetism interact to answer it myself. My intuition tells me the this would be equivalent to building an infinitely long linear collider, and would have similar radiation losses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there are unstable orbits for light like particles at r=3/2 r_s.

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could make a straight-line partical accelerator but it would have to be very long.  A circular path allows each partical to make several circuits as it gets up to speed, saving on cost of equipment.</p>
<p>The bigger the circle, the faster you can go.  If the circle is too tight you limit the speed because you keep losing forward accelleration to lateral accelleration.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>If the accelerator was as big as the galaxy, this would create some interesting logistics when operating. Our galaxy is 300,000 light years in circumference, so it would take 300 millennia for a group of particles to do just one round.</p>
<p>The accelerator stations around the path would have to coordinate in advance and be ready for the arrival of the particle bundle. On the flip side, that's a heck of an early warning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can we make one that's both? Say a partical does most of its acceleration in a circular path, then it opens to a linear one for the final bit of speed. Or are there problems with such a design? (I'm sure there are, otherwise they'd be doing it.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two major classes of accelerators, linear and circular (Synchrotron).  Electrons must be on a linear accelerator. When charged particles move in a circular motion, they loose energy in the form of Synchrotron Radiation (SR). SR is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle so the lighter it is, the greater the losses. Protons are about 1000 times heavier so the losses are minimal and can safely be used in a circular accelerator.</p>
<p>From an engineering standpoint, linear accelerators are easier to upgrade, just make it longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, sometimes we do use electrons in a synchrotron. We have uses for that radiation, x-ray uses. But yeah, if you're trying to minimize that loss, linear is better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current methods involve zooming the particles around and around to keep speeding them up, first a slower smaller circle, then at high enough speeds transferred to a second and third circle. If it wasn't a loop then it would have to be very very long which is just a worse design.</p></div>		</li>
