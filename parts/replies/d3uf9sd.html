			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine that most of the mass loss is from physical ejection, but I do not have any numbers to back this up. My opinion is based on the fact that mass changes from electromagnetic emissions are quite small. </p>
<p>But, there is also mass loss occurring from the various types of fusion reactions occurring inside the sun, and although each &quot;individual&quot; series of mass losses is small, the sheer volume of the sun might make that mass loss comparable or even greater than coronal ejection, etc. I'd love to find some numbers about this, might try and do some research later... ;) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply! I'd be excited to see those numbers too!  I'll do some looking myself, but I probably won't understand the numbers very well. </p></div>		</li>
