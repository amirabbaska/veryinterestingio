<p>Commercializing such a device requires extra components, specifically an LED driver, which takes the AC that your home provides and coverts it to DC that can then power a series of LEDs. These drivers have an operational frequency, the rate at which they cycle the power to the LED. In modern LED lamps, these frequencies are well north of 2000 Hz. However, a driver that is compact enough to fit in a retrofit lamp comes at a cost. So some manufacturers will still use drivers that operate at 100 Hz to save money/cut corners.</p>

<p>Except that in modern auto lamps, these drivers cost a few pennies.  And they don't come from AC.  Even if the mfg pays for the development in the mfg contract (which they almost never do anymore anyway).</p>
<p>120 is an industry standard because thats exceeds NA regulations, and there's not much reason to PWM faster... some do, but it doesn't seem to reflect brand quality or cost, it's mostly program discretion</p>

<p>Actual ELI5 is more like &quot;Many LED lights are turning off really fast. Why? Because their power is going off-on-off-on 100 times a second!   When you move a light fast enough, you can see it during the off times!  Let's try it.  [Experiment] ... Now, why do we make the power go on and off? It's a cheap way to make the light look dimmer.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats true, i wasnt really aiming to ELI5 with that one lol</p>
<p>it was more like ELI LED R&amp;D</p></div>		</li>
