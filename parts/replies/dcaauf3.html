			<div class="markdown"><p>Ian Malcolm, a man whose body was so tightly clad in ladder, it's amazing he could think straight at all. He makes a very important point though and let me reassure you, scientists really are thinking whether or not they should. Their experiments are tightly controlled by various regulatory agencies and all of the researchers I spoke are keen for the public to get involved early on, at the decision making stages. This is not a decision for any one scientist to make. It's something for society to thing about.
Should we bring back a dinosaur? Much as I'd love to meet a T rex, it's technically impossible. Add to that, in the 65 million years since they've been gone the world has changed beyond recognition. Their ecosystem is well and truly gone. There's nowhere for them to live making it a complete and utter non starter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supposing we could extract some T-Rex DNA, would it be possible to insert the genetic data into birds and at least breed some of the traits back into existence?</p>
<p>I feel like from a research standpoint, it would be really interesting to see if we could observe some T-Rex behavior and traits in a modern species. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're simplifying genetic modification a lot. Proteins that work one way in one organism, might work the opposite way in another. Different proteins interact in different ways, and the immune system might even break down unfamiliar proteins. Different proteins have different effects on each other, some good, some bad. Some proteins won't even do their jobs, some will be malevolent, and those that have a positive effect on the creature's fitness will be incredibly rare.</p>
<p>The chance that we can successfully implement a completely foreign random gene in another creature is nihil, bordering on fantasy.</p>
<p>Then there's also the problem of not knowing what each specific gene encodes for. There's no living T-Rexes to observe, so all we have is some random DNA-bases and some estimates.</p>
<p>There's also legal/ethical problems, as there's a lot of controversy surrounding genetic manipulation.</p>
<p>So, the answer is no. Not right now, not in the near future. I fear not even in the far future, but who knows what time will bring. Man once thought it impossible to fly.</p></div>		</li>
