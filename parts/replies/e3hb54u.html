			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly brownish tan &quot;desert colored&quot; due to having a mix of different minerals. The actual rocks will vary depending on the bedrock geology of the area. In a place like Mali, there will be more dark volcanic rocks. In a place like Egypt, there will be more light limestone chunks. Almost everywhere, there will be a layer of light caliche from groundwater leaching. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would depend where you were- the underlying geology changes on location and whether or not there were exposed rock outcrops before the sands were laid down- although most of it will be limestone, a rock that formed in shallow marine/lake conditions before north africa was uplifted as it collided with the eurasian plate.</p>
<p>There may be volcanic rocks too, depending where you are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree (in part).  The image you refer to (<a href="https://imgur.com/UrQBsUO" target="_blank"><a href="https://imgur.com/UrQBsUO" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/UrQBsUO</a></a>) is a geophysical cross-section, and the bottom is intentionally cut off at a given depth, so it perfectly mirrors the top.  Therefore, the bottom of the image is not the bottom of the sand.  The bottom of the sand is almost certainly the strong subhorizontal reflector, which I've highlighted here: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/0fHqobo" target="_blank"><a href="https://imgur.com/a/0fHqobo" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/a/0fHqobo</a></a>.  So there is little relationship between the topography of the dunes and the topography of the bedrock-sand interface.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that sand would create a uniformly thick layer over its substrata was mind-boggling. Almost like it had surface tension adhering it to the bedrock.  Plus the texture of the graph couldnâ€™t be interpreted. Your explanation makes a lot more sense, thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right on point. Reflectors wouldn't terminate in such an abrupt fashion. Is the GPR as he indicated or shallow seismic imaging? </p></div>		</li>
