<p>It was designed to fly at very high speeds for long periods of time, which results in significant heating due to aerodynamic effects, which in turn results in pieces of the fuselage expanding by several inches!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole plane would expand by several inches, not individual parts.  The plane got <em>absurdly</em> hot.  When Kelly Johnson (who started Skunk Works and is an aeronautical legend) first approached Ben Rich (who eventually succeeded him and worked on everything from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-117_Nighthawk" target="_blank">F-117</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_YF-22" target="_blank">prototype for the current F-22</a>) to design the propulsion system, he asked him &quot;How hot do you suppose the airplane will get at Mach 3 in sustained flight?&quot;  Kelly's guess was about 900 F (480 C).  By the time the plane was finished they got the temperature down around 600 F (315 C), which was good since most of the plane was built out of a titanium alloy that softens around 550 F.  Higher temperature alloys of titanium exist (and are sometimes used in jet turbines for helicopters), but at the time it was incredibly difficult to work with them- they ate drill bits for breakfast.  </p>
<p>Every inch of that plane was built specifically for speed.  The black paint?  That was because black radiated heat better, keeping temperatures on the wing 35 F lower (and adding a hundred extra pounds).  The fuel they used was like maple syrup at room temperature and had to be heated to 350 F (175 C) before it could be forced through the nozzles into the engine.  They used <em>fuel</em> as a coolant for the entire plane.  The temperature next to the glass windshield was hot enough to boil water, so they built a system to tap air off the engine compressor, cool it with the fuel, then expand it so that the air temperature dropped to -40 F (-40 C) and they used <em>that</em> to cool the cockpit.  They tested it by putting it inside a broiler with a test pilot.  They heated the outside to 600 F with that guy inside.</p>
<p>The outside air at altitude was -65 F.  A few feet away next to the aircraft it was 600 F.  A few inches inside the cockpit it was 75 F.  A few feet away from that, inside the heat exchanger, it was back down to -40 F, and about 80 feet away from that inside the afterburner it was 3400 F.  The nose was 800 F.  The engine cowlings were 1200 F.  Each of the engines made as much power as the RMS <em>Queen Mary</em> (2,139 passengers).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have to feel like they did it with a thermo probe first. Otherwise, props to that volunteer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't find the source right now, but I recall reading that the fuel was a myth. They would take off with nearly empty fuel tanks so that if they had a problem shortly after takeoff, they would be light enough to land. Once airborne without issue, SOP was to quickly perform an in-flight refueling then continue with the mission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not. If you read the book &quot;sled driver&quot; which gets quoted on here every time someone mentions the Blackbird (and is probably mentioned in this thread at some point) the author states that she leaked. Yes, they did a midair refuel right after take off, and then had to get the girl up to temp. I think the refuel was also because she'd be a bit heavy for takeoff. It's been a few years since I've read it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct. The fuel made the plane too heavy to take of comfortably on most runways, and there was a risk of increased wear and tear on the tires. Also, in the event of an emergency the plane had now way to dump fuel, so taking off with a lot of fuel meant that you would have to come around and land with a bunch of fuel, in a plane that already did poorly at low speeds. In a really bad situation one of the engines might fail, and carrying a full load of fuel at low speed with no altitude to spend would be catastrophic. </p>
<p>I don't think that /u/klyonisis was saying the plane didn't leak. I think they were saying that the fuel leak is not the reason for the after-takeoff refueling, which is true. </p></div>		</li>
