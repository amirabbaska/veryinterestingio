			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I can try, but I am not very good at it, so I'm sorry in advance. I'm basically answering your question only in the last two paragraphs - all the stuff before is (necessary) prerequisites.</p>
<p>One of the most wonderful things you learn very early when studying physics is the <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_19.html" target="_blank">principle of least action</a>. Of course you know that if you drop a ball from a certain height, then it falls down to the ground. And in school you learned that in the beginning, the ball had some potential energy and when you drop it, it converts its potential energy into kinetic energy until it lands on the floor and has zero potential and kinetic energy, great.</p>
<p>Ever wondered why when you drop a ball, the ball just falls down? Why doesn't it fly around a little bit, maybe hover for a short while and then fall down to the ground? In this scenario, it would have the same potential and kinetic energy in the beginning and in the end. But we don't see that happen, ever. And it's kind of intuitive to say &quot;well, while it is flying around and hovering, it has different, even more kinetic and potential energy, and this is totally different from just falling straight down&quot;. If we somehow could add up the &quot;energy balance&quot;, the difference between kinetic energy and potential energy, at any time while the ball is falling, then we would see that the first scenario, where the ball falls straight down, has a much smaller result than the second scenario.</p>
<p>This is basically the principle of least action - for some reason, the ball takes the path that minimizes this sum of &quot;energy balance&quot;, of kinetic and potential energy. And this or a similar principle forms the basis of basically any modern physics theory. You have an action, you can show that this action must fulfill some special things to be minimized, and in the very end this gives you conditions your ball or particle or field must fulfill.</p>
<p>The principle of least action is so fundamental that even Einstein himself didn't fully believe in his theory of gravity, general relativity, until a friend of him found a way to derive his very theory through a principle of least action. This friend was Hilbert, and he found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Hilbert_action" target="_blank">Einstein-Hilbert-action</a>. </p>
<p>As you may have heard, Einsteins theory of gravity states that gravity is caused by spacetime curvature. You can describe spacetime curvature with the Ricci scalar which we simply just call R. The Einstein-Hilbert-action basically is just that - R. Ok, actually it's a bit more, some constants thrown in front of it, but the really interesting part is that you have this Ricci scalar R, you apply some mathematics to it and you get the equations telling you how spacetime is curved by energy and matter.</p>
<p>And now, after I explained one of the most wonderful things in such a terrible manner, I can tell you what f(R) gravity is: Instead of your action being just R, as in general relativity, some people asked what if the action is more complex? What if it is RÂ²? Or 1/R? What if the action is some function of R? f(R)? So you can just plug your function f(R) into the action, apply some mathematics to it and you get, again, equations telling your how spacetime is curved. And depending on what function you chose, you get different results. </p>
<p>And now please excuse me as I feel ashamed for this comment. This topic is full of so much wonderful stuff that I just can't properly express. Words are so, so limited compared to thoughts and mathematics....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really good explanation, thank you.
But I'm wondering, if we use a function f(R) replacing R to describe the space time curvature isn't the fundamental model of space time and gravity still the same?
Or are any hypothetical particles or new principles involved?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of reminds me of density functional theory in solid state physics. Instead of needing to know the exact quantum state of every electron in the system, you only need the electron density, rho. Everything you need to know can be calculated from the scalar field rho, i.e. everything can be calculated from a function f(rho) which is way easier than dealing with functionals f(psi1, psi2, etc). </p>
<p>This is probably totally wrong and someone who knows more physics should chime in :)  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a previous response of mine I discussed how to read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations#Mathematical_form" target="_blank">Einstein Field Equations</a>, which you can see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/50l4g7/how_precisely_is_it_possible_to_measure_spacetime/d75cz4d/" target="_blank">here</a>, so I won't copy all of that down again. Basically, the left-hand side of the equation involves stuff dealing with the structure of spacetime and the right hand side involves your distribution of matter/energy. There are lots of equations represented there very compactly though, and so really it tells you how matter/energy &quot;warps&quot; spacetime and then how that warping causes the matter/energy to move. </p>
<p>R is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_curvature" target="_blank">Ricci scalar</a> and is one of those products of the metric when you take enough derivatives and do some other simple algebraic manipulations (meaning adding, multiplying, etc., are simple, the form those go in looks pretty complex from the outside). It assigns a single number (scalar) to all points in the spacetime that represents the curvature at that point. There are other ways to represent curvature, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor" target="_blank">Riemann tensor</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_curvature" target="_blank">Ricci curvature tensor</a>, etc., which assign a whole tensor (think about going from scalar to vector and then extending that to higher dimensions, sort of) to each point in space. </p>
<p>Anyway, one way to write the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics\)" target="_blank">action</a>&quot; of the system (something from which you can derive the equations of motion for all particles) is with the Einstein-Hilbert action, which is given by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F(R\)_gravity#Introduction" target="_blank">introduction</a> for the f(R) gravity wiki page. For standard general relativity, there's just a factor of the Ricci scalar in there but in f(R) gravity, there is some more complex function of the Ricci scalar. For example, it's easy to write it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F(R])_gravity#Observational_tests" target="_blank">Taylor-series</a>, so f(R) = a_0 + a_1 R + a_2 R^2 + ... , where in normal general relativity you'd just have f(R) = R, so a_0 = 0, a_1 = 1, a_2 = 0, a_3 = 0, etc. The goal is to use obserations to constrain those constants and then see how much of a deviation there is from standard general relativity. As you can see in the wiki, what's done is to dismiss a_0 as like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant" target="_blank">cosmological constant</a>, set a_1 = 1, and then see what limits you get for a_2. If at some point someone can determine that a_2 is significantly non-zero, that has implications for what kind of modifications we need to make to general relativity. For now, it's an upper limit consistent with zero. Remember that we do know that general relativity isn't a proper theory of everything and is in tension with quantum mechanics in some respects, which is why we look to see if we can observe modifications of general relativity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am loving the wiki page on this. Most of the time it's over my head what exactly all these theories do exactly, but this one explains it in a super clear way. Before you had a constant in the equation, now it's a function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To me, it's a really nice way to parameterize the theory because you can place very simple numeric constraints. You may also like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism" target="_blank">PPN formalism</a> which parameterizes the terms higher than Newtonian typically on a scale so that the fractional errors are close to zero (zero = GR). It makes it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism#Accuracy_from_experimental_tests" target="_blank">very clear</a> just how good plain general relativity is but also where alternate theories have room to maneuver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither of those are candidates for a TOE, they are simply extensions and generalizations of already existing models. F(R) gravity, for example, says nothing about the universe outside of gravity. Likewise, Supersymmetry at best gets you to grand unification. And even then, IIRC (although I might be wrong), grand unification is not something inherent in SUSY, but simply a common extension of it because it provides you some really useful tools to achieve it.</p></div>		</li>
