			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  The Iridium satellites that the F9 was delivering have to go to a certain orbit and position in space, and based on the F9 launch profile, there was one instant that day that would put the satellites in the right place with the right velocity.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool! Thanks for the detailed response. I find it so awesome that they have the technology and know-how to launch at a specified time for everything to fall into place. </p></div>		</li>
