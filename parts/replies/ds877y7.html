			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually are related to photons, just not in an intuitive way. any electromagnetic force between charged particles is described as the exchange of virtual photons in quantum electrodynamics.</p>
<p>the crucial thing is the &quot;virtual&quot; and that its just a description. the relevant equation look like there is a particle, so we say there is.
interpretation of these force carrier particles (gauge bosons) can not be taken literally, as most people do.
we humans are simply not able to really understand the quantum world, because we dont have senses that can experience it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They definitely are related to photons. However, the way that it is taught in an undergrad level does not do a good job of explaining this. Especially since you can't really explain a photon until you start to get at to graduate level courses. That being said, all electric fields are the result of photons being exchanged between the charged particles in objects. In a sense, every charged particle it technically exchanging photons with all other charged particles (as long as they are within each others retarded potentials). However, in almost every case, the electric forces will cancel each other out. This can be thought of how the strong force is not felt outside of bound states. The force either drops to 0 at large distances, or it cancels out through interactions with the vacuum (since we don't know the form of the potential, we cannot say the exact reason why this happens).</p>
<p>To explain why all charged particles interact, let's look at an example. Take the simple case of the hydrogen atom. In undergraduate quantum mechanics, you are taught that there is a proton, and electron, and the binding energy. However, that is not the complete picture. You have the electron, proton, and photon. The bound state energy is not -13.6 eV. It is 938 MeV + 0.511 MeV - 13.6 eV. The &quot;photon&quot;, is then photons which are continuously being absorbed and emitted by the other two particles. Analyzing this in a more classical sense, we would see that this would produce a standing wave. Even more interesting, if you look at the problem of a particle in the box for a massless particle, you can break the 2<em>m</em>a^2 term in the denominator to (E + mc^2 )<em>a^2 = E</em>a^2, note that doing this you would also multiple the denominator by c^2 and say 2m = c^2 /2mc^2. You can then massage the equation more to see that the energy would be proportional to 1/r, which is exactly what we would expect for the potential energy between two charged particles.</p>
<p>Then going to classical electromagnetism, we always are taught to look at the potential and electric field, which would tell us how our current particle would interact with a new charged particle if we make it exist at some point in space. However, in reality this is not how things work. The only way for charges to suddenly exist is through pair production. If you have a bar magnet and move some metal iron towards it, the iron does not suddenly feel the magnetic field when you bring it close to the atom. Those atoms have always felt each other's presence, since before the creation of the earth. It just becomes non-negligible when they finally come close together.</p>
<p>To rephrase this, electric fields cannot interact with &quot;nothing&quot; (note radiation can) as is often shown in electro-magnetism classes. This is because you cannot have a case where an electron is just emitting photons freely. If you have a charged particle at rest, it would violate conservation of energy if it were to emit a photon. If you have an electron and proton annihilate, they can still not create a free photon on their own. To see why, go to the center of momentum frame of those particles. When they collide, the resulting photon would have no momentum and then be at rest. However, we know from relativity that the speed of light is invariant in all frames. There for, that kind of interaction cannot exist. It is only when two particles scatter off of each other they can release some of their collision energy as a free photon. The field lines that we would draw are just showing how the photons would transfer energy between a new charged particle is placed in some position.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this is to look at gravity. If I were to tell you that our galaxy feel the gravity from a nearby galaxy, you would agree. If I tell you that you and me also feel the gravity from that galaxy, and essentially all other objects in the universe, you would also agree. Now, gravity works through the exchange of gravitons (I study particle physics so I accept this statement as being true), then you would expect that that means that we are exchanging gravitons with those distance galaxies. Electricity is no different. It's  just that photons can cause positive or negative attraction between objects while gravitons (as far as we know) only have an attractive force.</p>
<p>All of that being said, /u/iwillbecomehokage is correct in saying that these photons being exchanged are virtual particles. The obvious way to see that is that through all of these descriptions, we are able to talk about every electro-magnetic interactions as the sum of all interactions that a charged particle would feel from other charged particles. Thus, if you were to move an electron through a capacitor, it would not be interacting with the photons that are being exchanged between the positive and negative charges in the capacitor. It is only interacting with each of the charged particles with the charged particles in the capacitor, and has it's own unique set of virtual photons which it is exchanging with each of them. However, the net energy transfer that the electron would feel as it approaches the capacitor would essentially be null, and the energy transfer it would feel once inside of the capacitor would correspond with the electric potential inside the capacitor and it would feel a force in accordance with the electric field lines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The process of moving creates electromagnetic induction. This induction is both an electric and a magnetic phenomenon, so it does create radiation and thus photons.</p>
<p>But it does not create only a &quot;magnetic wave&quot;, as you mention. Basically, whenever you have a changing magnetic field, you immediately have a changing electric field at the same time. That's the beauty of the electromagnetic theory, both fields are tightly coupled and basically part of the same phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>
