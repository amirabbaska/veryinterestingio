<p>In Einstein's time, there was confusion in the scientific community about the periapsis of mercury and how it was deviating in a strange way, and the math wasn't adding up. When Einstein first derived the EFE, he discovered that he was able to show how the curvature of space-time affected the behavior of mercury in a way that matched how it was behaving. It is said that when he first realized this, it gave him heart palpitations for days.</p>

<p>I hadn't heard that before, but I believe it.</p>
<p>It must have been such an overwhelming experience, learning that something he'd thought of and worked out in his own mind accurately described a facet of reality that <em>governed the motion of planets and stars.</em></p>
<p>It must have felt like wandering through a huge house full of closed doors, looking for a particular room and stumbling into God's workshop uninvited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting.
I'm no physicist, i dropped any science at age 17. Can you explain to me what theoretical physicists do all day when they're working? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fiddling with equations and by planning out hypothetical scenarios. The same way that a high school student in physics could tell you how far a ball would go based on the angle and velocity you threw it at without actually theowing a ball, a theoretical physicist tries to come to conclusions by building a situation and tries to pull things out of it based on what information can be derived from it</p></div>		</li>
