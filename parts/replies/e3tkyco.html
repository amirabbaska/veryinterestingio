Given a human head rotation rate of ~350 degrees per second, after a distance of ~49000 km, they would have to move faster than lightspeed to get out of your field of vision in time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago a guy I rode the bus with was telling me about how he and his friends would dress up as vampires and werewolves (LARPing?) at night.  At some point he told me there were real vampires in the world. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and asked if he was referring to the goth kids in Florida who drank each other’s blood, but no... real vampires.  Blood sucking immortals who could turn into bats. </p>
<p>I laughed and politely told him that was ridiculous, but he insisted. At some point he said, “have you ever met a vampire?” ... “no?” ... “how can you be sure you haven’t?”  He asked if I had ever seen a vampire.  Of course not.  “how do you know they aren’t real though?... there’s plenty of things in the world you have never seen, but believe exist.”   Then he asked me to prove there are no vampires ... which I obviously couldn’t do.   He thought that me being unable to prove they didn’t exist was proof they did.  This dude legit believed in vampires.  Really when you think about it, it’s no more ridiculous than some of the religious stuff people believe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much every LARP club that runs Vampire the Masquerade makes their members agree to a statement saying they are definitely human, and not actually a vampire, werewolf, wizard, or anything else. I've promoted LARPing at Cons, and I've had to turn away numerous people who really thought they were a vampire or a werewolf.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was around 2001 and from what I remember, the guy and his friends would get together in a parking garage at night pretending to be vampires and werewolves.   But he legit believed Vampires were real and claimed my inability to disprove their existence made him right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's one of two people I've met who legit believe in vampires.  </p>
<p>I use to live in an apartment complex that had a hot tub.  I was using it one night and this guy in his late 20s joined me.  Kinda a strange heavily tattooed guy, but friendly.  He told me he was bisexual.  He might have been hitting on me.  Not sure.  At one point he asked if I had ever been hypnotized.  I said no.  He claimed he could do it and asked if I wanted to be hypnotized...  hard pass...   </p>
<p>Then he started telling me a story about how one time he was hypnotizing a friend.  I forget exactly how he explained it, but essentially he claimed he had his friend in a deep state of hypnosis and they were exploring his &quot;mental library&quot; together as if it was a physical space.   But to his shock...  there was someone INSIDE his friend's mental library.  &quot;Oh.  Ok?&quot; ...  I didn't give the reaction he expected.  Apparently this was a big deal.  </p>
<p>&quot;There's not supposed to be someone INSIDE your mental library!  Your mental library is just supposed to be for you and you alone.  This was shocking!  There was someone inside my friend's mental library hanging out!&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Oh.  Ok, wow... so... like... what was up with that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well turns out, my buddy's ancestors come from a long line of vampires and they were keeping the bloodline alive through him - hence why they were hanging out in my buddy's mental library.&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed and asked the guy if he and his friend happened to be taking mushrooms when they were doing the hypnotism, but he insisted they were fully sober.  Fearing the guy might get offended and stab me, I just played along... &quot;Wow... fascinating... vampires.  Interesting.&quot;   He then went on to tell me he had met multiple vampires throughout his life - most recently at a dance club in Berlin.</p>
<p>So yeah... there are people out there that believe in vampires.  I stopped using the hot tub at night after that.</p></div>		</li>
