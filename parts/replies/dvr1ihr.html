			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes. Think of it as a half life. You have a minimum useful quantity of material and as the original product degrades you approach the point where it is too degraded to function. In the past it wasn’t possible to manufacture such small transistors and so the product would still function as it degraded because there was more material than strictly necessary. If it was halfway degraded, it might still function. Now, there is less material and even a small amount of degradation affects performance. Let’s simplify and say that the transistors are structurally equivalent to metal wire. If the wire in your walls is 1/10 inch wire, then a rust coating of 1/100th if an inch thick after a year is pretty small. But the metal rusts at a constant rate. 1/100th if an inch is nothing to a inch thick metal plate. It’s everything to a wire that is nanometers. 1/100th of an inch is much thicker than the transistors themselves.the materials used now are much more complex than in the past. They are crazy alloys that do much more to resist degradation. They’re encased in non reactive materials so they aren’t exposed to the outside environment under any circumstances. If they were constructed similarly to older components, just smaller, they’d never turn on at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response, I appreciate it. I have a few follow-up questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What causes transistors to degrade? Does it depend on how long you run power through them / how much? </p>
</li>
<li>Whats the time frame on this with modern cards? 2 years? 10?</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This highly upvoted comment has no basis in reality. What's the failure mode here? What exactly do you think is causing transistor instability? Gate voltage drift? </p>
<p>The real answer here is that thermal cycling might cause PCB delamination, traces could pull up etc. That's generally not a concern if your card is running at a steady temp all the time. In fact, a card that's used for gaming is more susceptible to these failure modes than a mining card  </p>
<p>You're likely to see fan bearings fail after a certain up time. This failure mode is very likely for a mining card  These are fairly cheap/easy to replace. </p></div>		</li>
