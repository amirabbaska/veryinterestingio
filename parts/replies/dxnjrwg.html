			<div class="markdown"><p>My radiation protection textbook mentions Cf-252 as one of the most expensive substances in the planet at $30/um in the 90s. If Iâ€™m not mistaken, HFIR is the only place in the Western Hemisphere that produces it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't sure what $/um meant, so i did a quick google on the price of Cf-252. Holy cow, $27 million per gram, with only 8 grams ever made in the Western world. </p>
<p>I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Cf-252 probably isn't used in many instances where another less-effective <del>neutron</del> alpha emitter will suffice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need much, thankfully.  You get about 2.4E12 neutrons per second per gram of material.  We use Cf252 sources for things like active shufflers, which needs something like 10^8 neutrons per second.</p>
<p>Whether you can use other sources (e.g. AmLi, AmBe, etc) depends on lots of things, such as dose requirements, average neutron energies needed, etc.</p></div>		</li>
