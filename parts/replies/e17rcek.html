Is it highly likely to damage the sensor while flying?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is low probability but higher than what you get on the ground.  And it takes a lot of dead pixels to really make much of a difference on a 5D.   Noise reduction in the processing software you use will generally hide it so you won’t notice at all.  </p>
<p>Mine has flown many times with no noticeable degradation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly it would take a lead box with sides a meter thick to make a difference.  I don’t even want to imagine how much of a baggage fee they would charge for that. </p>
<p>Chris Marquardt did a podcast with a particle physicist that talk about this very subject.  It was quite a few years ago.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we assume that you use a spherical box with 1m radius, and we simplify to ignore the hollowed out center where the camera sits, and ignore any extra bits (hinges, latches, a <del>carrying</del>transportation method), you're talking about 4.2m^3 of lead.</p>
<p>Lead weighs 11.34g/cm^3 , so your safe camera box weighs about 47.6 (metric) tons. Wolfram Alpha was so kind as to point out that this is about half the cargo capacity of a 747-200F. </p>
<p>Some quick Googling seems to say that you could put this in a (in my experience) more common 737, and maybe barely take off. But you'd have to buy out all the other seats on the plane, cause that's pretty much the entire capacity of the plane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Screens are different from sensors. A pixel on a camera sensor is a single photo-transistor and is highly susceptible to damage from radiation. A pixel on a screen is not a discrete component in the same way and is made from less sensitive materials. A pixel on a phone is also many times larger than a pixel on a sensor and thus less likely to be damaged by background radiation which is generally very small particles. sensor pixels can be almost the same size as CPU transistors which are nanometers across, while screen pixels are closer to micrometers. It’s a bit of an apples/oranges type deal even though we call them the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the sensors that are affected on a camera not the screens.  Not sure if lcd screens have the same possibility for damage as a CCD sensor would.  </p>
<p>Now the camera sensor in your phone would definitely be susceptible but it is a much smaller sensor than a 5D for instance.  So should be a lot less likely to have an issue.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe they’re talking about the CCD (camera sensor). The sensor works based on how much light hits each pixel on it however other radiation can interfere; the wrong kind of radiation can permanently damage the pixel so it can no longer receive information from light when taking a picture.</p></div>		</li>
