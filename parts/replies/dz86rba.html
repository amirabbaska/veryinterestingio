			<div class="markdown"><p>In my experience I’ve just seen the audio squashed down during the final render of the film to save space. Sometimes it’s not rendered correctly at all, which leads to even more trouble. Basically anything other than a 96khz or 48khz/24-bit .wav properly routed out of Premiere or Final Cut will hugely change the mix as compression (or “lossy”) codecs do all kinds of weird stuff. I haven’t reached Hollywood-level filmmaking yet, so I can’t speak for what they’re using, but even Netflix uses lossy audio codecs to save space. Which is a shame, since raw audio files are still much smaller than HD video files, let alone 4K. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That shouldn't happen at all, lossy codes do not compress dynamics unless it is very highly compressed and it will not change the levels relative to other channels either. The codes usually aren't very highly compressed on movies so it sound like some setting in the program or something messing it up. </p></div>		</li>
