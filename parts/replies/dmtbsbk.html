			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the lift is generated at the front of the boomerang nomatter where it is in flight. When you apply a torque on the front of a rotating body the force will have its greatest effect 90Â° later (gyroscopic procession). This causes the edge that it's rotating toward to raise and the boomerang will curve in the other direction. So lift in the front raises the right side and it will curve left. Or vice verse depending on a left or right handed boomerang.</p></div>		</li>
