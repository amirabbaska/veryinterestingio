			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add many people think it's okay to put stuff out for recycling that is not recyclable but that isn't true. That's because it costs money to separate out recyclables for market. The more material in the stream that has no market value the more money a MRF has to spend separating out material they can't sell so it's a total economic loss.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now no. The commodity prices are too low.  For example the price a MRF can get for a ton of baled plastic 1 and 2 is barely allowing them to break even on the cost to produce that bale. Glass is a total loss. Clean metal, cardboard and paper is a money maker right now but not much. The price of oil is low, so competing with virgin material is tough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How bad are those residuals actually? When glass or metal is melted down, wouldn’t almost anything burn up? Especially in the high-oxygen environment for steel production.</p>
<p>How are metal caps separated from glass bottles? Most people seem to throw those into the glass bin with the caps still on.</p>
<p>I’ve always imagined paper and plastic recycling to be the hardest, since you really don’t want any metal or glass in your toilet paper or plastic bottle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For metal not a big problem. For glass a huge problem. Also you have to think of it as a whole system with parole trying to make money.  One reason residuals are bad is because the buyer who is going to process the material such as the glass doesn't want to pay for residuals.  So the MRF operator says here's a ton of glass that has 10% residual. Well now the buyer doesn't want to pay 100% for 10% he can't use. So the price the MRF can get for the glass drops but the cost to separate that glass + residuals didn't drop so the MRF loses money.  With single stream the residual in glass has increased so the cost for a MRF to process glass is more that what they can sell it for. </p>
<p>Second no one wants to pay to truck around residual. It cost around 10 cents per mile per ton to more commodity efficiently. So a glass processor doesn't want to pay to move stuff other that clean glass. </p>
<p>With metal it's easier to get rid of residual than glass, but the exact same principals I outlined above apply. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All this sound very complicated and expensive. My question always was does the cost of the whole recycling outweigh the profit intake that recycling companies have? I imgine government recycling schemes are non profit but surely there are alot of reclying plants in  most countries that spend more money recycling than actually gain in profits?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the answer is it all depends. In the US the government doesn't provide much in the way of subsidies to recycling. That is why access to recycling and what people can recycling varies dramatically across the country. The system is always run at least in part by a for profit company like Recommunity, Republic, Waste Management, there's more.  Those companies do make money from recycling.  Some commodities such as metals, cardboard, and clean paper are pretty much always profitable especially when collected on the commercial side from businesses. Businesses recycle a lot of boxes and are better about low contamination than residents. In operating a MRF there can be loosing commodities. For example most MRFs are loosing money on recycling glass right now. That is because the market has been down for recycling so the price a MRF could get per ton for sorted glass was low and then single stream peocessing decreases the quality and thus the price the MRF gets for the glass. Right now glass recycling is disappearing for many residents as these for profit MRFs say they won't take them.</p>
<p>In other countries such as Europe and Canada recycling is paid for in part at least by product manufactured. Oh and Japan.</p>
<p>In short in the US recycling is a for profit business that has it's ups and downs like any other. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>If it were, they wouldn't be doing it. Aluminum for example is way, way more expensive to extract than to recycle.</p>
<p>Recycled materials also pollute less, so it may be a good idea for the state to give tax breaks or other incentives to recycling companies.</p></div>		</li>
