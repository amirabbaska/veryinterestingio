			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with this theory is that it completely dependent on the assumption that when two people have different waking sensitivities, that it must be a biological behavior. It doesn't even consider how adaptable the human brain is to environmental context.</p>
<p>To make my point more clear, in proper Reddit fashion with an unscientific anecdotal story, I'm a deep sleeper at home. Like, to the point where it used to be a problem with work. I have to have several alarms to wake up. However, when I go hiking, which I do a lot, I'll wake up several times through out the night. And this was true when I went on a five month hike (yes, five months non-stop) where sleeping in the woods wasn't &quot;new&quot; to me. It was home. Despite being comfortable with that situation, I knew before going to bed that I had to keep an ear for animals attacking my food, especially bears. And so that's what I did. And I woke up a lot. And many of us on the trail, who were deep sleepers at home, became light sleepers on the trail.</p>
<p>And, probably as a better example, the same light sleeping happened to me in my early twenties when I was aiding my disabled friend at night while he slept. I slept in a bed next to him and had to wake up when he needed to go to the bathroom. On nights I worked with him, EVERY noise woke me up because I knew if I missed him, he'd piss his pants and I'd have to clean it up. On nights where I slept at home, I went back to being a rock. (When I think about this, I feel like it would make for an interesting sleep study to test overnight aids like myself. It's a big industry.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, take my girlfriend, who is a notriously light sleeper. She also happens to be riddled with anxiety. She sees a psychiatrist for it. For the most part, life feels dangerous to her. So, in my opnion, it's natural for her to be woken by any disturbance. And before you say claim that her anxiety is tied to this &quot;protection/vigilance&quot; gene, bear in mind that her childhood was pretty fucked up.</p>
<p>So, I'm not saying that it's NOT biological, but don't be so quick to assume it actually is based on some armchair evolutionary theory. You could just as easily expand on what I've said here and give a convincing environmental argument.</p>
<p>IMO chances are it's probably a bit of both, as many human behaviors are are, but regardless we need actual testing to back up those claims.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I find a bit redundant in your argument is that you're trying to disprove something that been long disregarded as a viable explanation for anything. We are well past the point in science where any scientist will try to establish any sort of biological phenomenon as based solely on genetic or environmental factors. Epigenetics is proof of that. The original comment is merely providing an explanation from an evolutionary perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except there's no evidence of population-based selection. This makes no sense on individual fitness. It's a convenient story but can't actually be the true selective pressure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My theory is how we were &quot;trained&quot; to sleep once we are born. For example: my mom made sure everything was dark and quiet whenever she would put my sister to sleep. So my sister is used to sleeping that way. But when I was born, she made sure I was surrounded by lights, music, conversations, etc. I can fall asleep anywhere and it's very hard to disturb my sleep but my sister can wake up at the slightest thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Individual&quot; fitness includes anyone in your own gene pool. &quot;Group&quot; fitness would be that of a group including neighbors or other unrelated individuals. (Unless you think families would somehow be under selective pressure to have an admixture of sleep deepness despite likely sharing the same sleeping genes?)</p>
<p>What selectable trait only benefits strangers in the group? Or benefits them more than the next of kin? Group fitness was an idea in the 1970s that has since been picked apart with few possible examples left. </p></div>		</li>
