			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for the cluelessness. I vaguely understand that you are taking a continuous signal over time, and trying to do something with it.</p>
<p>But is it more like each point in the time sequence has a single number attached to it? </p>
<p>Or rather that each point in the time sequence has multiple numbers attached to it? Like that each point in the time sequence represents the influence of several ongoing waves/patterns which you are trying to decompose? Would the dimensions be frequency and intensity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each point in time has multiple frequencies attached to it. You take the Fourier transform of, say, 100hz, 200hz, 400hz, et cetera. You store all those numbers for each chunk of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do they have to be represented by equations, though? Why can't you register the intensity at each frequency discretely for each timepoint? e.g. 100.0 hz has intensity 481, 100.1 hz has intensity 582 etc.? </p>
<p>Is it because the frequency spectrum can't be sufficiently represented discretely? Or could you do it, but the data would be too large?</p></div>		</li>
