			<div class="markdown"><p>So in regard to balance, what is the relation between that and the engine types? I thought initially reading your answer that &quot;V&quot; engines were better than inline, which seems to make sense to a lay person because they're symmetric. To that end you said V8 and V12 are good, and i4 is bad.  But V6 is also not great, though symmetric, and i6 is apparently the best? Haha</p>
<p>So what is the uniting principle that makes an i6&gt;i4, a V8&gt;V6 and somehow an i6&gt;both in regard to balance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This question get's pretty complicated very quickly, but I'll take a stab at it, feel free to ask any questions and I'll try to expand on them. There's a ton of different imbalances that can show up in an engine, but when we discuss differences between number of cylinders, V angles, etc. we are mostly talking about &quot;inherent balances&quot; of the engine configuration. </p>
<p>Think of it like this: in a 4 stroke engine, the piston moves 4 times (compression [up], combustion[down], exhaust[up], and intake[down]). The only one of these 4 movements that creates power is combustion, where the exploding gas pushes the piston down towards the bottom of the V. In these 4 movements, the crankshaft will make two full rotations, or  720 degrees of rotational movement. We make power in roughly 120 degrees of that movement (while the piston is moving downwards, but not as much at the top or bottom of the rotation). 720/120 = 6, which is why inline 6 engines balance well. They all push directly down on the crankshaft, and can be split up so that they overlap slightly and will always be putting an even amount of pressure on the crankshaft.</p>
<p>In a horizontally opposed engine, the cylinders point in opposite directions and each pair can balance itself out. </p>
<p>A V6 engine will fire every 120 degrees of movement, and therefore would balance well at a V angle of 120 degrees, but this is a problem for packaging. This configuration would be very wide, and difficult to fit in the engine bay. The purpose of a V engine (as opposed to a 180 degree horizontally opposed engine) is to take up less space. So instead of using a 120 degree V, we cut that in half and use 60 degrees. Because the firing events happen every 120 degrees of rotation, and 120 is divisible by 60 degrees we have a decently balanced engine, though it is not perfect. </p>
<p>If we have 8 cylinders, and we divide or 720 degrees of rotation by 8 so that our firing events are evenly spaced, we get 90 degrees. A 90 degree V8 is more reasonable, so most manufacturers use it and have good results. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if that accurately answered your question, but it's at least a good place to start. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That definitely answers my question. Thank you for taking the time. </p>
<p>So to make sure I understood you correctly, does that mean the main problem with an inline 4 is that, while they are all pushing directly down on the crankshaft which would typically be good, each cylinder would be responsible for 180 degrees which a) you can't produce power through the entire 180, and b) you can't have any overlap?  Based on your answer, I'm picturing that it's an issue because during one cycle (is that the correct term?) you have gaps of about 60 degrees of turn separating the most powerful periods of combustion (120 power, 60 gap, etc). </p>
<p>In the regard to the angle of the V, the basic concept makes sense, but practically why does 720/pistons need to equal the V angle. Inline and opposed being well balanced makes sense, but (assuming I understood the above part correctly) I'm not sure why 60 vs 120 matters. I guess what I'm trying to ask is, why can't the fact that 60=/=720/6 simply be addressed by how the the piston is attached to the crankshaft?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing you almost touched on.   </p>
<p>In a v8 or opposed engine, the combustion cycles are evenly spaced.</p>
<p>In a v6 there are gaps, you can have 60 drag between two ignitions and then 180 drag till the next.   Averages out to the 120 drug mentioned in last post.   But this is the primary cause of vibration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big portion of balance is Based in the order that the cylinders fire in. With a v6, you essentially have two banks of three. Three cylinders in a row creates a rocking motion, which creates an imbalance. Having two i3s next two each other does not correct for this imbalance, so it's rougher. An i6 is two i3's in a row. They both have a rocking motion, but it cancels each other out. Cylinders 1 and 6 fire together, then 2 and 5 then 3 and 4. </p>
<p>V12 is considered the smoothest, because it is two i6s next to each other. </p>
<p>An i6 is better than an i4 because it corrects for more balance issues. An i4 fires cylinders as 1 and 4 then 2 and 3. On first blush, you would think that's balanced, but the piston doesn't move in a perfect circle, it's slightly curved, moving faster at the top than the bottom. Having 6 pistons on different timings can correct for this issue more than 4 can. </p>
<p>A v8 is a bit of a different animal. Think of it as 4 v2s. Each side of the v is 90 degrees, so a cylinders vibration is cancelled out mostly by its opposite number on the v. Another way to say it is that have two i4's next to each other let's you cancel out some of the inherent imbalance of an i4, which makes a v8 smoother, but usually not as smooth as an i6.</p>
<p>Let's now do a bit of a heirarchy. An i4 is imbalanced, but it can be corrected fairly well by putting two into a v to make a v8. </p>
<p>An also i3 corrects some of the issues of an i4, but introduces a new one: rocking. </p>
<p>A v6 does not correct rocking, but an i6 does, because each i3 cancels the other rocking out. </p>
<p>I am not as eloquent as op, I apologize. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah this makes sense. The rocking is the aspect I was missing when thinking about it.  Explains the reasons behind the hierarchy as you described it. Eloquence is more than sufficient haha. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned that V8s &quot;sound sexy as hell&quot;.  I would have guessed the noise is primarily caused by the fuel combustion, and thus the sound would be dominated by the size and spacing of the power strokes - but as you allude to here, and I've heard mentioned elsewhere, certain (all?) engine configurations have a characteristic sound.  What causes the different configurations to sound the way they do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The different engine sounds are based on the different timing in the power strokes, and each configuration has a different timing. A v6 would be arranged differently than an inline 6, an inline 4 is timed differently than a horizontal 4. So even though they have the same amount of cylinders, the way they're arranged changes the timing and sound of them (along with things like airflow of course). I wouldn't be surprised if some smart sound person did analysis on how a v8 sounds and found that it has more pleasant frequencies for hearing than other engines.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup.</p>
<p>There have now been several studies (that we know of publicly) done on how people react to various engine sounds.   Fundamentally,  u/semaph0r3 is right -- the V8 always wins out.  In fact, it raises the testosterone levels of listeners.  There was even one (arguably crappy) study done in the UK that tested response to engine noise amongst women and found that the tune of a Maserati V8 has the strongest arousal response.  Do with that what you will.</p>
<p>Manufacturers now have this data, and at the high end of price, they tune for sound on purpose.  </p>
<p>Most Jaguar products, and the current Ford Mustang, have a &quot;resonator pipe&quot; built into the exhaust system that funnels sound under the driver's seat so that it's more pronounced there.  Several Porsche products have butterfly valves built into the exhaust and controlled by a button on the console, so that you can make the engine louder or quieter with the touch of a button.</p>
<p>The sound is a studied thing, and these days, a manipulated thing.  Thank heaven.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion the best sounding V8 is the small block Ford 302 high output.</p>
<p>1-3-7-4-6-5-2-8</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that's the firing order, I'm tired haha. Anyways, there's no other motor that sounds like it. Even the 351w with the same firing order doesn't sound like the 302 HO.</p>
<p>Glasspacks on a 302 HO. Let me post a YouTube video when I had them. I'm a damn idiot for getting rid of them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>shrubs311 posted a great reply here, but another factor is how the exhaust pulses and sound waves interact with each other in the exhaust pipe. If I grab all 4 pulses in a row from an I4 in one pipe, they will interact much more than if I grab 2 pulses from each side and use 2 pipes all the way to the back of the car. Same goes for high performance vehicles which have 8 or ten pipes, usually coming out each side, that never connect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with all of this but 6 cylinder engines having a lot of vibrations. I was taught in my auto training and by reading every auto magazine growing up that V6 and I6 are the smoothest running engine configuration next to the V12. </p>
<p>I4's and V8 can also be smooth but with extra help and 6 or 12 cylinder engines are the most naturally balanced. </p>
<p>One easy test to show this is to get into a 200k plus mileage 4, 6 and 8 cylinder engines, the 4 will shudder, chug and vibrate, the V8 will have vibrational tremors at idle and cruising speed, but 6's will typically be silky smooth. </p>
<p>Get into a 10 year 4 cylinder accord and V6 accord and there will be a big difference in smoothness. </p></div>		</li>
