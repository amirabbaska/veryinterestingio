			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd never thought of physical sensation as having hysteresis in those terms. That's not a bad way to describe it, though in the typical sense maybe it's not precisely hysteresis.</p>
<p><strong>More Generally</strong></p>
<p>Various senses have hysteresis in the sense that the threshold of perception is state dependent, but it's more that the current state can shift the threshold. For example, your skin's temperature sensitivity will change based on its current temperature (hold your hand in a bowl of ice water for a couple minutes then stick it in lukewarm tap water, or go from quite hot to slightly cool). Also, your eyes and ears adjust their perception thresholds for <em>intensity</em> of stimulus: eyes can adjust to brightness across orders of magnitude - it's more than just adjusting pupil size - and the ears will change how well coupled the ear drum is to the inner ear by adjusting muscle tension on the connecting bones - this also lets you listen to things across several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>I do not, however, know of any threshold adjustment to our ears' frequency response, and I imagine the Haas effect is frequency-related (looks like the original thesis by Haas looked specifically at <em>two</em> sound impulses - not a train of them - and at what delays they would be perceived as a single impulse, without studying it across different intensities).</p>
<p><strong>Specifically</strong></p>
<p>To get to your question, I don't think that particular aspect adjusts threshold. Though the answer you replied to mentioned the Haas effect which I assume is higher level processing than what I'm talking about. And I don't know how those higher level processes would come into play. If I had to guess, one would think that going from continuous to beating would be detected at a lower beat frequency than going from beating to continuous. The wikipedia page on the Haas effect is pretty sparse so it's hard to say how it applies to continuous impulse trains.</p>

<p>I was inspired <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/58qds7/my_shower_temperature_per_angle_of_the_handle_oc/d92ggfj/" target="_blank">This /r/dataisbeautiful post</a> about shower temperature, which has made me think where else I never &quot;noticed&quot; hysteresis before.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for engaging with my question!</p>

<p>You're talking about <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber-Fechner_law" target="_blank">the Weber-Fechner law</a> here, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Weberâ€“Fechner law[1] is a proposed relationship between the magnitude of a physical stimulus and the intensity or strength that people feel.</p>

<p>It sounds like it's not too crazy a thing to try and test rigorously though. Maybe someone can convince a (I guess psychology?) student to spend their bachelor thesis on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with your &quot;More generally&quot; section. I don't think frequency heard is related to previous frequencies. I would assume it is nothing more than the instruments that facilitates the hearing in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like hysteresis would be far less relevant in things other than magnetism, which is the only other place I have heard this term used. As far as I know it is a dependence on previous states of a system, and magnets are very easy to change in such a way that this is relevant.</p>
<p>Then again I know very little about acoustics so don't take what I said as fact.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am not sure how Precedence Effect is relevant in this context. The values you mention were obtained using a pair of clicks (or a pair of any other type of signals), not a train of clicks, which is what the OP is asking. Precedence effect describes the phenomenon by which if you have a sound and an echo that arrives shortly afterwards, you don't hear the echo at all, and the sound appears to be coming from the direction of the original sound. In other words, the original sound takes 'precedence' over the echo.</p>
<p>I am open to learning something new today, but I am not aware of studies that relate precedence effect to trains of clicks, and, in fact, what would 'precedence' mean in that context?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure how the Haas-effect <strong>isn't</strong> relevant in this context. </p>
<p>A train of clicks can be seen as several successions of pairs of clicks, meaning the time between the first and second click has to be low enough to be perceived as one sound, as well time between the second and third etc. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>That's not quite right, you <strong>do</strong> perceive the echoes that come after, but the brain interprets them as being part of the same sound. That's why if you for instance clap in a room, you don't hear the clap followed by 6 echoes that comes from the walls, ceiling and floor. Instead the brain interprets this as being the clap plus early reflections and the reverb of the room, which it then again uses to calculate your position in the room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and the sound appears to be coming from the direction of the original sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually this can be manipulated as well. A technique commonly used in mixing is to pan a mono source, say a guitar, to the left and have an identical copy to the right, but delayed by 10-20 ms. It will still sound as if the guitar is coming from the left. But if you increase the amplitude of the delayed signal it gets harder and harder to tell and eventually you can't pinpoint it in the stereo image, it just sounds like a huge guitar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure we can make the leap of equating a train of clicks to multiple pairs of clicks as far as perception is concerned. I wouldn't be <em>surprised</em> if we could, but I'd like to see a little less hand waving and a little more evidence to back up that assertion (speaking from a background of neuroscience)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that you can see a train of clicks as a train of pairs of clicks. </p>
<p>However, you can't interpret experimental results that were obtained with a pair of clicks for a train of pairs of clicks. I wish human perception was that simple (or maybe not, because I wouldn't have a job :-) ).</p></div>		</li>
