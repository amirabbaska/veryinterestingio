			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be at the top. The PIN is only for the computer, and is bound to the computer alone.</p>
<p>You can log into a Windows 10 machine with your Microsoft account and associated password. Once you've authenticated yourself, you can then set up a PIN on the device to log into your MS account on that computer (any time you log into a new device with your MS account, device info is reported back to MS, so they know which devices are which, and what PINs are associated with each device and account). Now, you no longer need to use your password to get into that device. You only need the PIN, just like with a smartphone. However, your PIN won't get you access into your account via  web browser or via any other Windows device. <strong>The PIN works ONLY with the device you set it up on.</strong> If someone gets your PIN, they've only compromised one device - not your entire account.</p>
<p>Essentially, Microsoft is enabling you to use your laptop or desktop the same way you would a Windows Phone (or an iPhone, or an Android). You can use a PIN to unlock the device, but a password is still used with your MS account (Apple account/Google account, etc.), in order to access your email, OneDrive, the app store, etc. from any other location. It's another layer of protection. The PIN isn't intended to replace your account password for anything other than unlocking the device.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reversely put, they made it extremely unsafe in the past when they allowed people to use a cloud password for what they may have figured was a local one. I know I hated it, because I usually make my passwords for online accessible stuff much more complicated.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The security increase they are selling us now is the reversal of a former security decrease they pushed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh great.  So, only my laptop with all my data is compromised, as opposed to my Microsoft Account which contains nothing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you don't encrypt your hard drive, your PC generally isn't very protected anyways. I assume if you have information that warrants encryption you wouldn't be using a pin anyways and would then probably be knowledgeable enough to use a long password.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well for many users this might be their outlook email aka the gate way to all the rest of their online accounts. it also means that when Grandma gives her computer to Geeksquad and tells them her pin the Geeksquad person doesn't now know Grandma's password for everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point where they are incorrect is that it makes your machine itself safer. It does not. Not when they won't let you set a pin that's alphanumeric or longer than 4 digits. That pin is <em>theoretically</em> unique to that machine, but just about every lay-person I know (as a sysadmin) will use the same damn PIN over and over. I think that in some ways they're helping (not having a disincentive to making a more secure MS account password), but by not providing more options, they're making the computer itself less safe, in my opinion, and dressing it up as a security measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of your statement is incorrect. I have a 5-digit PIN that I'm about to change to a much larger one for this reason. Microsoft does not limit the number of digits in your PIN. I suspect that a good PIN number to use would be a phone number of a friend or relative that you memorized, since it is (at least in America) 10-digits long and very difficult to guess if you choose the right person (and of course never give any details).</p>
<p>And they do provide other options. You can use your MS account, you can use a regular local account, or the PIN. They also have a photo login measure to add to all of that. So there are four different options you can use, it depends on your preference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the top answers are wrong. The reason why PINs are safer in <em>this</em> instance is because they are backed by newer computers' trusted platform modules (TPM) that make brute force really really slow and also limit attempts in hardware. These are tamper-resistant chips too.</p>
<p>Password -&gt; stored on the HDD with unlimited guesses and can be cracked &quot;offline&quot; meaning without that machine.</p>
<p>PIN on Win 8+ with TPM -&gt; limited to a small number of guesses</p>
<p>Kinda like a credit card limits the number of attempts.</p>
<p>Looking for a source turns up that Vista+ supported it.</p>

You'll notice Windows 10 won't let you use a PIN on an old machine.</p></div>		</li>
