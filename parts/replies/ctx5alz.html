			<p>This needs to be at the top. The PIN is only for the computer, and is bound to the computer alone.<br><br>You can log into a Windows 10 machine with your Microsoft account and associated password. Once you've authenticated yourself, you can then set up a PIN on the device to log into your MS account on that computer (any time you log into a new device with your MS account, device info is reported back to MS, so they know which devices are which, and what PINs are associated with each device and account). Now, you no longer need to use your password to get into that device. You only need the PIN, just like with a smartphone. However, your PIN won't get you access into your account via  web browser or via any other Windows device. <strong>The PIN works ONLY with the device you set it up on.</strong> If someone gets your PIN, they've only compromised one device - not your entire account.<br><br>Essentially, Microsoft is enabling you to use your laptop or desktop the same way you would a Windows Phone (or an iPhone, or an Android). You can use a PIN to unlock the device, but a password is still used with your MS account (Apple account/Google account, etc.), in order to access your email, OneDrive, the app store, etc. from any other location. It's another layer of protection. The PIN isn't intended to replace your account password for anything other than unlocking the device.</p>		</li>

			<p>Reversely put, they made it extremely unsafe in the past when they allowed people to use a cloud password for what they may have figured was a local one. I know I hated it, because I usually make my passwords for online accessible stuff much more complicated.<br><br>tl;dr: The security increase they are selling us now is the reversal of a former security decrease they pushed.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yep. And use the same PIN for all their Microsoft devices, effectively negating the benefit of the PIN system. If they want to try to increase the user's security, the policy should follow the path of least resistance/effort for the user. I think the best possible way would be to just require more characters in the password. Maybe like 15? At that point people would need to make it a phrase or set of words in order to remember it. For me it would be easier to remember a set of words than a set of random numbers anyway.</p>		</li>

			<p>If you don't encrypt your hard drive, your PC generally isn't very protected anyways. I assume if you have information that warrants encryption you wouldn't be using a pin anyways and would then probably be knowledgeable enough to use a long password.</p>		</li>

			<p>Harddrive encryption protects your files from being read while your system is turned off (turned off, not suspended). It also prevents someone (or another OS on the same computer) from writing anything else than gibberish onto your disk. If the threats you want to protect against are different than this it is useless. Especially it doesn't protect a running or suspended system against anything.</p>		</li>

			<p>Who caches their passwords?  Seriously, why would you do that?  Put your password in a manager or write it in a cypher in a little book in your wallet.  Putting your password in permanent storage in a common tool on an internet connected device just seems insane in the present day and age.</p>		</li>

			<p>The point where they are incorrect is that it makes your machine itself safer. It does not. Not when they won't let you set a pin that's alphanumeric or longer than 4 digits. That pin is <em>theoretically</em> unique to that machine, but just about every lay-person I know (as a sysadmin) will use the same damn PIN over and over. I think that in some ways they're helping (not having a disincentive to making a more secure MS account password), but by not providing more options, they're making the computer itself less safe, in my opinion, and dressing it up as a security measure.</p>		</li>

			<p>Part of your statement is incorrect. I have a 5-digit PIN that I'm about to change to a much larger one for this reason. Microsoft does not limit the number of digits in your PIN. I suspect that a good PIN number to use would be a phone number of a friend or relative that you memorized, since it is (at least in America) 10-digits long and very difficult to guess if you choose the right person (and of course never give any details).<br><br>And they do provide other options. You can use your MS account, you can use a regular local account, or the PIN. They also have a photo login measure to add to all of that. So there are four different options you can use, it depends on your preference.</p>		</li>

			<p>Some are, some aren't as configurable. There are a LOT of menu's to go through. I know because I have to configure the GPO for a lot of windows 10 features when we deploy it at our organization. I also had the ultimate version of 7, and I got the installation through windows updates. Its ok though, I went back to 7 because 10 is meh and I have no reason to go to it.

			<p>I'm really, really confused about where people are getting this &quot;Microsoft says a PIN is safer,&quot; stuff from.

It never even mentions security.<br><br>It's literally just allowing you to unlock your tablet/laptop/desktop the same way you would unlock your phone. That's all.

			<p>All the top answers are wrong. The reason why PINs are safer in <em>this</em> instance is because they are backed by newer computers' trusted platform modules (TPM) that make brute force really really slow and also limit attempts in hardware.
