			<div class="markdown"><p>I am incredibly amused that the best answer we have, despite decades and centuries of medical research is &quot;because ...reasons? Somebody's studying that, I'm sure&quot; </p>
<p>It reminds me of the Dara O'Bhriain line:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDYba0m6ztE&amp;t=1m53s" target="_blank">&quot;Well, science <em>knows</em> it doesn't know everything, otherwise it'd stop.&quot;</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I know that when my parents go to a humid or cold area, they start complaining about their back, wrists or knees, but in the summer, at the beach, or in a dry/hot area they're totally fine.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely broke both my tib/fib and femur in a car accident a few years ago. I get dull aches in my femur, and sharper aches in the break point of the tib/fib. I cannot correlate this to weather, diet, physical activity, etc. Some days, it just hurts. other days, don't even  notice it. Can attest, no rhyme or reason</p></div>		</li>
