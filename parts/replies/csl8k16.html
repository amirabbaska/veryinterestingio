			<div class="markdown"><p>Even worse for bronze. Most early bronze wasn't copper-tin it was copper alloyed with arsenic which was smelted in one step using the correct combination of minerals.  More amusing, brass another alloy was also produced in one step smelting copper and zinc ores together.</p>
<p>One can also mention the old technique for winning silver from silver bearing lead ore. First smelt the lead, this is actually easy.  Then one melts the lead in a crucible made of ground bone. The lead chemically combines with the calcium phosphate in the bone leaving a small hunk of silver behind. The remained is then smelted yet again to recover the lead.</p>
<p>So yeah, in someways iron production is simple compared to other processes that were developed and used. And iron ore being heavy, it's not that hard to see early metal smiths taking an interest in it. Likely that the difference is, if you have high grade copper ore, it takes less fuel to smelt copper and tin to make bronze. Once that became scarce Iron becomes more attractive. And small deposits of Iron ore are actually common everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point is that tin was rare in those days, let alone the know how and ability to refine it from it's natural state. Yet in the middle east, bronze was used often enough. Same for Central and South America. Actually, the ratio of tin to copper was the same in both places.</p>
<p>How does one explain such a discovery?&gt;</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the most sinister form resource extraction I've ever heard of.  Going straight into my D&amp;D campaign.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bronze can be made by co-smelting tin and copper ores, and probably was at the beginning. See also aresenical-copper, a very nice Bronze Age metal which doesn't get much attention but was beautiful and mechanically superior than low-tin bronze. </p></div>		</li>
