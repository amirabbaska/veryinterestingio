			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer is the most correct I've seen so far in my opinion. One important extra note I think, is that back then it was assumed that you would plug in a peripheral once and leave it plugged in for the foreseeable future. Mainstream adoption resulted in products that ended up being plugged in and removed literally on a daily basis. That simply was not the expected use case in an age where most cables still came with screw heads so everything would stay put</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. Consider the common peripherals of 1996: keyboard, mouse, printer, joystick / gamepad, maybe a scanner, and maybe a removable media drive such as a ZIP / SyQuest drive. All those devices would have been plugged in and more or less left there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since this was all beyond the grasp of the average computer user who wanted stuff to &quot;just work&quot;, the coalition beyond USB didn't really consider their experience</p>

<p>But the rest of your point indicates that they did consider the user experience. And they absolutely did consider the experience and conduct trials.</p>
<p>You seem to forget how different computers were. As users were 100% used to always having connectors that were NOT symmetrical, were big and bulky, and often involved fitting pins in holes (Remember PS/2 connectors?), users of the day would NOT have approached this the same way as users even 10 years later. They would look at the connector, look at the hole, line it up carefully, and insert it.</p>
<p>To take the next step to say &quot;Okay when this standard becomes the new standard on every computer and everyone uses it, what sorts of new devices are going to come out and how do we keep the experience good&quot; is a valid question and one that was considered - They just didn't think 25+ years ahead about what sorts of features people might want then, and what sorts of devices people might use. Much less what manufacturers would do with the standard. </p>
<p>The original intention was for USB-B connectors to be used for peripheral-side disconnectable devices such as removable disk drives, which are much easier to quickly orient and connect. The smallest peripherals at the time were USB floppy drives and even then, those were a good inch and a half to two inches thick. Even a device half that thickness would be better served by a larger connector like USB-B versus Mini-USB (which they DID think about) from a usability standpoint.</p>
<p>Even things like USB flash drives and MP3 players might as well have been science fiction. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's false though, some connectors could be connected easily without looking, ex. the RCA audio connectors, the audio jack connectors, the coax ethernet cable, etc.</p>
<p>You make it sound as if symmetrical connectors are a recent invention. The USB people just plain didn't care for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically audio connectors standardized for audio devices and later integrated into computers and a connector 99.9% of computer users didn’t have on their computer.</p>
<p>Seriously. Around the time USB came out, PS/2, Serial (DB9), Parallel (DB25), or even a 5-Pin DIN connectors constituted the vast majority of users interaction with personal computers’ connectors. Apple/Macintosh computers also had proprietary connectors that were not reversible. While there were a FEW computers in the 70s and 80s that utilized RCA connectors for video, these didn’t last super long. </p>
<p>So I mean yes, there were audio connectors that people might put into a computer. And that’s it - literally everything else was non-reversible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>None of that has anything to do with creating a connector that can be inverted, though. It was a choice by the engineers because they didn't consider the impact such a design would have on the end user.</p>
<p>Instead, the engineers figured that simplifying device driver management and engineering a faster, more robust standard would suffice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that everybody and their grandma is a peripheral connector expert, speculation is running wild all over the thread. Your post is the only one that has it right: there were no limitations, they just didn't care for it.</p></div>		</li>
