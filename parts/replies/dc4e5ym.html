			<div class="markdown"><p>Also: Helmoltz resonance is more commonly used in bass-reflex (ported) speakers to tune the resonant frequency of the enclosure to match the electro-mechanical properties of the speaker to produce the best bass response. It's why small subwoofers can produce a lot of bass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a response to me talking about dead leg vortices.  It's very possible (and I'm not enough of an expert to say one way or the other) that the effects are tightly related.  OP didn't provide a specific window arrangement so I assumed he meant either all open or two open where bluff body is more likely since there are effectively two potential sources.</p>
<p>Sounds like I have some reading to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vibration is ALWAYS a combination. The vortex shedding is the excitation. The Helmholtz resonator is the transfer function. You always need excitation. The transfer function can be anything, but your response is higher when there is a resonance (the transfer function lines up right).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I most commonly get this effect in my car when both rear windows are open by approximately the same amount (so both gaps are equal). It goes away when I open one of the gaps more than the other, so get more effective inflow/outflow.</p>
<p>I'm not to familiar with these principles, which of the two would be a better explanation given that window configuration?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it only happens in that case, I'd imagine more the bluff body type than the single-port type (dead leg, helmholtz, etc.).  Is your back window/wall near the rear windows, by chance?  I have a theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right about that and I missed it the first time.  In that case, /u/Generic_Username0 has the right answer.  Note I'm not saying this doesn't happen with two windows, only that OP hasn't chimed in on the specific configuration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few misconceptions going around in this thread and I just want to help get it right. This almost gets it, but implies that the flow reversal comes from the internal pressure of the car exceeding the outside dynamic pressure. Instead, think of it as the outside moving air is always trying to draw air out of the car, due to the low static pressure of a flow with velocity. The internal pressure of the car gets lower and lower until it's low enough to actually draw in air. This increases pressure a bit, but the outside is still trying to pull that back out, so there you have your oscillation. As for the other theory, there really isn't much going on with vortex shedding and bluff body aerodynamics here. Source: 5yrs work + bs in aerodynamics.</p></div>		</li>
