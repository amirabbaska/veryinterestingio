			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in Canada.  Some things are &quot;free,&quot; some aren't.  Seeing my doctor is 100% covered.  Seeing a counsellor &amp; buying medication are both 80% covered by workplace insurance; otherwise would be 100% on my dime.  Right now I'm receiving rTMS (I call it &quot;brain-zapping&quot;) treatment in a Toronto hospital.  That's not covered by OHIP (Ontario's public health program) <em>or</em> insurance, but fortunately it's being provided free of charge under a research grant.  Just wanted to clarify as I think a lot of non-Canadians think we get 100% coverage of everything here.</p>
<p>As for the &quot;broken leg&quot; metaphor, I've tried it and my family totally rejects it.  But I agree with you; depression is definitely a real illness and deserved to be treated like one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got total remission of depression and felt like a teenager again [without the hangups :-)] And the doctors told me I could expect at least six months of relief.  Can you imagine?  Was on the moon.</p>
<p>Sadly, it turned out that I was one of the RARE cases whose relief started fading almost immediately.  Got maybe 3 weeks of relief.  Not to be ungrateful (3 weeks free of depression is a miracle) but it was like being called back from the vacation of a lifetime because your asshole boss wants to work 24/7 on some thankless drudgery.</p>
<p>Now I'm getting &quot;maintenance treatment&quot; while they look for another opportunity to start a full series.  Who knows, maybe it'll take the next time.  So the jury is out on whether it works in my case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been getting it done for several months. It's not as huge as an improvement as I was hoping (i.e. not enough to get me off most meds), but it's definitely a pretty big improvement. I think something like 60% of patients see some improvement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically it <em>is</em> electroshock, except that instead of applying electricity, the machine applies magnetic pulses, and then the brain responds by producing the electrical shock. </p>
<p>The advantage is that rTMS only affects a very small area of the brain, whereas traditional electroshock affects the whole brain.  So rTMS doesn't cause problems like memory loss.  Both treatments can make you very tired, though.</p></div>		</li>
