			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, records are analog devices.  If the music was recorded in analog rather than digital (think the first phonograph), there would be no discretization or sample rate associated with it.  I don't think music is actually recorded this way though.  Nowadays it's all recorded digitally i.e record the instruments and vocals using a microphone which is connected to a computer.  When people say that records have better sound than CD's, what they're really saying is they <em>prefer</em> the sound of records to CD's, and there are reasons why a record would sound different to a CD even if they were both created with the same digital source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see.  I guess it really just comes down to preference.  Some people like that &quot;warm&quot; sound that is distinctly characteristic of vinyl.  I think it's more of a nostalgia thing than anything else.</p></div>		</li>
