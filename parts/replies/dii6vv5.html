<p>All major retailers use software for scheduling that pulls in all the sales data from the last year.</p>

<p>That data is readily available, but in my experience staffing still was decided on the local level, and was one of the things that management would look at when making their decisions. Weather, the composition of your staff, something special going on that week, some even in your city that may boost or detract from traffic, all still needed a bit of a human touch to it. As great as automation is, an experienced manager is going to know when he is doing next weeks schedule what kind of day Saturday is shaping up to be and if he needs added staff or wants to ask if anyone wants the day off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked retail. My manager pulled a &quot;matrix report&quot; every week. It basically told him how many people staff for the week, exactly what has been ordered and what should be pulled or marked down. It was based heavily on previous week's sales and other historical information. He really didn't have much say in any of that, the report did all the work for him and if he strayed too far from the report he'd get in trouble. </p></div>		</li>
