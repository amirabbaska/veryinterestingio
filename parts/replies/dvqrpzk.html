			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that middle paragraph is critical.  It basically says cable is inefficient because it provides its users with a continuous stream of content that they are mostly not interested in and aren't watching.  Netflix is more efficient because it offers a lot less content that its users are uninterested in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That means Sling and the other &quot;a la carte&quot; services (though still bundled, but at least you have some choice) are probably the most efficient, no?  Netflix still has a TON of shit I'm not interested in, but I don't expect them to carve out &quot;reality TV&quot; and offer a package without it for less money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the time you add all the bundles that include the channels you watch, it can end up being just as costly as regular cable. I had it for 3 months and found my original cable bill was about $5 more when bundled with internet. The service was not as stable quality-wise as well, for which there was little to nothing the company would do except blame the hardware/intenet connection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix efficiency goes beyond what they offer though.</p>
<p>The actual overhead of Netflix is relatively small compared to other platforms. The vast majority of hosting for Netflix is done by its users. As in, Netflix seeds the original video, but once one user starts to watch that video, he becomes a seed for the next user, and so-on. </p>
<p>Does this sound familiar? It should, because it's what torrenting is based on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix doesn’t sell bundles of channels either. One channel with hundreds of choices and dvds if you’re into that. Cable makes a ton of money bundling channels which is why their customer service blows. It must really burned their asses to provide broadband and have people choose Netflix and Hulu over them. That’s why they wanted to abolish Net Neutrality. They want to bundle internet websites and sell them, and charge content providers on top of that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you have unlimited broadband which is commonplace if not standard in the UK, thank god, I'd say broadband is an essential service which every household is likely to get the full value from regardless of using streaming services and shouldn't contribute to the price of your streaming.</p>
<p>Major advantage Netflix has is that they use another service's infrastructure to provide theirs, meaning they win the cable comparison largely by that virtue, it's not fair to cable but it's the reality of the situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget about the huge difference in overheads costs between Netflix and a cable company. Cable companies own the wiring that carries their broadcast signal, and own/lease the telephone poles and switching equipment the wiring uses. That's huge overhead. Then they pay employees or contractors to maintain that equipment. They own/lease trucks and tools that the technicians use....</p>
<p>Netflix just carries the cost of their network infrastructure and content production/acquisition, then sends out their content on the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to why cable is so expensive, remember that the channels themselves are owned by companies and negotiations can increase the cost even further, so it's a rights issue.</p>
<p>A simple example is ESPN is essentially owned by ABC, NBC related cable channels are owned by Comcast. So they're all working out deals and negotiations because Comcast has to pay ABC to get the rights to air ESPN. Does DirecTV pay the same amount?</p>
<p>A lot of your cable bill (or satellite bill) will directly go toward specific channels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked for the local cable utility one summer. I got to sit in on a negotiation meeting for the local sports channel and I think it was ESPN 1. They went back and forth for 2 hours.</p>
<p>Cable company wanted just ESPN 1, but the other guys said they'd only give ESPN 1 if the cable company took 2/3/4 whatever the other weird ones are that no one ever watches. They would not sell JUST ESPN. So in the end the cable company had to cave and take ESPN and like 5 or 6 other channels and pay more than they wanted to. </p>
<p>This of course meant a rate increase in a few months.</p></div>		</li>
