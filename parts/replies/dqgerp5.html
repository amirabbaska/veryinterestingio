<p>Iridium is actually reasonably abundant in the Earth's core. The problem with iridium's abundance on the surface is that...</p>

<p>This means early in the Earth's history as it heated and became molten, all the iridium quickly sunk to the center due its density, and remains to this day bound up with the iron core because of its siderophilic nature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I recognize the Greek root Siderous from experience with Siderite (Iron Carbonate mineral).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was no walk in the park. Very hard/brittle material alloy. Could only cut a couple pieces before all tooling had to be replaced. No coolant allowed due to the porous nature of the tungsten and fear of contaminating the material. Fairly certain that particular cathode was only used in laboratory settings. Never made more than 5 at a time and only once every couple years. We had the same single pc of material and cut parts from it for probably 20 years prior to me starting there, I'm sure due to scarcity of the iridium. Bar stock was about 1/8 inch(3.17 mm) in diamter. Cathode, maybe .090 inch in diameter. Once the material was used up, we never made them again.</p></div>		</li>
