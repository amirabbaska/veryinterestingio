			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some truth to it, in the sense that these sorts of financial practices are common for many businesses and banks. </p>
<p>The payment processor does not delay your payment processing to make more money. In all likelyhood, the merchant wants their money ASAP so they can profit from having it - they're not going to stand for a payment processor dragging its feet on a transaction to make a few extra pennies. </p>
<p>The exact same systems that process the payment for the merchant process refunds - from a technical perspective, there is no real difference between the two transactions. </p>
<p>Edit: As others have said, the only part of the chain that would really benefit is the customer's bank holding onto the refund money for a few days before they reflect it in the account. This does happen (especially with debit cards), and can be a pain in the ass. It isn't the merchant or the payment processor's fault, though - it's your bank. Go get a new bank if yours does this and you don't like it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do you think it takes up to 72 hours to process? We can land a car on mars and drive it around, don't you think we can create systems that process payments and transfers money instantly?</p>
<p>Yes, we can.</p>
<p>Do the banks want to?</p>
<p>No, they don't, because of float.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having worked with banks -- it has nothing to do with float. They get hit just as much by that 3 day delay when their inbound money from another bank takes 3 days to show up. The 3 day delay is there to reduce fraud -- around 95% of fraud claims are resolved within 3 days (and there's a steep falloff after the 3rd business day), so banks wait that long to actually move the money to reduce their risk exposure in case of fraud. You'll notice that banks with which you have good standing (say, a bank you've been banking with for many years) can move your money faster than 3 days for smaller transactions (typically &lt;1 day for &lt;$1000)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. People are getting caught up in the &quot;conspiracy&quot; concept. There doesn't need to be a conspiracy to continue a system that involves float.  </p>
<p>In years past, prior to real-time data transfer, there was a necessary processing delay. Now, with RT technology in place, this delay is not necessary. However, due to float, there's a disincentive to change the system. </p>
<p>These businesses want to spend their time and effort on things that make them money. Providing real-time refunds does not benefit them at all, and in fact, would reduce any float benefit they receive. Costing them money. </p></div>		</li>
