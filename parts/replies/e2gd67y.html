<p>This isn't quite correct.  Soaps are produced by reacting <em>fats</em> with a strong base.  Fats contain fatty acids, but they're &quot;locked&quot; into an unionised state.  If you react the fat with a strong base, it breaks the fat down into fatty acid salts and glycerol.  This &quot;unlocks&quot; the fatty acid, allowing the salts to form, which they couldn't do when it was &quot;locked&quot;.  And soaps are just fatty acid salts.</p></div>		</li>
