<p>a station could just generate its own bubble of magnetism to deflect cosmic radiation if it could generate enough power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would a magnetic field that's concentrated enough to deflect cosmic rays on something so small as a space station also have harmful effects on organisms on the station?</p></div>		</li>

<p>See where the human habitat is in figure 1-- <a href="http://www.sr2s.eu/images/documents/Bruce2015.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sr2s.eu/images/documents/Bruce2015.pdf</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with your last statement: I think the best solution is a &quot;force field&quot; or a magnetic field generated and directed such that it envelops the habited spaces and slows or defects incident high energy particles. Earth has a lot of success shielding these types of harmful radiation due to this active shielding. </p>
<p>Out of curiosity, has anyone come across any applications of electromagnetic shielding for contemporary use (ie in fission power generation, diagnostic imaging, etc?)</p></div>		</li>
