			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds to me like &quot;imaginary money&quot; in our current financial system.</p>
<p>If you're doing math with money and you decide that you start with $1000, spend $20,000, earn interest on the money, and then deposit $50,000, at some point you are dealing with money that doesn't really exist. We have no nega-dollars, and 0.000003 dollars is not a thing that exists. But we still calculate it to make things come out right in the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't &quot;have&quot; them, though. They are a made-up representation for a made-up concept. We buy into the concept--the existence of those nega-dollars will eventually convince someone, somewhere down the line to give real goods in exchange for removing them. But that doesn't mean the nega-dollars (or the dollars) are actual, real things. It just means we all agree in the hallucination. The term for this is &quot;fictions&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, being made-up doesn't make it not <em>useful</em>. But it does make it not real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well not quite. Imaginary numbers can't represent things that actually exist (in the sense of a physical entity that does exist).</p>
<p>In your example, it's possible we would invent a new unit of money called let's say the millicent or microcent or whatever to represent that 0,000003 dollar.</p>
<p>Imaginary numbers got their name because it just can't in any way represent an actual THING you have. You can't have 3i pies, 3i elephants or 3i photons. </p>
<p>BUT the imaginary value when talking about physical object is a modifier. For example, in electricity, it's possible to represent the imaginary value as a phase state of a signal. If it has no imaginary value (0i), then it's in phase with the input signal. If it has any other i value, it means there is a shift of phase (meanning the signal is delayed compared to the input). </p>
<p>Imagine for example there is two light bulbs linked to the same input. One is linked with a single wire while the other has some black box connected to it. When you flip the switch, the first light bulb lights up almost immediatly (electrical field still had to travel to it at the speed of light or really close to it if we want to be pedantic) but the other light bulb takes a slight delay before it lights up. This means there is something modifying the imaginary value of the signal to that lightbulb.</p>
<p>Imaginary values can mean different things in different mathematical models but for waves, it's usually related to it's phase</p>
<p>Imaginary money on the other hand is money that DOES exist but is not related to any physical object. That 20 000$ spent is a real debt and means real repercussions if the lender asks for it. </p>
<p>Also, you can replace a lot of the misconception if you change imaginary with complex: complex numbers instead of imaginary, complex value instead of imaginary value, etc. This is what we usually use in science or at least every domain I worked in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The word imaginary in &quot;imaginary number&quot; has nothing to do with those numbers' ability to be representative. They got the name specifically because the concept was poorly understood at the time and people thought it was somehow more fictive than the rest of math. Even in your example, the phase transition is a &quot;real thing&quot;, in that there are phenomena that are measured and and then <em>represented</em> with imaginary numbers. That's all math is, finding made-up and <em>arbitrary</em> symbols to represent things we interact with, and then using those symbols to model further behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So they're not counting numbers. Are you trying to say things like phase, frequency, impedance, wave functions (some experiments have shown they are a physical thing), etc. don't exist? Imaginary numbers represent plenty of things that exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess what I meant is just that they are used as bridges to make the equations work even though they don't really work with the rest of the math on their own. As if we could hold the division of zero inside of a variable and work around it and resolve it after the fact without having to confront the fact that it's impossible to divide by zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of fiat money is imaginary. In your example, the $1000 you started with are no more real than the $20000 you spent. Both are just promises of future value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just say &quot;currency&quot;, full stop. Anything short of strict barter for items that can be converted directly into use is fictive.</p>
<p>But like I said above, being fictive doesn't mean it's not <em>useful</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree! I hate the word &quot;imaginary number&quot; just because it has this feel like it's something made up, especially compared to &quot;Real Numbers&quot;. It's no more or less made up than any other number, convenient to describe some quantity.</p>
<p>Bad naming here I find is a major hurdle when people first encounter complex numbers.</p></div>		</li>
