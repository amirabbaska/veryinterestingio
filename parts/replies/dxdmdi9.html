			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a big factor in auto racing. In the documentary <em>Grand Prix Driver</em>, they show how F1 racers have to work out to build their muscles to handly the g forces over the course of a race.</p>
<p>Or check out the story of <a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/gaming/geek-rebooted" target="_blank">Gregor Huttu</a>, a world champion in virtual racing who was invited to drive a real race car. He was able to do several fast laps... and then threw up in his helmet because his body couldn't handle the g-force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is dealing with G force in racing the same as regular travel? When you’re flying in an airplane you don’t feel literal physical pressure the same way you do as driving in a race car even though you’re going significantly faster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>G force is due to acceleration and decceleration. You can go a million mph and be fine but you can't accelerate from 0 to a million in a few seconds cuz you would die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a question of velocity vs acceleration. Only acceleration gives g's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember that moving at a certain speed doesn't generate any type of force on you. It only  happens when you accelerate/deccelerate. And g forces are simply a measurement unit that compares de force you are experiencing to that of gravity.  </p>
<p>For example right now you are experimeting a 1g force downwards from gravity itself. When you turn in a car at high speed you experience forces from 2 to 4 g</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was a terrific story! I watched a top gear video of one of the presenter driving a F1 car and saying how hard it was and this guy drives one with just simulation practice.! Amazing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is.  Drove truck in a previous life and was quite aware of how fatiguing it is.  Everyone says it's an easy job but look at the studies out there that describe how much turnover there is in the industry.  Some of it is poor pay and time away from home, but the stressors over such a supposedly easy job do add up.</p></div>		</li>
