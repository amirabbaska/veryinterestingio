			<div class="markdown"><p>If I work 40hrs a week and live in a sober house for 130 a week plus but insurance through work and pay med bills I have about $30 a week left over. If I work 32hrs a week I get Medicaid, eat better because of food stamps, and have $50 a week leftover. This includes no savings so if I miss one day of work I have zero disposable income and fall $10 short on bills for the week. It's rediculous. This isn't about taxes though as I pay about 13% not including sales. I also don't have a car.</p></div>		</li>

<p>OP is suggesting that we should all be paying 20% because that's more &quot;fair&quot;.  </p></div>		</li>
