			<div class="markdown"><p>This is crazy. So while you’re eyes are sweeping toward the clock (you haven’t actually seen the clock yet) your brain is waiting for the motion to stop. Then your brain overwrites that brief time period with what your eyes settle on when they stop moving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn’t quite overwriting in this instances, but a real time phenomenon. Your eyes are receiving light signals about the clock and sending them to your brain, but your brain decides to ignore them in order to better analyze signals within a certain window of reception. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is the threshold for this?
If I was traveling really fast and everything was a blur my brain would not cut that off.
So I wonder what is the threshold of useless information for it to decide to do this. </p></div>		</li>
