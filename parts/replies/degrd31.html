			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. That's the gist of the question.</p>
<p>If my rough calculations are correct, an electron that is 1m from a proton will race towards it at around 25g, and will pick up speed rapidly the closer it gets. In other words they're going to get very close in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Will the electron radiate any photons?
What would be the mechanism that forces the electron to bind with the proton to form a hydrogen atom?
Isn't the initial setup already a hydrogen atom, with the electron at a very high energy level?</p></div>		</li>
