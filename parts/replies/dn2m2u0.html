			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for the record, it is possible to legally transport a load that takes the gross weight above 80,000 lbs, it just requires special permits, and pilot cars, and is generally just a huge pain in the ass, so it typically isn't done unless you've got some huge piece of equipment that needs to be moved and there just isn't any way around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No pilot cars needed.  Just special permits that allow for excess weight. Permitting varies by state. New York allows heavy liquid loads. So does Michigan. Not all states allow it though.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are moving something heavy enough to need a permit there is a good chance it is also over sized, or will have overweight speed restrictions over bridges. In those cases you do need escorts and the polo. So while not mutually exclusive the odds are high that if you need a permit you need an escort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did the 80k rule come before or after 70k loads of gasoline? I feel like the law must've come first because there's no reason (besides practicality and safety... Kinda important I concede) that we couldn't haul 100k lbs of gasoline. Or 200k.</p>
<p>Sure, roads will crush and stop lights will become alleyways of chaos and death as an overloaded truck comes barrelling through, brakes glowing red like the blood spewing out of every vehicle it crushes beneath it's perfectly balanced cylindrical load. But like, we could totally do it from an engineering point of view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the dimensions of a tanker truck are constrained by road width and bridge height, center of gravity etc. Think of a cylindrical tank as being multiple spherical tanks laid side by side, with the gaps between them bridged to form one volume.</p></div>		</li>
