			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right. I personally find it easier to think of it as what are the odds that nobody shares a birthday. So the second person in the room has a 364/365 chance of not having the same birthday as the first person, the third a 363/365 chance not to share a birthday with either of the first two.  When carried out after 23 people you get that there is a 49.3% chance that no two people share a birthday,  in other words a 50.7% chance that at least 2 people share a birthday. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't make it much clearer to me. After 23 people that person would have a 342/365 chance of not having the same birthday as anybody else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but <em>all</em> of those requirements have to be satisfied. If the 23rd person was born on Mar 5 and the previous 22 were all born on Mar 4 then the &quot;342/365 condition&quot; would be satisfied but the previous ones wouldn't be. You need <em>all</em> of these statements to be true, so the final probability is (364/365)*(363/365)*(362/365)*(361/365)*... and all those odds <em>together</em> chip away at the total probability of all of these things coming true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to multiply the probabilities for all the 23 people, so 364/365 <em> 363/365 </em> ... * 342/365. </p>
<p>Think of tossing a coin 23 times, each time having 1/2 chance of not getting a head result. So 2 throws have a 1/2 <em> 1/2 = 1/4 chance, 3 throws 1/2 </em> 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8, 4 throws 1/16, and so on, for not getting a head result.</p></div>		</li>

<p>that person</p>

<p>Yes, for any <em>individual</em> person the odds are quite low.</p>
<p>But what we need to calculate is that nobody shares a birthday with person1, AND nobody shares a birthday with person2, AND nobody shares a birthday with person3, etc.</p>
<p>The way you do that is by multiplying the odds.</p>
<p>Skip person1 since there's nobody to compare him to.</p>
<p>Person2 comes in.  The odds that he DOES NOT share a birthday with person1 is 364/365 - pretty decent odds.</p>
<p>Now person3 comes in.  The odds that he DOES NOT share a birthday with person1 OR person2 is 363/365.</p>
<p>So you do that with all 23 people, and you wind up with 364/365 <em> 363/365 </em> 362/365 <em> ... </em> 343/365</p>
<p>That works out to be about 49% chance that NOBODY shares a birthday.  Which means there's about a 51% chance that somebody shares a birthday with someone else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PAIRS!!! PAIRS holy crap I finally understand this. </p>
<p>I had heard this fact before and always knew it was true, but never understood why. Because there are a far greater number of two-birthday combos than there are people. Oh man, like a bolt of lightning this information. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a wonderful explanation.  In particular it was you saying &quot;There are 253 possible pairs&quot; which is what made the lightbulb click on for me.</p>
<p>So thank you :)</p></div>		</li>
