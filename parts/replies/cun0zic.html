			<p>That's right. I personally find it easier to think of it as what are the odds that nobody shares a birthday. So the second person in the room has a 364/365 chance of not having the same birthday as the first person, the third a 363/365 chance not to share a birthday with either of the first two.  When carried out after 23 people you get that there is a 49.3% chance that no two people share a birthday,  in other words a 50.7% chance that at least 2 people share a birthday. </p>		</li>

			<p>That doesn't make it much clearer to me. After 23 people that person would have a 342/365 chance of not having the same birthday as anybody else.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, but <em>all</em> of those requirements have to be satisfied. If the 23rd person was born on Mar 5 and the previous 22 were all born on Mar 4 then the &quot;342/365 condition&quot; would be satisfied but the previous ones wouldn't be. You need <em>all</em> of these statements to be true, so the final probability is (364/365)*(363/365)*(362/365)*(361/365)*... and all those odds <em>together</em> chip away at the total probability of all of these things coming true.</p>		</li>

			<p>When I do this in excel, I get 46.1655742%. Am I doing something wrong?  <br><br>I have the numbers 364 to 342 laid out in one set of cells, divide each one by 365 in another set of cells, then multiply (=PRODUCT(A3:X3) for example) all of them together to get that answer. Am I making an assumption on what you're saying? (Bored at work about to leave, thought I'd try for shits n gigs.)</p>		</li>

			<p>That's what I get as well. Keep a couple things in mind:<br><br>1. the 364/365 applies to the <em>second</em> person in the room, even though 364=365-1. So 365-23 refers to the <em>24th</em> person, one more than the minimum needed.<br><br>2. These are the odds of <em>none</em> of the birthdays matching, so it's 1 minus this that yields the odds of a match.<br><br>If we actually go up to the 23rd <em>person</em> (up to 365-22=343) we get 49.27%, and 100%-49.27%=50.73%, just as claimed.</p>		</li>

			<p>You've got an extra number there.  364/365 is the odds for the second person, not the first -- the first guy is guaranteed to be unique.  You want 23 numbers starting at 365 or 22 numbers starting at 364, not 23 numbers starting at 364.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's the solution. The top level comment should include this equation:<br><br>P = 1-(364/365)*(363/365)*(362/365)*...*(342/365)<br><br>Edit: let my asterisks escape.</p>		</li>

			<p>does this mean, that the math fails here,  so to speak and 342/365 is the correct probabilty?</p>		</li>

			<p>You have to multiply the probabilities for all the 23 people, so 364/365 <em> 363/365 </em> ... <em> 342/365. <br><br>Think of tossing a coin 23 times, each time having 1/2 chance of not getting a head result. So 2 throws have a 1/2 </em> 1/2 = 1/4 chance, 3 throws 1/2 <em> 1/2 </em> 1/2 = 1/8, 4 throws 1/16, and so on, for not getting a head result.</p>		</li>

			<p>You would stop at 343/365, not 342/365. This is because 364/365 represents the second person, not the first. The first person has a probability of 1 (365/365) of being distinct. This brings the total much closer to 50% (~49.3%).<br><br>I like extending this to the coin analogy. The probability of tossing 2 distinct tosses is (2/2) <em> (1/2), or 50% chance. The probability of tossing 4 distinct tosses of a coin is (2/2) </em> (1/2) <em> (0/2) </em> (-1/2) = 0, or 0% chance... impossible!</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; that person<br><br>Yes, for any <em>individual</em> person the odds are quite low.<br><br>But what we need to calculate is that nobody shares a birthday with person1, AND nobody shares a birthday with person2, AND nobody shares a birthday with person3, etc.<br><br>The way you do that is by multiplying the odds.<br><br>Skip person1 since there's nobody to compare him to.<br><br>Person2 comes in.  The odds that he DOES NOT share a birthday with person1 is 364/365 - pretty decent odds.<br><br>Now person3 comes in.  The odds that he DOES NOT share a birthday with person1 OR person2 is 363/365.<br><br>So you do that with all 23 people, and you wind up with 364/365 <em> 363/365 </em> 362/365 <em> ... </em> 343/365<br><br>That works out to be about 49% chance that NOBODY shares a birthday.  Which means there's about a 51% chance that somebody shares a birthday with someone else.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;skip person1...&quot;<br><br>No. The chances person1 does not have the same birthday as the no other people in the room is 100%. You don't skip him, you multiply by 1.<br><br>The end result is skipping (1 times something is that same something), but that's not what's mathematically happening, and this is a math discussion, so I'll be pedantic :-) </p>		</li>

			<p>PAIRS!!! PAIRS holy crap I finally understand this. <br><br>I had heard this fact before and always knew it was true, but never understood why. Because there are a far greater number of two-birthday combos than there are people. Oh man, like a bolt of lightning this information. </p>		</li>
