			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be a good choice not to answer calls from unidentified numbers, but the fear of having your &quot;yes&quot; recorded is weird hokum.  Banks and lenders aren't checking your voice for authenticity--they don't even have that information.  If a thief has your credit card number, birthday, SSN, etc., they won't need recordings of your voice to commit identity theft or fraud.</p></div>		</li>
