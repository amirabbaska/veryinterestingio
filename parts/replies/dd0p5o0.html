I’m not here because I know a lot about cancer leukemia genetics, but because I have skills that all PhD scientists have: we’re all trained to think critically about data and results, value evidence-based decision making, know how to gather accurate information quickly, and can process large amounts of complex information. I don’t have any foreign policy training, but we’ve got really smart people in our office who do, and I rely on them to understand the international relations aspect of our work just like they rely on me to understand the biological aspects. </p>
<p>Contrary to what most people think, State works on a huge range of issues that have some or a lot of bearing on science and technology: global health, WMDs, climate change, trade policy, oceans and fisheries, arctic policy, species conservation, space and nanotechnology, cloud computing and cyber security, etc.  As such, there is a great need to have in-house scientific and technical expertise to make sure we, as the U.S. government, are making smart decisions on these issues.</p>
<p>One of my favorite stories of the Iran nuclear deal negotiations is how then Sec. of Energy Moniz would challenge his DOE nuclear scientists to make sure all their calculations were correct. As a world-renowned nuclear physicist, his input was invaluable in making the highly complex scientific aspects of that deal so strong. And next to him was a career diplomat and foreign policy expert, Sec. of State Kerry, who could make the sensitive diplomatic aspects of the deal achievable. That melding of deep scientific and foreign policy expertise is “science diplomacy” at its finest, and it’s why State has worked hard over the past decade or so to recruit more scientists, engineers, and other technical experts into its ranks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit- Originally, I was confused about this comment and wondered whether person was questioning whether the Secretary of Energy is a position of high importance. I responded that yes, the position was hugely important and that the Secretary of Energy is actually 14th in line for the presidency. I have since learned that the person posing the question meant it sarcastically and have edited the response accordingly:</p>
<p>You're right to feel disappointed that Secretary Moniz will surely be replaced by someone who is far less distinguished in the field of nuclear physics than he is. I too found it quite amazing that he was personally involved in the Iran nuclear deal negotiations, and applaud his efforts there.</p>
<p>I unfortunately cannot offer much insight into where Rad/Onc is these days, but that it's definitely a neat field with a lot of possibility. One of my good friends from UChicago is a rad/onc physician today and she's absolutely brilliant, so I would guess that the field has a bright future. I imagine it's a bit frustrating for folks to hear that I'm a &quot;cancer biologist by training&quot; but keep punting on so many cancer biology questions. I do that not because I no longer care for cancer biology, but because I've literally been out of the field for years and do not feel qualified to answer some of these questions. In other words, I would rather offer no comment than inaccurate or potentially damaging comments.</p></div>		</li>
