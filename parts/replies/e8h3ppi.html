If it slows down below <em>c</em>, its not really light/massless anymore. The universe will always force massless particles to be at <em>c</em>, they cannot be in any other state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's just call them tachyons for the sake of conversation. And I share that query. Here's an interesting question - would we be able to detect/measure tachyons, given that we can only use &quot;c-class&quot; measuring tools? In other words, can we &quot;see&quot; tachyons using only non-tachyon tools?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Interesting factoid for a non-scientist. And if I understand correctly, a &quot;thing&quot; (particle, wave, whatever-thingy) traveling at c does not &quot;experience&quot; time. So, from the perspective of a &quot;thingy&quot; traveling at c, the entire existence of all that is happens instantaneously. Is that a fair (albeit perplexing) statement?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s the handwavy way to think about it. It doesn’t make sense to talk about the rest frame of something going at c, but it’s true that we wouldn’t see photons “experiencing time.”</p>
<p>We don’t actually know what the mass of neutrinos are, but we know they can’t be massless because they oscillate between flavors, so they “experience time.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not an expert on relativity, but i belive the refrence frame is invalid at c, so you couldn't make any statements about time dilation from the perspective of a photon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. According to what information read from people who know way more than I do, it's not that a photon experiences everything instantaneously, it's that there is no resting frame of reference at all, even for the photon.</p>
<p>Since there is no resting frame of reference, <em>if</em> a photon has experiences, they are well beyond our power to describe them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IT 'slows down' relative to <em>c</em> in a vacuum. However, it is going <em>c</em> for the medium its propagated in. Its axiomatic, a massless particle has no other speed but <em>c</em> of the medium its in. Speed of light in a vacuum is the absolute upper limit of relative speed, but not the lower one. </p>
<p>I wish we could call the upper limit something else, it would make this stuff a lot easier. Light travels at the maximum possible allowed speed of any medium it can travel through. It cannot go slower. </p></div>		</li>
