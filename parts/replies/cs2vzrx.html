			<p>That's the assumption. It's pretty tough to form a giant planet without an initial &quot;seed&quot; planetoid made of rock/ice to act as a gravitational sinkhole to pull in a bunch of gas.<br><br>That said, it's pretty tough to actually make any observations that provide direct evidence of this. The Juno spacecraft (set to arrive next year) will take tight orbits of Jupiter. Depending on how that orbit changes, that should hopefully provide evidence of the gravitational signature produced by a dense rock/ice core.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not scientist here, but maybe there was a &quot;rocky seed&quot; in the beginning, but now with that much pressure it just got melted</p>		</li>

			<p>Not necessarily. All that pressure actually favors states of matter that we normally think of as &quot;cold&quot; - namely liquids and solids. So for Uranus, at least, the core is almost certainly still solid.<br><br><br>For Jupiter (and possibly Saturn), and the other hand, there's so much more pressure that the mantle has become liquid metallic hydrogen. This turns out to be a very, very good solvent, so while the cores of these planets wouldn't have melted, they might have dissolved.</p>		</li>

			<p>What gravitational signature does a dense core produce? I understand that there's a fantastic amount of heat in Jupiter's core relative to Earth. Wouldn't all that heat allow for more homogeneous rock?</p>		</li>

			<p>Its a big ball of heavier elements - but there's not really a solid surface because its 30000+ degrees down there so everything is molten, and above it lies dense metallic hydrogen which is 10000 degrees at its upper boundary.  The metallic hydrogen apparently is like a liquid.  </p>		</li>

			<p>According to the wording, it shouldn't be Kelvin; since Kelvin is based on an absolute scale, the use of the term &quot;degree&quot; would be inappropriate.</p>		</li>

			<p>The Celsius/Kelvin difference maybe, but it's important to clarify whether it's not in degrees Fahrenheit. Those degrees are smaller, not just shifted.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not quite solid, but they are extremely dense at their core. <br><br>No planet is solid 'like a ball of rock' per se, as the pressure is so great everything is turned into liquid (the most compact form), like how earth's core is molten rock and heavy metals.</p>		</li>

			<p>All else held constant, yes, but don't forget that a planetary core is also very hot.<br><br>If you look on the phase diagram on the Wikipedia article, you'll see that a substance under high pressure and high temperature can form a liquid.</p>		</li>

			<p>The phase diagrams you linked to show &quot;critical points.&quot; At the extreme temperature and pressures at planetary core, matter takes on a state that defies solid/liquid classification. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBRdBrnIlTQ" target="_blank">Periodic Video</a> that talks about supercritical fluids and how weird they are.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes but it's not solid like the guy said, 'a ball of rock'. If you took a cross section of a planet's core and put it on a plate, it will be liquid!</p>		</li>
