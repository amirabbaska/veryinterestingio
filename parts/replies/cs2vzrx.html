			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the assumption. It's pretty tough to form a giant planet without an initial &quot;seed&quot; planetoid made of rock/ice to act as a gravitational sinkhole to pull in a bunch of gas.</p>
<p>That said, it's pretty tough to actually make any observations that provide direct evidence of this. The Juno spacecraft (set to arrive next year) will take tight orbits of Jupiter. Depending on how that orbit changes, that should hopefully provide evidence of the gravitational signature produced by a dense rock/ice core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. All that pressure actually favors states of matter that we normally think of as &quot;cold&quot; - namely liquids and solids. So for Uranus, at least, the core is almost certainly still solid.</p>
<p>For Jupiter (and possibly Saturn), and the other hand, there's so much more pressure that the mantle has become liquid metallic hydrogen. This turns out to be a very, very good solvent, so while the cores of these planets wouldn't have melted, they might have dissolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What gravitational signature does a dense core produce? I understand that there's a fantastic amount of heat in Jupiter's core relative to Earth. Wouldn't all that heat allow for more homogeneous rock?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a big ball of heavier elements - but there's not really a solid surface because its 30000+ degrees down there so everything is molten, and above it lies dense metallic hydrogen which is 10000 degrees at its upper boundary.  The metallic hydrogen apparently is like a liquid.  </p></div>		</li>
