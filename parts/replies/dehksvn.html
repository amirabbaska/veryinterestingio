			<div class="markdown"><p>There is actually an organized network of Chinese owned staffing agencies that places Chinese immigrants in restaurants around the country.  A lot of these agencies are in the major urban centers where Chinese immigrants tend to congregate, New York, San Francisco, etc. They have connections with Chinese owned bus lines and housing and will place low skilled, sometimes undocumented job seekers at assignments around the country.</p>
<p>Many people here are presuming that their local Chinese food place is family run. That may be the case but they may also utilize this network. That is part of the reason you'll see workers in the restaurant working the hours they do. They are recent immigrants with limited employment prospects who were placed in a random location they have no connection to.</p>
<p>If a restaurant only placed hiring ads within these services, versus the local paper or a sign, they will de facto hire a Chinese person without overt discrimination.</p>
<p>Edit to add a bit of a digression: interesting how most commentators, including myself, thought of Asian restaurants rather than Mexican restaurants or the fact that Latinos hold so many kitchen and construction jobs in general. However, the reasons for both patterns are very similar. Networks, some organized, some spontaneous, that people outside don't even have awareness of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hiring of family members and people in their own social circle is definitely a factor. Freakonomics podcast did an episode on this and they found that it's actually the other way around. It's not that Chinese restaurants refuse to hire non-Chinese and Mexican restaurants refuse to hire non-Hispanics, etc. It's that people tend not to apply to restaurants that don't match their ethnicity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm: I worked for a Chinese restaurant with all Chinese waiters, and Mexican cooks. I was hired as the hostess because I was the only one who spoke English (and Spanish).  </p>
<p>99% sure all of the Chinese staff were illegal, as they would be replaced overnight every couple months. If you asked the bosses what happened, they would simply say they &quot;had to go somewhere.&quot; I don't think anything &quot;bad&quot; was happening (sex trafficking, etc), because they were all positive, and enjoyed telling you about their personal lives; most of them were sending money back home to their families, and trying to save enough to bring them to the states... On breaks, they would trade me English lessons for Mandarin ones. This was years ago. I miss them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only ethnic restaurant, I personally know, that tried to racially discriminate hires had a language requirement. It was a language which one only learns if they're from that ethnicity.</p>

<p>You need to be able to speak &quot;Jive&quot; to work in this soul food restaurant.</p></div>		</li>
