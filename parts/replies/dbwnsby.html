			<div class="markdown"><p>Other than the fact that seasonality results in the relative cost of juice, seasonality is not an issue anymore for availability.  As you allude to: (1) juice is concentrated an frozen in huge blocks available year round, (2) the availability of winter/summer seasons in southern/northern hemispheres has created nearly year round availability (not as true for oranges, however), &amp; (3) modern commercialization and transportation allow near universal availability.  </p></div>		</li>
