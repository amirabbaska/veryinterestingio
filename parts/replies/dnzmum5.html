			<div class="markdown"><p>Your father in law must have worked for a well funded department, my department and the departments around my department decides based on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Budget. How much do the cars cost?</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Money. Do we have any left?</p>
</li>
<li>Affordability. Who will sell them to us the cheapest.</li>
</ol>
<p>In all seriousness it comes down to who has the lowest bid, which is why we have a mix of mostly crown vics and impalas with the occasional unmarked charger. This is on a department that routinely pushes cars to 175,000 of the absolute hardest miles you can put on a car.</p></div>		</li>
