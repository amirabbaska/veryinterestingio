<p>I followed Eastern Orthodoxy for a while; my parish priest used to call icons &quot;windows into the other world&quot;. Again, not unlike the Catholic and Hindu ideas of conduits to the divine or otherworldly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how it was described to me too. We don't worship the icons, rather we venerate, which is a fancy way of saying we remember and honor the people and events that are depicted. I like being Orthodox because wherever I go, whether it's church, my home, or the homes of friends and family, there's always beautiful art</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That part I didn't know. Thanks. That is truly not unlike the Hindu concept... the energy or spirit of God takes up residence in the icon. As with Orthodox icons, there is a consecration for the Hindu forms also. What initially drew me to the OC is the mysticism... not dissimilar from eastern philosophies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its also partly because Catholicism sees itself as a fairly physical religion. Whereas in other religions the spiritual is seen as good whereas the physical/flesh is evil or intrinsically flawed, Catholicism teaches that the physical is an important, holy part of creation (in fact, for a long time cremation was frowned upon by the church since each person’s body is supposedly raised with them during the second coming). Therefore, having physical symbols, rituals and monuments is important to Catholicism. The Church does, however, make a point of emphasizing the importance of praying to God, as represented by the symbols, not to the symbols themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why you should never believe a protestant when they say Catholics worship saints.  They venerate them.  I grew up in a VERY Baptist area and was raised Catholic.  I can't tell you how many times I'd go to a friends house and the PARENTS would question me, a 10 year or younger child, why I worshiped saints.  When I was older I knew how to respond but when you're that young and adults question the religion you were raised on that you don't totally understand yet it's very intimidating.  Not religious anymore though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess that's where some of the disconnect begins. Some people forget that saints and other holy figures are used to &quot;intercede&quot; for us when praying to them.</p>
<p>As evidenced by some Catholic responses, which usually go: &quot;Saint ____, pray for us.&quot; I even remember being <del>forced</del> in a religious club at school and during one of our promotions to become a full-fledged member, we would respond to a prayer by saying &quot;To Jesus, through Mary.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Most secular teaching of world history in the West and the US (in particular) tends to ignore or gloss over the Great Schism that divided Rome and Constantinople, focusing instead on the Reformation. Not helping matters was that, unlike the Reformation (which was just about everywhere in Europe save Italy and the Iberian Peninsula), the Schism had a very explicit divide between Western and Central Europe (Catholic) and Eastern Europe (Orthodox), in part due to the nature of the Schism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, in the West total. The Orthodox Church didn't have much of a presence in Western nations until about the 19th and 20th centuries, when mass migrations from the Greek and Slavic lands began. I'm certain that if you head to, say, Germany or France and asked about the Orthodoxy, they'll either give you a blank stare or assume you're referring to Orthodox Judaism.</p></div>		</li>
