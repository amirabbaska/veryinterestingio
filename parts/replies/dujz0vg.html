			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the humidity itself add &quot;thermal inertia&quot; to the air? In other words, humid air takes more energy to cool than dry air, and humid air holds more thermal energy than dry air.</p>
<p>I've heard the term &quot;enthalpy&quot; used in this context - is that the right word?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct--the heat capacity of humid air is higher than that of dry air. But that effect is pretty small, only a few percent.  </p>
<p>Enthalpy is a catch-all term to include the various energies involved.  In this case that most prominently includes the energy stored by the heat capacity--the energy used the change the temperature--and the energy involved in phase change between liquid and vapor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nights can get quite cool in the summer in the Texas Hill Country. I got stuck on top of <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/enchanted-rock" target="_blank">Enchanted Rock</a> in an overnight August rainstorm (when it's often well above 90F during the day) and it got pretty chilly by daybreak due to the diurnal temperature shift. In the higher elevations and arid regions of the West, and on the Pacific Northwest Coast, summer temperatures have a pretty wide range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup it's quite nice. Where I used to live in Colorado and it would be 60's-70's (F) during the day and 20-30(F) at night during the summer. Perfect if you ask me. </p>
<p>For foreigners that's 15C-20C (ish) and -6C to -1C (ish). Apologies if that's wrong, I'm better at converting positive celcius temps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spent years living in Dallas Texas, it doesn't cool down at night during the summer. Unless you count going from 105F and 70% humidity to 92F and 90% humidity &quot;cooling off&quot; :-/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude, no.</p>
<p>Last year it was 98 and our coldest day was -4, that's a 102 degree difference between winter and summer.</p>
<p>the PNW's temp only varies by about 30 degrees over the seasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where in the pnw? It snows most places up there, and will often hit high 90s or occasionally 100 in most major urban centers. That’s at least a 70 degree spread. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between winter warming and summer cooling, though.</p>
<p>It's not entirely uncommon to have one or two days that creep about 10 Celsius in an Edmonton winter (I've seen it hit 20, even), and then plummet back to -20 a couple of days later. I've never seen June - August drop down to -20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, what you described was a 30 degree shift - have you ever seen June-August drop 30 degrees in the night from the highest temperatures in the rest of the summer?</p></div>		</li>
