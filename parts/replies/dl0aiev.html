<p>Misleading statement even for ELI5. Not all substances are flammable.</p>
<p>Take NaCl, Helium Gas and many other substances. These are not capable of supporting/feeding the combustion reaction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lots of things you know see are actually flammable, at different temperatures and conditions.</p>

<p>FTFY. It isn't true that &quot;everything&quot; is flammable, merely many of the day-to-day objects a five-year-old is likely to encounter and remember.  </p>
<p>As a counterexample, consider helium, which many five-year olds are at least acquainted with as &quot;the special air in the floaty balloons&quot;. You can't really burn it, nor is it the result of burning in the past. (Fusion is a different process.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Water is 1 example of something fire makes that doesn't burn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of... if you re-ignite a candle like this it's because that wisp of &quot;smoke&quot; contains vaporized wax from the candle, which is combustible. </p></div>		</li>
