The flow at some point was moving slowly and burning trees, but not fast enough to actually cover them. The lava cools around the truck of tree which thems finishes burning or rots out over the years. Likely there will be new examples of this happening after the current rift eruption stops.
This is coming from someone who lived near the park. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to say thank you for this post. I have been trying to put into words for regularly wired humans gor years about why I get so excited when there is a volcanic eruption in the news cycle. I love volcanos. As an artist they are endlessly inspiring. But i get this immense joy during eruptions the journalists catch. Regular people think I'm quite Ill to enjoy a natural disaster.  But it's the moving lava... And then that &quot;bloop&quot; when it's sitting for a moment. Oh divine. Now I can re read this over and over till I truly comprehend what it is. But i caught at least 1/3 on the first read! Bravo. And yea... LAVA</p></div>		</li>
