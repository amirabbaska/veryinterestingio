			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question.  It depends a lot on the disease, the type of vaccine, and how much time has passed since you were vaccinated.  </p>
<p>For measles, there is evidence that transmission without symptoms is possible in vaccinated populations (one example: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0264410X89901990" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0264410X89901990</a>), but there's no evidence that it's a big deal for keeping a measles epidemic going.  </p>
<p>For polio, it depends on which vaccine you got. The oral (live attenuated) vaccine protects from infection by reducing the odds of infection on exposure (&quot;shedding&quot; poliovirus in stool)  to 13% compared to no vaccination, while the injected (inactivated) vaccine provides no protection from infection (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002599" target="_blank">http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002599</a>).  Both vaccines protect you from paralysis.  The injected vaccine is safer in absolute terms for you as an individual (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2urird/raskscience_vaccines_megathread/cob6l6j" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2urird/raskscience_vaccines_megathread/cob6l6j</a>), but the oral vaccine is better at stopping infection, and neither stops all infections.  This is why we use the injected vaccine in countries where poliovirus transmission is non-existent, but use the live vaccine in countries where poliovirus transmission is a concern.  If we use the injected vaccine in the wrong place, polio can transmit silently as happened recently in Israel (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6159/679" target="_blank">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6159/679</a>).</p>
<p>Last for now, even if you can get silently infected and can transmit after vaccination, infections in vaccinated people are usually smaller (less virus/bacteria produced) and last for less time. Because of this, silent infections in vaccinated people, if they occur, are usually less important to transmission.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Vaccinated people are usually individually-protected, but they might be able to host a silent infection, but that silent infection will probably be small and less important for transmission, but not always.  This is part of why it's important to vaccinate everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for such a thorough reply! A few questions. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.Would you mind explaining in a little more depth why the oral polio vaccine is better in some circumstances than the injected polio vaccine, and vice-versa? </p>
<p>2.Ultimately, if I understand this correctly, it is possible to be vaccinated, temporarily infected, asymptomatic, and contagious. So, if a freshly vaccinated kid goes through a &quot;shedding&quot; phase, then could his nonvaccinated classmate catch the disease from him? If nonvaccinated kid caught the disease would it be really bad and cause an outbreak all over town, or would it be a lessened version of the disease since he caught it from someone else's vaccine?</p>

<li>We talk about immunity like it's one thing, but it's very complicated.  Vaccines train the adaptive immune system to respond, but there are lots of components to the adaptive immune system (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system</a>), and most vaccines do not train all the parts of the system that are important to fighting off a disease.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Poliovirus infection mostly takes place in the intestine, but it can cause paralysis when the virus travels from the intestine through the blood to the nervous system.  So, poliovirus immunity can act in 2 ways: there's local &quot;cellular&quot; immunity in the intestinal tissues where the infection takes root, and there's also blood-born &quot;humoral&quot; (like the four humours) immunity that can block the trip to the nervous system.  </p>
<p>The oral vaccine is a live poliovirus that's been modified so that it is very unlikely to cause paralysis (like 1 per million rare, vs 1 per hundred paralysis for wild polio infections).  Because it's a real polio infection, it replicates in your intestine, triggering the development of intestinal immunity, and it also travels into your blood and triggers blood-born immunity. The live vaccine gives you essentially the same immunity a natural infection would provide, but with much more safety.</p>
<p>The injected vaccine is made out of &quot;dead&quot; (inert, can't replicate) poliovirus protein and is given in your arm.  That treatment is really good at generating blood-born immunity, but it does very little if anything at the intestinal cells where poliovirus can get a foothold because it doesn't travel there.  So, someone with the injected vaccine has good protection from paralysis, but they are almost unvaccinated to stop infection (there are some more complicated effects I'm leaving out).</p>
<p>The reason different places use different vaccines comes down to &quot;is 1 paralysis per million vaccines a big number or a small number?&quot;  It's a small number if wild polio is still circulating in your country (Pakistan, Afghanistan, maybe still Nigeria) or in a neighboring country that can re-infect you, and so it's better to risk a few vaccine-associated paralytic cases to better prevent transmission of the much more dangerous wild polio. But, 1 per million is a big number if the risk of ever getting exposed to wild polio is much lower (like in the US or most of Europe or South America), where it's judged to not be worth the few vaccine-associated cases per year.  </p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that until about 20 years ago, almost every country used the oral vaccine because polio transmission risk was a serious concern everywhere. It's the success of polio vaccination that has gotten us so close to eradicating the disease that we are asking these complicated questions now.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's possible <em>sometimes</em> in a couple different ways, and sometime impossible.  </li>
</ol>
<p>First, all vaccines that are based on proteins or inactivated &quot;dead&quot; bugs can't transmit and so there's no worry (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine</a>). </p>
<p>Live &quot;attenuated&quot; vaccines (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine</a>) can <em>in principle</em> transmit and give the neighbor kid a vaccination for free, but transmission is only common for oral polio vaccine and is unusual for all the others.  So, with the exception of oral polio vaccine, there's no worry about transmitting anything from a freshly vaccinated person to a non-vaccinated person. And, except in very rare cases (that 1 per million from earlier), transmitting the polio vaccine helps because it's like getting more people vaccinated for free.  Nobody gets sick, everyone is happy. </p>
<p>Now, if someone was vaccinated a long time ago, but picks up a wild infection like we were talking about a comment ago, then they can pass it on but are usually much less likely to pass it on than if that person was never vaccinated. It's less likely because the vaccinated person is often less likely to get infected in the first place and the infection is often smaller than it would be if they weren't vaccinated.  So again, the vaccination makes it safer for everybody.</p>
<p>The main point of my posts here is that immunity isn't &quot;yes or no&quot;. It's a continuum.  </p>
<p>On one end are things like measles vaccination (and mumps, rubella), where the protection after you get vaccinated with all required doses is excellent for decades.  These are up there with closed sewers and garbage collection as the most important public health inventions of all time.</p>
<p>On the other end is flu vaccine where the protection halves your odds of getting badly sick if you get the flu, and you need an update every year.  </p>
