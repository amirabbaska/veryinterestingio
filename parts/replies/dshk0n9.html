			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on what you said, dielectric breakdown is mitigated by having more turns.  The wires are right next to each other, so the voltage increase per turn is a function of how many turns you have.  For example, you could step up 1000 to 10000 volts by having 1 turn on the primary and 10 on the secondary, but this is not practicable because the dielectric between each turn on the secondary would be seeing 1000 volts.</p>
<p>If instead you had 1000 turns on the primary and 10000 turns on the secondary, the voltage difference experienced between turns on the secondary is only 1 volt.  This, and the current of substation transformers is why they are the size of a house and cost $2M</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the first example you say that it's not practical for each turn to see 1000 volts. Why is that? Thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make it simple: The voltage gap is what generates the &quot;spark&quot;, and  insulation is NOT absolute. Insulation works up until a gap, depending on material, thickness and stuff.</p>
<p>So if you have insulation that can take 700V, and you place 1000V on it, it &quot;gaps&quot; the insulation and now you got a current and a spark and everything's in the shitter.</p>
<p>If you have 1V between spots, nothing is going to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To save space, wires on transformers will sometimes have weaker insulation than normal wires. They might have a thin laminate coat or something. The voltage difference across this will be too much for that coating to handle. You could use regular rubber insulated wire, but the insulation will take up a lot of space, and it might lose efficiency.</p>
<p>Someone can correct me if I am missing anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the moment, you can think of this dielectric effect as similar to standing on a thumbtack vs. laying on a bed of thumbtacks. You may be able to stand on one for a short while, but you will eventually explode into blinding pain and rage. Whereas a person can lie on thousands of tacks and be only slightly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In the case of electricity, the current (mass of the person) stays the same, but the current, per cross-sectional area of the wire, per number of turns (mass, per area, per tack) has been changed; this means the current is spread out more evenly, so the wire's dielectric ability is left intact, and able to continue working as a non-conductive material.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. </p></div>		</li>

<p>69kV -12.47kV at 22MVA is about $1.7M delivered, assembled, and tested (but not installed).  This is one of three units to power a data center. </p>
<p>To put this in perspective, Port of Long Beach had somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 units of ~47 MVA...</p>
<p>Typically utilities own these but in certain situations end users build the HV substations on their property to have greater control. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The wires are right next to each other
But in practice, the wires are next to multiple other wires, right? If, in the 10000 turns example, a wire is next to another wire (from another layer) after 500 turns, wouldn't they encounter a voltage difference on the insulation of 500 volt? So, do the wires need to be wrapped in a certain manner to minimize this &quot;turn distance&quot; of neighbouring turns?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes if you have ignition transformers or even microwave transformers they are not random.
You wont see the first turn next to the middle or the last .
This is true for every coil application that has high voltages across them and it becomes more important when the voltage/turn goes up.</p></div>		</li>
