<p>What if this thinking was used in other fields? Think of all the 486 processors you could buy for the same cost as an Intel i7, and unlike the i7 the 486 has been around for decades, the i7 could stop working at any moment, not like the reliable 486. The i7 is much more complicated as well, with many more transistors that are very tiny; if even one of those transistors stop working the i7 is done for. We have to misrepresent what an Intel engineer said about power management to claim they put a 486 in the i7, because the i7 is worthless so it has to have a 486 in it to actually work. Worst of all, you can't just replace the 486, you have to replace everything! All the software and the hardware and retrain everybody to use the new stuff. This is absolutely insane! Only a fool would buy an i7.</p></div>		</li>
