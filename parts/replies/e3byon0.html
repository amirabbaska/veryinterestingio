			<div class="markdown"><p>But that also means a larger skull, which means comparatively less energy is transmitted to its contents, no? If I hit a fly in my car, I won't notice, but if I hit an elephant, my car stops and I will fly forward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same energy, divided by a greater mass. Though this is meaningless if your head meets an immovable object such as the floor.</p>
<p>Also bigger head = more chance of it hitting something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but there are plenty of examples of things being proportion but not operating the same way. I'm not sure if this applies but that doesn't seem like a definite reasoning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that would apply in this case. The action of a concussion is the same, and the physiology is the same. The size of a human skull doesn't vary all that much to make a difference in the way that it would respond differently to trauma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>correct. imagine someone with a bigger femur or ribcage. technically the size alone would put them at a marginally higher risk for injury, but the brain inside the skull will damage similarly across all subjects. it is the severity of concussion or injury that will directly effect the brain. </p></div>		</li>
