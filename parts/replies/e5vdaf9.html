			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the reason medieval bows did not have great armor penetration compared to similar strength crossbows. The arrow must be flexible to be accurate, and this means it can flex when it strikes armor and reduce the impact. Crossbow bolts on the other hand could be rigid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t a crossbow bolt trajectory also be displaced similarly, just in the vertical plane rather than horizontal, and thus suffer from the same issue when it comes to armor piercing? Or does the “flight groove” allow for the rigid bolt to travel straighter?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. You could use a flexible bolt and it may have a flight path similar to what you'd expect from archer's paradox, especially as crossbows tend towards very short draw length and high draw weight. </p>
<p>The thing to keep in mind is the archer's paradox was kind of useful, as it means you can aim by pointing your bow at something, rather than aiming by pointing your arrow at something. Presumably this is much more natural, especially for high draw strength like English longbows, where holding at full draw could be very difficult so a more natural aiming motion is probably best. </p>
<p>However for crossbows you can easily aim down the bolt, and even if you hip fire, naturally tending to aim with the bow or stock, you will only be off on range, which is less likely to miss a human entirely, who are typically taller than they are wide. There was no reason to deal with a more wobbly flight path and potentially less penetration for the crossbow (which already required higher draw strength to compete with bows) so stiffer quarrels are used. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! The Archer's Paradox was factored in to the design of (even very old) crossbows. Czech out this picture <a href="https://previews.123rf.com/images/noimagination/noimagination1009/noimagination100900004/7810270-old-wood-crossbow-isolated-in-white-background.jpg" target="_blank">https://previews.123rf.com/images/noimagination/noimagination1009/noimagination100900004/7810270-old-wood-crossbow-isolated-in-white-background.jpg</a> .</p>
<p>Notice how there is a groove in the crossbow shaft, where the bolt/arrow rests. The bowstring is slightly offset from center, and the bolt/arrow is resting in a straight line with that bowstring. </p>
<p>Super neat feat of engineering.</p></div>		</li>
