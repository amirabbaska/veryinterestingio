<p>There's a classic physics trick problem where you ask students to figure out the best way to gain momentum using only a flashlight or laser pointer while in space. The trick of the question is that it's better to simply throw the flashlight/laser pointer than to bother turning it on!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why not use it until the battery is dead and then throw it? It'll be marginally better than just throwing it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But if you eventually do catch up and overtake, isn't it still &quot;better&quot;? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure about that?
Seems if you have the rest of the flashlight in your pocket when you throw the first part you are putting some of the delta-V into the parts in your pocket.
If however the smaller parts let you throw them at a higher velocity it would/could be an advantage.</p></div>		</li>
