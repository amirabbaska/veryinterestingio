			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't necessarily have to have debt to have a credit score... say you open a credit card, use it for daily expenses, and pay it off each month. You'd build a credit history without paying interest or accruing long term debt. Spend $400 in March, pay it off in full; spend $500 in April, pay it off in full; shows the ability to manage credit and track record of payments but no negative consequences of cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you don't have any debt, then you don't have a credit score. Which is not necessarily good, or bad. There just is no history there.</p>
<p>You probably wouldn't be able to go and take out a mortgage. But you probably WILL be able to go get an introductory, low limit credit card or one for students (most banks offer them).... but you'll have to proove that you have a job etc. They won't just let you have a $1000 credit card, let you rack up the balance and then not pay them back (you have no income).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You buy things with your credit card, which loans money from the bank, then you pay it back in full. Youre not really in debt because you shouldnt buy more than what you can afford.
You are not charged interest if you pay back before a certain time.</p>
<p>The bank can then see that you are capable of paying off your debts and will grant you loans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also not having any debts will consistently lower your score. I don't owe anyone money, so every couple years credit karma lets me know my credit score has fallen a couple points, which to me is better than owing money</p></div>		</li>
