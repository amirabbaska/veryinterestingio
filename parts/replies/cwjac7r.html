I can dissolve more sugar in my tea if it is hotter, is it same with air and water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's exactly the same.</p>
<p>That's why we get dew. When the temperature drops, the air can hold less water vapour, and some of it turns into liquid water, which we see as dew.</p>
<p>The &quot;dew point&quot; is the temperature at which, if nothing else changes, the air will be at 100% humidity, and dew will begin to form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to note however is that it is the other way around when dissolving gases in liquids. Thus if you heat a carbonated soft-drink, it will not be able to hold as much carbon-dioxide anymore, and much of it will evaporate. </p>
<p>I am not sure what the analogous situation would be with liquids and solids, or if it is even possible to &quot;dissolve&quot; a liquid inside a solid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>To add to the other response, this is why it's actually called &quot;relative humidity&quot;, as the saturation is relative to the temperature.</del></p>
<p>Edit: Read the comment below for a more (read as: actually) accurate account of what relative humidity represents. And then I guess read my response for what I was trying (and utterly failed) to say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope.</p>
<p>It's &quot;relative&quot; humidity because it's a percentage of the total possible humidity.  Absolute humidity would tell you how much water is evaporated per volume of air.  Even if the temperature doesn't change at all, those are still two different ways of expressing it: absolute is the amount of water, &quot;relative&quot; is not telling you the amount of water directly, but rather telling you what percentage of the maximum it is.  This would be true even if temperature <em>didn't</em> change air's capacity to hold water; you'd still be able to express humidity as an absolute or relative number in that hypothetical scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. </p>
<p>And to expand on this, the amount of water the air can hold is relative to its temperature. The hotter the more it can hold, the colder the less. So if you cool the air it won't be able to hold as much water as the temperature drops. This makes the water condense and come out of the solution. You see this when warm moisture laden air comes into contact with the cold ground in the morning and cools, you get dew on the grass (or when warm air touches the outside of your cold glass and cools, the condensation is due to the moisture in the air coming out of solution). </p>
<p>This is also how cooling and dehumidification on air conditioners work; you pass warm air over cooling coils (which work on a refrigeration cycle) to cool the hot and humid summertime air which causes the water to come out of solution as the air temperature drops, you can then provide cooler, dryer air.</p>
<p>Dryer air feels cooler also since you can evaporate sweat easier, when it's near 100% humidity out you sweat and it can't evaporate, so you can't cool down. That's why humid places feel hotter than dryer places even though they might by at the same temperature. This is why dehumidification is also extremely important for air conditioning, and not just lowering the air temperature. Because of the effect your own body feels with sweat evaporation, and it's called evaporative cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might add that if you have this conversation with a psychometric chart in front of you any little bugs that might appear will be explained. </p>
<p>Making wet air colder increases the relative humidity up to 100%. make it even colder (below dewpoint) and the water is forced to drop out. Now I am saying this from experience and needing a crash course on this at work one day. If you discharge that air it will read near 100% relative humidity. Its absolute amount of water stored is less though. For comfort purposes you probably want to reheat it. Now you have warm air with less water in it and so, less relative humidity.  Which is why air de-humidification can be a very expensive process. You need to cool it and heat it back up before you send to the space unless you are comfortable with discharge temps in the range of 55 F or less. In really hot weather this may be fine but anything close to mild weather and 55 degree discharge is drafty and will likely cause complaints. Its straight up unacceptable in winter for most buildings.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're delivering 55F at a constant temperature then most likely you're running a variable air volume system, in which case your VAV boxes will throttle back and your supply fan will modulate down. The occupants should not feel discomfort under these conditions and if they do then sometimes screwy.</p>
<p>I don't even think the newer energy codes allow you to do reheat unless exempt under special conditions like say in a hospital where you need to maintain some minimum air changes per hour.</p></div>		</li>
