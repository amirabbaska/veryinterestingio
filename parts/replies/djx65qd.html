			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely fascinating. I was curious about an animals abilities to track prey through visual clues, and this absolutely fits the bill. I didn't even think about an animals ability to use other ocular senses so to speak. Thanks for sharing. </p>
<p>EDIT: Finally get to say, rip inbox. Besides the top comment however, still haven't found much conclusive evidence. Unless it's hidden in the minefield below..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Some animals (mice,elephant shrews,etc.) leave urine trails that
glow in ultraviolet.Birds of prey see in that spectrum and use these trails to catch these animals. Years ago this was featured in a program narrated by David Attenborough. I'm at a loss to find it on YT though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc it was a BBC series similar to planet Earth but classified the episodes by types of animals instead of region. The Avian episode of &quot;Wildife Specials&quot; maybe? If not there, check &quot;Life of Birds&quot; and if you don't find it at least you got to watch some cool stuff about birbs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, animals will learn to associate certain experiences with food and adapt their behavior accordingly. Mice will not eat normal food that smells like food they were previously poisoned by.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They (gsmnp staff) say that the Bears in great smokey mountain national park recognize packs as a source of easy food. As a result you've got to put your pack up on the bear cables along with your food and any other smelly items(toothpaste etc).  </p>
<p>Animals are pretty ducking cool. </p></div>		</li>
