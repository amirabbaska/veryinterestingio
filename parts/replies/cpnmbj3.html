			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not bypassed, what's in the path is flushed out with water.</p>
<p>Maybe someone more qualified can answer, but I think it still takes some time for what you have just eaten to pass through the system. So what comes out immediately is what was in process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of what's in its path. The large intestine is responsible for water absorption, ie, turning poo from soft to firm. When you get diarrhea, your body is effectively stopping water reabsorption and dumping what it can. Meanwhile, your small intestine can still be hypermobile in response to stimulation (notice how gut sounds increase dramatically when you have to go?). </p>
<p>This is why prolonged diarrhea can be dangerous in patients: they become dehydrated from the inability to absorb water and can show signs of electrolyte imbalance for the same reason. </p>
<p>It's also important to note that this is why pedialyte is given in place of water. Those electrolytes need to be replaced. Furthermore, large amounts of pure water can trigger or prolong the initial diarrhea because it further imbalances electrolyte levels in your system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The liquid in the diarrhea most likely creeps into the hard stool and softens it making it easier to pass, but it may still be harder than what comes next.  I can recall from my last stomach bug that I had to go to,the bathroom badly, and dropped a decent amount of solid stool.  It paused after that, and I hoped that that was it.  When I was washing my hands a minute later, I felt the pressure build again and sat back down, only for the flood gates to be released.  I guess that the initial poo was just what was left in my large intestines before my gut yelled &quot;abandon ship!&quot;.  All of the pressure built up behind it, and the harder stuff was like the cork in a champagne bottle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that when the stomach hits the EJECT button everything inside gets a first class ticket out, which includes a lot of liquids and moisture (lets not forget about stomach acid). It seems likely that all that moisture could be reabsorbed by any dehydrated solids that were already there further along the line.</p></div>		</li>
