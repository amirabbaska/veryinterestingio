			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at a database of detected transiting exoplanets, it looks like most of them were at a &quot;transit depth&quot; of about 10^-3 , so much bigger than what the Earth would do to the sun. It's not just the size that's the issue, but also the time: when a planet goes around its star every 24 hours it's a lot easier to build up statistics than if it goes around every 8700 hours like the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this partly explain why we keep finding &quot;superplanets&quot; which are far bigger than our own? I always assumed it meant Earth was something of an outlier in being small in comparison, but this implies that maybe there are plenty of Earth-sized planets out there, and it's just harder for us to conclusively observe them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the design goal of Kepler--to be able to detect other Earths. Without building a specialized space telescope designed for that express purpose, however, the answer is no.</p>
<p>EDIT: The largest earth-based telescopes almost certainly have the resolving power, but the problem becomes one of resource usage, atmospheric distortion, and the fact the Earth spins on its axis. You'd have to have a global network providing 24/7 observation for years to detect the transit, and when it happened it would be one hell of a data reduction challenge to make sure you didn't miss it with the atmospheric noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kepler was able to detect transit signals that small, barely. In fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-37b" target="_blank">the smallest planet it discovered was slightly larger than the Moon.</a></p>
<p>With other telescopes, we're mostly limited to finding giant planets with the transit method.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite difficult: Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn all contribute to the amplitude of the Sun's wobbliness more than the Earth, with Jupiter's contribution being more than ten times that of the Earth. </p></div>		</li>

Not in the range of current telescopes, the next generation (ELT) could get some sensitivity to it for bright stars but you would need many observations to get a significant result. ELT could also directly image Earth if it is reasonably close.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Impossible with current technology. If there were a planetary system identical to ours around a nearby Sunlike star, it's doubtful we would have detected any of its planets yet, except maybe its Jupiter. This will change in the next decade as our technology improves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since an alien race observing us via the transit method would necessarily be on the dark side of the Earth, how much would the light from large urban cities (for example Tokyo) change or even mask the blocking of the Sun's light?<br />
I'm presuming not much because the intensity is still relatively low and that on the whole the frequency of light emitted by the cities would be different enough to the Sun's that aliens would separate the two peaks in the spectrum. Perhaps this could be a signal for intelligent life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to know.  Do they have the same tech as us? Do they have a massive, manhattan-sized space telescope? Perhaps a million such devices, each pointing at a different star for 750 years?  It's not an impossible feat on paper, but we don't know what's feasible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, though I was also wondering whether anyone knew how &quot;bright&quot; cities at night are compared to the Sun - it's enough to evaluate the brightness at the Earth since intensity scales as 1/r^2. If the two are comparable then one would be less likely to associate the difference with a planet transiting across the Sun.</p></div>		</li>
