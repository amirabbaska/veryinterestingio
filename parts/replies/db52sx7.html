			<div class="markdown"><p>Deflation means that your money will be worth more tomorrow than it is today. So as a result people don't spend money, don't make investments, and if people aren't willing to spend money, no one can make any money. So deflation stagnates an economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is utterly false. High-schools and colleges spread this Keynesian propaganda that simply isn't true. The Austrian Business Cycle Theory is the key to truly understanding economics.</p>
<p>First off, when people gain more purchasing power via deflation, they are more likely to purchase. </p>
<p>Second, savings is a crucial aspect of economies. When people save more money, that means banks have more money to loan out and invest into businesses, which create jobs. Consumerism doesn't produce jobs, it merely keeps the economy in a loop; if you want growth, you need investments flowing. What stagnates economies is mal-investment.</p>
<p>In order to understand why we have had the great depression, the NASDAQ bubble, the housing crisis, etc., you need to look at the actions of the Federal Reserve. In all of the time leading up to each of these instances, the Fed was pumping monopoly money out of its ass into the big banks. The big banks then loaned this brand new money to companies. Keep in mind that the pie of resources and labor didn't change, but the supply of money grew. These companies gained access to resources and labor that they shouldn't have had access to, fucking up the entire production structure of the economy, and also increasing mal-investment.</p>
<p>The boom and bust cycle has always existed, even without the Fed. But when the Fed sticks its nose into our affairs, it creates false wealth (or in other words, a fake boom). Unfortunately, fake booms have the unavoidable consequence of a very real crash, destroying businesses and families in its wake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That question is tightly connected to your beliefs and your own personal bank account. Fiscally conservative people tend to like deflation, fiscal spenders and credit users tend to like inflation. </p>
<p>We used to get like 10% interest on bank account savings; if you had $10,000 in your account, you would get $1,000 in interest. Banks <em>needed</em> your money because deflation had made it so scarce. It's almost heretical today to discuss how amazing your returns were on saved money because a large part of the Great Recession &quot;recovery&quot; was to lower borrowing rates to have more chance to &quot;go into debt cheaply&quot; and have more pocket cash to spend on consumer products to &quot;stimulate the economy.&quot;  They printed lots and lots of &quot;bailout&quot; money and banks no longer needed your money to do business. </p>
<p>The &quot;recovery&quot; ruined savings returns to like .01%. </p>
<p>Banks have so much cash that they are collectively like the Time Warner Communications of people who value savings. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, but your mortgage was at 16% and inflation was more of a worry. There's not a clear better or worse just using that one metric. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just finished intro to econ and struggled with this concept a bit at first. Is this under the assumption that adding another 100 in money supply wouldn't promote the 10 people to work harder? or is this all under the assumption they're operating at max efficiency</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone everywhere tends to operate at about the same level of efficiency, give or take, and barring extreme circumstances (crunch times at work, they are starving and struggling to make ends meet, etc.) They will not work at substantially higher levels. Even if there was a way to make people do so, it would be destructively stressful to the workers. And while an initial boost in productivity happens as a result of higher pay numbers, people have a way of normalizing quickly against that number, and the downsides of using inflation for this outweigh the gain, because too much inflation discourages lending and savings, and eventually the currency begins to cost more to create than it is worth (such as the American penny and nickel).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why increase the money supply then? And why does inflation affect the economy if it's basically just how many &quot;points&quot; we assign to the &quot;tokens&quot;? If the actual value remains unchanged, why does it affect everyone? Also, what the fuck is going on in Venezuela?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because modifying the 'point value' of the tokens only applies to tokens earned in the future, not to tokens already earned. let's say I am one of those ten people, and I have through whatever means obtained 200 of the 1000 initial tokens through shrewdness and leverage. That means that I have double the mean buying power.</p>
<p>If the society then inflates the currency evenly, I now only have 300, or 1.5x average buying power. </p>
<p>If I had loaned some tokens to someone, they can pay back that loan with half the effort.</p>
<p>If people are aware that inflation is going to happen over time, losing value over time, people will be driven to spend rather than save their money, invigorating the economy.</p>
<p>Why inflate a currency? To drive those who live paycheck to paycheck to spend them before they lose value, to allow those with debts to pay them, and to drive those with large sums to invest in building things that, unlike money, have intrinsic value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit simplistic though. Work is represented by <em>movement of money</em>, not by the money itself. You could run the whole economy on a single dollar coin if it moved fast enough. This is called the velocity of money.</p>
<p>So the total amount of work is equal to the total amount of money multiplied by the velocity of said money. In period of depression the velocity of money slows because people are not spending. That's why you can add lots of money into the system without immediately causing inflation.</p>
<p>But if the economy picks up and the money starts moving you have to destroy the money again to prevent the inflation getting too high.</p>
<p>Creating and destroying money, this is what central banks do.</p></div>		</li>
