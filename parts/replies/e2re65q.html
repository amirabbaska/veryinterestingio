			<div class="markdown"><p>Stress hormones (adrenaline and cortisol) increase blood sugar levels and can keep it up for quite some tims. Fasting is also supposed to do that but can sometimes fail, especially around the time you should have the meal you're skipping.
Also your hands can shake from the adrenaline, but it's usually subtler.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would explain why my hands shake most of the time then since I don't have a chance to eat due to working</p>
<p>Edit: I may also be a mild alcoholic because my hands stop shaking when I drink, but I mostly drink liquor mixed with soda so maybe it's the sugar that helps with that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For once it's probably safe to bet on the sugar. &quot;Mild&quot; alcoholism doesn't really cause tremors like that. That's typically reserved for &quot;Severe&quot;. This is doubly supported by just how much sugar is in liquor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the dizzyness has to do more with low blood pressure. Bloodcells need glucose to function, other cells can use fat but blood cells can't. Around 3 days pf fasting, the blood cell count drops because the body now has to break down muscle to get the glucose requirements for blood cell replenishment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people have become dependent on carbs. When you skip a meal you are depriving your body of an expected carb load.  You react with symptoms designed to make you feel like you need to eat. </p>
<p>You can train for body to ignore this by regularly fasting. Your body readily adapts to your environment.</p></div>		</li>
