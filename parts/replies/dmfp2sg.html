			<div class="markdown"><p>Not related but an interesting fact:<br />
Speakers and Microphones are built very similar.
If you put your headphones into the microphone jack, start recording and make that record louder by audacity for example, you can use your headphones as a microphone</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My headset has a mute switch. Once before I not only saw my voice transmitted over Discord while it was muted, but I heard my echo back through the other persons headset. I asked them if they heard anything, and they claimed they didn't hear me speak, so i dunno what the hell happened there</p></div>		</li>
