			<div class="markdown"><p>great question!</p>
<p>short answer, depends on what kind of cancer you want to fund and what country you live in. send me a PM and I can maybe give you some better suggestions</p>
<p>long answer for those following along: always look into and check out a charity before donating. <a href="https://www.charitywatch.org/home" target="_blank">https://www.charitywatch.org/home</a> is a really good resource for the american ones... some barely give any money raised to actual cancer research...</p>
<p>another thing is, where do you want your dollars to go. If you are passionate about a specific cancer type because you or a loved one is effected there are going to specific groups and institutes that do that kind of work and donating directly to them is going to have biggest impact than some of the fundraisers. </p>
<p>here are a couple I really like:</p>
<p>Canada --&gt; <a href="http://thepmcf.ca/Ways-to-Give/Donate-Now" target="_blank">http://thepmcf.ca/Ways-to-Give/Donate-Now</a></p>
<p>USA --&gt; <a href="https://www.cancerresearch.org/" target="_blank">https://www.cancerresearch.org/</a></p>
<p>UK --&gt; <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/donate" target="_blank">https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/support-us/donate</a> (these people do amazing work)</p>
<p>Aus --&gt; <a href="https://donate.cancerwa.asn.au/donate/" target="_blank">https://donate.cancerwa.asn.au/donate/</a> (we have people in our group that get money from them to fund their research, mods please delete this link if this is not allowed as self promotion etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they are fantastic... not specifically a charity for cancer research, but the work they do is absolutely amazing and its horrible that their services are needed as much as they are in these conflict zones</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really hope he answers this question. As someone who doesn't know a lot about cancer or the research that goes into it, it'd be nice to know a way I could contribute that would actually be effective.</p></div>		</li>
