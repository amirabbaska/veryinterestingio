			<div class="markdown"><p>The planned maximum collision energy at the LHC is 7 TeV.</p>
<p>If all of this energy is converted to a black hole, and it has a lifetime of 10^-27 seconds this would mean that the black hole is radiating ~10^21 Watts averaged over its lifetime. This is the amount of power you have to put into the black hole just to break even. This is 5700 times the power the Earth intercepts from the sun, and even if you have so much power available, you would also have to aim it on this tiny speck :)</p>
<p>I have no idea how much of the collision energy would actually be converted to the black hole though. But we have plenty of orders of magnitude leeway until we get to reasonable power levels, so I guess it doesn't really matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we can build our next LHC much closer to the sun, so the amount of collected energy (e. g. with huge parabolic mirrors) would be sufficient to grow black holes. Correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You dont need to be able to generate 10^21 watts to create that black hole though. It takes at least 5.86 seconds to accelerate the matter (if i am interpreting <a href="https://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/lhc-machine-outreach-faq.htm" target="_blank">this</a> correctly). It may take only 10^-27 seconds for the black hole to evaporate but you can take as long as you want to spin up the matter and smash it into place, 1 watt at a time if you wanted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, that only ends up being 10^-6 joules though. Sure, we couldn't hold that many watts for a second, but what about 10^-27 seconds? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short, simple answer: Black holes throw off radiation, gradually lowering in mass until they disappear completely. I don't understand it well enough to give a more thorough answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All black holes evaporate. If they are not fed more mass, they will eventually vanish. It radiates as a black body at a certain temperature. Imagine quantum fluctuations creating a fast electron-positron pair near the event horizon. One particle falls into the black hole, the other escapes. Voila.</p>
<p>Black holes smaller than out moons mass appear hot and will evaporate, while large appear colder than cosmic background radiation, and due to thermal equilibrium will therefore not evaporate. A 100 tonn black hole would last about 1 second, and would emit energy 10 million times more then all energy production on earth. As it evaporates, its radiation grows, and gets close to the radiation of a sun before it vanishes.</p>
<p>Astronomers have been looking for events like this, and are not sure they have found any yet. Real black holes may be electrically charged, spinning very fast, and generate enormous magnetic fields etc, so the math might be a lot more complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's one possibility that physicists are still looking for, but we're not very concerned about it happening.</p>
<p>First, we don't expect them to form in the first place. The collision would have to create a tiny pocket of energy density heavy enough to form a black hole. Subatomic particles don't like being pushed together, so creating such a super dense region would be insanely difficult. It's about as likely as starting a nuclear reaction by clapping your hands and compressing the air between them (I haven't actually don't the calculation, but I suspect that clapping your hand is still more likely).</p>
<p>Second, any black hole created would be extremely short lived. In the brief period of time in which it exists, it will spew out a small amount of Hawking radiation (but extremely quickly, making it one of the most powerful objects humans have ever created). It would have to absorb more mass from somewhere else but by the time the universe knew about the black hole (because of a finite speed of casualty) the black hole has already evaporated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain what it means to say subatomic particles &quot;don't like&quot; being pushed together? People often explain scientific concepts in terms of what this or that &quot;likes&quot; or &quot;doesn't like.&quot; Why does it like one thing over another, and why does that matter?</p></div>		</li>
