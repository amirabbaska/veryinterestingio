			<div class="markdown"><p>I made a video once of a small stream of water traveling against gravity (underside of my finger) with surface tension.</p>
<p>After a certain flow/stream size, the water would split, with part of it traveling via tension, and the other part dripping via gravity.</p>
<p>Is this the same reaction? Or is it purely surface tension/gravity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In each case there are a combination of forces applied to the water that causes the behavior seen. Some overlap, but not all.</p>
<p>In the raindrop, surface tension between air and water tends to decrease the surface area of a drop into a sphere. As the sphere falls through the air the pressure that builds up at the bottom face of the drop reshapes the drop like the picture I posted before. At about 5 mm the aerodynamic forces overcome the surface tension and stretch the drop until it breaks up.</p>
<p>For water travelling along your finger, if a stream flows up then there is likely momentum in the stream which carries it up. Capillary action (a manifestation of surface tension differences) can't drive continuous flow up indefinitely. If you just mean parallel to the ground, water does stick to your finger because of surface tension, but like the raindrop surface tension is only so strong. At some point the force of gravity on the water pulls the stream apart.</p>
<p>The difference in the two examples is that one breaks up because of gravity and the second breaks up because of aerodynamic forces. Compare a rope breaking because it couldn't handle a large weight (in tension) vs a thatched straw house (cohesion by mechanical linkage) being blown apart by wind. </p></div>		</li>
