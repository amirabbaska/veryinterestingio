			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this, its all starting to make much more sense now. So its not really the fact Australia is a giant island in the middle of no-where (though this doesn't aid the situation). Its more about unfortunate circumstances of government shifting. </p>
<p>But since you guys are required to vote, why hasn't the more progressive government got in? One that will fix this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did....but their own in-fighting ruined their chances.</p>
<p>The first time a Labor Government had won office in 12 years was in 2007, when the NBN plan was put into action.</p>
<p>They lasted 6 years in office, but the amount of political dragging that occurred as a result of the opposition party (i.e. passing laws which prevented NBN from going to peoples homes to install new cable, unless they had organised it with them before hand and had permission and the owners were home...as an example....or the power companies suddenly charging 1000% more for aerial cable access rental, causing NBN to have to reconsider roll-out plans in large swathes of areas around the nation {the same power companies were huge donors to the recently ousted, Telstra friendly, Liberal party}).</p>
<p>And then their in-fighting resulted in a change of party-leader TWICE within 2 years.</p>
<p>The opposition party played on party instability, insecurity in policy, businesses not wanting to operate because of 'perceived policy fluidity' etc....etc...</p>
<p>Basically the fox-news of political parties regained power and shut it down.</p>
<p>You have no idea how incredibly frustrating it is trying to build a stable career in this sector. Having the very concept of communications infrastructure being turned into an idealogical football...is the last thing I wanted in my earlier years.</p>
<p>And yet...here we are :(</p></div>		</li>

The only thing thats notable on the subject is that when you're physically in one area and want to access content in a distant area, it takes longer for the data to travel. Now, most servers with content worth viewing are not located in Australia.</p>
<p>It didn't have to be that way. Australia could've joined the rest of the world and been a booming hub for IT development and had major growth in e-commerce, banking, gaming, whatever venture you could imagine that can utilize the internet as its medium.</p>
<p>However Australia's base infrastructure (think pathways of piping, internet lines) is very old and dated and they did not progress. From this thread I have gathered that most of the reasoning behind it is political, aging population in power, and lack of vision beyond the internet being a tool for gaming and porn.</p></div>		</li>

Locally the monopoly is holding things back, but it also affects other global networks that try to get into the region to provide services.  Non-ISP services like CDN, caching, and deploying local networks for your favorite services is held back by some very ridiculous pricing.  A lot of big NA/EU players don't even deliver directly into the region because the costs of local delivery are so high.  So you end up with a lot of your favorite websites having their traffic originate from Tokyo or Los Angeles.</p>
<p>There are also a very limited number of trans-pacific fiber lines out there, so again, limited resources mean cost pressure and then over-subscription of what cross Pacific infrastructure there is (which in turn leads to higher latency).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>everything that /u/chucklesmthethird said is true, I was a political adviser to the federal government for about as long as he's been a telco engineer, but to put it in real perspective, there are a few, not exactly mitigating factors, but 'factors' that explain much of why Telstra was in that position. </p>
<p>For starters to say Telstra was 'privatised' is a massive over simplification and it's the odd details in the transaction that explain much of their subsequent behaviour and why they were allowed to get away with it. Remember, in 1999, the Government didn't even have the internet on its radar. The transaction's politics was all about regional jobs (Telstra, or Telecom as it was then, was a massive rural and regional employer) and insulating home telephone services against the potential for price hikes. </p>
<p>The Government instituted a regime of share sales in the new entity, Telstra, and completely privatised their retail and consumer arms while holding onto much of their physical infrastructure by way of first, a 51% ownership deal, and later, a shit tonne of regulations. This created a bizarre chimera of a company, made up of two component parts, often fighting at cross purposes with each other, compounded further by the fact that within mere years, it was the most widely held ASX listed company. </p>
<p>This is the only thing I take issue with in the post - to say Telstra was working against the interests of the nation isn't strictly true when you consider it was the largest consumer grade financial product in Australian history. 2 out of every 3 working Australians own Telstra shares, either because they personally bought them, or because they're a part of a superannuation fund that is leveraged into them. </p>
<p>Telstra were absolutely guilty of anti-competitive behaviour in the years between T2 (the second Telstra sell off) and T3 (which turned them into a wholly private company effectively when their infrastructure was sold), but at the same time, remember that behaviour was the retail arm of the company protecting the interests of their share holders which just happened to be the Australian public and the Australian government. </p>
<p>Now the issue here is obviously, why the fuck was such a stupid scenario allowed to develop, and I think the answer is just pure oversight. No one really believed in 1999 that the retail arm of Telstra would shift from being a provider of home telephony services to being needed to provide internet connections on the scale it then had to. That's why internet services were left in Telstra retail and why in the interregnum between T1 and T2 the new private entity was able to make such anti-competitive decisions. </p>
<p>You can't really blame Telstra for what happened. Sure, they're a horrible company, but all companies tend to be. They didn't have to be a company at all, the failure was Government's. The failure goes even deeper to the very way in which major Government decisions are taken. My throwaway is a reference to the fact the terms of the entire sale ended up being dictated to the Government by an 80 year old Senator from Tasmania who held the balance of power at the time. Hilariously, I remember him as being the only guy who had the internet on his radar at the time - he wanted Government assurances that they'd crack down on internet pornography as one of the many, many conditions of his support for the privatisation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I left this (and other) details out as it tends to over-complicate ELI5 posts, but yes thanks for the contribution :)</p>
<p>The core problem was in how Telecom was structured into Telstra through T1-3. Vertical separation should have occurred from day 1, with the wholesale arm being retained by the government, and only floating the retail services functions.</p>
<p>All physical infrastructure should have remained a socialised asset for the good of the nation.</p>
<p>Instead, it felt like an incredibly rushed effort in an attempt to maximize value, so howard could go to the polls and say to everyone &quot;LOOK HOW AMAZING I AM AT MANAGING THE BOOKS, WE HAVE A MASSIVE SURPLUS NOW, RE-ELECT ME!!!&quot;.</p>
<p>Yeah well you would too, if you just handballed a multi-billion dollar asset to the private market without much regard as to how it would operate prima facia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as I remember it, started with the gov shortly after the first sale, the sale wasn't about the surplus - resources boom, which was booming loud 99 to 04, was what was getting the surpluses. What they discovered was a massive short fall in projections of public superannuation. There was this fear, unfounded as it turned out, that around 2000 we weren't going to be able to pay out on the bloated public sector super commitments. They were worried sometime around 2020 you'd have all these people hitting retirement at the same time and putting their hand into a pool of money that just wasn't there. So the real crunch on the Telstra sale was actually shaving off the last 17% into the Future Fund in T3. This was how Telstra, by then half a private company fucked the Government on everything. They could leverage any attempt at reigning them in on the fact that the government needed the 17% of Telstra to go into this pot of money that was an insurance policy against poor super returns. </p>
<p>Keeping the physical infrastructure in public hands I'm pretty agnostic on. We're a year into the sale of NSW poles and wires and the IPART still isn't saying it increased prices. That's a controversial one, but Government has sold off billions in crown land and forgotten infrastructure (do you miss the says when sewer treatment was public? did anyone even know that it's not?) with only positive effects. </p>
<p>Telstra went badly. I know for a fact that a lot of the lessons have been learned from it, they went into it thinking it would be like Qantas or Commonwealth Bank, two enormously successful privatisations that are really the financial building blocks upon which the rest of our successful economy are built. </p>
<p>Ironically, the Telstra sale's biggest failing is actually the very hedge against the problems of taking away socialised assets. Telstra was privatised, then essentially re-socialised - apart from a couple of Singaporean power grids, it's the only major public asset that has ever been the subject of a consumer share privatisation targeted at households. Remember, the biggest, nastiest corporates didn't want a bar of Telstra. That's why T1's price tumbled down to 3.90 so quickly. The big funds wouldn't go near it. The foreign super funds wouldn't touch it because our bond market was so strong why would you take a punt on such an untested product? It was ordinary Australians, people with a couple of grand tucked away, who privatised Telstra. It is still the most owned share market product by households earning less that $60,000 per annum. </p>
<p>The Government thought, during that period of panic, that maybe there would be a silver lining, that maybe the massive investment by households into Telstra could be a real hedge against price rises and anti-consumer activity. How many other companies have as much as 30 per cent of their shareholders as actual consumers?</p>
<p>But it actually had the opposite effect. Suddenly, Australians were personally invested in Telstra's fortunes and that meant they could get away with the most predatory market behaviour by pitching it to the electorate as merely being about protecting their shareholders. Telstra shareholders, mums and dads, pensioners, didn't give a toss if Telstra were ripping off Optus and everyone else who wanted lower prices because their share price was growing, their investment was justified. </p>
<p>You'll never see that happen again. Telstra was kind of a grand social experiment, and we failed it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even though this post is old I'm going to chime in as I worked for Telstra, a company who issued you with a book on how to deal with your friends complaints at BBQs about Telstra, yes they did.  </p>
<p>I rode in directly in e aftermath of privatisation, working in the new mobile area and later in corporate services to major companies over in the Wild West.  </p>
<p>With out a doubt everything future bound was 100% on management radars.  When it went private a major known issue was the ageing and degrading telephony network that needed major repairs and upgrades.  With mobiles as a major cash cow there was plenty of money around to do this but an absolute reluctance to invest in this area.  They knew then and have always known that Australia was becoming a third world country in this area and have never acted and always passed the buck.  This was not assisted by the import of a dreadful Ceo from the U.S.  There has never been leadership or ownership in the area of infrastructure.  Nearly all the old school techies left in disgust.  It was very much smoke and mirrors and glitzy ad campaigns and catch phrases and this was well before the share floats.  Their land line computer system was a complete nightmare that barely anyone could work around, no plans to fix, only to stick a user friendly interface over the top.  </p>
<p>The floats meant a tightening of the reigns, less training, less staff, more amalgamations and even less chance on money being spent on the dying infrastructure.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, an 'upgrade' of ADSL, while definitely seen in a small scale, once it reaches nationwide deployment will probably see little improvement due to the state of the copper network (there have been incidents of pits of wiring not being watertight with the wires exposed to the elements or attempted to be fixed with a simple plastic bag, and these are not isolated incidents). This is the same copper network that the government recently purchased and sold back to Telstra, costing Australian taxpayers billions for that alone, and despite that you can be sure that Telstra will put in no more effort to actually provide maintenance to a line.</p>
<p>Also, Foxtel (i.e. Tony Abbott's mate Rupert Murdoch) has seemingly had some play into this, with all the newspapers that are owned by his media empire touting FTTN as a superior option to Labor's 'crappy' FTTP option, which one would assume because the then rising usage of Netflix and the already rampant piracy for movies and TV (Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead, our most pirated shows, are both on premium packages offered by Foxtel and are not available elsewhere usually until some time after the season finishes), both of which could see a potential increase with faster and more affordable internet speeds, here was driving customers away from Foxtel.</p>
<p>And our current Prime Minister/ex-Communications Minister answered a tweet from a Aussie who was frustrated with the fact that she couldn't get ADSL, NBN or Cable with this: <a href="https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm/statuses/446525847487254528" target="_blank">just curious:- if connectivity was so vital to you why did you buy a house where there was no broadband available?</a></p>
<p>Sorry if none of this is really relevant or wanted, just talking about the NBN pisses me off to a high degree, particularly as I am stuck on Telstra's starved data limits on a 4G plan for my primary internet connection</p></div>		</li>
