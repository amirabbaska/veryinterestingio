			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I think you are exactly right that our recent and ongoing evolution is less about dramatic changes to our bodies and more about subtle/internal changes like the the evolution of resistance to infectious disease or the ability to digest different types of foods. Another possible major change, which I discuss in the book, involves what we are doing to our microbiome (the bacteria and other microbes that live in and on our bodies). Mostly we are waging war against them, the outcome being that the diversity of microbes in and on our bodies is declining rapidly. The more we learn about the important roles some of these microbes play in our health and wellbeing, the more concerning this trend seems. I expect our future evolution to involve changes to our bodies to compensate for the loss of our coevolved microbes, or small partners as I call them.</p></div>		</li>
