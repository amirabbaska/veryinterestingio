			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they have more mass, but I dunno about the &quot;simply&quot; part. The impact sites that happened when the moon was young and the interior was hot caused mascons, but later impacts when it was cool didn't, or at least not as big. It's information that we can apply generally to the formation of rocky planets like ours.</p></div>		</li>
