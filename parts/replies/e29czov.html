			<div class="markdown"><p>As /u/mynameismunka pointed out, LIGO was off at the time, but blazars aren't expected to be a source of gravitational waves for LIGO. The neutrinos and cosmic rays are created by accretion/jet-launching near a supermassive black hole, but the generation of GW requires a changing mass distribution (specifically a changing quadrupole moment). If there were two black holes in a binary blazar, that would create gravitational waves, but at a frequency below LIGOs sensitivity (but inside LISA's!).</p>
<p>Detections from IceCube, Fermi, and LIGO could potentially all happen together with a GRB, though. (EDIT: GRB = Gamma-ray burst)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst" target="_blank">Gamma-ray Burst</a>. Possibly caused (as per the link) by extremely largely collapsing stars, neutron stars and/or black holes merging with each other, or flares from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetar" target="_blank">magnetars</a> (neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields spinning very quickly). </p></div>		</li>

<p>GRB = Gamma-ray Burst, one type of which has already been detected by LIGO. There are &quot;long&quot; GRBs (~100 seconds long) which are thought to be jets launched from collapsing cores of stars, pointed at us, in a particular type of supernova. This hasn't been seen with LIGO yet, but could be. There are also &quot;short&quot; GRBs (~2 seconds) that are the result of neutron stars colliding. Short GRBs were detected by LIGO last year. Either could also be a source of neutrinos as the high density and high temperature environment could lead to many nuclear reactions in a very brief period. Both are also gamma-ray sources, which is how we know about them to begin with (Fermi is a gamma-ray observatory in space).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pierre Auger is not unfortunately going to detect neutrinos- it's a cosmic ray particle detector, and looks for a different particle interaction.</p>
<p>LIGO wasn't on, but even if it was, it's not capable of detecting just a blazar- it detects gravitational waves via things like mergers, aka very large disruptions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That will probably need a supernova or similar nearby. Too far away and the protons get scattered too much from magnetic fields.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually depending on neutrino energy and source location, the Pierre Auger has sensitivity. I think the neutrino has to have an energy above 10^17.5 eV and the source has to be near or on the horizon though.</p></div>		</li>
