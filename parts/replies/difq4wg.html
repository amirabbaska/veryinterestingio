			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly archaeologists use this to work out when different areas got agriculture. </p>
<p>No cavities in the skeleton's teeth: pre-agriculture, they hunted and gathered</p>
<p>Few cavities: that skeleton (when it had some flesh on it) had some access to bread</p>
<p>Terrible teeth: that skeleton lived where and when bread was a daily food</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago I caught this series on Netflix called Archeological Autopsies (it's no longer available), a team of researchers would dig up various human remains from historical sites. If I remember correctly they had found remains from a Knight, possibly from the Crusades. Later in the show they found the remains of a farmer, remarkably still intact. I recall the farmers teeth were in great shape, still had fossil like berry seeds in his teeth. Whereas the Knight had a ripping case of gum disease, his lower jaw bone had actually eroded from his gums being so diseased. It was incredibly interesting.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom who was born in 1925 ate everything the family did. But, when she died, I found out she never ever had a cavity.
Unfortunately I didn't get that gene. Do you think her saliva might've been slightly different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats too. The geniuses that make name brand cat food decided that cat food should primarily be rice and corn, not meat based. My cat had to get two teeth out in the like 5 years I had him, and his other teeth weren't so good either. Thankfully they can live with no teeth it just looks weird and is expensive. I had him on better food but I have no clue what the people before me fed him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should be noted that the chewy treats do barely anything compared to Brushing them, similar to how mouthwash is great and all, but its not going to replace brushing. I believe the figures are they do ~20% of what brushing does, not to mention you generally don't give them one the amount of times you should be brushing your doge's teeth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, idk. My parents would buy these &quot;medicated&quot; treat things at the vet's office, we called them &quot;cheweys&quot;. Idk if my dogs' teeth were healthy but they were mostly white-yellow except some plaque along the gumline and they never lost any teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the chews is they can only chew about 60-80% of the visible tooth, where as brushing gets quite deep under the gum line where a lot more plaque resides, so although they aren't the worst thing ever, they're marketing (because they're more expensive) as an alternative to brushing, when they're just an addition to stave off the plaque (although unnecessary really), and its causing a lot of dog owners to end up giving their doge's long term issues if they're able to keep them alive long enough.</p></div>		</li>
