<p>most climate change models actually have Antarctica land ice remaining stable or even increasing slightly</p>

<p>I don't think this is correct.  There seem to be two things going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Antarctic SEA ice is growing.  <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/winds-of-change-why-antarctic-sea-ice-is-growing-16507" target="_blank">http://www.climatecentral.org/news/winds-of-change-why-antarctic-sea-ice-is-growing-16507</a></p>
</li>
<li>&quot;Scientists estimate the loss of ice from the West Antarctic ice sheet to be from 47 to 148 cubic kilometers per year. On the other hand, recent measurements indicate that the East Antarctic ice sheet (which is much larger than the West) is gaining mass because of increased precipitation. However, it must be noted that this gain in mass by the East Antarctic ice sheet is nowhere near equal to the loss from the West Antarctic ice sheet.  Therefore, the mass balance of the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet is negative.&quot; from <a href="http://www.climate.org/topics/sea-level/" target="_blank">http://www.climate.org/topics/sea-level/</a></li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the first post is only half right. <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6185/735" target="_blank">Multiple scientific teams</a> have determined that the Thwaites Glacier basin in the West Antarctic is definitely deteriorating, and this single ice sheet alone would add 2 to 3 meters to current sea levels. However, this may not be for a couple of hundred years. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this the actual scientific measurement in play here? Seems like the calculations could be off a bit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow. That's 47,000,000,000,000 liters. 47 Trillions. At least! Every year! How are we not dead yet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surface area of Earth is about 510 million km²; the water surface is about 360 million km².  <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/25756/surface-area-of-the-earth/" target="_blank">http://www.universetoday.com/25756/surface-area-of-the-earth/</a></p>
<p>So adding 148 cubic km evenly to the water surface would add depth of 148 * 1000 / 360 million = 0.0004 meters.  I think I have all the decimal places right.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ice that is currently floating on the ocean does not change the sea level when it melts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually that is not completely true, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18841-melting-icebergs-boost-sea-level-rise/" target="_blank">as you can read here</a>. When sea ice (ice floating on ocean waters) melts it <em>does</em> lead to a rise in water levels, it's just that this contribution to rising sea levels is smaller than that of ice on land melting and flowing into the oceans. To quote from that article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The ice melting is diluting the oceans, decreasing its density and raising sea levels as a consequence,” says Shepherd.</p>
<p>The team calculate that the melting of floating ice accounts for a small amount of the 0.3 millimetres per year unaccounted for in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s best model of sea-level rise, currently measured at about 3.1 millimetres per year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this situation is different from pure ice melting in a sea of pure water, where you would be right that the water level wouldn't change as a direct result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes'_principle" target="_blank">Archimedes' principle</a>. (See <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/110645/why-does-ice-melting-not-change-the-water-level-in-a-container" target="_blank">this discussion</a> for the mathematical proof.) However in the case of the ice caps there is a significant difference: the water trapped in the ice when melted has a lower density than the bulk of the ocean water. The lower density in turn is due to the fact that the ice has less salt mixed in due to a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine_rejection" target="_blank">brine rejection</a>. As a result, when this ice melts, it will effectively dilute the rest of the salt in the oceans, reduce the density of the water, and raise the water level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this... If sea ice like the arctic melts, it will mean that Earth's temperature is warmer. That being said, water that is warmer expands and so will contribute to sea level rise as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, And to clarify it for OP.  The ice you see in pictures of the north pole is floating sea ice.  If the &quot;sea ice&quot; melts, water does not rise, because it is already floating in the ocean.  If &quot;land ice&quot; melts then it flows to the ocean and it rises.  Exact same reason when you fill your glass with ice water, and the ice melts, the water does not overflow the glass but stays the same level.</p>
<p>A quick youtube search of &quot;NASA sea ice&quot; will give you some very informative videos explaining the concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda off topic, but it should be noted that there are serious consequences resulting from the loss of arctic sea ice - just not higher sea levels (directly).</p></div>		</li>
