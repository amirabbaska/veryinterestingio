			<div class="markdown"><p>They are passive which is important in a disaster. If you have redundant pumps to get hot water to them, they are guaranteed to cool the water. There's no need for redundant fans, etc</p>
<p>Edit: I'm catching flack. Cooling towers are not safety-related or necessary for safe shut down. I shouldn't have said disaster. Being passive is a plus for minor stuff, but they do not have benefits in case of major emergency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cooling towers of a nuclear plant are non-safety related.  They can be destroyed by a bomb and the plant will still be able to shut down and cool the decay heat.  They have an ultimate heat sink typically cooled by a forced draft cooling tower or spray pond.  Much smaller design, but it requires power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You donâ€™t use your cooling towers for accident response. You use spray ponds or once though cooling as your ultimate heat sink. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't worst-case weather conditions, e.g., a strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_\(meteorology\)" target="_blank">inversion</a>, cause them to not work for a while, though?  </p>
<p>Seems like you'd want backup fans in place anyway, even if you don't have always-on primary fans, in case you ever really need to boost the cooling rate suddenly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also from Wikipedia specifically for hyperboloid structures:
ith cooling towers, a hyperbolic structure is preferred. At the bottom, the widening of the tower provides a large area for installation of fill to promote thin film evaporative cooling of the circulated water. As the water first evaporates and rises, the narrowing effect helps accelerate the laminar flow, and then as it widens out, contact between the heated air and atmospheric air supports turbulent mixing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's one not too far from me. When I was young, I thought it was one of the coolest things. A freakin' nuclear reactor!</p>
<p>Then I found out that was just the cooling tower, and it's pretty much hollow inside. </p></div>		</li>
