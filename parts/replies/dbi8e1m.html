			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I recently bought a Google Pixel and was surprised by my ability to manipulate the touchscreen even with my leather gloves on. They aren't special gloves of any sort and they didn't work with my old Note 4.</p>
<p>What changed? Is the Pixel different from other touchscreens in that regard?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Disclaimer: physics is not my field so take this with a grain of salt</p>
<p>Edit edit: &quot; the size of the electrode and the covering material influence the sensitivity of the sensor.&quot; source: <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/downloads/MICRO/fme/articles/fujitsu-whitepaper-capacitive-touch-sensors.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.fujitsu.com/downloads/MICRO/fme/articles/fujitsu-whitepaper-capacitive-touch-sensors.pdf</a></p>
<p>Based on this, it  appears that they modify the size of the electrodes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't made any changes to the field's strength myself. So if you're right, then the Pixel's electric field must be stronger than other phones by default. </p>
<p>I am not surprised... The Pixel is an awesome machine.</p>
<p>That said, I would like to turn the strength of it down -- it gets woken up in my pocket all the time and destroys the battery life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Old Samsung phones had a &quot;glove&quot; mode where they would crank up the touch screen sensitivity but it drew more power and would detect more false touches. Looks like Google optimized that feature on the pixel and figured out how to reduce the power draw. </p>
<p>Also they do sell leather gloves that work with normal touchscreen phones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water in the cells a short distance below the surface is more important than the water on the surface.  But otherwise this explains it well.  The sensing is capacitive, not conductive.  A thin non-conductive layer does not pose a problem, but thick leather gloves do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>3D just means sensitive enough to detect fingers a little further away.</p></div>		</li>
