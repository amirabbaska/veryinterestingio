			<div class="markdown"><p>A single piece of DNA will have ~200 billion atoms.</p>
<p>A single corn cell will have much, much more atoms than that.</p>
<p>A single grit of ~200 micrometers grain size will have some ~3*10^17 atoms, i.e. ~ 300000000 billions of atoms.</p>
<p>As the parent poster said, tl;dr: The difference in scale between an atom and a macroscopic object (including grits) cannot be measured in mere billions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>so they were technically right.  and technically right is the best kind of right.</p></div>		</li>
