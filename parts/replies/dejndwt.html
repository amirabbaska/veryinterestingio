			<div class="markdown"><p>One example I often heard is someone throwing a package of drugs over your fence. If you didn't order those drugs then you are not in possession of them. Only after you found them (and it was obvious what the package is) and neither got rid of them nor called police you are in possession</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in my part of the world... we have &quot;Drop boxes&quot; for drugs/old medications. They also suggest you bring in drugs to the police station as well for them to dispose of... they're not going to arrest you </p>
<p>Edit: I think the drop boxes are actually at the police stations - So I may be wrong and they expect you to drop them in and not bring them in. I still believe they would not arrest you for surrendering drugs at a station. </p></div>		</li>
