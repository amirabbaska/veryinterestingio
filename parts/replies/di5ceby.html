			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps to think of the wall not as just a 10x15 rectangle of concrete, but of everything connected to it: its foundation, the road leading up to it, etc. If you could somehow load those several city blocks onto a giant 100 mph treadmill (and put it in a bubble to account for wind), you can see why there's no real difference in force between the car moving or the car being &quot;stationary&quot; while the road underneath it slides by and the wall itself approaches at 100 mph. In fact, an observer on that moving sidewalk would experience that &quot;stationary&quot; car as the thing moving.</p>
<p>And when you consider that the Earth itself is not some absolute frame of reference, but just another object moving in space, the example becomes a little less fantastical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On Earth, If you had a very large wall coming at you at 100mph there would be an equally large bow wave of air out in front of it. Perhaps enough force to start moving the other object away from it before any impact. </p>
<p>I suspect that there is a similar air movement effect on an object going toward a stationary wall, but smaller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the car aspect, or even being in a vehicle, does change things. In a car everything in the car has inertia. My organs, my eyes, my brain, the watermelon in the passenger seat, all are also traveling at 100mph. So when you crash into the wall, everything inside the car keeps that same energy into the car interior, or the windshield, then wall, stop you. </p>
<p>If, let's say, we make the moving wall have enough mass to account for the foundation, etc. Then when it hits the car, energy has to be transferred into all the stuff in the car, down to the energy going from the wall, to the car, to the seat, to the belt, to my torso, to my neck, to my head, to my skull, abs that shakes my brain. There's a loss of energy all throughout that, though not much relative to the impact total.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because that would be the most common way for someone to go 100 mph.</p>
<p>Just like someone saying a wall is also attached to a foundation, the method that the person uses to go 100 mph matters too. I guess we could consider slingshotting a person at a wall since a vehicle of some sort would likely change the damage done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But won't the force be different in the two cases?  In both cases, the velocity and acceleration are equal.  However, couldn't a case be made that the car wouldn't have as much force due to not having as much mass as the brick wall (assuming the wall has more mass)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ignore influence of air and street than the difference between the two scenarios is just a change of the inertial frame, which should not alter the physics. The forces will not change from changing inertial frame.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter that in one scenario the energy of the system is higher on paper, the outcome will be the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but the acceleration of the car and the occupants inside itwould be different, correct? Because the car would be thrown backwards by the wall. The wall would not be thrown by the car though. The wall and car have different masses so the car and the wall would have different momentums.  This would result in different acceleration for the car if im not mistaken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The force will be different, but not only because of the reason you mention.  When a car hits a brick wall, the assumption is the brick wall doesn't move (velocity 0) because it's fixed to the ground, but if a moving brick wall hit a car, it would probably move backward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my initial thought, too. Others have pointed out that the energy (assuming the wall us just sliding along at 100 mph somehow) is going to be very similar. The car and the wall will end up with 0 mph relative to each other, even if the wall keeps moving because it's more massive than the car.</p>
<p>This is obviously ignoring things like the car being pushed along the ground after impact, wheels not spinning, etc. The two collisions would have a bunch of little differences, but the total change would be negligible compared to the energy of the impact.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if you were sitting in the car with eyes closed during both collisions (assuming you survive), the difference would be too small to notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The force of moving either the wall at 100 mph or the car at 100 mph would be different because they are different masses, but the force isn't what kills you. The impact is what kills you, and since in both cases the velocity relative to each other 100 mph, the change in momentum (impact) remains the same (in an ideal environment).</p></div>		</li>
