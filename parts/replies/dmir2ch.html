			<div class="markdown"><p>I too work at bank, as the Field Tech saddled with keeping said banks ATM's up and running. If you're trying to suggest that 10 transactions per day is a good, or average day, you're completely off your nut.</p>
<p>If our machines only did 10 transactions per day we'd go out of business, since it's a primary revenue stream for the bank.</p>
<p>I can't count on two hands the number of times I've had a queue of 10+ people behind me waiting on the tech to gtfo the way so that they can get some cash.</p>
<p>You're right on customer/non customer front though. ATM's don't make a dime on customer transactions but that's a primary reason to raise your withdrawal limit to an amount higher than the ATM's in the surrounding area. If ABC bank, and it's cousins are all capping daily withdrawal limits at $500/day, a smooth $800/day limit pulls in more non customers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The banks/IRS only care if you go over 20,000$ a month per Atm. I found this out 5-6 years ago and did get a nasty letter from the bank. No problems since the deposit/withdraw dance started. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are having reports filed on you every time you exceed $10,000. And the transaction is recorded if it's over $3000. Also, attempting to avoid these limits is a reportable action.  </p></div>		</li>
