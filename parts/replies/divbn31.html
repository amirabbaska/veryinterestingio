			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the article says the antihydrogen atoms have a kinetic energy of 0.5K, so the rate of reaction is probably pretty small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rates of reaction are still very much the key here though. The problem is that the reaction is too slow for a anti-H2 molecule to form and be detected before the atoms destabilize.</p>
<p>This is directly caused by rate of reaction (a product of concentration and temperature, among other things).</p>
<p>In reality, (to my understanding, but I'm a chemist and antimatter is a subdivision of physics) there have mostly likely been anti-H2 molecules in a laboratory conditions. But not in concentrations that we can detect with methods that don't destabilize antimatter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any idea on how many H2 molecules would form if 309 H atoms were in confinement for 1,000 seconds? Would we expect the same number of anti-H2 molecules? Is the problem the kinetics of the system or just our ability to detect it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, they're <em>very</em> cold so the rate of H2 forming will be much slower than at room temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it being very cold would help them to form H2 faster,  because if they happen to collide, they won't have so much kinetic energy that they collide elastically and bounce off each other.  Instead,  at low temperatures,  they would collide and sick together to form H2 molecules. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious, and total layman obviously, but when they make antihydrogen are they just making antiprotons or do the atoms also have orbiting positrons?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are making both antiprotons and positrons and combining them to form antihydrogen.</p>
<p>They are also able to make heavier nuclei up to and including antihelium nuclei, but they have not been able to get positrons into orbit.  Or at least, they have not been able to observe that to be the case.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly difficult to work with anti-atoms because they cannot be controlled as easily as antiprotons and positrons using electromagnetic fields, since they are neutrally charged.   Without that, it is hard to slow them down enough for study before they impact the matter of the containment device and annihilate.  Even getting antihydrogen slowed down enough to study was a big deal and used a property that atoms have called spin magnetic moment where you can use specially structured magnetic fields to slow the atom down.  But it is nowhere near as efficient as the devices to slow and capture charged particles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that correct?  If so that's a very roundabout way of saying we can make two anti-elements: Anti-Hydrogen and Anti-Helium.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How are they generating the anti-particles in the first place?</p>
<p>There shouldn't be any on earth or within the atmosphere, so they must be generating them somehow...</p>
<p>Something something supercollider?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why couldn't you just trap the antiprotons and bathe them in positrons? Would there be too much matter around to annihilate with? Is there some other reason you need to create the antihydrogen first before you trap it? </p></div>		</li>
