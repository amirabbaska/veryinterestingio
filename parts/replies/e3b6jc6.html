			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda. In the case of solids like most metals, &quot;plastic&quot; (permanent) deformation occurs when little cracks called dislocations form and move around. You can visualize this by imagining a rug that isn't quite laying flat and has those long ripples running across it as a result. With no external force added, these cracks are held in place by the rest of the material (atoms bonding to each other).</p>
<p>However, if you apply heat, those bonds can move around for much the same reason liquid water differs from ice. You can visualize this as the aforementioned carpet sitting on a really slippery tile floor rather than a floor with more friction (like another carpet). Without friction to hold it in it's non-flat state, it will smooth out. </p>
<p>This process - again, in metallurgy - is called annealing. It's also worth noting that even though the material is &quot;healed&quot; it won't spring back into shape. Atomic bonds have no memory after all :)</p></div>		</li>
