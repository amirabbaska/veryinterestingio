<p>At least if you take a look from the original reference frame, there is certainly a huge acceleration. But now that I think about it I guess it does make sense - your entire body is accelerating at the same rate so no harm can come to you.</p>
<p>I guess it is the &quot;seat&quot; of the jet engine that is pushing you back causing the damage? or what is happening here?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the force is being applied only to your back by the seat behind you. In this case the gravitational field is pulling every molecule in your body (and the ship) uniformly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not at all.  In a jet, the aircraft is pushing against you and the inertia of various parts of your body resists it, potentially causing damage.  In space, gravity is pulling everything equally.  The ship, you, and everything inside you is accelerating at practically-equal rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think about it this way. There's a plane that allows you to feel weightless. It flies up high then falls down to earth at 9.8m/s^2 . You feel weightless as you're accelerating because you're accelerating at the same rather the plane is. I get this part.</p>
<p>You'd you feel <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics)" target="_blank">jerk</a>  though? The acceleration rate of acceleration? Let's say 9.8m/s^3 ?</p>
<p>Because I think the rate of your acceleration would change as you get flung around the plannet, right?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like being in free fall. You'd still experience microgravity throughout the manoeuvre.</p>
<p>The only danger would be from tidal forces, which only start to be problems for human-sized objects when you're dealing with fairly small black holes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Neutron stars are not typical astronomical bodies.  A typical neutron star has a radius of about 10 km.  If you were to plot an orbit that comes within 20 km of the center of the neutron star, my back of the napkin calculations suggest that the difference in pull between your head and your feet would be about 10 million gravities.  At 100 km from the center the difference would still be 76 thousand gravities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was a Larry Niven short story where that was the major plot point. Damned if I can recall the title off the top of my head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jeeze that's insaine. I wonder how far away you have to be to not die. I wonder what's the maximum difference in force between your head and toes before a human dies.</p>
<p>Do you have the equation?. I'd like to know an equation that gives you the difference in gravity between your head and toes as a function of the distance to the neutron star.</p>
<p>I'd like to see how it drops off with distance.</p>
<p>And some it for a difference of 4G's. I think a human can survive that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gravity from a given object is given in the formula F=Gm/r^2</p>
<p>Technically the formula uses M1 and M2 for the mass of the two objects, but since a neutron star is so massive we can just ignore the mass of a person or a spaceship and leave that quantity at 1.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says a neutron star has a radius of about 10 kilometers and about 1.4 solar masses, so <code>r = 1e4</code> and <code>m = 2.78e30</code>.  G is the gravitational constant of <code>6.67408e-11</code></p>
<p>Let's say an average astronaut is about 2 meters tall... then you plug in the formula for the force at a given distance, and then the distance plus 2 meters, and subtract one from the other.  This gives the difference in force between the feet and the head, assuming that one is pointed at the center of the star and the other is pointed directly away.</p>
<p>The number you get is in (m/s)^2 so if we want the number of 'earth gravities' we divide by 9.8.</p>
<p>Since the numbers are so large, we want to take the log of the resulting value so we can plot a reasonable looking graph</p>
<p><a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bh3hf1pxl6" target="_blank">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bh3hf1pxl6</a></p>
<p>X here is the distance from the star in radiuses, so 1 means you're standing on the surface of the star.  </p>
<p>Y is the log base 10 of the difference in earth gravities between X and X plus 2 meters.</p>
<p>If you look at the point on the graph where X = 2, you see Y = 6.977, so the difference in gravity between your head and feet is ~1e7, or 10 million Gs.</p>
<p>At X=70, or 700 km from the star, Y is 2.354 or about 200 Gs.  </p>
<p>Y drops down to 1 somewhere around 190 &lt; X &lt; 200, meaning the difference between your head and your feet is 1 G.  Of course that's just the difference due to tidal forces.  The star is still pulling on your center of mass with well over a million Gs, so if you're doing an orbital pass of the star, better hope that the nearest point in that orbit isn't much closer than 2000 km from the center, and that's assuming that your ship as a whole is well put together than that you're going to be located at the exact center of mass of the ship.  Get 10 meters from the center and you'll be pressed against the wall at about 5 Gs.</p></div>		</li>
