			<div class="markdown"><p>the neuronal pruning is typically synaptic pruning, or arbor pruning of a branch of an axon terminal, rather than &quot;pruning&quot; of the entire cell.</p>
<p>according to the review linked above, there's <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> evidence from different neuronal lines that antidepressants trigger apoptosis. so it's not necessarily linked to learning.</p>
<p>they also claim that previous evidence (see below) of antidepressants exhibiting neurogenesis is equivocal--that it is actually a marker of DNA synthesis, rather than cell proliferation. that evidence uses, BrdU a thymidine analog that can be that is incorporated into DNA during synthesis, and then is visible with cell staining. so previous studies using BrdU could be visualizing DNA repair, or even the upregulated DNA synthesis that often occurs during the process that leads to apoptosis. </p>
<p>note: this review has a very apparent anti-antidepressant slant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to be offensive... but I just read the first review you linked and thought it was just a load of inflammatory babble. The study they cited for that apoptosis comment was done on TCAs, which are an old class of drug and arent often prescribed as first line antidepressants anymore. (More so for neuropathic pain these days). The authors speak as though they’ve  discredited the use of antidepressants simply by citing all of their well known side effects. It’s so unrealistic. People who get side effects worse than the symptoms of their depression just stop the medication. SSRIs can be incredibly effective treating moderate to severe depression. </p>
<p>Is OP’s question possible? Sure because longitudinal studies on new antidepressants haven’t been done. But it’s pretty unrealistic to accept any in vitro study as “probably” the case in this setting. In vitro “long term” effects would be in the order of a week. How does that apply to human long term effects that are in the order of a life time? </p>
<p>Also just keep in mind that we already know long-term depression itself causes hippocampal atrophy. </p>
<p>Edit: OP I’ve linked a better/more recent article. If you’re considering starting antidepressants, please give this a read. It’s easily digestible, unbiased and accurate! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I have recently learned in my Basic and Clinical Foundations of Neurological Disease course, and a few sources, yes.  I am not a fan of the article above, the language seems odd for something on NCBI, overly declarative and conclusive.</p>
<p>As far as I understand, there are theories to depression, given it is a syndrome and not really tied to just serotonin function in itself, such as the macrophage theory and the neurogenesis theory.  I would say they go hand in hand:  We know that inflammatory response is elevated in depression, and it could be considered to be very much like sick behavior symptomatically with apathy, lethargy, and all the things that come along with it.  Relating the macrophage theory to neurogenesis is simply noting that glucocorticoids which are increased in the hyper-immune state stunt neoronal development in the hippocampus.  This has been seen in anxiety where stress causes overall reduction in hippocampal volume and a disinhibition of the amygdala, further reinforcing anxious tendencies.  I do not believe there has been conclusive evidence as to how an SSRI would effect this system overall, but I would say the evidence points towards a net-benefit to neurogenesis.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it seams pretty sloppy almost unethical to use the  blanket term &quot;anti-depressants&quot; instead of something more specific when seriously discussing medical side effect. Like saying &quot;antibiotics&quot; or &quot;painkillers&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This article is not from a peer-reviewed journal, and is ridiculous.   Their line about how their &quot;summary supports&quot; their conclusion is a rather interesting standard for vetting hypotheses.  It's rather unscientific:</p>
<p>Step 1:  hypothesize
Step 2: commence echo chamber and toot ones own horn.<br />
Step 3: conclude that the hypothesis matches the conclusion.<br />
Step 4: call it science.  </p>
<p>The meaningful mechanism of action of SSRIs is that the upregulation of serotonin leads to an increase of BDNF and other neurotrophic peptides (proteins that improve cell functioning and stimulate down stream neurogenesis).  Population-based studies show that people with depression average smaller hippocampal volumes (a key neuro-structure in the lambic system).   When successfully treated for depression-- whether it is with SSRIs or with talk therapy or even with ECT, that area (the hippocampus) shows regrowth.   The articles supposition that &quot;perturbing&quot; serotonin is bad, is ridiculous.   Having a good (or even a bad) conversation with someone will &quot;perturb&quot; your serotonin.   The brain is made to react to the environment.   </p>
<p>SSRIs are extremely safe and tolerable when used correctly.  (This doesn't mean they are without any risk).  They can be extremely helpful, and even life-changing for some.   On the other hand, the effects of depression can be absolutely devastating to some people's lives.  Any &quot;study&quot; that doesn't consider the risk/benefit ratio, or provides some objective statistics (look particularly for number-needed-to-treat/harm stats) it's generally no worth its weight in hot air.  </p>
<p>To answer your question, there is no evidence that SSRIs have long term adverse neurological effects on those who take the medication.  In fact the evidence strongly suggests that SSRIs are beneficial to the brain.   Note:   Some SSRIs have been linked to  some problems en-utero when used during certain trimesters.  though, Again I'm not aware of any studies that suggest there are adverse neurological effects to the fetus.   Also keep in mind, that given the severe consequences of depression, including post-partum depression, in many cases it is advised to continue taking antidepressants through pregnancy.  </p>
<p>If your concerned,  talked to a doctor.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phrase &quot;there is no evidence&quot; is misleading. It suggests appropriate research has been done. There is no evidence because the research hasn't been done. </p>
<p>But if you understand brain plasticity you'd understand that a medium to long term drug mediated change would almost inevitably induce downstream changes. Whether those changes are bad or good remains to be seen. But from a neuropharm standpoint, of course they will cause changes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose an air of finality about the term &quot;there is no evidence&quot; can be construed.  It wasn't intended in that manner, nor was it intended as hubris.   Tone doesn't convey well over the internet.   </p>
<p>I will argue that the statement is rather precise, and that any misconstruance is easily rectified by taking the statement literally.   </p>
<p>Your point hints at a major blind spot of science.   Science is great at commenting upon observable phenomena, but can't comment on that which is unseen (or-not-yet-seen).   For people unfamiliar with science, they can take a statement of &quot;there is no evidence for&quot; as synonymous as &quot;the evidence does not support&quot; or &quot;the evidence contradicts&quot;  ... but again, these statements are very specific, and you may notice  I used such statements carefully, so as to not overstate any of the evidence.   (In contrast to the linked article whose statements are entirely disassociated from the evidence).   In fact, I probably understated the evidence.  So science can be fairly certain about positive phenomenon, but it can never completely assuage fears about the existence of latent phenomenon. (Thus the purpose of stage 4 studies).   That's how tort lawyers and conspiracy theorists make a living--capitalizing on the ambivalence created in the wake of science.  </p>
<p>Along those lines, I am going to call you on your conclusion as to why there might be no evidence.   You said that it has not been looked into.   That is 1000% ridiculous.   (1000%= 100%, ten times over).  Your comment &quot;whether those changes are bad or good remains to be seen,&quot; attempts to amplify ambivalence, confusing noise for signal.   Changes that have been good are being &quot;seen&quot; as we speak.  Changes that are &quot;bad&quot; have not been seen. But we can never say they don't exist with science.   Science is positive.   </p>
<p>Finally I'm going to ignore the snipe about who understands plasticity more...  and increase the frame of reference.   The neuroplasticity of untreated depression is utterly devastating.   So just talking about the evidence regarding neuroplasticity, the risk/benefit ratio of taking SSRIs to counteract the detrimental effects of depression is overwhelmingly in the direction of benefit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a great summary of how antidepressants increase BDNF and other factors that improve neuroplasticity in depression:    </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3022308/#!po=20.6522" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3022308/#!po=20.6522</a></p>
<p>It doesn't specifically mention bupropion, but I believe the evidence is showing that BDNF is a common pathway of all successful treatments of depression.   This includes psychotherapy, ECT, ketamine, turmeric (yes herbs too), etc.</p>
<p>In fact I just learned that ketamine accesses BDNF via an alternative pathway (through AMPA) that results in rapid (minutes-to-hours) increases in BDNF-- rather than weeks with traditional antidepressants (it requires gene up-regulation through CREB).   </p>
<p>Here's an article that describes this:
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/doi/10.1093/ijnp/pyv112/2910075/3-Deoxyadenosine-Cordycepin-Produces-a-Rapid-and" target="_blank">https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/doi/10.1093/ijnp/pyv112/2910075/3-Deoxyadenosine-Cordycepin-Produces-a-Rapid-and</a></p>
<p>Bupropion tends to have both rapid effects (increased energy and drive-- though sometimes anxiety as well) that are probably related to dopamine and NE reuptake inhibition, but the complete antidepressant effects still take a few weeks.   I imagine it's a similar pathway to SSRIs.  (Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine all regulate each other). </p>
<p>This article actually mentions bupropion and BDNF: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1300345" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/1300345</a></p>
<p>This one does too,  and shows how complex this science is:</p>
