			<div class="markdown"><p>How is this the top answer, is not even slightly correct.</p>
<p>Firstly, the wind doesn't need to cancel the sound, only dampen it to the point of it not being clear.</p>
<p>Secondly, sound and wind are not two constant forces in exact opposition to each other.  They are at varying angles, of varying strengths and in varying phase to each other.</p>
<p>The reality is that the wind noise plays a major part in not hearing things, mostly because it's loud, but also because it's a fairly wide spread of different frequencies, but the wind speed, direction and wave pay a role too, one which could be enough on its own to obscure the sound enough to make it difficult to hear </p>
<p>Wind can also change the direction of a sound, so those down wind can hear well because the sound is being channeled towards them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think OP meant if it's ever the case that the wind makes it physically impossible for the sound to travel to the listener's auditory organ, but I agree with the rest you said</p></div>		</li>

<p>The only way for your words to be completely &quot;blown away&quot; would be for the wind to be moving at the speed of sound (about 767 mph). </p>

<p>so that bit is false</p>

<p>Since you'd be dead if you were exposed to winds of that speed,</p>

<p>that bit is true but not really relevent</p>

<p>it's just the wind noise drowning the sound out. </p>

<p>that bit is false</p>
<p>so all of his comment that is relevant to the question is factually incorrect which he points out, how is he agreeing with him?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further elaborate:
Sound is energy being transferred from molecule to molecule through a medium (air, water, etc.), kind of similar to heat. A voice is a vocal tract vibrating, transferring energy to the surrounding air molecules, producing sound waves. These sound waves are vibrating air molecules that inevitably end up in someone else's ears, and are then picked up by sensory hairs in their ear canal.
A wind can indeed displace these vibrating air molecules, thus dissipating the effect of the sound waves, since fewer vibrating molecules reach the ear canal.
So yes, a strong wind should be able to &quot;mute&quot; a person relative to someone else standing in the wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, you know it's not the same vibrating air molecules that leave a speaker or person's mouth that travel to a person's ear?</p>
<p>Rather, the vibrating air molecules pass the effect on to neighbouring molecules, which has a chaining effect like a compression wave traveling down a slinky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sound propagates differently depending on the wind direction. The ground dampens the noise, and the wind direction from the source determines how much of an impact the ground has.</p>
<p>In downwind condition, the sound refracts towards the ground in a more grazing angle, minimising the ground effect.</p>
<p>In upwind condition, the sound gets a more direct angle of approach towards the ground. Increasing the damping effects.</p>
<p>Depending on the wind speed profile, and also temperature differences, the sound could also be refracted upwards (especially common in upwind), away from the receiver.</p>
<p>Source: I work with outdoor acoustics and wrote my thesis on this subject.</p></div>		</li>
