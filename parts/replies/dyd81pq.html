			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer, and it is the only way flat (meaning straight, not counting roughness) surfaces could be achieved before interferometry.</p>
<p>And even now the same principle is used, and on the highest metrological level flatness is realized using 3 reference plates, which are measured with an interferometer and rotated to compensate for errors with a symmetry. From these measurements you get a height-error map for each surface.</p>
<p>Once you have a flat reference surface, you can build machines using it as a reference, and derive basically everything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amateur astronomers have been hand grinding their own telescope mirrors to better than 1/4 to 1/20 of the wavelength of light since the 1920's.  This is a level of accuracy of better than 30 nm / one-millionth of an inch.</p>
<p>Basically you start with a flat piece of glass for your mirror and a second one for grinding or you can make a grinding tool with plaster and tile.  By sliding one over the other with successively finer abrasive grits you'll naturally get a concave, spherical surface.</p>
<p>Eventually you switch to polishing techniques and then you figure the mirror to change the spherical surface to a parabola.  Finally you have the finished surface coated and you're done.</p>
<p>Hand made mirrors are often much better quality than ones made with machines.  While it was common for people to make their own mirrors a few decades ago, it's far less common today.</p>
