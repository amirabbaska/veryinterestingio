			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html#sunenergymass" target="_blank">this page</a> the mass loss is 4.4 billion kg per second!  Of course, the sun weighs about 2 x 10^30 kg so that number isn't going to affect it really.  In a billion years, the total mass loss is around .007 % of the sun's total mass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But what's even crazier is that the bigger stars have the shortest lifespans, counter-intuitive to how one would expect a larger mass to take longer to be used up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite true! However, towards the end of the lives of stars like our Sun, they will end of ejecting huge amounts of material from the outer layers into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_wind" target="_blank">stellar winds</a>, that can often end up being significant fractions of the mass of the star in a really short amount of time (thousands or tens of thousands of years, which is cosmologically an incredibly short amount). The end result are beautiful yet poorly named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nebula" target="_blank">planetary nebulae</a>. So over the main portion of the Sun's life, it will lose about the amount of mass that you provided, but when it enters the end stages it will go out quite incredibly!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or is that insignificant compared to the mass lost, simply because there's not that much space dust left in the general area?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The solar wind provides outward pressure as does the light radiation from the Sun. So the picture looks something kind of like <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/ibexheliosphererevised.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. That is, in the general vicinity of the primary solar system, the motion of particles will be outward until they hit the heliosphere region. Of course, it will accrete some material by chance but when you're really close to the surface of the Sun, the particle/radiation flux will be higher, as a consequence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">inverse square law</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question! Since they are both positively charged, two protons have to overcome the electrostatic force (the &quot;Coulomb barrier&quot;) before they get close enough that the strong nuclear force will dominate. In terms of energy, it looks something like the left image <a href="http://sdsu-physics.org/physics197/p197_images/p197_classicalquantum.gif" target="_blank">here</a>. A particle has some kinetic energy and you can imagine that when it has a lot of kinetic energy, it will reach over the peak of that potential energy barrier and end up in that well; the well is where the strong nuclear force dominates, and like a ball rolling up a hill and then into a pit, there's no reason for it to escape. However, this is not quite right because you actually need an enormous amount of kinetic energy to overcome that barrier height, and even though the core of the Sun is in the 15 million K range, that's still not really enough (yes, there is a distribution of temperatures, but still, the rates are too low). What happens is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">quantum tunneling</a> occurs, denoted by the right hand image, such that the particle is really a wave function with some probability everywhere, and there is some small probability for it to cross the barrier into the well. While it seems like that might never happen, there's a lot of mass in the core of the Sun. And if you work out the rates for that to happen, you get the right amount of energy generation as to what we observe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the sun is actually much cooler than the temperatures we need for useful nuclear fusion here on earth. The fusion output of the sun is something like 200 watts per cubic meter. This is a tiny amount of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what /u/themeaningofhaste said, I've read that even after you've broken through the Coulomb barrier, the probability of one of the protons undergoing positron emission is so low, that it is the deciding factor in the rate of fusion for the Sun. </p>
<p>After positron emission, the Helium-2 is quickly moved along the reaction chain, and rapidly fuses into Helium-4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, yes! I was thinking about that this morning but then forgot to put that into my reply. The reaction rates are kind of funny. The first step takes on order a billion years in the Sun (you can see the first calculations <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1952ApJ...116..649S" target="_blank">here</a>). The reason why we still get anything out of it is because there's just so much hydrogen in the Sun, so even if it takes a long time, there's enough that plenty of it will happen at any given time.</p></div>		</li>
