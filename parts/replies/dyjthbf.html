			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow I actually didn’t know they were a total rip off. </p>
<p>But not only of Lego, they are clearly infringing on Star Wars copyrights with that Millennium Falcon kit. </p>
<p>I’m actually more surprised that Disney’s legal team aren’t onto them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disney would like to be on them, but again, where is that legal case going to end up?  In China.  And the Chinese system isn't going to say <em>boo</em> to Lepin.</p>
<p>It's not worth Disney's time to sue any Chinese company.  Chinese companies have been making knockoff Disney products for decades now.  Disney doesn't pursue lawsuits because they don't work.</p>
<p>And now China is such a huge market for the American movie industry, pursuing any lawsuit could get them an injunction from the Chinese government against Disney's movies.  (And the government over there is <em>just that petty</em>.)  Again, not worth it to pursue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do the same with LEGO, and they are more than responsive. </p>
<p>I buy used sets from time to time, and LEGO is almost always happy to send me missing pieces for free, and where not free, at their rack cost. </p>
<p>They send sticker sheets without question, too. Provide instructions upon request, etc. etc. </p>
<p>LEGO is a solid brand that cares about their customers. Why fuck with that for a few dollars? </p></div>		</li>
