			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, wouldn't those cells be surrounding the teeth while in the gums? A bit harder to do that when the teeth are out. </p>
<p>There is work on regenerating the pulp of the tooth that I think should see clinical trials sometime this year (if it hasn't started already). That should help obviate the need for root canals, but would still require regular fillings for the enamel. </p>
<p>What I personally hope to see is the ability to locally induce new tooth growth from (injected?) stem cells that could replace damaged teeth entirely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That hard tissue would be the enamel and the soft innards would be the dentin. The ameloblasts do indeed die because they are pushed out of the gums as they create enamel, where they die and basically fall off. Odontoblasts, on the other hand, stay inside the tooth and can continue to create new dentin if the existing dentin is damaged.</p>
<p>The enamel coating/dentin core structure give teeth hardness and flexibility. A tooth made entirely of enamel would be too brittle and one made entirely of dentin would be too soft.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I poisoned myself with machine shop chemicals. My teeth began turning grey. The dentin was dying. </p>
<p>I was advised to eat 1/2 bar of chocolate and 1 shot of vodka per week, and in a few months, they began to regain their natural color.</p>
<p>This is not standard treatment, but the alcohol is a solvent for the chemicals, and chocolate bonded with it and removed it from my body. </p>
<p>Not sure if it was a treatment for me, but it did work.</p>
<p>Partway through the process I stopped, and the grey returned. I kept on the second time for about 6 mos, and that did the trick for good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re remembering it correctly. Odontoblasts can still lay down secondary dentin when there is stimulation to do so. So if you have a cavity near the pulp, or constant cold challenge, etc. This is why when you look at a radiograph of an older person, generally their pulp (nerve) looks smaller on each tooth. It’s better to think about the fact that they have more dentin to insulate the nerve.</p></div>		</li>
