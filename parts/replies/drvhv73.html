			<div class="markdown"><p>That's damned impressive.</p>
<p>What's scary impressive to me is a gorilla could have walked up to that bar and 1-hand lifted it if it cared to. No training, no steroids, just ridiculously strong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those powerlifting squats are extremely egregious, if you look at raw squats in the larger feds they will more resemble your &quot;pretty&quot; Weightlifting squats, especially training and not comp lifts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are multi-ply squats. Very different from a raw squat. Although weightlifters often squat high bar and deeper than necessary, a true raw powerlifting squat looks more like a ‘regular’ back squat than a multi-ply squat.  </p></div>		</li>
