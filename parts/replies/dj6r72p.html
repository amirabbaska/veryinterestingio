			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also a theory that the first form of hunting humans became proficient at was chasing animals till they overheated and collapsed.</p>
<p>The average speed of a jogging person is just past the point where most prey animals can no longer pant and run, causing the animal being chased to die between a half hour to two hours of exhaustion or overheating.</p>
<p>This theory also helps explain why humans lost most of their hair (to allow our sweat to cool us better while running) as well as why we are such good endurance runners compared to the rest of the animal kingdom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never heard that, also never really looked into it lol, but I can believe it.  When one of my dogs would escape I could jog behind them...keeping them in sight.  I'd get close, they'd sprint off.  A few iterations of this and they'd lay down tired and I would be able to pick them up and take back.</p>
<p>I was still in the military at the time and actually in shape...not sure it would work now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's more than just a theory, there are videos on YouTube where people in African tribes use this techniques and hunt animals this way.</p>
<p>Edit: yeah 'more than a theory' is incorrect, but oh well.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had meant to say that the theory mainly is about why humans changed so drastically over a relatively short time, I understand that the hunting tactic is still used today. </p>
<p>But the theory is that endurance running shaped our entire current form of homo-sapien.</p></div>		</li>
