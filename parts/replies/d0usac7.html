<p>&quot;We live in a very special time. The only one where we can observationally verify that we live in a very special time&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lawrence Krauss is by far my favorite astrophysicist. He's funny and informative. He doesn't dumb it down too much to keep those with a higher understanding challenged but good enough to educate those just learning. </p>
<p>He's going to be speaking at the reason really in dc this summer too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imo, he deserves much more exposure than he gets, more than NDT, though he isn't as marketable as Dr. Tyson. Professor Kraus is a legit scientist, some 300 papers published as well as being Foundation Professor at ASU. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that we can observe. Which is part of the reason the universe is considered to be infinite; it is homogeneous and isotropic, and everything we observe appears to be just as central as we are. Nothing suggests that heading in any particular direction would lead you towards an edge or center of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we don't posit there are infinite galaxies, do we? I feel the infiniteness of the universe is commensurate with the observation of an <em>apparent</em> edge. But which I mean, half your sky is filled with galaxies and half is just black. Your observable universe is still a perfectly spherical event horizon of which you are the center, it's just that your sky isn't evenly filled.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, imagine an observable universe with only two galaxies, which (if I'm correct in remembering Krauss's talk about the heat death of the universe) will probably happen on the way to the isolation of every galaxy due to spacetime expansion. </p>
<p>Edit: the reason I bring this up is that I think a lot of people end up talking past each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The latest observations suggest the universe is flat, ie it doesn't appear that space is curved.  We know this because if you measure the angles of a triangle they add up to 180 degrees on a flat surface.  But if you draw a triangle on a curved surface, like a ball, the angles will add up to more than 180 degrees.  Or less than 180 degrees if you do the measurement on the inside surface.  </p>
<p>Astronomers have measured the angles of a triangle the size of the observable universe and they add up to 180 degress.  This <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2012/07/shape-600x429.jpg" target="_blank">diagram</a> shows how it was done.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the implications of this is that the universe is flat and therefore just goes on forever into infinity.  So you'd never reach a galaxy that only had emptiness on the other side  of it.  You'd just keep finding more and more galaxies no matter how far you travelled.</p>
<p>However, it could be the angles DO add up to 180 degrees if you measure a bigger triangle.  But since its impossible for us to fit a larger triangle into the observable universe, we may never know for sure what we're dealing with.</p></div>		</li>
