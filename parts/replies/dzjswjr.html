Would you get HCl if you suddenly heated seawater regardless of the mechanism (say with metal heated to a similar temperature as lava)? Would you get different chemicals depending on the temperature?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HCL can be made by electrolyzing salt water. It's the energy that makes the reaction happen. I've never heard of quenching in salt water making HCL steam (I make knives as a hobby) but that may be because there isn't as much thermal mass in a knife blade as there is in thousands of tons of lava. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metal would melt before lava. The temp is considerable lower. Glowing red hot metal is below 1000f. lava being mostly silica and at flowing viscosity is well above 1800f and closer to 2300f. Typical soda lime glass with fluxes in does not flow until around 1550f.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As someone who hopes to get his little knife forge up and running one of these days, I'd certainly *hope* not...  \\^_\\^;;;;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you could get HCl if you boiled sea water to dryness and then kept heating. The important chemical that people have mentioned for HCl production is MgCl2, which decomposes to MgO and HCl above 415 degrees C (the H and O come from MgCl2 usually being present as a hydrate, MgCl2•nH2O). The suddenness of heating isn’t important except that heat disperses over time and there’s a whole ocean involved. </p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165237011000349" target="_blank">here</a> for a paper on MgCl2 decomp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely not. Lava always contains some sulfur compounds, with and without oxygen. Also, very few pure metals can get that hot and still be solid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/qeveren 's answer is great.  A relevant paper with some details that clear up some of the questions here:</p>
<p>Edmonds, M. and T. M. Gerlach, &quot;The airborne lava-seawater interaction plume at Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i&quot;, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2006.02.005" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2006.02.005</a> </p>
<p>Seawater has many different salt ions in it, and the paper shows that the heat causes water to react with the ocean's <em>magnesium</em> salts specifically, with reactions like:</p>
<pre><code>MgCl2 + 2 H2O --&gt; Mg(OH)2 + 2 HCl

MgCl2 + H2O --&gt; MgO + 2 HCl</code></pre>
<p>(I've simplified these.)</p>
<p>Re /u/talkinbollox 's point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This suggests that it’s not the chemistry of the lava but the seawater</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yes, according to this paper the chemistry is entirely in the heating of seawater, so it will work with any heat source.  In fact the paper talks about historical experiments that were trying to figure out the chemistry of seawater by heating it up, and HCl was produced causing all sorts of problems.  But it only happens if you completely boil away the liquid.</p>
<p>/u/gamblinman2 asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens to the sodium and oxygen?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, the sodium doesn't really participate.  The <em>magnesium</em> ions turn into oxidized magnesium minerals like Mg(OH)2 and MgO.  Why magnesium and not sodium?  Because the sodium version produces lye (NaOH): it dissolves easily in water and will neutralize the hydrochloric acid and you're back to salt water.  But magnesium oxide and hydroxide aren't very soluble in water, so you end up with hydrochloric acid and little solid particles of magnesium minerals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might get an exchange of Na with Ca in the lava/minerals (eg plagioclase and clinopyroxene). Hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust at mid ocean ridges often includes the formation of more sodic minerals, due to interaction with sea water. </p></div>		</li>
