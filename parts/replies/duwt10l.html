			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very insightful and thought-out answer, but I have a question that arose from it. What about animals who are aware of impending danger? For example, an animal that knows to avoid a high drop or animals knowing to avoid other animals that are dangerous?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure &quot;fear of death&quot; is sufficient for &quot;awareness of mortality&quot;. It's <em>a component</em> of mortality, of course. But when we talk about mortality, we're usually referring to the idea that we know death is inevitable and that this understanding is reflected in our decisions and behaviors. </p>
<p>We know elephants revisit locations where family/herd members died, for example, and react to the presence of elephant bones. Are they pondering their own death? Or just habitually looking for the lost herd member? Or reacting to the recurrence of bad memories of the death event? </p>
<p>I mean, I don't think we can know, unless or until we see a behavior that unequivocally implies that they are aware of or planning for their own eventual death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What sort of behaviours qualify as unequivocally implying or planning for ones own eventual death? Do humans always perform these behaviours? How can we tell if these behaviours are outliers in human populations or intrinsic to human death experiences? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's interesting is that animals often display low amounts of fear in the face of death. Prey animals go into flight, but they often display quite a bit of neutrality as they die.<br />
Compare it to nervousness... When an animal suffers or gets nervous from disturbances, then they're not really neutral or cool about it. However if you grant them a decent expression of flight and then death, they don't express much nervousness or that kind of agitation we'd maybe define as negative. You could kind of call it &quot;Animals don't seem that bothered by death&quot;...  </p>
<p>This is part of my research and how I formulate it. I also use it to define how much torment humans perceive and how to comparatively grade it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're making an assumption here. OP asked if animals are aware of their mortality and nothing else, which simply means are they aware of the possibility of their death. You're right that my example does not cover the question of whether they know death is inevitable or not, but there is actually a lot of research done in the realm of certain species understanding what death is at least to some extent.</p>
<p>Edit: Changed understand to understanding</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the reason animals aren't flinging themselves off cliffs or running full speed into a herd of enemies (at least...most of the time) is because of instinct (or, in others cases, some type of basic learning capacity).  It is difficult for a human to imagine what this might &quot;feel like&quot;, because our own experience is so utterly inextricable from our systems of language, concept formation, and rational thought.  When we see a large bear in the woods, we <em>feel</em> fear and exercise caution instinctively, but this is <em>paired</em> with the previously mentioned faculties of the human mind to create our full human-like experience of the situation.  What would it feel like to be in that situation <em>without</em> those extra faculties (or with non-human faculties that are completely foreign to us)?  Who knows...but even if someone did have that experience, we still couldn't use that to make any definitive statements about what a non-human animal might feel in that same situation (for all the reasons stated in the original comment).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While technically true that we cannot know what any other animal, human or otherwise, experiences (is my &quot;red&quot; the same as yours?), we can make some good guesses based on what natural science has deduced about how brains work and which parts of the brain we share with other animals.</p>
<p>It is pretty likely a cat feels the same fear I would feel when I see a wild bear atracking me. The emotion and the body response is created by old parts of the brain that we share biologically. I have a conscience, so I can also observe myself in that situation (if my reptile brain does not take over completely), but otherwise the experience is certainly very similar.</p>
<p>So, please don't say we cannot deduce anything about the animal experience. Otherwise I agree, mortality is a pretty abstract high-level concept, I doubt that any animal possesses it other than humans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are your thoughts on genetic knowledge? It's kind of a buzzword, but is it possible that knowledge itself can be transmitted during reproduction, as opposed to just the capacity to learn and retain knowledge? Migratory insects have always confused me. How do monarch butterflies know exactly where to travel if no one is there to teach them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually not true, though. The reason animals aren't flinging themselves off of cliffs or running into herds of predators is actually a combination of instinct and learned behavior. An instinct, by definition, is &quot;an innate, typically fixed pattern of behavior in animals in response to certain stimuli.&quot; It is true that it is instinctual to be cautious because of that &quot;feeling of fight or flight&quot;, but it took a few people flinging themselves off of cliffs and not coming back before we recognized that the cautious feeling we get due to the uncertainty of jumping off a cliff is because it's not safe for us to do so. That's a learned behavior. Your bear story is an even better example, actually. We &quot;feel fear&quot; when we see a bear because we are taught to do so. A infant does not know that it should fear a bear, much like a wolf pup does not understand it should fear a bear until taught to so. We like to say &quot;feeling it in your gut&quot; is being instinctual, but the truth is that an instinct is simply a non-learned behavior that a species automatically takes part in from birth. We instinctually eat, breath, poop, pee, and various other things, but understanding which species to fear or what activities are dangerous are not instincts at all. The best way I can put it is it's instinctual to fear in general, but it's not instinctual to fear specific activities or beings. Therefore, a dog fearing something that can kill it is one of the strongest arguments that it is at least somewhat aware of death, in that it doesn't like things that can cause it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a behavior that can just evolve as an instinct, if we assume instincts can be hereditary (which I guess is reasonable, because different species have different instincts): Individuals who are willing run off cliffs are less likely to live long enough to reproduce. Those who avoid running off cliffs are more likely to reproduce. Therefore, the instinct to run off cliffs dies out and the one to avoid running off cliffs becomes common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're using an archaic view of &quot;instinct&quot; created by a predominately religious society that assumes animals by definition are non-sentient. An instinct, by definition, is &quot;an innate, typically fixed pattern of behavior in animals in response to certain stimuli.&quot; It's a learned behavior that jumping off of a cliff may kill you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a safari one time and noticed a distinct lack of lion bones/skulls. Some places are riddled with bones/skulls of buffalo, wildebeest, zebras, etc. My guide told me that lions will wander off on their own to die in the bush. Which explains why on almost 20 safaris I have never seen (or possibly noticed) any big cat skulls. </p>
<p>I agree with you that I don't think they know what death means. I just think they know something is wrong and that their bodies are not responding like they are accustomed to. They might find it difficult to even keep up with their pride. So they wander off away from the group and pass away. </p>
<p>edit: Before my statement about safaris sounds silly (who can cover the entirety of parks in East Africa in a few safaris?) I simply mean that you see bones, remains, sometimes only partially decomposed bodies of other animals all of the time. Just never one of a lion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of animals do that, my assumption was always that they did this not because they wanted privacy or something, but like you said, they recognize they are vulnerable and may hide to protect themselves if they know they cannot fight or escape to otherwise protect themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, yeah - that's behavior that could be very valuable if the animal has some hope of survival. Being secluded and protected gives you a much better chance of getting over a virus, say. </p>
<p>It'd almost be the opposite, I think: an acceptance of mortality would mean that an animal becomes more careless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I did just a cursory search after my post and it appeared to be the general consensus the animals are seeking safety in their vulnerability. Another response concerning the wild was also that a weak/dying one could encourage attacks from other predators and put their pack/pride/group in danger as well. </p>
<p>I suppose the easiest answer that I didn't think of prior to your response is that I see those bones because they <em>are</em> prey. So most likely killed out in the open by a predator. It absolutely makes sense, even for the other ones who die naturally, to hide away and seek safety while they can. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So this why my cat never learns that eating certain things results in her feeling quite ill.  Very frustrating as a human, since it is glaringly obvious.</p></div>		</li>
