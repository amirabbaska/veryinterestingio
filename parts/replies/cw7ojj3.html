			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not total mass but density that determines if there is a region in which gravity is so great light cannot escape. In theory you can make microscopic black holes, but they would evaporate very quickly. There was [a silly debunked fringe] concern that firing up the LHC would create a black hole that instead of evaporating quickly would swallow mass and begin to feed until it swallowed the planet.</p>
<p>EDIT: language on LHC statement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was no actual concern that the LHC would create a black hole that would swallow the planet. There are higher energy collisions in our upper atmosphere all the time, so if those collisions were going to destroy the planet they would have done so already.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually it would EXPLODE (if Hawking is right and nothing stops it). A ten ton black hole would be incredibly microscopic (a billion times smaller than a proton) and would evaporate in less than a tenth of a millisecond. That's ten tons of matter converted to pure energy in the blink of an eye: i.e. a &gt;200,000 Megaton explosion.<br />
In theory, every large black hole will eventually evaporate down to that size and do that.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p>Edit: Updated the size and time having checked the numbers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation#Black_hole_evaporation" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah so it shrinks very slowly with a large mass, but the rate speeds up as its mass goes down,  until it eventually reaches an exponential rate of energy being emitted such that it explodes/rapidly reduces to nothing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>....yes. But there will come a point where the cosmic background will be redshifted beyond the temperature of the black hole. That's when it will start to shrink.</p>

<p>Should note that this is really, really, really far in the future.  Like many orders of magnitude longer than the current age of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't actually escape -- the theory is that at quantum scales, a particle and its antiparticle can spontaneously appear.  However virtually every single time they just smash into each other and disappear again.  But, when that happens right along the event horizon, one particle will be in the inside of the event horizon and the other on the outside.  So one particle will be able to escape, creating hawking radiation, while the other antiparticle falls into the black hole singularity, theoretically cancelling out some particle in the black hole thus reducing its mass.</p></div>		</li>
