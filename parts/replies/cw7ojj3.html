<p>(for stellar mass black holes, the predicted temperature is much lower than that of the cosmic background, so are unobservable)</p>

<p>If that's true, wouldn't they forever be absorbing more radiation than they emit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>....yes. But there will come a point where the cosmic background will be redshifted beyond the temperature of the black hole. That's when it will start to shrink.</p>
<p>Now we are <em>really</em> talking without supporting data ;)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Should note that this is really, really, really far in the future.  Like many orders of magnitude longer than the current age of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How does the radiation escape? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't actually escape -- the theory is that at quantum scales, a particle and its antiparticle can spontaneously appear.  However virtually every single time they just smash into each other and disappear again.  But, when that happens right along the event horizon, one particle will be in the inside of the event horizon and the other on the outside.  So one particle will be able to escape, creating hawking radiation, while the other antiparticle falls into the black hole singularity, theoretically cancelling out some particle in the black hole thus reducing its mass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How does Hawking Radiation cancel out/reduce the blackhole's mass?</p></div>		</li>
