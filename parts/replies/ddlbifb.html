			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I agree. It has to do with being able to hire your own lawyer to argue your case for you. Public defenders will just make you settle and have you processed as fast as possible. </p>
<p>There was a case where a woman who got a traffic ticket for driving while operating a device(google glass back when it was &quot;cool&quot;). She hired a layer and went to trial and got her ticket thrown out because they can't prove that the device is actually on. She probably paid a couple grand to resolve a $200 ticket. When you're poor or &quot;middle class&quot;, you would just pay the $200 ticket and take the admission of guilt and get points deducted in your license. </p>
<p>Edit: I got a ticket for running a stop sign I knew I didn't do. Cuz I stopped at the stop sign, change the song on Spotify and returned a text and then I went. But I'm just going to pay the $160 ticket and be done with it. </p></div>		</li>
