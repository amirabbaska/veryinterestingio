<p>Oh, I knew about relativistic mass, it just never clicked for me that this was the reason why subatomic particle interactions would suddenly act differently if there was more energy in the interaction. I just never considered there could be enough energy that gravity would have any effect on the interactions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought only particles with mass had gravity. A photon has no mass. What happens with high energy photons?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is affected by momentum, which photons have. And we know photons are affected by gravity by measuring the positions of stars as the pass behind a solar eclipse (for visibility) and found they were in different positions than when the sun was not bending the light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy actually exhibits gravitational mass under special relativity. It's why black holes distort the light that passes near them (gravitational lensing). This is part of mass-energy equivalence. </p>
<p>The concept of mass breaks from intuition when relativistic effects come into play. The relativistic mass of an object is not the same as the mass of a resting object that you're intuitively familiar with. </p>
<p>The relativistic dispersion relation </p>
<pre><code>E^2=(mc^2)^2+(pc)^2 </code></pre>
<p>defines the relationship between the rest mass, momentum, and energy of a system. When the system is a photon the rest mass m is zero, dropping the first term, but the momentum term remains. Hence, </p>
<pre><code>E=pc</code></pre>
<p>If our system is an object at rest, the momentum term drops and we're left with the more familiar</p>
<pre><code>E=mc^2</code></pre>
<p>Comparing a photon and a mass at rest, we can then see that, under special relativity, a photon of momentum p has the gravitational effect of a rest mass m= p/c. Note that this doesn't mean that a photon itself has &quot;mass&quot; in the usual sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is a result of energy. Mass is simply a very efficient 'configuration' of energy. An atomic bomb converts it into the energy we are more accustomed to, very little mass is needed to create a huge explosion.</p>
<p>A good example of this is a spring; if you compress a spring it gains energy, and if you weigh the spring it turns out to be slightly heavier than before. All mass is energy, but not all energy is in the form of mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, gravity is related to mass.</p>
<p>E=mc^2</p>
<p>c is a constant.  So that means as E (engery) goes up m (mass) goes up.</p></div>		</li>
