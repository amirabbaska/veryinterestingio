			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a Vietnam story once, where the drill sergeant demonstrated that you could hit C4 with a hammer, then demonstrated you could light it on fire, and it would be safe. Some guy went home on leave, showed his friends you could light it on fire, and then hit it with a hammer. Apparently the order matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TNT is actually hard to set off. Just hitting it with a hammer will not do it.  There is an inverse relation between the yield of an explosive and its sensitivity. With nitroglycerin as an exception. I have taken small pieces of RDX (another high explosive) and actually placed them on concrete and hit them with a hammer. Nothing. Likewise lighting them on fire will not set them off. We once disposed of old dynamite by burning it. Since dynamite has nitroglycerin, we hid behind a dirt berm and triggered the fire remotely.</p>
<p>Now wiring up the blasting caps is the risky part. Those have gone off from static discharges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The series Lost taught me the exact opposite, that Dynamite is highly unstable. Maybe it's unstable when it's old? </p></div>		</li>

<p>TNT is tri-nitrotoluene.
Dynamite is stabilized nitroglycerin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. When it is old, like sitting for a year or more, the nitroglycerine 'sweats out'. You will find it pooling in the bottom of the wrappers it was packaged in. That is why we were burning it. It had started to 'sweat'. There were little beads already forming. That liquid nitro is what is touchy. What Alfred Nobel invented was that when nitroglycerine is absorbed into a carrier (many different things are used) it greatly reduces the sensitivity of it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is, in theory, quite safe, it's still being hit by a guy with a hammer in the Alamagordo desert in summer. </p>
<p>I don't think I'd ever be comfortable enough with the science to do that experiment. There's 100 tons; what percent is old batches or slid through quality assurance or something?</p></div>		</li>
