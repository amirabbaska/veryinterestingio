			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I thought about trying to answer the exact question but then quickly realized that this would take waaay too much time and may not be feasible unless you do a lot of approximations. But it's a very good question so I didn't want it to be left without an answer of any kind so let me try to say how you'd go about figuring out the answer.</p>
<p>As /u/mfb- said, you want to consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor#Electromagnetic_stress.E2.80.93energy_tensor" target="_blank">electromagnetic stress-energy tensor</a>. This tells you everything about how energy and momentum flows in your spacetime and if you click the link and keep clicking links, you'll see that basically it depends on your E and B fields, which is probably what one would expect. But it involves a lot of different pieces of the E and B fields that are built into that 4x4 matrix. So once you figure all of that out, you need to plug that into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations#Mathematical_form" target="_blank">Einstein Field Equations</a>. I've written about this a bit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/50l4g7/how_precisely_is_it_possible_to_measure_spacetime/d75cz4d/" target="_blank">before</a> but in short, the left hand side of that equation describes the geometry of your spacetime and the right hand side is just the stress energy tensor times some constants. But one side influences the other and then vice versa so really this is a whole bunch of differential equations (4x4=16 but really there are 10 unique ones due to symmetries). Because of these interactions, you end up with some pretty nonlinear equations in these cases, described a bit more by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations_in_curved_spacetime" target="_blank">Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime</a>, which is about what you'd expect by taking already complicated equations and making them more complicated.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, let's say you do manage to solve the Einstein Field Equations. Well, now you have to discuss observability. Different experiments measure different types of gravitational effects. The lowest-order approximations can be written in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_post-Newtonian_formalism#Accuracy_from_experimental_tests" target="_blank">Parameterized Post-Newtonian formalism</a> and you can see where a lot of different experiments have come into play to help constrain how accurate General Relativity is, but you can also take this as some rough approximation on how well you can measure various effects (above the noise, basically). There are other experiments not listed here, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B" target="_blank">frame-dragging by Gravity Probe B</a> or various gravitational wave experiments, though the latter are going to be incredibly insensitive to any kinds of miniscule effects.</p>
<p>So, to sum it up... it's really complicated. But if someone else would like to figure it out, I'm all for seeing the work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current density is not directly related to energy density (or any other component of the stress-energy tensor), but the contribution will be orders of magnitude smaller than the contribution from the cable. Let's use a 1 mm diameter cable with 1 MA. We get <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=mu_0+*+1+MA+%2F+%28pi+mm%29" target="_blank">400 Tesla</a> directly around the cable, corresponding to <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+%28400+T%29^2+%2F+mu_0" target="_blank">6*10^10 J/m^3</a> - or <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%2F2+%28400+T%29^2+%2F+%28mu_0+c^2%29" target="_blank">7*10^(-7) kg/m^3</a> - that is a good vacuum, a factor 2 million thinner than air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I often hear that electromagnetic forces are much stronger than gravitational effects (like the mass vs charge of the electron, or even proton). Why does it seem to be the opposite in this case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We compare the energy density of electromagnetic fields to the energy density of matter here. For a fair comparison of the two interaction strengths we would have to compare the energy density of the gravitational field. For a 1 g object with a 1 mm radius, the surface acceleration is a = 7*10^(-8) m/s^2, corresponding to an energy density of a^2/G = 7*10^(-5) J/m^3 or 15 orders of magnitude lower than the electromagnetic energy density.</p>
<p>In addition, the 1 MA cable is mainly electrically neutral. If you would keep only its positive charges or only its negative charges, the electric field strength would be extremely high, leading to even higher energy densities. But that arrangement would immediately explode - because the electromagnetic interaction is so much stronger than gravity.</p></div>		</li>
