			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading forever ago that when they built the Panama Canal that one issue they had to overcome was the fact that Pacific was higher than the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Now, the Arctic Ocean connects both bodies of water, if you even want to call the Oceans &quot;separate&quot; bodies of water, as, like I say, they are all connected.</p>
<p>Why aren't those levels all the same? I was honestly curious about this, like, does the Pacific &quot;bunch up&quot; on it's eastern side? While on its western side it's as low as the Atlantic is on its west side? I'm just throwing that out there.</p>
<p>I didn't know if anyone was aware of a reason for this. As it seems odd that it would just be more voluminous for no reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’ve never cared to ask the question but now that’s it’s been asked... I really want to know</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can't possibly be an issue they encountered. The Panama canal is two separate channels with locks. The locks raise and lower the boats so they can get over the land in between. The water used to fill the locks comes from Lake Victoria (IIRC) which is in the middle. The canal isn't just a trench they dug from one end to the other. Dealing with moving boats up and down is literally the problem it solved, so it can't have been a problem if the oceans weren't level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do they have locks like that? <em>Because</em> of the fact the oceans are higher on one side than the other. The way it was designed was definitely, at least partly, to solve the very problem I was mentioning. I learned about the difference in a documentary about the Canal.</p>
<p>Here's a source that came from the Google search I just did. <a href="http://www.psmsl.org/train_and_info/faqs/" target="_blank">http://www.psmsl.org/train_and_info/faqs/</a></p>
<p>To quote it, &quot;Sea level is about 20 cm higher on the Pacific side than the Atlantic due to the water being less dense on the Pacific side, on average, and due to the prevailing weather and ocean conditions. Such sea level differences are common across many short sections of land dividing ocean basins.&quot;</p>
<p>Which, in seconds I proved that I was right and answered my own question. It's because of the density of the water. Fun times.</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify, as at first I thought you were arguing that the oceans were the same height, but I concede that the locks were put in place not <em>only</em> because of the discrepancy in sea level height but for other reasons as well. Since the Pacific is higher it meant that they couldn't just put in a &quot;trench&quot;, like you put it, because, among other things, there would be a current constantly flowing towards the Atlantic. I don't know how powerful it would have been, nor what kind of issue that would have caused if there was, but it would have been something each ship that used it would be constantly fighting against, not to mention the ecological issues it might have caused, as you populate the area with massive amounts of Pacific based flora and fauna.</p>
<p>To be as clear as I can, the lock based system the Panama Canal used overcame the issue I was initially talking about and was absolutely implemented, in some part, due to the ocean levels being different. I'm sure it solved other, maybe even more important, issues in the process but one was definitely, without question, the sea levels being different.</p></div>		</li>

<li>What is that nontrivial degree?</li>
<li>Does anything have an absolute 0 angle of response? I imagine water is slightly above zero because of surface tension. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The tidal range is the difference between high and low tide, and depending on where you're talking about, it can be up to fifteen meters. In the open ocean, it's more like half a meter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I imagine water is slightly above zero because of surface tension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly. Surface tension affects the edges of the water to a limited degree. With angle of repose, you're looking for a consistent angle -- the same angle when you've got 1kg of material as when you've got 100kg. (Assuming that's enough of the material to form a pile.)</p></div>		</li>
