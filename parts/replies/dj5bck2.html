<p>I got a major cyst from an ingrown hair.
It was on the top of my balding head. It got to be the size of a half dollar, with a head the size of a dime. It would not pop. The fluid was too thick for a needle to relieve the pressure, and it got to the point that even touching it was excruciating.
I finally went to a Stat care. He stuck a needle straight down into it to dull the pain, then lanced that sucker.
Luckily he put on one of those plastic &quot;welders masks&quot; like devices, because that thing erupted and shot across the room, deflecting off his mask and hitting the wall, where the reddish brown fluid the consistency of snot ran down the wall.
He packed the gaping hole in my head with gauze, leaving a wick out to drip the continuing river of puss that went on for 2 days. I wore a bandanna and a baseball cap into my office with my boss's permission. When people asked, I asked if they wanted to see the worst case scenario of an ingrown hair. No one said yes.
Once I finally took out the gauze a few days later I found a four inch long hair coiled into a 1/4 inch diameter coil. I yanked that thing out and it never grew back. Sorry (thankfully) no pics since this was back in the flip phone days and I didn't even have a phone then.
I have a nice scar from the ordeal.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tmi: had one of these near my groin. A little smaller - about the size of a nickle. I had to get excused from school and work. it didn't leave a scar but if you touch the area there's a pretty deep indent with skin over it where the ingrown hair used to be. Pleh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the location. Some are nigh unnoticeable while others either itch or even hurt. I find the coiled ones most frequently on my hips at the elastic underwear lines and they're mostly the itch variety (and scratching them usually frees them «sproing»).</p></div>		</li>
