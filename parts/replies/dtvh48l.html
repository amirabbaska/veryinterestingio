You don't need to apply any sort of learning to it, so much as &quot;monitor value, adjust available inputs as required to maintain value within acceptable range&quot; really, really fast. And yes, that value can be monitoring the fluctuation in heat earlier in the chain, to adjust the strength of the magnet several feet up to prevent plasma from escaping.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not not so sure. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep25890" target="_blank">Fast machine-learning has been demonstrated in creating and sustaining Bose-Einstein condensate</a>. PID works reasonably well in simple processes. But a closed-loop set point based system is still limited. Handcrafting an algorithm to control complex systems is very time consuming. Machine-learning AI could in theory learn to predict plasma movements from cues haven't seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! This is exactly what I've been trying to say. Thank you! I'm also glad to see demonstrations of AI helping create and sustain Bose-Einstein condensate. If anything, I'm now more convinced that this could work in nuclear fusion!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you can see the advantage of machine learning there though, It's possible to program the machine to do exactly that but being able to predict exactly what action will cause what effect with relation to highly sensitive almost chaotic variables would be a challenge for a human</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep repeating this and variants of it at work. It's hopeless. &quot;AI&quot; is just the new fad word for &quot;cool advancement in technology&quot; now. Machine learning techniques are powerful tools for a lot of data-driven problems, but it's not some sort of one-size-fits-all replacement for general computing. You don't need an AI to print &quot;hello world,&quot; yet the buzz would make you think that DNNs are the first thing that should be taught before printf() or WriteLine().</p>
<p>In a few years, this will doubtlessly switch to quantum computing, and we'll spend another era trying to explain that you don't need probabity-based operations to add two numbers. Meanwhile, the most important improvements will continue to be really fast computers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AI is a fad in the sense that many companies like to throw it around to get VC funding nowadays, even if it brings about no major advantages, because it IS the current trend. I understand that it's not a one-size-fits-all replacement for general computing, and I'm also well aware that quantum computer is relevant for different kinds of problems that classical computing isn't very good for. Now, what I'm arguing and what I'm interested in knowing is whether it's possible to use a data-driven approach using supervised or unsupervised learning to solve a problem that would otherwise be too complicated to solve otherwise. AI is generally good at making predictive models, and for nuclear reactors, it seems logical that a good predictive model would help us design a more stable reactor core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of the macroscopic goings-on in a fusion reaction is that they're very well modeled by classical approaches that can rely on classical computing to predict. There's not a probabilistic &quot;if the temperature on this hemisphere increases, there's a small chance the field might distort that way,&quot; but rather a &quot;if the temperature goes up, you're definitely about to observe something happen, and you better do something really fast if you don't want it to destabilize.&quot; Making very fast decisions and changes based on very fast measurements is the linchpin, not making informed decisions across large data sets.</p>
<p>I'm a computer guy and not a physics guy, though, so if there's something a lot more nuanced and complicated going on, I could be off my rocker. I've just never heard that this is a problem in need of ML/AI approaches--and it's frustrating that we're trying to apply it to everything under the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or maybe even some analog stuff. Feed the analog sensor data to some filter circuit, that output a control signal that is fed back into the magnetic field generator.</p>
<p>I don't know how it work at all, but I assume that they mostly have many coils, each affecting a specific region. Let's think of a pie... If one slice get too long then a sensor can mesure that and send a spike to the electromagnet to push more on it and voila, back to it's shape. Should be doable even in 3 dimentions.</p>
<p>Of course, a computer may be easier... </p></div>		</li>
