<p>I also want to point out that gender dysphoria is not a &quot;replacement&quot;. It's a completely different thing. Wanting to express gender differently is not the same as feeling unhappy with one's own gender. It's also not necessarily related to &quot;biological sex&quot;, either (genitals and hormones =/= gender)-- although gender assignment at birth and subsequently being forced into a gender role and expression is part of the problem. In general, gender dysphoria is about experiencing extreme unhappiness with the ability to present, perform, experience, (etc) gender in a way that feels good and true to the individual. And if one considers why they are not able to do those things, by (for example) pathologizing the individuals, the it's easy to conclude that the result of the dysphoria is not due to being trans, but because of society. So, it makes sense that the DSM had to change that to address a common aspect of trans the trans experience, rather than being trans itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Conditions and disorders provide a way to classify and explain phenomena in human behavior. If changing the classification and explanation doesn't change the described behavior, the new condition is replacing the old condition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth pointing out that the DSM is a provisional guide to diagnosis and treatment. It is a clinical reference, not an authority. That is, doctors use their best judgement and training above all because disease and disorder ultimately don't abide by rules in a book. Things like transgenderism, homosexuality, and psychopathy find their way in and out of the DSM depending on how patients present and get treated, so it represents a catalog of current clinical practices rather than mental illnesses in general.</p></div>		</li>
