			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you want to add 1J of heat to your home via direct heating, you have to provide all of that yourself plus a little extra for efficiency losses. Efficiency is always <em>less</em> than 1.</p>
<p>However, to transfer 1J out of (or into: see heat pumps) your home, you can use much less than 1J of work to do that, depending on the temperature difference between inside and outside (and of course, efficiency). AC can have efficiency <em>greater</em> than 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat pumps can definitely exceed 100% efficiency. They produce heat from the work of compressing a fluid <em>and</em> from extracting the additional heat from the environment. They are basically air conditioners mounted so the heat is extracted from the outside and dumped inside. </p>
<p>No laws of physics are violated..the extra heat that causes it to be over 100% is the heat it extracts from outside. </p>
<p>I don't understand jaredjeya's comment that an air conditioner is greater efficiency than 1, unless he's talking about using it as a heater. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For A/C to have an efficiency greater than 1, wouldn't the outside air have to be cooler than the inside air? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that you use, say, 0.1J to transfer 1J of energy out of your house. That way we say it has an efficiency of 10.</p>
<p>The theoretical maximum efficiency is highest when the temperatures inside and outside are very similar, and gets lower as the temperature difference increases. If it were colder outside you wouldn't even need AC to cool the house down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well your right in saying that for heating efficiency is less than 1. However in electronic systems heat is usually considered a loss as electric current naturally wants to produce current. This means that an electric heater has an efficiency so close to 1 that it's pointless to call it anything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that it's the theoretical maximum. It's not that AC is closer to 1, it can go <em>above</em> one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  More than just being a new technology, it's just more difficult to understand.  Everyone can get their minds around burning something for heat.  Understanding how to make a room colder is much more difficult.  I'm sure there is a named fallacy for assuming that just because something is more difficult to understand means that it must be more difficult to do.</p>
<p>So people figure that A/C <em>must</em> cost more energy than heating because it is more difficult to grasp.</p></div>		</li>
