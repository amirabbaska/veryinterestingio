			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the top post is not really giving the answer to the question I'll chip in. I already did answer a similar question once but don't feel like looking for it. So here - a quick re-cap.</p>
<p><strong>WW1</strong></p>
<p>Before WW1 Germany was the second most industrialized nation in the world, behind only the US and ahead of Britain. In the war the frontlines never entered Germany to any significant extent, even in 1918 and when Germany surrendered there was never any physical destruction to German industry and their losses were proportional to what the allies suffered. While they were burdened with immense reparations they did not pay them to any major degree, had international help (Dawes plan) and used debasing of currency (Weimar inflation) to help themselves along. What this meant was that when Hitler took power Germany already stopped paying reparations and he faced a <em>financial</em> problem but not an <em>economic</em> one because the  factories and workers were all there and Germany lost nothing of its excellent knowledge base. So all in all despite losing the war they were exactly in the same position relative to France, Britain and Russia shortly before WW2. In a relative sense it was as if WW1 never happened and Germany just had to build some tanks and airplanes.</p>
<p><strong>WW2</strong></p>
<p>An important fact to know is that Germany in WW2 was relatively <em>weaker</em> compared to Germany in WW1. In WW1 Germany attacked with massive forces on two fronts simultaneously and maintained constant involvement throughout the war. In WW2 they only started doing it in 1941 against the USSR. Germany lost battle of Britain because it couldn't break British air defenses and outproduce Britain to any significant degree - that's a major weakness. Germany won against France only by sheer happenstance - France despite having superior ground forces was completely unprepared for a completely new war within 20 years time - and got itself surrounded like in 1870. In Russia a very reasonable theory suggests that Hitler simply surprised Soviet forces which were both poorly managed <em>and slowly preparing for an invasion themselves</em>. Compared to WW1 where Germany fought on two fronts in a major capacity in WW2 there was only one front at any given time until 1944 and Germany was losing within <em>one year</em> of starting the war in Russia. So it is pretty obvious that in pure economic terms  it was <em>in WW1</em> that Germany was better prepared for fighting a major war than in WW2. It wasn't really the strength of Germany itself as the  new, highly mobile style of combat that made WW2 so different. If you look at the production rates then it is painfully obvious that Germany had often trouble matching British rates of production and was far behind American efficiency (partly because unlike the Allies it did <em>not</em> mobilize for war until 1944 IIRC). While Allies invaded Europe in 1944 with a thoroughly modern and motorized army Germany had extensive use of horses and old artillery! </p>
<p><strong>Post-WW2</strong></p>
<p>After WW2 Germany was treated very differently from the Versailles era. First of all nobody bothered with reparations in financial terms. Instead the Soviets took <em>everything they could</em> from their occupation zone physically destroying the already ruined cities and factories of Eastern Germany. The Western Allies however - this time too dependent on US both militarily and economically to protest - did it differently. The US and its allies saw  rebuilding Europe economically as key to stability and peace - as opposed to exacting collective justice. After some initial military occupation they re-formed a new German state (FRG) without any compensatory burdens and even with some small help from the Marshall plan (which was however not all that significant to recovery in Germany - contrary to popular opinion). The western occupation zones in Germany suffered less because once the Allies broke the winter offensive in early 1945 they just rode in with little to no resistance (and therefore destruction). The carpet bombings in 1943 and 1944 were destructive (especially in Hamburg and Dresden) but not nearly enough to throw Germany back to stone age. More importantly while factories and buildings were ruined Western Germany <em>kept its skilled workforce and technology</em> which meant that once the people were allowed to go back to work it would go much more smoothly than in the now-communist East.  As a matter of fact it was military command imposing  rationing and price controls that suppressed German recovery for the first 4 years. The Wirtschaftswunder started in 1949 with relatively liberal Ludwig Erhardt at the helm of Germany's economy. That meant that not only Germany did not embark on any major nationalization programs (Like Britain) straight away, or started introducing socialism on a full scale (Like Sweden) but even reverted to a more functional mode of christian-democratic economic model with an existing welfare net - compared to  bureaucratic, highly centralized Nazi model of industrial production. Because of external politics and suspicions of communist infiltration the CDU/CSU stayed in power until 1969 which also meant that there was no major change in policy over the years. When Willy Brandt took over Germany had already two decades of growth and people were sufficiently set in their ways that he didn't really change too much internally and instead focused on international politics - especially relations with East Germany.  SPD only ruled for over a decade compared to two decades of CDU/CSU and then in early 1980 CDU/CSU took over again with Helmut Kohl as chancellor.</p>
<p>The other key factor was very limited military spending within NATO. While other countries did spend significant amounts of money on armies and expensive strategic programs such as nuclear weapons and their delivery (France and Britain) Germany kept a token navy, moderate air force and only its land army was anything comparable to other Nato countries. That meant that Germany was saving a fairly crucial couple of % of GDP each year which went into the civilian economy consistently over three decades - the 50s, 60s and the 70s. I do not have to explain the benefits of compound interest....</p>
<p>Did I mention that the EEC was formed in 1957 which meant that whenever someone built an expensive tank the common market made it easier for Germany to sell them a cheaper car or a washing machine? One of the major points of the EEC were industrial tariffs. Without them Germany had a much easier time selling its industrial products to the rest of Europe</p>
<p>A third factor is typically neglected but it's just as important - it was monetary stability. The new German Mark was easily the most stable currency on the continent, behind Swiss Franc. After US cut Dollar from gold the Mark became <em>the most</em> stable major currency. This meant that Germany in the late 80s was the only European country on the trajectory to catch up with the US in terms of wealth.... until the unification. Americans are typically being taught Keynesian orthodoxy about government spending and monetary stimulus so that might sound to them like something out of a fantasy novel but in reality the key to economic growth is ability to realize capital investments - not generate growth in bulk by injecting easy credit into the economy. That increases GDP figures but often causes <em>real</em> capital to stagnate because all it does is propping up &quot;toxic&quot; assets.  In Germany that never happened and subsequent governments were very careful to perform all major adjustments in moderated steps so that German industry did not have to suffer surprising shocks until the 1970 oil (actually dollar) crisis. Long term stability makes capital-intensive plans to become more profitable (because the are financed by long-term loans) and that in turn makes them cheaper. Which is why for example Germany was able to maintain one of the lowest housing costs in Europe even <em>before</em> unification (coupled with existing stock in the East it barely felt the 2000s bubble!!!). But at the same time Germany currently has fewer tanks than Poland!</p>
<p>Well... that was longer than I anticipated.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>In WW1 Germany was the most powerful European country in terms of industry.  The post WW1 settlement was all about money and not about factories and resources.  </p>
<p>In WW2 Germany was far less prepared for war than in WW1, they just had more luck initially and would lose if faced with real opposition because of how <em>unprepared</em> they were. </p>
<p>After WW2 Western Germany was considered key to post-war stability and was protected from retribution. In 1949 the new conservative government of Adenauer and Erhard put Germany on a balanced mix of free-market and welfare which lasted until social-democrat Willy Brandt took over <em>20 years later</em>! Germany didn't spend nearly as much on military matters only matching symbolically their share in NATO which allowed them to invest more in a productive civilian economy. They were also allowed to do this for <em>four decades</em> without major economic crises (save for the 70s) compared to only <em>two decades</em> between the World Wars and with <em>two serious economic crises in the meantime</em>. An important factor was monetary stability which meant that German economy was growing relatively undisturbed by devaluations, currency shocks and asset bubbles. Also the EEC which was created in 1957 helped German industry by getting rid of protective tariffs in Europe.</p>
<p>The post WW2 recovery of Germany (1949-1979) should be compared to the economic growth of Imperial Germany  (1870-1910) only without excessive military spending (hence the bonus decade). <strong>Germany in WW2 was just a bunch of well placed sucker punches which made Germany look stronger than it really was</strong>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small point, but you bring up something that a lot of people fail to realize.  The German army of World War I was vastly more badass than the German army of World War II.  The German army of World War II gets a lot of credit for its quick victories, but it had quick victories over poorly prepared opponents.  The German army of World War I was a massive beast that clashed directly with huge armies on two fronts at once, while at the same time propping up its various useless allies.  Relative to its time period, the German army of World War I was probably the most bad ass army since the Mongol army under Genghis Khan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Badass? What does it even mean? </p>
<p>If anything it was precisely the WW2 where &quot;badass&quot; played a role - Bismarck, Me-262, V1s and V2s, Tiger and Panther tanks, raids of Guderian and Rommel, the invasion of Crete. No sir the &quot;badass&quot; is precisely what you should call German military in WW2.</p>
<p>The problem is that &quot;badass&quot; doesn't win wars only gets you killed.
The German army in WW1 was <em>solid</em>. And the command - despite numerous flaws and conflicts - wasn't managed by an incompetent maniac but by the military which was preparing for war for years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they were so badass they reached a stalemate with France as well as with Russia, which they broke through not with a complete victory but a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk#Background" target="_blank">treaty</a> which, though advantageous, was thanks to a civil war that bogged down Russia.  If they were as badass as Genghis Khan, Germany should've taken all of continental Europe (e.g. France and Russia), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Khwarezmia_and_Eastern_Iran" target="_blank">destroyed a civilization on the way</a>, and should have been contemplating their Ottoman, Iran, and Pakistan invasion strategy at some point.  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Genghis_khan_empire_at_his_death.png" target="_blank">Here's</a> the Mongol Empire when Genghis died.  If you don't take out at least two major powers next to you (by yourself, by the way, not with the help of Austria-Hungary) in your first stage of foreign invasions - e.g. Khwarezmia and Jin, you can't be compared to the Mongols.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. It only became apparent in the face of a faster mode of operations of Heer and Luftwaffe. If the battle turned out the way France expected it to be then they were well prepared. France did nothing <em>but</em> prepare for war with Germany. But if you plan for a largely static war on the Belgian front you have absolutely no means to deal with mobile armoured push.</p>
<p>There were plenty of issues in the German army. Again it is only the degree to which they outmatched the French that we forget about it. Dunkirk was one such example.  The Panzer raid through Ardennes was also much more successful than expected and that led to numerous problems... Germany had done a similar thing back in september 1939 against Poland where thin defense lines alongside borders gave way immediately ... and yet they did not draw conclusions.</p>
<p>It's unfair to only look at everything that went wrong in the French army.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can recommend &quot;The German Genius: Europe's Third Renaissance, the Second Scientific Revolution, and the Twentieth Century&quot; by Peter Watson as well as &quot;Iron Kingdom: the Rise and Downfall of Prussia&quot; by Cristopher Clark . Both are pretty long and fact-heavy, but they are very interesting if you want to go deeper. To really understand (if that is possible) why it was Germany and what was the mindset of the people, you have to go further back than 1914 and start at the Thirty Years' War and its aftermath. Watson repeatedly points out key features of the &quot;German psyche/character&quot;: rationality, (protestant) work ethic, education as an end in itself with the goal to become a better, more complete human being, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism" target="_blank">romanticism</a> as a counterweight to rationality. Clark's book is very important, because he shows how the Germany that started WWI came about to be politically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You didn't ask me, but I have AN answer, probably useless but anyway. The &quot;best&quot; book that gives detailed and interesting information in a very comprehensible manner is &quot;von bismarck zu hitler&quot; by sebastian haffner. It is in german and I am having trouble finding a translation for it, I am not sure whether one exists. However if it does, go read it, it taught me almost anything I know about german history from pre WWI to WWII. </p>
<p>€dit: What makes it good is that it takes very close looks and so makes the stuff that was going on very lively. For example the way documents were faked pre WWI to provoke reactions and the role Bismarck played, the Preußen mentality that was inherited in the new &quot;germany&quot; and so on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some slight corrections if I may:</p>
<p>It wasn't just war weariness on the part of France and the UK by the mid to late 1930s, but more importantly the pitiful economic situations and the difficulty of convincing the respective populaces (and the national banks that lent money to the gov'ts) to spend so much of an already strained budget on military expansion for a war that may or may not come. One mustn't forget that elected officials could fall quickly, especially in France during this period. Check out the number of prime ministers between 1918 and 1940; it's nuts. If war didn't come, the new planes, tanks, ships, and assorted munitions would be more or less useless and each country out of a significant amount of its already shrunken budget. </p>
<p>And for the record the Germans didn't write the book on Blitzkrieg and tank warfare. Technically speaking, the FRENCH wrote the book (books, really), but their military establishment didn't take heed. Heinz Guderian, the famed German tank general, tactician and author of &quot;Achtung! Panzer&quot;, the treatise on tank warfare, readily admitted that he was influenced by the earlier work of the then relatively obscure Colonel Charles de Gaulle, &quot;Vers l'armée de métier&quot;. Further works, these on aeronautics in warfare, by Camille Rougeron and Didier Poulain were also quite revolutionary and influential on German tactics. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Errr, guderain also attributes the British, liddel hart and fuller as his main influences. And is a particularly unreliable source as he repeatedly alters his stories and tries to cover himself depending on who he's talking to. He was a great self promotor. He also wasn't the main proponent of armoured warfare in the inter war periods for the germans.
Thoma and Blomberg were some of the significant theorists for Germany and who guderian expanded ideas from. Both Blomberg and Thoma cite hart and fuller.</p>
<p>There's also the fact de Gaulle wrote his main proposition in 32, a year after liddel and 5 years after the British created a blitzkrieg test force in 1927. Whose results were well documented in Russia and Germany. In fact the book you cite adds another 2 years onto those dates. </p>
<p>-edit- also the French way of integrated armoured warfare was small groups of infantry tanks following an infantry advance, which is not blitzkrieg. The British theory was massed armoured groups for a quick advance, followed by inf. Which is blitzkrieg. Which is one of the contributing factors of why Frances very good tanks suffered so badly in the invasion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't specifically discussing tank warfare but rather the combined arms tactics of the Blitzkrieg (which was thoroughly explored in de Gaulle's book). I've read neither Hart nor Fuller so I can't comment too much on that, but a brief scan of the wiki articles (yeah I know, but I don't have the time to dedicate to a full exploration) seems to indicate that they focused on tank warfare and not combined operations. That said, there is an open debate on the origins of the Blitzkrieg being carried on by people that I assume are far more educated on the matter than of us, so I excuse myself from the discussion of the origins of the Blitzkrieg. My only real desire here was to dismiss the notion that it was a German invention. </p>
<p>Your point about the French way of fighting is irrelevant as de Gaulle's ideas were completely ignored by the high command. The tactics actually employed had nothing to do with his theories. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm kind of in a rush, but I'll give it a shot.</p>
<p>As WW2 is wrapping up, everyone knows two things: Western Europe has been supplanted by America and the USSR in terms of power, and the US and USSR are not going to remain allies after the Axis is gone. </p>
<p>Normally, this just means there'd be another war. But nuclear weapons change that. Now, there's a very real possibility that countries, or even all of humanity could be destroyed. Now, the stakes are so much higher than in they were before. In the past, if you lost you might have some territory annexed; now, if you lose then all of your people might be killed. </p>
<p>Clearly, an open war is too dangerous; the Americans and Soviets hate each other, but no one is willing to end the world over it. So what follows is a series of proxy wars and economic battling. The US and USSR fight and destabilize the allies of the opposite side in a bid to gain enough of an upper hand to be able to safely attack their enemy (or at least have enough power that retaliation is unthinkable). This also leads to each side supporting very...unsavory types, simply because they share a mutual enemy. The archetypical example is the US supporting &quot;freedom fighters&quot; in Afghanistan to fight the Soviets, only to turn around and wind up fighting in Afghanistan after the Cold War ended. This kind of thing happened a lot to each side. Whether these proxy wars and insurgent activities were worth it is pretty...questionable. They often times wound up doing more harm than good and destabilized entire regions of the globe, but at the same time, when the consequences of losing the war are potentially as bad as extinction, I can at least see why people considered it. </p>
<p>But to be brief, while the US and USSR started out as equals, as time went on the US and NATO pulled further and further ahead. Their economies were stronger, technology better, and people happier. By the end, the Soviet Union, despite having even more land than the US and a pretty big population only had an economy about 1/20th the size of the American one. They still had nuclear weapons so they couldn't be ignored, but that was about the only tool they had in their toolbox. Eventually, the Soviet Union collapsed under the pressure of trying to compete with the West, and broke up into a bunch of separate countries. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick clarification. I do not believe that the US and USSR started out as equals at the end of WWII. Almost 20 million russians were killed during WWII, about 15% of the Russian population. Most of western Russia was in ruins as Russians retreated from territory and later retook the country. In contrast, the U.S. was relatively untouched from the war incurring less than half a million deaths and its industrial base was never attacked. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties#USSR" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties#USSR</a></p>
<p>Even with these constraints on Russia, they were able to recruit several German scientists and purchase western equipment, such as the Rolls Royce Jet Engine from England. This allowed Russia to rapidly produce new technologies enabling intercontinental ballistic missles, jet fighters (the Mig killed hundreds of Americans during the Korean War), and fueled their space program allowing them to get to orbit, dock, and build a space station well before the US.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all really good, except I think that the end is somewhat incorrect. The USSR collapsed mostly because their economy was in dire straits. Up to 40% of their GDP went to military spending just to keep up with the US and NATO. As the country got poorer, the republics got fed up with just giving their money to a faraway Moscow and still seeing their quality of life deteriorate. People saw the quality of life in the West via TV when the majority of them could not even afford cars. People got fed up and demanded independence.</p>
<p>Ninja Edit: Oh, and there was an attempted coup (possible assassination attempt?) on Gorbachev in August 1991 that destabilized the govt and was the final nail in the coffin. Unlike most people think, the fall of the wall in 1989 was not the end of the USSR. It started in late 88 and ended in 91.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Marshall Plan poured so much money into rebuilding Western Europe that entrepreneurial ventures were backed with tons of American cash. Eventually within the span of the following decade, only one country in Europe was really as powerful as it once was, and that was the UK. While it lost most of its empire, its expenses were mounting up so much that it had to relinquish the empire eventually. The UK had the advantage of being off the continent so it was immune to land-based battles but was very susceptible to bombing. France also eventually pulled through although it was and is much weaker than the UK, due to poor leadership under CdG, the Algerian War, internal turmoil, and extensive damage from WWII, although the Marshall Plan helped to alleviate a lot of that.</p>
<p>However, how Germany rose to the cream of the crop after reunification because it had experienced what was known as the &quot;Economic Miracle&quot; or <em>Wirtschaftswunder</em>. See, with all the money poured into Germany, some German companies took the center stage in the world, most notably VW, Audi, Mercedes. Germany, according to Wiki (the rest is from my memories of a European History class I took) became nearly as wealthy as the UK and far more stable by the year 1957, the beginning of the European Common Market. This was aided by a brand new currency, American investment, and the leadership of Konrad Adenauer. Germany's economic power was greatly helped by the fact that it is the largest country in Western Europe, and the second largest in all of Europe after Russia. Germany was far more stable than France and the UK especially because it had no colonial empire to tend to and the West ensured that it would not fail again. Italy did alright in comparison, but there was a wealth disparity between the urban north and the rural south.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That got Germany back on their feet, and from that point the Germany culture of being pretty productive took over and built a strong economy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the ironies of The entire situation is that especially on the eve of world war 1, due to its large population, high level of industrialization, being located as the central hub of Europe, etc. Germany was poised to be THE big economic power in Europe. Even after the war, German industry and the country itself was not destroyed, so in the long run Germany still had a lot of things in its favor. The problem was that the Prussian military elite had a terminal case of inferiority complex and was in a constant state of rage that the rest of Europe was not giving them enough respect or honor or whatever. </p>
<p>Basically, if the militarist idiots in charge hadn't felt the need to prove what big baddies they were, Germany would have become the big massive power they dreamed of becoming. (To be fair Germany was far from being the only country with this issue leading up to WW1, but that is a different discussion.)</p></div>		</li>
