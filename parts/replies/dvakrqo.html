			<div class="markdown"><p>There are studies that show oscillating/rotating brushes (Oral B) being superior at cleaning to the vibration / sonic brushes (Sonicare). But the aesthetics of Sonicare are more appealing and their brushes are quieter and have better accessories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. My dentist recommended any power brush, but said they use a sonicare (and she said she only started using it a few years ago, was manual before that), and I happen to find one on clearance at Target, so I got it, and my wife thinks dentists only recommend a brand if they're getting paid by said brand. </p>
<p>Thanks for your thoughts. </p></div>		</li>
