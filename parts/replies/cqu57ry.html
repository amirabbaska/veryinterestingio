			<div class="markdown"><p>The post above messes up the units a fair bit, equating force and pressure, and energy and power:
The force needed to crush a human skull is about <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/game-of-thrones-exposed-the-science-of-skull-crushing" target="_blank">5000N</a> spread evenly across the side of the skull. My skull is about 20 cm by 20 cm when viewed from the side, giving a necessary pressure of 125000 N/m².
By the law of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure" target="_blank">Radiation pressure</a>, the maximal radiation pressure P that a light beam of intensity E can produce is P = E/c, yielding E = 3.747×10^13 W/m². Assuming your light source is a perfectly focused square of 1mx1m, and assuming a conversion efficiency of 10%, you would need p = 3.747×10^14 W to power your device (and a hell of a cooling setup). That is about 350 times the <a href="http://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_01_02.html" target="_blank">peak capacity of the US electricity fleet</a> and about 67 times <a href="http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=2&amp;pid=2&amp;aid=7&amp;cid=ww,&amp;syid=2008&amp;eyid=2012&amp;unit=MK" target="_blank">the world's total capacity</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, this isn't entirely correct either. As you pointed out, force and energy aren't the same thing. Crushing something requires energy more than it requires force which is why cars are designed to crush to absorb the energy of a crash rather than withstand the force of the crash. Therefore, we need to answer the energy question just as much as we need to answer the force question. I'll get to that in a second, but I'd like to talk about your analysis first.</p>
<p>In your analysis, you assume the light field is applied over a 1 m^2 area, but the pressure is applied over a 0.04 m^2 area. There is no good reason for this mismatch unless you want to assert it's impossible to focus this much light into 20 cm x 20 cm, but it is somehow fine to do it on 1 m x 1 m. If you apply the power to only the necessary area, your incident power requirement drops to only 1.49 TW (as calculated by your parent comment) which is a much more reasonable power to achieve. Today, the NIF can produce 500 TW pulses which they use to crush fuel to start nuclear fusion; clearly a much higher pressure than what would be required to crush a person. They have something more going for them though which I will get into more in a moment. There are also benchtop lasers that can produce TW-class pulses (some of which I've worked with), but head crushing is not a safety concern when using them.</p>
<p>The real problem with radiation pressure becomes applying enough energy through it. The NIF is very powerful, but it can't apply that power for very long. You'd have to apply that pressure over a distance of say 0.1 m to half-crush someone's head (I'd say half crushed is as good as fully crushed) requiring an energy of 0.149 TJ. Here the NIF falls far short of the goal. It can only do 1.85 MJ.</p>
<p>A few other nitpicky things before I get to the real answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Industrial lasers with wall-plug efficiency of well over 30% are available today. The NIF isn't nearly close to this efficient, but if you could get that kind of efficiency and keep some of the peak power capability, one would only need to store up 138000 kWh of energy (the consumption of about 12 average US homes for a year) and successfully deliver it through the laser system to achieve your goal of a half-crushed head.</p>
</li>
<li>If we operate under the assumption that the target head is covered in an absolutely perfect reflector that retroreflects all the incident light, then by Newton's 3rd law, all of our requirements are cut in half.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, there is no such thing as a perfect reflector (as far as I know at least) in the macro scale. There will always be some significant absorption and at these power levels, which means the target will be thermally damaged. In this case, things suddenly get a lot better for us optical head crushers, even if we don't let the human head get burned. Suppose we allowed for a metallic face mask to be in direct contact with the head, but otherwise free to move. We'd also make the face mask thick enough that the heat from the light wouldn't make it to the head. What we'd find is that it requires much, much less light to crush the head because as the light vapourized the top of the face mask, the vapour would apply significant recoil pressure to the mask. This pressure would be much, much higher than the radiation pressure alone. (Again this was alluded to by the parent comment) The confounding factor here is that the escaping mass would also tend to temporarily block some of the beam from hitting the mask, making this into a dynamic problem which would be quite difficult to simulate. People do this kind of stuff, but they are modelling a few hundred to a few thousand atoms; not a whole head.</p>
<p>Just as a note to those who are interested, there are people who can take multi-terawatt lasers and focus them down to a few hundred microns creating intensities well into the zettawatt/cm^2 regime; way, way more energy density than thermonuclear weapons; enough to distort the conventional laws of light-matter interaction. As a bonus, they get to use their laser for multiple experiments because while the power is very high, there is, once again, very little energy per pulse.</p></div>		</li>
