			<div class="markdown"><p>This is well put.  Nietzsche's whole project was the question of how do we move past Nihilism.  Existentialism is one such reaction and continuation of Nietzsche's general project, where instead of us locating meaning on the outside, it says every person creates their own meaning.  Freud went in a different direction, that is in a different  Nietzschean direction via Nietzsche's will to power, where he located meaning in our biological drives and the subconscious aspects of ourselves.  A lot of modern philosophy leans towards one way or the other in the continental tradition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In essence,</p>
<p>Nihilism = Nothing matters, purpose isn't real</p>
<p>Existentialism = There isn't one universal purpose, and whichever you pursue is up to you. But the purpose that you do choose to pursue is very real, it's just up to you to create it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice summary.  I'd also add that while folks often associate existentialism with Sartre and Camus, most consider the grandfathers of existentialism to be Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would throw Nietzsche in there too, though he was all over the place (which is what I like about him) so it is hard to pin him down with one label like &quot;proto-existentialist.&quot; Still, if I were making a reading list, I would throw some Nietzsche on there. <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> specifically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nietzsche is a tad more focused on society at large. There's certainly existential messages (reevaluate all values), but his overall project is focused on group mentality (in order to avoid nihilism and decadence), rather than individual finding meaning. </p>
<p>To be fair, Kierkegaard also discussed group dynamics a great deal, but in the end lines up a little more clearly on the individual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is accurate, but I've always read Nietzsche as someone who considers life to be a beautiful thing, which for me means neither existentialism nor nihilism applies. He's like a logical romantic or something. I think the removal of god and the language of christian morality doesn't inherently mean atheist nihilism nor existentialism. Furthermore I think even the mere adherence to either school of thought would undermine his core challenge to authority. But i'm rusty on him and haven't read it all, so I dunno. I'm mostly just glad you guys are talking about this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note that Sartre was greatly influenced by the work of Martin Heidegger, although Heidegger apparently thought little of Sartre.  Sartre's <em>Being and Nothingness</em> was named in homage to Heidegger's <em>Being and Time</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something inside me is always a little bothered by the idea that philosophies and schools of though have a single origin, not because i disagree or deny that, but only because i wonder is it not possible or likely people can just inherently have a set of values or moral compass or inherent beliefs that match the school, despite having never 'attended'.  We all live on the same planet, subject to similar variations of experiences, so why not individuals have similar residual imprinting resulting in like belief systems?</p></div>		</li>
