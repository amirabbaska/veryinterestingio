			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to piggyback your comment but maybe this will help someone.</p>
<p>I've had hormonal cystic acne on my back and shoulders and just accepted it as a fact of life for a long time, until sometime last year when it got significantly worse. It went from something that was kind of annoying to looking like a warzone on a volcanic wasteland, and was also incredibly painful. Decided I needed to figure that shit out because clearly skin is not supposed to be like that.</p>
<p>I identified two main triggers - one, a very stressful breakup, and two, I'd started drinking whey protein shakes because I was working out a lot. The stress was a not insignificant factor, but once I realised it was the whey - dairy - I eliminated all dairy from my diet. There were very obvious improvements right away, and at first I kind of figured that was the best I could do even though it wasn't 100% cured.</p>
<p>Eventually though, I wasn't satisfied that it was enough. I did a ton of research into WHY dairy would cause acne, and it seems like it's because it causes a spike in insulin and IGF-1 (insulin like growth factor), which in turn causes inflammation.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that I'm not diabetic, I'm actually quite health conscious and in shape, but I guessed that maybe I had some kind of sensitivity to insulin. So, as a test I started taking a low dose of metformin, an insulin-blunting drug primarily used to treat diabetes but also used to treat PCOS. It worked.</p>
<p>Obviously, different people will likely have different causes, and I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending people start taking drugs they weren't prescribed, but if you feel like you've tried everything else (I know I did), consider looking at your diet and cutting out dairy. I can't overstate enough how much it helped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eggs don't seem to trigger any problems for me at least, versus even a tiny amount of dairy. Also I can recommend hemp protein shakes as an alternative to whey - they're pricier and have less protein gram for gram, but I have no doubt that it's healthier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're not completely clueless. </p>
<p>Acne is defined as an androgen-dependent disease in that excess androgen will cause over synthesis of sebum, where as androgen deficiency (like a loss of receptor function) does not lead to acne. </p>
<p>Androgen receptors require two stimuli: 1) androgen binding and 2) depression of the metabolic transcription factor forkhead box O1A (FoxO1), which is the negative coregulator of the receptor.</p>
<p>FoxO1, in turn, is depressed by insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), the major growth hormone of puberty, that decreases continuously after but still plays an anabolic role in adulthood. </p>
<p>Some research has shown that serum levels o,f IGF-1, not serum androgen, correlate with acne. The evidence pointed to patients with Larron Syndrome (IGF-1 deficiency)  being acne free until being treated with the hormone, since as stated previously, it decreases Fox-O1 and also stimulates AR signal transduction by upregulating the amount and affinity of AR-activating ligands.</p>
<p>The article linked below also talks about Western diet being acne - unfriendly since foods such as refined carbohydrates, and milk and dairy products causes an increase of insulin secretion while the latter and excess protein intake also leads to increased serum IGF-1. All of which depresses serum Fox-O1,leading to acne proliferation. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the Western diet portion of your comment. </p>
<p>This is anecdotal, but I had acne fairly bad as a teenager and went through all sorts of treatments to treat it with varying success. </p>
<p>As an adult my acne has been minimal. I do, however, notice break outs when I eat cleanly (low sugar intake) and suddenly have a day or two where I'm eating a ton of sugary foods. </p>
<p>Makes me wish I would have had more self control as a teenager with what I ate. Maybe not eat that whole row of Oreos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have patients ask this all the time. Why isn't there a cure for acne/warts/eczema... the reason is simple. These diseases aren't life threatening, therefore there isn't the research money directed at curing them. Also there is a lot of money to be made constantly treating them so our current methods are an excellent business model. Accutane is an amazing option for severe acne, but you've gotta have an appointment every month to get it. Cryotherapy and bleomycin will eventually illicit the immune response needed to tame warts, but again he best course to treat is monthly visits. </p>
<p>Personally, we make enough money anyway, I would love it if I could just cure everyone that walked in. Hell, if I were the one to cure any of these diseases I would be a billionaire. I get plenty of patients who let me know they think it's a rip off that they have to come in so often and I don't argue with them, I just let them know the same thing I've just written. They try to negotiate not having to pay a copay at each visit, and I have to explain that I cannot do that. I have a contract with each insurance company and not collecting a copay is in violation of that contract.</p>
<p>I kind of got off topic, but I just want people to know that the majority of providers are on your side here. Of course there are the odd ones who push to bill for every thing they can, but I am hard pressed to think of many who share my profession that are like that. If you have bad acne please go see a dermatologist, we really do want to help prevent you from scarring. If you're afraid of accutane that's cool too- we can still find ways to treat you without that nuclear option. </p>
<p>If a dermatologist isn't an option then go to the store and buy a benzoyl peroxide or salicyclic acid wash and use it daily. It will help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should pay /r/skincareaddiction a visit. Washing your face more is not always the answer. This is a common misconception propagated by people that don't suffer from acne. Most of the facial cleansers you find in a drugstore are needlessly irritating, causing your skin's protective barrier to be upset and inflammatory.</p>
<p>Often people find that their skin improves when they treat their skin more gently and don't strip it constantly with harsh detergents</p>
<p>TL;DR overwashing your face is the equivalent of constantly scratching your itch. It might help temporarily, but what it needs is to be bothered less and left to heal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do it. Maybe there's some truth to what the person who responded below is saying, but I had terrible acne for years until I started washing my face and using a face cream when I wake up and just before bed. It's made a huge difference. </p>
<p>Edit: And apparently what they're saying is a myth that keeps being spread around.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From personal experience, find a good soap and stick with it for a month or two. It's not so much about how often but with what. I use CeraVe consistently and it's done wonders--I still get acne but it's rare, light, and definitely stress related.</p></div>		</li>
