			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, the people who are widely agreed to have caused 2008 operated completely (or at least almost completely) within the law. Everyone likes to talk about the crash like it was a massive one-off scam that just exploded suddenly, when really we should pay more attention to the even scarier fact that these people had spent many many years prior to the crash slowly de-regulating/loosening up the laws and restrictions on their industry before it was able to get as out of control as it did. Any for-profit business <em>should</em> do every single thing within it's legal rights to make money, and these massive firms all did just that. </p>
<p>What we should take away from 2008 is not 'banks are evil', it's that it has become way too easy for business to influence policy, and that needs to change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was because it was legal. Extremely risky, but legal. On top of that, the ones who did do something illegal were mostly offered settlements. And frankly the reason why they did was because if those people went to jail, it would probably do more harm to the economy then good. In a sense they became to big.</p></div>		</li>
