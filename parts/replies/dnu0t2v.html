			<div class="markdown"><p>Levantine and Saudi are likely more similar than you would think. I would say they are mutually intelligible, whereas Moroccan or Somali Arabic and the other dialects in MENA would be a bit more challenging to communicate. Shami and gulf dialects use the same roots but typically different prefixes and slang articles. Egyptian is even more slang oriented from a modern standard standpoint, but everyone understands it because of the media. However, dialects such as Moroccan or Somali that have a lot of other linguistic differences are because of the influence of other languages.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about Danish? As a swede I understand Norwegian pretty ok and regularly have conversations with a Norwegian, each of us speaking our own language. But I don't understand much Danish, on the other hand, when reading, I can't tell if it's written in Danish or Norwegian!</p>
<p>I think this is a good example of /u/bettinafairchild mentioned. If Scandinavians were still in a union, Danish and Norwegian would perhaps be considered dialects, but since they are separate countries, they are considered Languages. Perhaps they'd even be considered dialects of Swedish! ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a moroccan, it would be tough to call our dialect a proper language because it doesn’t have any rules. It’s literally just a spoken dialect that derives from arabic, french and some spanish. Everyone in arab countries study classical arab so it is somewhat the lingua franca.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arabic is a great example. There is Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) which is a version of Arabic based on classical Arabic but modernized and simplified for the current day. MSA is used in most media and formal speech in the Arabic world. Its also what is taught to westerners learning arabic. But just about every region has their own dialect. Countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia speak variants of MSA that are fairly easy for people who aren't native to the region to understand. Then you have countries like Morrocco which has some bastardized French/Arabic mashup that is completely bonkers and throws native Arabic speakers for a loop. And then you have the Arabic dialects spoken in SE Asia and Europe which also borrow words/phrases/pronunciation/grammar from a multitude of different languages. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the case with Zulu(from South Africa) and my native tongue Ndebele(Zimbabwe). There are differences in cadence, emphasis, pre- and suffixes and a few amusing word substitutions (the Ndebele word for pumpkin, &quot;thanga&quot;, for example, is the same as the Zulu word for thigh, and the word for &quot;burn&quot; in Ndebele , &quot;bhebha&quot;, means &quot;orgasm&quot;. A friend of mine tells a story of one time she forgot she was on the wrong side of the border and during a church discussion intended to say &quot;you must burn with Christ's fire&quot;, but used the Ndebele word).</p>
<p>The closeness of the languages isn't surprising considering the Ndebele rebelled against Shaka in the 1830s, less than two centuries ago.</p>
<p>What makes things confusing is that there is another closely related but very different linguistic/ethnic group called the Ndebele that resides in South Africa. They're a bit more well-known for their <a href="https://goo.gl/images/4AgbZU" target="_blank">geometric art and the tribal practice of women elongating their necks with brass rings</a>.</p></div>		</li>
