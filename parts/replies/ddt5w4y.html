			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. I wasn't actually aware of that, and it raises a few other questions. Does that mean that juvenile sharks have to do the same? They have to keep swimming from birth?</p>
<p>Life must be complicated if you can never stop swimming. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They do take breaks and they have been seen staying still on currents so they don't have to move. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There hasn't been much evidence collected on shark sleeping behaviors (I believe. I'm not in a field that studies animals though, so my information may be wrong/out of date). </p>
<p>A number of sharks have small muscles (spiracles) close to their eyes that helps to push water over their gills when stationary. On the great white, this is small enough to the point of usenessness. </p>
<p>Tracking the great whites has shown they do indeed stay still (likely to rest), sometimes for hours in gullies. Likely, they face into the current created dy the gully, allowing water to pass over their gills without their own movement. </p>

<p>Why couldn't we simulate this in aquarium to keep these great whites? Like, a stream of current like that water pool thingy with the current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that relates to horses at all, I believe what allows a horse to sleep standing are special ligaments in their knees. Something SeaBiscuit lacked or had weakened etc and that's why he laid down. Maybe only parts of horses' brains rest too but I've never heard that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, booked a road trip round Cali for the sole purpose of staying over in Monterey to finally get to see a great whites close up. </p>
<p>When we got there I found out they weren't having them in captivity that year. </p>
<p>Ranked alongside not pre booking Alcatraz tour 3 months in advance as I thought we'd get tickets on the day to getting there and having to settle for a boat trip around it.</p>
<p>Didn't see any great whites there either</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a huge bummer - I saw the first one they kept successfully a few years back and it was awesome!  It was only maybe 4 ft long but that was the most imposing fish I've ever seen, and I've done scuba dives around barracuda and black tips and lemons to 10'. Worth a trip back, whenever they hold another one. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you could tour the whole jail and island by yourself or with 1 tour guide and just you, it'd be way better. Going in a group setting is so lame though.</p></div>		</li>
