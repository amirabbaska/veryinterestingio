			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Regression to the mean&quot; is the right answer, but you're giving the wrong explanation.  You are making it sound like wealth is a <em>random walk</em>.  Like if you take a basketball team and look at their biggest win of the season, their next two wins will look worse.  The <em>fact</em> that there is no correlation between each game and the next is caused by randomness.  The fact that if you choose their <em>best</em> game of the season, the next two games look worse, is caused by <em>selection bias</em>: in fact, if you choose any two other games, the other two games will look worse, no matter when in the season they occur.  Regression to the mean is one way to describe this phenomenon, but maybe not the most insightful: you yourself find it more illuminating to frame it as a “fooled by randomness” phenomenon, which is quite correct.</p>
<p>A more illuminating example of “reversion to the mean” would be, not a basketball team over consecutive games, but basketball <em>players</em> over consecutive <em>generations</em>.  If you take a professional basketball player, you’re not unlikely to find that his sons were very strong high school or even college-level players, but not good enough to go pro; and those sons give him grandkids who, on average, aren’t really much better than your average basketball enthusiast. Why? Well, if you look at the <em>traits</em> that make good basketball players, you’ll find the exact same thing: the kids aren’t as tall, as strong, or as coordinated as their father… and the grandkids may not even be as tall, etc. as <em>their</em> fathers.  Is this because there is <em>no</em> correlation between how strong a father is and how strong his son is? No, of course not.  It’s just not a <em>1.0</em> correlation.  This is where mean reversion is an extremely powerful concept.  The height of any person is <em>partly</em> a result of his genes, and partly a result of random circumstances.  To be NBA-tall, you need to be lucky with your genes <em>and</em> lucky with other random factors affecting your height.  Even if you find a WNBA-tall wife, your kids are still going to be much shorter than you on average, because your unusual height is strong evidence that its not entirely genetic.  The kids can inherit your genetic luck, but not your environmental luck.  Likewise for strength, coordination, and the rest — even with your hypothetical WNBA wife, your kids aren’t going to be up to pro-ball standards, on average.  And if you prefer beautiful blondes to WNBA, your kids’ chances of going pro are that much worse.</p>
<p>The wealth thing is exactly the same, except we are looking at traits like IQ, patience, innovation, aggression, and risk-tolerance instead of the basketball-related traits. We aren’t fooled by randomness, <em>per se</em>: our belief that brilliant, patient, innovative, aggressive gamblers should have children with similar traits isn’t wrong unless we expect extreme versions of the trait to be maintained at the <em>same level</em> over successive generations, instead of reverting to the mean as individual luck is subtracted out from family genetic traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Everyone is assuming that it's due to the upbringing of the third generation, that they're inherently lazy, when money just gets split as each generation has kids and that the likelihood of each generation also being able to create fortunes being relatively similar to the rest of the population- very small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. So much this. The narratives people spin are nice, and might have some validity, but people tend to severely underestimate the role of chance in obtaining and retaining vast fortunes.</p></div>		</li>
