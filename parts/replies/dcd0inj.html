<p>So if your equations to model the universe produces infinite quantities, then you know something must be wrong. </p>
<p>Physicists are confident that the equations and physical variables (that describe the values that a set of particles and forces have, like their mass or energy for instance) they use are correct because they produce consistently accurate answers for real world phenomena when used individually but when they try to merge the equations together to describe how all those physical variables work together, infinities start popping up in the answers produced. </p>
<p>The key physical variable being used which is an assumption and not scientifically verified is the number of physical dimensions that forces can move through. We think it's 4 because we can see 4 dimensions (including time) but we don't have proof that there aren't more.</p>
<p>Hence String theorists, who have models that neatly describe mathematically how all the particles and forces we know of behave, but run into the problem explained above, discard that assumption of 4 dimensions and tried to do the maths using greater numbers of dimensions. They've found that the infinities disappear if you assume 10 dimensions (or indeed 26 and possibly some higher numbers). </p>
<p>They explain the extra dimensions being invisible to us as due to those dimensions being curved very very compactly upon themselves much like the other,  known dimensions were curved very very compactly upon themselves at the beginning of the universe. </p>
<p>There are other problems that arise from using more than 4 dimensions, but some physicists believe these issues may not be as intractable as the problem of mathematical infinities and more to do with a lack of knowledge than a fundamental barrier, although there hasn't been much luck solving those problems either yet.</p></div>		</li>
