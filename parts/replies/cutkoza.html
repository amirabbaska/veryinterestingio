			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the movement of the moon away from the Earth is dependent upon tidal force and tidal force diminishes as the moon moves away, won't they eventually reach equilibrium with the moon still in orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the force of gravity from the Moon on the Earth is not 1 µm/s^2 , that's the gravity differential across the Earth-Moon line. The Moon is making the Earth accelerate about 33 µm/s^2 . Maybe you just misspoke, I just wanted to point that out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the differential is what I was talking about. I could have said it in a more precise way. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best explanation of how the water moves to create the bulge. It's also interesting how the moon is moving away from Earth slowly o.O</p></div>		</li>
