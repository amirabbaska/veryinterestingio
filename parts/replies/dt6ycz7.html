<p>If I understand it correctly, the far end of the board moves forward after a delay affected by the speed of sound in that material... right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.</p>
<p>What propagates through the material? The pressure or force propagates along the material at the speed of sound, and eventually reaches the end of the board, which results in the board moving. If we were to see this in ultraslow motion we would see that the board is contracting and stretching elastically a tiny amount along the direction of the propagation of our push.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't confuse the electrons and the electric field and energy transfer. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen this question several times. Most people work under the assumption that the electrons actually move from the switch to the bulb, like tiny balls that need to make the their way to the bulb.</p>
<p>As you say, it is not the electrons, but the electromagnetic field the one that carries the energy in an electric circuit. It is a difficult concept to grasp when you are just starting to study electromagnetic field theory.</p></div>		</li>
