			<div class="markdown"><p>High (inflation%-interest%) does mean people prefer to spend over save.</p>
<p>If savings account is 3%, but it's 5% inflation, shit take it all out and buy real estate.  Because it's only shrinking as cash.  If inflation is 10% but interest is 20% then you've got no reason to panic-buy to get rid of the cash.</p>
<p>At some point, it's justifiable to just take out all your savings and throw a big party.  Because it won't be worth anything soon, so no loss.  But that point creeps up gradually, everyone else got the same idea and  a six-pack is $200.</p>
<p>The party is hyperbole, of course.  It would make more sense to buy gold or canned food or trade for USD at any rate you can get.  But again, by the point where it's undeniable that the money will soon be worthless, no food importer or gold/currency broker wants your local currency at all.</p>
<p>In fact the guy down the street growing tomatoes hardly wants the local currency, even in huge amounts, except the produce will rot if unsold.</p></div>		</li>
