			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a misconception that dark beers are purveyors of huge calorie counts. This is just untrue. Dark beers generally only offer about 20 more calories than a 'light' beer.
For example, Bud light = 146.67 calories per pint (16 oz)
Guinness = 167 calories per pint</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that color doesn't mean much in the context of craft beer calories. A light colored imperial IPA will have 2+x as many calories as a dark, but relatively low alcohol content, stout. Same thing applies to an imperial stout vs a relatively low alcohol IPA. Alcohol content is one of the biggest factors in calorie count, at least when you have to estimate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the darkness is a result of toasting grains, and more heavily  toasted grains produce a darker beer while adding no extra calories.  You can have dark lagers as well as light stouts.  The stout is almost always going to have more calories than the lager.</p>
<p>This actually means your 146.67 and 167 averages are respectively meaningless.  You should instead be comparing specific beers and potentially styles of beer.  </p>
<p>For instance, New Holland's Dragon's Milk barrel aged stout clocks in at 300 calories, over double your Bud Light figure.  Similarly, Cascade Brewery's Oblique coffee stout, a unique stout known for it's light golden color, is estimated at around 231 calories.</p>
<p>On the other side of the aisle, Guinness Black Lager, which isn't much less opaque than actual Guinness, is estimated at around 135 calories.</p>
<p>Just goes to show you really <del>can</del>can't judge a beer by its color.  However, some beers are <em>definitely</em> heavier in calories than others.  It's all about how much grain you use during the mash.</p>
<p>Edit:also, I should have specified American style stout, both English and Irish styles of stout will generally be lighter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with what Dude said above. More burger and fry bellies in US than anything. Also - try traveling around Europe. You see a ton of bicycles and public transportation. People walk and ride bikes everywhere resulting in better exercise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The transportation systems in the parts of Europe I have visited have been awesome.  I got off trains and walked to hotels or youth hostels.  Bikes get a separate lane from walkers <em>and</em> traffic in some areas.  Bikes get protected left turn lights.  Busses are frequent, run on time, and actually take you somewhere you want to be.</p>
<p>I think people in the US would like alternate travel routes, but everything is set up with a high degree of difficulty.  One must often <em>drive</em> to a bus or train station, bikes are not allowed on some public transportation and bike lanes are pretty much a joke, or a gamble.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Czech guy here. I wouldn't say it is only beer belly in the Czech Republic. More likely it is bread, dumpling, deep fried and in general bad eating habits bellies. Lots of carbs in diet and overeating with combination of beer. But I know tons of people who do not drink beer or drink only 2beers/month or so and still they have 'Beer belly'. I would say that beer belly is not even thing.</p></div>		</li>
