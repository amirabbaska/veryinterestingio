			<div class="markdown"><p>The MOAB, as it's name suggests, is an airburst, so it's exploding in the air towards the ground. That has more to do with its non mushroom shape than the amount of explosives. I worked with mortar systems and can tell you a lot of things that explode on the ground make mushroom clouds, but airburst stuff does not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if its relevant, but the moab id also a thermobaric weapon or fuel air bomb, so while it wheighs a lot its direct explosive yeild is less than straight He bombs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends of what they want to do. For hardened underground military targets, you actually want the bomb to penetrate into the ground before going off. These are so called 'hard targets'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a 10,000 foot air burst that has the cloud roll into a torus and mushroom shape. They didn't see the stem because they were directly under it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, it will. But they have to be pretty big.</p>

<p>No, it doesn't have to be pretty big. Any sudden burst of fire or slow burning explosion will produce a mushroom effect.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQWKWtL1aMM" target="_blank">Random video</a> from youtube illustrating this. Just look at any video with apaches firing hellfire missiles, you'll often see a small mushroom effect with even with the relatively small amount of explosives. </p></div>		</li>
