			<div class="markdown"><p>Tattoos are simply metallic paint beneath your skin that your body has a hard time to dissolve. The paint isn't pigments in the cells as freckles are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tattoos are placed in small packets of pigment under the epidermis, into the dermis, which is not shed in the same way as the outer layer of your skin. Your body forms small scar pockets around the pigments which anchors them in place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The daughter cells are exact copies of the parent cells unless of course there was a mutation or error in the DNA replication process. If this does occur though, then the body's immune system would attempt to destroy it before the cell has a chance to multiply further, or the daughter cell's DNA would have the error placed somewhere along the cellular functions and would either self-destruct or be destroyed by the immune system as well.</p>
<p>In short, daughter cells are exact copies of the parent cells 95% of the time, cause a process that occurs millions to trillions of times each day is going to have issues.</p>
<p>Also, No problem! I'm happy to help! :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer, thank you. But while we are here.... What about philosophically? What is the definitive answer to the question of whether or not you are the same person once your body has replaced every single existing cell with a daughter cell or copy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think, theoretically, you could with machines such as CRISPR for it alters the DNA in organisms, which helps to create Genetically Modified Organisms. The only problem with trying to reverse or stop this process would lead to your body's cells dying without being replenished, and that would leading to your rapid death due not being able to go through the body's necessary functions.</p>
<p>That is a great question though, and can only be truly answered as we look deeper into DNA</p></div>		</li>
