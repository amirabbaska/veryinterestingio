			<div class="markdown"><p>You're failing to answer your own question.</p>
<p>Conditional on the four genotypes being equally fit, allele frequency does not change across large populations because of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardy%E2%80%93Weinberg_principle#Derivation" target="_blank">simple mathematical principle</a>, not because of an extreme hypothetical where one is significantly less frequent than the other and may confer evolutionary disadvantages.</p>
<p>If random matching holds (which carries the additional assumption that no geographic factor exists), then <em>both</em> the allele frequency and the genotype distribution are fixed forever after 1 period, regardless of starting distribution.</p></div>		</li>
