			<div class="markdown"><p>Not drinking is absolutely to prevent sloshing/cramps. But then why do anything at all? It's probably mostly psychological/comfort.</p>
<p>It hydrates you a little bit, but particularly when you have a mouthguard in it removes the distraction of feeling like you need to spit out the buildup in your mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would take longer in that case, yeah. Though just like in your mouth and throat, you do have receptors inside your veins that measure water content which would start sending signals fairly quickly once you get an IV water infusion. </p>
<p>Don't underestimate your body's receptors, signaling molecules, and hormones. They're responsible for a LOT of what you're feeling at any given time and can have rather major influences considering how &quot;minor&quot; they might seem. </p>
<p>For example, your body's production of melatonin (sleepy hormone) is greatly suppressed in the presence of blue light wavelengths, to the point where a blue LED light shining on the back of your calf while trying to fall asleep will significantly lengthen the time it takes to fall asleep. That's why you fall asleep early when around a campfire (red-yellow wavelengths) but stay up all night at your computer (full-spectrum).</p>
<p>It's also why people get the &quot;munchies&quot; when they smoke weed just keep eating even after they're &quot;full&quot;. Because it has compounds in it that are close enough to the &quot;endocannabinoids&quot; your body naturally produces to signal hunger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why you feel like you’ve been quenching your thirst with something that is actually going to cause some lose of water. Alcoholic drinks can feel like they are helping replenish your thirst when they are actually going to have the opposite effect (depending on the ratio of other stuff to the alcohol). This potentially applies to caffeinated beverages as well.</p></div>		</li>
