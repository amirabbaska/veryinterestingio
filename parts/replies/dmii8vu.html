<p>The compression on the chest squeezes the heart, pushing some blood out of it. When the compression stops the change in pressure allows the blood to fill the heart again, <strong>much as it does between heartbeats.</strong></p>

<p>Maybe it's obvious or implicit, but I think it's worth explicitly pointing that out- The (healthy) heart's function is to pump blood, which it does by contracting rhythmically. The point of CPR is to mimic this, by <em>artificially/manually</em> contracting the heart rhythmically.</p>
<p>CPR is a way to imitate/approximate the normal behaviour of the heart.</p></div>		</li>
