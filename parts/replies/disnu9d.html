			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not so sure that being Catholic has much to do with being Republican. I know just as many liberal Catholics as conservative Catholics. Although I'm not very familiar with the demography of Puerto Rico, so you may still be correct that it would be a very red state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the primaries, there are far more people voting for a Democratic candidate than those voting for a Republican candidate. Puerto Rico is certainly less socially liberal than Democrats but I don't think that's enough for them to vote Republican.</p></div>		</li>
