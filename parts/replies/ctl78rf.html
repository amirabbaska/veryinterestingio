<p>The royal family uses Windsor, after their residence, to follow convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The choice of Windsor was a deliberate one (as one documentary put it, it's a very British name), but it wasn't necessarily because of the place. </p>
<p>Also, not all royals use Windsor. When the Duke of Cambridge was in school, he went by &quot;William Wales,&quot; probably because his dad's the Prince of said place. I think that's also the name that's on his jumpsuit (he flies medical helicopters now).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Windsor is a new self-given name since 1917. The real family name was Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Much of English nobility changed their name to non-German family names during WW1 as these were unpopular. Example: House Battenberg changing its name to House Mountbatten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, to be precise. Originally from Coburg in Oberfranken they reigned over parts of todays Sachsen, Th√ºringen and Bayern. Their original emblem:
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Coat_of_arms_of_Saxony.svg/100px-Coat_of_arms_of_Saxony.svg.png" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Coat_of_arms_of_Saxony.svg/100px-Coat_of_arms_of_Saxony.svg.png</a></p>
<p>still is official emblem of the Bundesland Sachsen today.
They succeeded another german Dynasty, the House of Hannover, of which the last successor was Queen Victoria, with Edward VII., Victorias and Alberts oldest Son from said house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.
With Edward being the uncle of Wilhelm II. of Hohenzollern <em>and</em> from his Wife, uncle of Czar Nikolaus II. - making George V., Wilhelm II. and Nicolaus cousins.
And they resembled each other very much:</p>
<p>(Wilhelm + Nicolaus)
