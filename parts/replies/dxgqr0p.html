			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was younger I went to a candy store with my mom. The clerk offered me a harry potter jelly bean to try. Boom, vomit flavour. Now I was a shy/awkward kid so even though I wanted to barf my face off I kept chewing and eventually swallowed it. I didn't want to be rude and spit it out, and I wouldn't even know where to put it! </p>
<p>So I tasted vomit for like a week even with many many tooth brushing sessions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a QC chemist in a flavor company.  One of the worst products we made was a rotten meat flavor.  It had a strong rotten flavor, and quite a bit of charred flavor.  It was terrible to have to do the scent and taste test for.  It was usually decided who the unlucky person was by drawing straws.</p>
<p>We also dealt with mercaptan, which is similar to one of the 3 predominant odors in skunk smell.  It eventually went into a coffee flavor.  It was horrid if anyone opened the bottle outside of the fume hood, or spilled any at all, inside it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they’re trying to say that if you hold your nose and chew one, it will taste bland. This is the case for nearly every food - you won’t get the full flavor until you release your nose. </p>
<p>Try it with the next thing you eat. Your tongue can really only detect a few flavors - salty, sour, sweet, for example. It’s your sense of smell that makes food taste the way it does. This is also why food tastes different when you’re sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty simple.. With your nose pinched, the jelly belly will taste sweet, but not much else. When you un-pinch your nose, the odors will suddenly come into play, and it'll suddenly taste like whatever it's supposed to.</p></div>		</li>
