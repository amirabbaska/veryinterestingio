			<div class="markdown"><p>That's basically what happens. One of the main purposes of payload fairings (right after making sure your payload doesn't disintegrate due to aerodynamic/thermal stresses) is to maintain sterile conditions between when the spacecraft was constructed until when it actually reaches space.</p></div>		</li>

Any such microbes would have a huge advantage over Voyager in the record of &quot;farthest distance from Earth an Earth thing has died.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

While I'm not as good as the fun maths as the xkcd guy is and as a layman I don't want to make any claims about what certain things are possible, I would assume that 420 zettajoules is sufficient energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithopanspermia, or transmission of life through meteors and other objects is hypothetical, because of some of the conditions microbes would have to survive, but I'm more than confident such an impact could eject objects into space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I... don't think those impact ejecta were on unbounded trajectories out of the solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. If, and that's a big if, these impacts were big enough to send matter out of Earth's SOI but somehow not so big that all matter ejected was melted beyond survivable temperatures, it definitely didn't leave the Sun's SOI. Unless, due to dumb luck they somehow caught a gravity exist. </p></div>		</li>
