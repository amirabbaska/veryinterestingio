			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I knew you 3 years ago, I took care of my second wife ,she died of lung cancer at 50, no one told me how it would end it is 3 years later and I cant get the last moments out of my head. I lost my first wife to a heartattack, and thought I could deal with anything. I still question if I have all my marbles.Do people that do hospice ever get over the feelings of uselessness? The things keeping me going are my 2 sons, other than that I see life as so fragile. Thanks for listening.

<p>I can only speak for myself. I do it because some of these people have no one left. They're just so old, and they never married, or their spouse is dead, and their kids, if they have any, don't live nearby. There was one woman I used to go see who had had a sister in the same facility. The sister died, and the only family left lived a few hundred miles away. I used to let the remaining sister use my cell phone so she could call them. </p>
<p>But anyway, I figure someone should go visit people like this, someone who isn't there as a medical person or a social worker or whatever. Just, here I am, you can talk to me about whatever, and if you don't want to talk to me, you can talk to the fuzzy dude. </p>

<p>It is. And people don't often get that till they're really old. I'm edging in that direction, the old part, and I get it. I look at people who were around for WW2 and who have lived thru such turmoil and uncertainty and who thru it all raised a family and went to work and had a life. I dunno, it sort of gives me hope that regardless of what goes on in the world, some basic humanity is preserved. </p>
<p>I'm glad you have your sons. Hang on to them, they're what counts. </p></div>		</li>
