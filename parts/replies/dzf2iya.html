			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a bankruptcy attorney. I can't speak to other states, but in Virginia at least, your primary residence is largely protected, so long as you own it or are staying current on the rent. Personal possessions normally can't be seized, although I'm sure there are circumstances where that might not apply, that I just haven't seen.</p>
<p>In practice, we see judgements just go unpaid all the time, both court ordered fine and civil awards from torts cases. A court can say you owe something, but it can't make you have money; if you're broke, or prepared to be broke, you can act with relative impunity tbh. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hate to break it to you, but since bankruptcy is the federal level (and California law doesn’t govern), the bankruptcy code and the precedence set by a 1986 US Supreme Court ruling (Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36 if you’re bored) explicitly state that criminal restitution payments cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. However, they can be paid over time in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would restitution be allowed in bankrupty? If someone steals my car and wrecks it, but cant repay me and declares bankrupty, am I just fucked and he gets off? Why shouldn't be be forced to pay for the rest of his life?</p>
<p>Edit: just an example. I would probably be able to make a claim on my insurance in a real scenario. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You’re just fucked. It’s one of the shortcomings of a system that equates money with restitution. </p>
<p>Similarly, if I do something stupid and hurt you through negligence - say you’re a passenger in a car I wreck while driving drunk, and you lose an arm and an eye - the court is going to put a dollar sign on your harm. Even though no dollar sign can really restore what you lose. </p>
<p>It’s a conceptual shortcoming, that gets a lot of thought from transsystemic legal scholars of a certain type.  </p>
<p>EDIT: since I got PMs</p>
<p>It’s an issue of competing rights. Your right to having your harm corrected by money is seen as important, but not as important as preserving the general concept that the state should administer justice, not vengeance. If the state cripples Peter for life to force him to pay a judgment to Paul, that’s not justice, it’s retribution. It’s a civil case, not criminal; the idea is to right the wrong, not to punish the tortfeasor (except in cases of punitive damage, which are both rare and strictly regulated by law). </p>
<p>Basically, if you lose a judgement and can’t pay, that’s bad, but not as bad as a court using the power of the state to permanently harm someone’s ability to make a livelihood. This is why we don’t have debtors prisons anymore. A civil judgment is a debt like any other, and needs to be dischargeable. (This is also why our current student loan system is unsustainable)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bankruptcy effects your credit, but other than that...not much. We have had clients who have filed bankruptcy 5 times, which is impressive, considering you can only receive a Chapter 7 discharge once every 8 years, and Chapter 13 every 2 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>&quot;42 U.S.C. § 659. Consent by United States to income withholding, garnishment, and
similar proceedings for enforcement of child support and alimony obligations&quot;</em></p>
<p>This is the heading of the section of the CFR(Code of Federal Regulations) that deals with garnishment of Veteran's Disability Compensation for family support. Its a couple of pages of lawyer-speak so I didn't bother copying and pasting the entire thing, but I'm sure you can Google the CFR number and find it. Basically, (if I've managed to translate this mumbo jumbo correctly) it says VA benefits <em>can</em> be garnished, but only a certain amount of the recipient's disposable income. </p></div>		</li>
