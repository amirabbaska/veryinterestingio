			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easy, sure, but a person should still take a two hour class with an instructor showing you the process on a mannequin. Just that knowledge of where to put the pads may be enough, the rest is just pressing the button; in a difficult situation, people panic and don't follow instructions even if they are simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some train of thought among Cardiologists that 2 min of CPR before defibrillation on an <em>unwitnessed</em> arrest patient improves survivability rate by a significant amount. Currently that is the practice at the hospital I work at. I can’t find the link to the study as I am on mobile, but this <a href="https://www.aclsmedicaltraining.com/blog/cpr-first-defibrillation-first/" target="_blank">discussion</a> goes into some depth on it. As an FF/EMT at a fire department, we usually arrive anywhere from 5 minutes (in an urban setting), to 25 minutes (in a rural setting) after a call is placed. From our clinical perspective, the sooner you can start chest compressions and can set up an AED, the survivability rate of the patient increases dramatically. Whether it’s 2 minutes before we get there, or 20, it can mean the difference between ROSC and no ROSC. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The American Heart Association does a lot of pig studies. I think one of them showed that extended downtime in an arrest has better outcomes post-ROSC and better chance of ROSC with 2 minutes of CPR prior to a shock.</p>
<p>Also, 2 minutes of CPR is enough to get the heart irritable enough to <em>be</em> shocked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely correct. There is a variety of instances where first rhytm found on patient in cardiac arrest is PEA (pulseless electrical activity) or asystole (flat line). In addition to drugs hypoxia, pneumothorax or cardic tamponade for example. </p>
<p>The thing to know about defibrillation is this: there are two 'shockable' rhytms. First is ventricular fibrillation, where the ventricles of heart are just, well, fibrillating and such unable to pump blood. Other one is ventricular tachycardia, where the ventricles contract so fast they are unable to pump blood. Both lead to a situation where the person has no pulse and no blood is circulating in their body. Sometimes V-tach can still maintain a pulse, but usually not for long and it is medical emergency nonetheless. The point of defibrillation is to stop that uncontroller electrical activity in the heart in the hope that it will start back as normal after the defibrillation. So as said, it doesn't restart the heart but actually stops the chaos that is going on in there, which gives the heart a possibility to get back in line and fulfill it's duty. There is no point in defibrillating asystole or PEA as there is no faulty electrical activity to stop.</p>
<p>Also, there are situations where compressions do triumph over defibrillation. Heart muscle needs oxygen to be able to work properly again, and compressions don't only circulate the blood in the body to prevent destruction of brain cells, but to pump oxygen to heart muscle also. Heart needs oxygen to be able to benefit from defibrillation, so it would be better to start with some compressions and then defibrillate than to just straight away defibrillate. No need to complete a 2 min cycle, but one should never wait for defibrillation before starting compressions no matter how close the defibrillator is, unless the patient was seen to go into (shockable) cardiac arrest on monitor and the shock can be given in under 30 seconds or so.</p>
<p>Note for every confused layman reading this: you shouldn't be worried about these things. Automatic defibrillators won't give shock to any other than shockable rhytms (and they are extemely easy to use) so you don't need to worry about PEA, asystole, ventrical fibrillation or ventrical tachycardia. Also, remember that chest compressions are the most important thing in CPR, followed by early defibrillation. Learn to do proper chest compressions and you may save someones life, and don't be afraid to use an automatic defibrillator if there is one available. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Narcan will bring people back if they’ve overdosed on opiate drugs (heroin, fentanyl, etc). But there are other drugs you can overdose on that will send the heart into life threatening rhythms, such as beta blockers (ie, metoprolol) or TCAs (drugs used for refractory depression, such as amitryptiline). These types of overdoses require other drugs to reverse symptoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>narcan reverses the effect of the opiates themselves (sleep and apnea [not breathing])</p>
<p>The defibrillator is needed when you have been not breathing so long it has irritated your heart and caused it to fall into one of those funny &quot;non-perfusing&quot; rhythms like v-fib or pulseless v-tach that can potentially be transitioned back to normal rhythm by shocking the heart (essentially turning it off and on again)</p></div>		</li>
