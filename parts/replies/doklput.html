			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe they only wear it for the day and those extra hours of sleep with it on are the tipping point where it finally becomes to swollen to take off comfortably. That’s how I read the post </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That video always makes me cringe. You see the purple finger before he starts wrapping? That's trapped blood. If you wind the string <em>toward</em> the trapped blood, you risk forming and embolism. Not fun stuff. Much better to wrap at the top and then do the under-ring tuck at the end.</p></div>		</li>
