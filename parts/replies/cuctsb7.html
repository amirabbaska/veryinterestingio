			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking the top comment to say that I've been woken up by a sneeze a few times. When sleeping in an allergy inducing environment I sometime sneeze so hard in my sleep I wake up. When a cat gets in the room for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've definitely woken up to sneeze. I remember a few times because it's kind of startling. I'm pretty sure I came conscious first although it was really fast and intense. Do you think your brain might have woken right before and then you sneezed or do you think you sneezed and it woke you up? Just curious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like your sinuses start to get itchy/clogged and that wakes you up. As soon as you pull into consciousness you sneeze. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm this. My gf also does it because she gets cold (because she pulls the blanket off in her sleep, she doesn't have allergies), but she twitches her nose, sits up, sneezes and gets back to sleep, not remembering anything the next day. Though neither does she remember getting up and getting a glass of milk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I don't know about the rest of you but <em>I</em> have been awakened in the night by sneezing especially lately. I have severe acid reflux and the acid creeps into my nose and makes me sneeze. Not all sneezes are from dust and pollen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just my own experience, but a couple of years ago I had a pretty gnarly sinus infection. I was sleeping on my stomach and sneezed while asleep. Of course, I woke up immediately to the very sticky and slimy sensation of mucus all over my face and pillow. I'm talking about a really bright, lime green and crusty, dark yellow snot spiderwebbed all over my pillow and face. </p></div>		</li>
