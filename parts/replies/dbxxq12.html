			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually depends on the software. Some players treat normalization as ensuring that the volume peaks between each file you play are consistent. Others have more complex methods designed to compress volume differences within the same file (often some form of multiband compressor or a more proprietary maximizing algorithm).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a really old Mitsubishi rear-projection HDTV and the audio menu on the TV has a function that does this.. it's called &quot;Level Sound&quot;.  From the manual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automatically equalizes the volume level of
programs containing significant level differences
from one segment to another (for example, regular
programming to commercials). To receive the best
fidelity with music programs, you can turn this
setting to Off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So check your TVs to see if it's under a different name.  I'm an audiophile and normally don't like equalization, filters, etc, but I gotta say this auto-level is worth it for action movies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My older Denon receiver had the same function, but under a different name.  It was pitched at normalizing the volume of commericals, but I have to imagine the math isn't that different for loud action scenes.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This ^ but a lot of hardware also has it, you usually just have to poke around.</p>
<p>My samsung surround sound calls it &quot;s.vol&quot; on the remote, and describes is as night mode in the instruction booklet.
My laptop and pc call it normalization in sound settings.
KODI calls it volume amplification (not as good, but only required if you have no other native way of normalization).
Many other devices simply call it &quot;night mode&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
