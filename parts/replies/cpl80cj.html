<p>Is it that the body just shuts down stimuli in a fight or flight scenario?</p></div>		</li>

&quot;Some More Specific Behaviours Of Children Following Sexual Assault.
Wetting/soiling
Many young children lose bladder/bowel control following sexual assault. It can be frustrating for parents and cause extra work. It can be humiliating and embarrassing for children. It is easy for adults and children to focus on the consequences of wetting and soiling eg. changing sheets/clothes, washing, rather than the reasons why it happens.
All children bed wet from time to time when they are sick, stressed or anxious. Children who have been sexually assaulted will often bed wet every night and sometimes more than once a night. Bedwetting can be linked to feelings and may be a result of nightmares. Extreme fear can cause loss of bladder control and may serve the purpose of waking a child from a terrifying dream.
Bedwetting can also result from feelings of helplessness when children feel a loss of ownership and power over their body when it has been used by someone more powerful than they are. Bedwetting can be a reflection of children regressing in many ways, following sexual assault, when they lose a number of skills they previously had. Children may regress to a younger state to try and get their needs met. Bedwetting and soiling may also occur because a child separates from their genital/urinary/anal areas. They may lose the ability to respond to their body cues and therefore become less able to regulate their toilet habits. Sometimes children may be scared to actually go to the toilet. They may have experienced sexual assault in a bathroom or their fears may focus on the toilet itself.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had though that recent consensus was that bedwetting was more physical than psychological; there are plenty of instances of healthy, normal, well-adjusted children (except for the social implications of bedwetting) who wet the bed.  Perhaps the abuse correlation is more like the psychopath correlation, a side effect of the random distribution of the problem.  Of course, berate, belittle or embarrass the child, and they are more likely to exhibit signs of maladjustment. It's hard to be a happy kid if the parents are regularly making you feel a failure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While true I just want to point out that this is also a tautology. We define regression by it's symptoms (when thinking of it empirically) and bedwetting is one of those symptoms.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize this in order to understand what aspects are about theory of the mind's self-organization (unproven but helpful conceptualizations about the mind) and what aspects are evidential.</p>
<p>I'm mostly posting this because of earlier comments regarding psychology as disregarding the scientific method or otherwise drawing useless conclusions on lack of evidence. The tautology is fine as long as it's recognized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of bedwetting, the child has never been dry overnight and reached a certain age (above 7) or a child who was previously dry but isn't any more. I don't know which one is supposed to be a sign of abuse, perhaps either, but there are many other reasons like a small bladder or inability to recognize a full bladder and wake up (never been dry) to a urinary tract infection or onset of diabetes (suddenly wetting the bed). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. Bedwetting isn't automatically a sign of abuse; there are many other health reasons a child might begin to wet the bed.</p></div>		</li>
