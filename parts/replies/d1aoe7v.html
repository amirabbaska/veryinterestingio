			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  Thermal expansion of sea water is one cause of sea level rise.  However, the oceans are already melting the ice.  In a steady state condition, the amount of ice being melted is equivalent to the amount added, typically as snow that is then compressed.  The ocean doesn't necessarily need to warm in order to melt more ice.  Changes to temperature <em>distribution</em> can have a similar effect without an increase in heat.</p>
<p>Specifically for ice shelves, as the ocean melts the base of the ice shelf, if the bedrock slopes downwards towards the continent, pressure increases.  Ocean water that was at freezing temperature at that salinity and pressure is now able to melt more ice, without a change in temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point, should have been more specific... in my head I was thinking &quot;If the globe as a whole gets warm enough to completely melt Antarctica&quot;. Which is a much stronger statement than what I actually said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're saying is mostly correct. Water is at it's densest at around 3.94 degrees celsius. So the statement &quot;Water occupies more space at higher temperatures than it does at low temperatures&quot; Is correct as long as water is warmer than 4 degrees celsius.
