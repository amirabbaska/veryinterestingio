<p>Personally I use a TI-89 because the numerical solver makes things like compressible flow tolerable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used a TI-85 through most of middle and high school, and moved to the TI-89 only when I was sure that it had the solver functionality built in. Yes, I can do it in 5 minutes, or I could do it in 15 seconds on my calculator and spend the rest of the time graphing guitar chords. I choose the latter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used a cheap Casio knockoff. The teachers couldn't help me much but if you just keep the manual it's easy to learn and I was faster on it than the class on a ti83 or whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ik this is old but I was just thinking...</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why schools haven't at least made newer calculators a standard. The thing is, I got my N-Spire for cheaper than or at the very least the same price what most people pay for an 84, which is what I mostly see in schools. My N-Spire is objectively superior and much more user friendly, yet it seems nobody is making the switch from these calculators that are over a decade old. The price of the 84s haven't even really gone down, so I really have no idea why everyone is still using them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Teachers learn on TI83.  You'd be adding an entirely new learning paradigm to the required teaching education- and that info would go out of date extremely quickly as new graphing calculators came out.</p>
<p>So....yeah, it's kind of BS that you have this monopoly, but on the other hand, it saves a lot of effort further down the line.  So....tradeoffs. </p></div>		</li>
