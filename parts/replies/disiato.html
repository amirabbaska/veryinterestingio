			<div class="markdown"><p>When you say the US are you referring to Congress or the average American? I agree with you that Congress probably doesnt want another state since its controlled by the republicans and PR would take more federal money in then it would give since its in a debt crisis atm. As for citizens I think they would like PR to become a state. There is no real reason why US citizen's wouldn't want it to become a state unless they are worried about the fiscal impact but that wouldn't be that big of an impact on your average American.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I'm referring to the government. About the average american, I'd say you're right, but I've also seen some disagreement. Some people say things about not wanting us because we supposedly only want your benefits and your money and welfare, etc. or that we want to be &quot;saved&quot;. So I think there's mixed feelings.</p></div>		</li>
