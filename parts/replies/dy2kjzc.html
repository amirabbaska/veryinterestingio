			<div class="markdown"><p>My doctor told me he went into peds because there's practically zero non-compliance. </p>
<p>Internal: Stop smoking, cut to a week later, he's still smoking</p>
<p>Peds: Stop doing this to your kid yields (a) over protective parent goes crazy to do that for their kid (b) parent doesn't do it and you alert CPS. It's not that black and white, but there's definitely less of a compliance issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope you don't mind me asking - don't your hands get really, really dry from the purell? </p>
<p>I ask as the people in my circles usually have dry, cracked skin on their hands. Mine are always smooth. The difference? They use hand sanitizer and I don't. (I am allergic to alcohol - so no hand sanitizer for me (unless I want trouble breathing, swollen hands and hives).) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't had that problem yet, and I don't pay much attention to moisturising. The sanitiser we use in our hospital isn't Purell - it's probably less harsh on the skin because it's meant to be used repeatedly throughout the day. </p></div>		</li>
