			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the CFCs themselves that catalyze the O3-&gt;O2 reactions, it's that they're a transport mechanism for chlorine which is a catalyst.  Stratospheric chlorine is the culprit, CFCs just protect the chlorine from removal by natural processes on the way up.  When CFCs reach the stratosphere, they're photolyzed by UV-C releasing the chlorine.</p></div>		</li>
