<p>They are <strong>not</strong> affecting each other faster than light. Changes in the gravitational field propagate at c.</p>
<p>This line from the paper explains it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does eqn. (2.4) imply that gravity propagates instantaneously? As in the case of electromagnetism, it clearly does not. Every term in the connection Γρμν depends only on the retarded position, velocity, and acceleration of the source; despite Van Flandern’s claim to the contrary [15], there is no dependence, implicit or explicit, on the “instantaneous” direction to the source. Indeed, the vector (2.5) does not point toward the “instantaneous” position of the source, but only toward its position extrapolated from this retarded data.</p>

<p>Advisor's commentary accidentally makes it into the submitted paper.</p>
<p>Just kidding, this is really interesting. Is it saying though that Earth orbits the sun's ballistic trajectory or that it orbits the sun's trajectory extrapolated under constant acceleration?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very confusing for me, the layman.</p>
<p>I saw an animation where the sun disappeared and things kept moving normally for 8mins until the vacuum reached Earth and then started to drift away.</p>
<p>If the Earth is attracted to where the sun is now, shouldn't it start drifting immediately after the sun disappears?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if you've been asked this, but I'm a tad confused.</p>
<p>So based on the equations and what you posted, the earth is attracted to where the sun is now due to the extrapolation of where it was 8 minutes ago. I probably didn't word it quite rightly, but if I'm understanding that's the gist.</p>
<p>How are we sure about this though? Because although this does seem like a neat and tidy way to keep gravity propogation at luminal speeds, if we have never seen the sun suddenly not follow this, how are we sure this is the case and not that the two are directly linked at superluminal speeds, and not due to extrapolation? </p>
<p>Again, apologies for my awful explanation and wording, hope what I'm asking makes some srnse</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially they're assuming the vectors that define the sun's movement are remaining constant over that 8 minutes. As those forces are translated thrpught thw Sun's gravitational field it follows that were moving in parallel. </p>
<p>However if there was a sudden change in the sun's momentum that caused it to deviate from its otherwise predictable trajectory, it would indeed take 8 minutes for that corresponding change to influence the earth.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The Earth accelerates towards where the Sun was 8 minutes ago extrapolated to where it would have moved based on its velocity and acceleration 8 minutes ago. The fact that the position is not quite the same as the &quot;instantaneous position&quot; is the very reason why the Earth-Sun system spits out gravitational waves. </p>

<p>They are not, that's sort of the whole point of the paper.</p>
<p>I'll quote their explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does eqn. (2.4) imply that gravity propagates instantaneously? As in the case of electromagnetism, it clearly does not. Every term in the connection Γρμν depends only on the retarded position, velocity, and acceleration of the source; despite Van Flandern’s claim to the contrary [15], there is no dependence, implicit or explicit, on the “instantaneous” direction to the source. Indeed, the vector (2.5) does not point toward the “instantaneous” position of the source, but only toward its position extrapolated from this retarded data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everywhere the time dependence is in terms of the retarded time, which enforces that there is a delay due to the finite speed of propagation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The paper seemed to imply there's some tricksy math that makes it possible, but it would almost certainly seem to violate a ton of other rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean? There isn't really any &quot;tricky math&quot;, they're just evaluating the full velocity-dependent interaction between the Earth and the sun. The same derivation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liénard–Wiechert_potential" target="_blank">electromagnetism</a> is a simple but tedious exercise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, the Earth is attracted to the place where the sun is. But the location of the sun can easily be predicted 8 minutes ahead of time. The earth is attracted to a place, and we can also compute that based on our observations of the suns orbit it will be in that place at that time.</p>
<p>So perhaps you argue: but what if some force moved the sun in that time. Yes, but that requires the sun to move, and to accelerate. And these things have an effect on the gravity field, so it will cause the Earth to be attracted to a different place, which will be the same place the sun ends up.</p>
<p>So no you can not use this for communication. The point towards the Earth is attracted correlates with the point the Sun is. But there is not a direct causality between them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But this effect on the Earth would not occur until ~8mins later, right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is only true provided there is no 3rd-order motion between the Sun and Earth. If the relative acceleration of sun were to change for whatever reason the Earth would be attracted to the position the Sun would have been assuming constant acceleration. If there is any change in acceleration, the discrepancy will propagate a gravitational wave between the Sun and Earth at the speed of light. <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s6-08/6-08.htm" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>
