			<div class="markdown"><p>Off topic, but as a semi-good cyclist, I highly recommend getting cozy with your front brake - it stops you much, much faster than the rear. I brake with both at the same time, and I brake harder with the front than the rear, since the rear is more liable to skid. Going over the bars doesn't happen if you <em>practice</em> with the front brake - the key is to keep your arms solid and shift your weight back a bit. Using a strong front brake, I can stop in at least 1/4 the distance as using the back. Once you get confident with your brakes, you'll be a better rider, because you'll be more confident.</p>
<p>edit - On dirt or gravel, you'll want to split the braking force more evenly, as you can get into a dangerous front wheel slide if you brake too hard. Nevertheless, the front brake is still absolutely essential to effective stopping offroad as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I have my front brake on the right side as well. That way I can signal with my left while still having my primary brake available. It also helps to toe-in your pads so you have a little more modulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recommend signalling right turns with right hand, left with left... I've had people wave at me multiple times when I was signalling a right turn with my left arm - they thought I was waving at them. That said, I don't ride anywhere with extreme traffic, so I am rarely in a situation where I need full braking power and signalling capability at the same time....although when I am, I normally signal first, then brake with both hands on the bars, since it's much easier to control the bike with both hands.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But what about right turns? In my experience right turns (for right handed traffic) are more sudden and sharp, thus require more braking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For dry pavement, there is virtually no risk of your front tire slipping</p>

<p>Rubbish, I can happily lock up the front wheel on any of my bikes at any speed.</p>
<p>To do so would be very very stupid mind, but the brakes are more than capable of doing so. </p>
<p>Either you're trying to oversimplify for this one or you have very very bad brakes...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I could certainly be oversimplifying, but I've never locked up a front tire on pavement, and I keep my brakes in very good condition. When I was first getting used to using the front brake, I repeatedly went faster and faster and then braked as hard as I could, to see at what speed my rear tire would lift, and I never locked the wheel... I think it's possible that even if you did lock the wheel, your rear tire would lift before your front started to slip. Of course, it's possible that I'm just modulating the brake to keep it from locking up without realizing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use my back brake as a trim brake to avoid wearing the front pads out too soonâ€”for example, approaching a junction at which it's not yet clear whether I'll need to stop or that I can retain my momentum. If I need to brake any harder or stop, I'll use the front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a little advice from a fellow amateur cyclist.  </p>
<p>I grew up as a kid being told to back brake first to avoid going &quot;head over turkey&quot;.  </p>
<p>When I upgraded to road bike and started casual cycling with a group of guys in a peloton on weekends they taught me that I should be using only my front brake for most of my braking.  </p>
<p>Front braking is more efficient than the back brake and when used correctly you won't go over the handle bars. Travelling at high speed you can stop much more quickly with front brake only. Here's a good summary of technique:</p>

<p>Edit: Just relised almost everyone has mention this to you. Apologise for sounding like a broken record.</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Conventional wisdom says to use both brakes at the same time. This is probably good advice for beginners, who have not yet learned to use their brakes skillfully, but if you don't graduate past this stage, you will never be able to stop as short safely as a cyclist who has learned to use the front brake by itself.</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're getting at something that hasn't really been brought up--the precision required. When I'm descending at 50+mph on my bicycle, my brain is working hard. I'm watching for minute debris, damp patches, differences in the pavement texture, cornering, etc. Every little thing matters. Tiny steering, center of mass, and brake inputs matter. In a car at 50mph, people eat cereal while texting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just started cycle commuting, and feel like a total rockstar going 21mph down hill.  50+ seems impossible and terrifying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to live in a really flat area and recently moved to a place with hills. It was pretty scary the first few times, but it's not so bad now. I've even done a few panic stops down from 40 mph which really increases confidence. For some roads it just became second nature.</p>
<p>However, I recently crashed at 25 and now I'm paying attention again! Ground squirrel ran cross the road around a bend. Ground squirrels are adorable, stupid, little things. I find myself going slower now. It's super fun to go fast, but if that thing ran out in front of me at 50, I don't think I'd be alright. There are also deer here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends how long you get to practice it. Familiarity breeds contempt lol you get used to it quickly. Conditions and the road surface plays a big part too.</p>
<p>I can regularly hit 40+ mph on a couple of local descents, clearly sighted, decent roads, so there's not a lot to worry about.</p>
<p>30 on an unfamiliar, wet, gravelly, potholed surface with some blind bends is terrifying lol.</p>
<p>50+ takes bigger hills than I've got around here, my personal maximum speed ever was 55mph. That was surprisingly easy. Biiig hill, completely clear visibility etc etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the terrain for me. I have a hill on my daily commute that I regularly hit 45-50 on and it's no big deal because it's pretty well maintained and visibility is good. The hill where I can go faster than that is a poorly maintained mountain road through a thick forest which is much more intense. I'm also doing this with flat bars so my aero position probably isn't as stable as it could be. If I don't watch my weight distribution, the speed wobbles start immediately.</p></div>		</li>
