			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, the gun bit. If animals can learn to recognise guns as a hazard, are there any animals that recognise roads as a hazard? IME, quite the contrary. Birds will swoop low over a road surface before flying off high again. It seems animals are confused by roads. I assume they haven't had enough time to evolve any protective instinct regarding roads. </p></div>		</li>
