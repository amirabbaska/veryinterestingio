<p>If you're curious about why this doesn't happen often, one good read is the Red Queen hypothesis.</p>
<p>Edit: going back to the car example, the red queen concept is the idea that even if you managed to make your car last forever, it would still become outdated in many ways, losing value (Vintage cars break the analogy, shh).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, evolution is about random changes and some making critters survive and spread. Since we have very little pressure from our environment, and do everything we can to keep even undesirable mutations alive, it seems unlikely we'd see as much evolutionary change as in the past.</p>
<p>Also, considering the massive timeframe involved in evolution, and our scientific progress lately, it is likely that we will figure out immortality ourselves long before evolution will have a chance. So we may never know if it would happen by chance, because we'll cause it well before then.</p>
<p>You know, if we don't kill ourselves with our retarded wars and weapons of mass destruction before then.</p></div>		</li>
