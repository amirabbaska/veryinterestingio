<p>Extra information: Since Humans as a species have been fairly good at adapting as needed, this may explain why we have lighter people in places where it'd make sense for everyone to be darker toned. Things such as umbrellas, sun block and houses would allow those with little natural protection to the sun to easily live in places where it is over abundant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fairly certain this would be due to evolving in a naturally shade abundant region or the invention of clothing/covered homes. I don't believe the things you've pointed out like umbrellas and sun block have been around long enough to provide significant impact on skin tone in a population. </p>
<p>That plus colonization the past few hundred years and migration being much easier leading to genetic blending. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Would that be a possible reason that the higher castes in India have lighter skin tone vs lower castes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, back in  Victorian times wealthy women always carried an umbrella and wore powdered make up to appear as white as possible.  This is because they associated having a tan or dark skin to being a poor day laborer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im not familiar with the people of India to have an educated opinion on the matter. Possible though. In Europe, for a while the wealthy and educated viewed pale skin as a sign of privilege and high class. To the point they would powder their skin. </p>
<p>Wouldnt be too much of a leap to think it could be a factor but I know nothing to back it up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partially maybe, but this is primarily sexual selection at play, much like the negro/mulatto/quadroon type structure of society in the southeast US (Louisiana in particular I think) during Spanish and French eras. It's more likely that lighter skin was seen as being of the upper class and conceivably would allow your or your children greater privilege in society, thus imparting advantage for selection of skin tone without any physiological selection required in the form of vitamin d acquisition or cancer/tumour pressure against the sexual selection.</p>
<p>Tldr: light skin became the new hotness for having your kids make it to breeding ages at some point, cancer rates from sun or lack of sun are unlikely to be the driving selective forces in a caste system</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My SO had a good question the other day. Does a woman's sun exposure during pregnancy have any effect on the skin's tone/reception to sun exposure of the fetus? Based on your response, you might have some clue about this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your SO's question is a complex one, but the simple answer is probably not. Since UV light does not penetrate deeper than the dermis (at normal altitudes), your SO's question is asking about epigenetics and trans-generational inheritence (how these modifications they are passed on). Epigenetics are changes in phenotype (appearance) or gene expression that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence (things like DNA &amp; histone methylation and acetylation = turn up or down gene expression). There are some cases that we know of in which someone's life experiences can affect the genetic expression of future generations. However, this generally SKIPS A GENERATION. Two well studied examples are below:
1) Grandchildren's lifespans are influenced by the pre-pubescent diet of their same-sex paternal grandparent (if you're a boy your dad's dad, if your'e a girl your dad's mom). Researchers discovered that if one's same sex paternal grandparent had restricted caloric intake before they reached puberty, that grandchild's lifespan would be longer (to some degree) than someone whose same sex paternal grandparent had high/sufficient caloric intake before they reached puberty.

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16391557" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16391557</a>
2) You are more likely to be obese and have mental issues if your grandmother was malnourished during the first trimester of your parents pregnancy. The same was not found for malnourishment during the third trimester (gametes/sex cells mainly formed by then). This is due to a systemic change (signal passed throughout entire body) in expression of a metabolic gene (IGF-2). The pregnant grandmother's IGF-2 expression changed during malnourishment, this affected the gametes of her fetus. Once properly fed, the grandmother's and fetus's IGF-2 expression returned to baseline, however the fetus' gametes remained changed to some degree.

<p>So there is a possibility that exposure to sunlight could affect future generations production of melanin epigenetically/in non-random way (not classical evolution). Getting back to your specific question, sunlight exposure on a pregnant woman would most likely not affect the fetus' skin tone because a) UV light doesn't penetrate deep enough to reach the fetus; b) increases in melanin production are local only to exposed areas (tan lines), so a signal isn't passed throughout the entire body; and c) epigenetic changes usually skip a generation. </p>
<p>Edit. Wording.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The baby's genes won't change in the womb, so no. However, vitamin D deficiency is very very real, and if Momma doesn't get enough sun and vitamin D, baby will be deficient as well. There are studies being done to show the causality of Vitamin D deficiency in the womb and diseases like Multiple Sclerosis which is most prevalent in people with a deficiency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um... look. I don't know your specialization but... some of the wires are crossed a little in your explanation. Your presentation of the mechanism for tanning is weird, creeping up against the more populist evo-psych notions. &quot;Evolutionarily&quot;, of course, the role of any particular gene suite is only to produce more of itself - to aid in successful differential reproduction of the individual over time. The genes themselves wouldn't have had any teleological desire to increase protection from the sun, but instead genes would propagate through generations if they were successful (or neutral) in their expression throughout individuals, including the genes that would code for the type of skin to either tan or simply burn.</p>
<p>The sunlight connection could reasonably be expected to express itself in the successful differential of infant mortality, possibly rewarding individuals who could draw more solar energy in less-sunny climates (over long periods of time). Tanning itself, however, wouldn't involve &quot;signaling&quot; to any system in the body in order &quot;to increase your protection against the sun&quot; but rather an artifact of the sun's effect on human skin with varying melanin profiles, just as losing the tan is dependent upon the skin repairing itself, not the result of a process <em>that has as its end</em> the consumption of more sunlight. Now, perhaps all these things could have led inadvertently to more successful differential reproduction of certain features over time, perhaps because who wants to breed with someone with crusty burn scabs all the time? But that describes a very different kind of feedback loop, and doesn't answer the question. Your manner of characterizing it is a little too much Kipling and not enough Dawkins. And of course the time-scale of sun-block and etc. just isn't long enough to have made a difference.</p></div>		</li>
