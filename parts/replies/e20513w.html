			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but the richness of a yolk can tell us the type of diet a chicken has, as you mentioned , beta-carotene produces a deep orange colour, and tells us whether a chicken has been grass fed vs grain fed, and this determines the amount of omega 3 in the yolk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chickens eat anything they can get ahold of. When we castrated pigs the chickens eat the testicles. They eat bugs, frogs and toads, mice and rats, snails and slugs, you name it. The very best eggs come from free roaming chickens that eat anything they can find. You get dark orange, firm yolks that taste delicious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what about the shell? I bought some free range eggs the other day and I still had some regular eggs in the fridge. I noticed the free range had mush thicker, harder to break shells than the regular supermarket brand. Free range also had a deeper yellow yolk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If their eggs are too thin you should consider supplementing with oyster shells as laying hens are genetically compelled to produce a quantity of eggs that will lead to depletion of their own bones calcium if it is not supplemented. This leads to fractures, an obvious welfare problem. It does depend on the breed you have though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chickens will typically pick up calcium, when available, as they need it. Deficiencies and excesses can both be harmful. Thick shelled eggs can indicate a healthy chicken or an unhealthy chicken that's getting too much calcium. Thin shelled eggs can be typical to the breed or could mean a calcium deficiency or another problem.</p>
<p>In other words, eggshell thickness is a poor indicator of egg quality or chicken health.</p></div>		</li>
