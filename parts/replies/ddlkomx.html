			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI Japanese is the much the same, usually as number 2, the stroke order number of strokes and radical.</p>
<p>It's also one reason electronic dictionaries are HUGE in Japan (can't speak for china, not sure)
It's really easy to look something up if you know number of strokes and radical. Even for some one like me that has a maybe a 4th graders level of Kanji ability I can look up a kanji in an electronic dictionary really quickly. For example, oh look 語. I can see the left radical is 8 strokes, so enter 8 and it gives me all the radicals with 8, only so many, easy to pick out usually. Then it gives me all the combos of the left radical with possible right radicals, but I can narrow that down even further by selecting combos with only 7 strokes, as seen as in the right radical. Takes like 5 seconds to look something up when you get the hang of it.</p>
<p>BUT all this is pretty much pretty much pointless today for many applications (like morons like me who need translation) because there are translation apps where you can snap a quick pic and it will translate loads of text for you instantly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But how does it work when you look it up with 8, when it's actually only 7 strokes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's still Chinese. it's not actually Japanese, which has it's own alphabet. That was r/weinsteinjin 's point. a lot of different peoples use Chinese, and the characters are always the same, but the pronunciation varies widely. Korean is the same way, but they still have their own alphabet. kanji in Korean is hanja, and they, too, have a separate Korean alphabet with FAR fewer characters </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a lot of Japanese indexes listing words based on kana though. I'd imagine a dictionary works the same way.   </p>
<p>Although, it'd probably be easier to navigate a Kanji dictionary that's listed according to radicals and number of strokes because Japanese has multiple pronunciations for most Kanji.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's right, and as an extra tidbit, anyone learning the language will be happy to hear that every show has subtitles because for some areas, some dialects are so different (plus minorities and Hong Kongers who speak different languages) that every show comes with subtitles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I lived in China one of my favorite things to watch was people talking with deaf people. Instead of using sign language they'd often write characters on the deaf person's hand.  The sort of fun thing was when someone would make a mistake writing and they'd rub the person's palm to &quot;erase&quot; the character they'd written.</p></div>		</li>

<p>here's an interactive example of how dictionaries are arranged based on the stroke components.
clicking on the starting stroke, the individual words are then ordered by the total number of strokes. also the main table is ordered from right to left, top to bottom.</p>
<p>it's how it's arranged in the 1700s during the Qing dynasty (康熙字典), dictionaries used today (besides hanyu pinyin) are derived from this arrangement. </p>

<p>There is only ONE written language, so the same character can be pronounced differently but still understood by everyone.</p>

<p>Although not formalised, quite a few dialects do have their own written form, where they make use of their own grammar and extra character sets. An example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Cantonese" target="_blank">Written Cantonese</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy fuck this is is complicated but insanely interesting. Using a &quot;radical&quot; to communicate a general idea and then other symbols within the character for specificity sounds fascinating. I would love to learn Mandarin some day but as a native English speaker and with how much I've heard about it's difficulty I feel like it would be more practical to stick with an easier and more widespread language like Spanish, still  a really interesting language though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started learning Mandarin from scratch over 20 years ago, and it's a lot less complicated than this sounds in practice.  We did an hour or two of dictionary drills my first week of class and I've had no trouble using a Chinese dictionary since.  It's a simple as finding a symbol on a chart, figuring out the remaining number of strokes, then just turning to the right page.</p>
<p>There are two key learning points to this method that are getting lost as more and more digital natives never learn how to use a paper dictionary.  One is that you learn the radicals and their frequency of use as you go, and the other is that you're constantly writing characters out as you figure out the number of strokes.  Years later when I went back to teach at the same school I would always drive home the importance of this method to my students (who of course ignored me and would just start drawing on their phones until the translation software figured it out).</p>
<p>Also, Chinese is three times more spoken than Spanish and as the post-opening Chinese diaspora explodes throughout the world, so too is the language.  It's a great choice for a second language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify I wasn't trying to diss Mandarin as a language by saying I might prioritize Spanish. With China's economic rise to power there's probably a good chance that Mandarin starts to become the lingua franca over the next century as more people learn it. I'm just saying as an American citizen Spanish would probably have more applications in my life with the growing number of Spanish speakers here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really simpler than it looks. Chinese grammar compared to our languages in the west is super simple. What takes a lot of work is learning to write characters, but with patience and a bit of discipline you can get there. Also I find writing Chinese characters way more entertaining than writing latin letters, so that helps.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think learning Mandarin will be insanely tough. I'm not sure how some westerners do it, but Mandarin is my mother tongue, and really often I find that I cannot translate some words in Mandarin to English, even though English is my first language. Plus, it's really tough to explain the fact that it's better to use some phrases instead of others at times even though they have the same meaning. I think when we speak or write Mandarin, it comes naturally to us, but if we were asked to explain how we knew what to write/say... Well, even if we could explain, I doubt a non-native Mandarin speaker would understand! </p>
<p>That being said, I'm not a professional tutor or anything, and if you really find the language interesting, please attempt to learn it! It's truly a beautiful language. c:</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh? Mandarin is your mother tongue but English is your first language??</p>
<p>Mandarin is really easy to learn to SPEAK. Unfortunately, most teachers feel the need to introduce the WRITING far too early which makes learners feel that the language is insurmountable.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people in China are unable to read, yet they have no problem speaking.</p></div>		</li>
