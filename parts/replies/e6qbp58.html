			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are looking at corrective surgery DO NOT GO TO A CHEAP SURGEON!!!! This is your eyes and all surgeons are not the same. Lots of people have gotten good results at a discount but every person I've talked to that had problems with their surgery went to a bargain doc. Save money in other areas of your life, not on the person cutting into the only set of eyes you will ever have.</p>
<p>I paid $4k 20 years ago to have my eyes done by the best surgeon in Southern California (at the time) and it was the best money I've ever spent.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was “lucky”enough to have cataract surgery this year at the age of 43. I went from -17 myopia to seeing 20/25 without glasses. I lost my near vision but it’s been well worth it. I used to have to wear contacts to take a shower. It feels like a miracle. Unfortunately due to the extreme myopia I have other eye issues but for now I’m seeing very well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you start seeing straight lines as curves, that's a sign you're getting far-sighted as well as near-sighted. Multifocals are your friend - you're already used to glasses and probably to reading close by looking past the bottom edge. </p>
<p>Depending on how extreme your near-sightedness is, your glasses might become lighter (happened to my mom). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I've heard some stories about near-sighted-ness getting better over time but also stories about them getting worse because everyones eyes get worse over time.</p>
<p>Without my glasses, things start to blur about a foot from my face so if my eyes only get worse, I'll need bifocals</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you mean that someone nearsighted who has developed presbyopia gets used to reading close by looking past the bottom edge? I wear glasses for nearsightedness and have never done this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. in fact, if you already need distance correction in the eye that's being operated on, they'll take that into account when  fitting you with a replacement lens. Afterwards your distance vision should be close to 20/20 again.   The replacement lens is not flexible though, so it still won't be able to correct for your reading needs.</p></div>		</li>
