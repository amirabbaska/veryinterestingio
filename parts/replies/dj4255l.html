			<div class="markdown"><p>He explained it... when you look at others, your minds eye focuses on more prominent features about them, and &quot;the big picture&quot;: how they look over all. You are focusing on big recognizable things like complexion, eye/hair color, general built, etc. With yourself every time you look you overlook major features and focus on things that others normally don't notice, which changes the &quot;big picture&quot; for you as well. </p></div>		</li>
