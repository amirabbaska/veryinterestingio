			<div class="markdown"><p>What's really interesting is that &quot;water&quot; in the form of hydrated minerals that you mentioned can travel down to hundreds of kilometers depth (~400-600 km if I recall correctly, the limits are based on melting processes described below). </p>
<p>This water can start out as liquid water that seeps into oceanic crusts and bonds with minerals there. But the crust isn't  static, it is on a tectonic plate that moves. When the plate moves, it pushes against other plates and can be forced downward (subducted) into the mantle. So the water inside can ride that subduction plate all the way into the mantle. </p>
<p>Now in the mantle, there's a big difference between the subducted plate and the rock around it: it has water in it. That water causes the rock in the subducted plate to melt more easily than regular mantle rock. So as the plate subducts and gets heated by the mantle it starts to melt. The melted rock is less dense and rises to the surface to form volcanoes. </p>
<p>That's why there are arcs volcanoes several hundred km behind subduction zones in the ocean, e.g. all the arcs that make up the <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10085661/tectonics_world_map_600.jpg" target="_blank">Pacific Ring of Fire</a>.  Here's a <a href="https://nature.nps.gov/geology/education/images/GRAPHICS/DETO_Backarc_basin_WEB.jpg" target="_blank">cartoon showing this process.</a> (Sorry for the big segue from water to volcanoes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That illustration is a bit misleadingly labelled. It's ambiguous at best to just say 'melting of downgoing plate' when we are dealing with just trying to convey the general cases. Some researchers say that the sediment package in the subducted material does melt, whilst others simply say that dewatering of the sediments occurs due to pressure increase. </p>
<p>The actual oceanic crust subducted also undergoes dehydration through metamorphic reactions which supplies the bulk of water entering the mantle through subduction, as you say. </p>
<p>The way I understand it is that this water and other volatiles are driven off into the overlying wedge of asthenospheric mantle, which is the rock that (partially) melts and produces the magma that eventually causes an arc of volcanoes behind subduction zones. </p>
<p>Melting of the actual subducted tectonic plate is atypical simply because the basaltic crust cannot generally be heated enough to melt at any given pressure it will experience once subducted. In the cases in which subduction angle is shallow enough and the subducted plate is young enough, slab melting only ever makes a minor contribution to the magma being generated at subduction zones, resulting in the interlayering of adakites with erupted products of more typical composition. </p>
<p>For a full discussion on subduction processes, <a href="http://www.tectonics.caltech.edu/meetings/brownbag/files/2006/SternSubdct2002.pdf" target="_blank">Robert Stern's 2002 review paper</a> is excellent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's the mantle overlying the subbducted slab that melts to form magma, as a result of hydration from water leaving the slab. The slab itself continues being subducted a very long way past the volcanic arc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, in theory, if you drilled a wide and deep borehole under Yellowstone Lake, to let it drain down into the mostly crystalized mush underneath the park, then those sensationalized news stories that predict doom and gloom would at least have a slightly higher chance of coming true?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your bore hole is releasing the pressure you need for the water to form hydrated minerals, so the water would probably boil off from high temps, low pressure. Also the timescale on this process is over millions of years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>is (perhaps) true, but not because the crust is a verdant jungle of intense life.  It is plausible because surface life only get to live in a thin layer of soil, and a slightly less thin oceanic layer; whereas the crust is a huge 3D space dozens of km thick.  Even if the density of life (ie. living cells per m^3 ) is very low, the vast amount of liveable space makes it possible for there to be more total living organisms.</p>
<p>edit: to be clear, this isn't a criticism of the answer in any way.  Just heading off a potential misunderstanding for the OP.</p></div>		</li>
