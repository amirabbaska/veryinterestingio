			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, some people in the Philippines kinda do this too - the mother's maiden name is taken as a middle name (not hyphenated). This is likely a holdover from having been under Spanish occupation for centuries. It helps with identification, since for such a long time they had a relatively small register of names, and having so many 'Matthew Arroyo's in one place would get confusing sharpish. Myself and all my siblings have our Filipina mother's maiden name as a (additional) middle name. I'd like to carry on the tradition if I have kids myself, but every girlfriend I've had the talk about having kids with has vehemently rejected the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's a very Spanish thing. I wish you the best luck convincing your eventual wife on keeping that. </p>
<p>On another note, somewhat unrelated, as a Filipino, you can get the Spanish nationality through 2 years residence,rather than the usual 10, precisely because of all the Spanish blood running in the country.</p></div>		</li>
