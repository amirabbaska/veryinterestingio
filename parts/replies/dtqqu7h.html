			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty common not to, anecdotally. I'm one of the only people I know who gets the burn, and a few family members do as well. My friends don't, they looked at me like I'm crazy when I said it's why I don't like soda.</p>
<p>Weird thing is that alcohol and smokes don't hurt nearly as bad, for me,  whereas they can't stand either (yet still smoke/drink, they just use coffee/chase to help with the burn).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I believe that yall are talking about the same thing; &quot;scratchy&quot; actually sounds worse than &quot;burning&quot; to me when it comes to food.</p>
<p>I posit that people who are bothered by the sensation are more likely to label it as a &quot;burning&quot; sensation, whereas people who are not bothered at all by it are still feeling the same sensation, but just never label it in such an unpleasant way.</p>
<p>It's &quot;tingly&quot;; but you show me the human being who says that carbonated-water feels flat, instead of tingly, and I will show you a lizard-person in disguise.</p>
<p>To make a slightly analogous observation, you know the feeling commonly described as &quot;pins-and-needles&quot;, which some people describe using words like &quot;unbearably painful&quot;? Yeah I feel the same thing, but I am <em>almost</em> never even bothered by it. I have had it hurt before, and it's still the exact same feeling. The difference really does seem to be &quot;all in your head&quot;, just down to the very subjective experience of pain.</p>
<p>So rather than seeing much evidence for a difference between people, besides that which is already very subjective like pain, what I see here is simply evidence for a failure of people to communicate their common experiences.</p></div>		</li>
