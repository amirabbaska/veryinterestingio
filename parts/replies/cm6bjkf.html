			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, particularly groundwork in physics tends to become more and more expensive the closer we get to phenomena that don't just happen every day on earth all by themselves. And usually we find what we're looking for (neutrinos, for example) and when we do it's not a big surprise any more, but often, when we repeat the experiments and look closer, we find that what we initially found is quite different from what we expected (like neutrinos having mass). Usually to come up with this is going way beyond simply analyzing and interpreting the data, you also have to extend the theoretical framework. So from initial experiment to Nobel price can take a very long time, and involve different people.</p></div>		</li>
