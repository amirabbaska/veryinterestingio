The bleeding is a result of inflammation(gingivitis) stemming for improper dental care. Metaplasia of internal cells is usually a response to an inappropriate stimulus, and as such is generally negative especially in response to a mechanical irritant. </p>
<p>To answer your last question, brushing the stomach would initially likely lead to irritation and recovery. Persistent brushing may lead to inflammation and metaplasia or death of the lining cells, and could lead to an ulcer depending on the amount of damage done. I couldn't say for sure if constant damage would result in tissue scarring, the tissue of which may be more resistant to perforation but would be unable to perform the stomach's proper duties, and would probably cause a host of issues including underproduction of stomach acid and overgrowth of bacteria like H. pylori. </p>
<p>The best example of purposefully altering tissue is breakdown and rebuilding of muscle in weightlifting. I can't think of any examples of cellular changes that would be caused purposefully by mechanical stimulation but impractical, given the nature of medicine to develop methods that are practical. </p></div>		</li>

Often times after vaginal deliveries with uncontrolled hemorrhaging, medical staff will &quot;massage&quot; the uterine fundus, which releases prostoglandins that help limit the bleeding.</p></div>		</li>
