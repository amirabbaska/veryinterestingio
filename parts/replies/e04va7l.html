			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on bed rest because I struggled keeping my balance after lacking the nutrients to keep functioning normally. I also lost all the coloring in my face and looked like a ghost. It's been 5 months and I still have bathroom and digestive issues from my stomach being screwed of its priobiotics. I'm on supplements to get it all back to normal but could take awhile. Maybe I'm jinxed because I've had food poisoning 5 times in the past 20 years.</p></div>		</li>
