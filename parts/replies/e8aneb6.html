<p>I do audio engineering. Certain transformers that are used in the signal path are prized for their particular flavor of distortion and their ability to impart certain harmonics into the signal. Given that they’re both induction devices, is this similar to the “slip” that you describe?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is from Jensen Audio.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The permeability of magnetic materials varies with flux density. As shown in Figure 9, when magnetic field intensity becomes high, the material can saturate, essentially losing its ability to conduct any additional flux. As a material saturates, its permeability decreases until, at complete saturation, its permeability becomes that of air or 1. In audio transformer applications, magnetic saturation causes low-frequency harmonic distortion to increase steadily for low-frequency signals as they increase in level beyond a threshold. In general, materials with a higher permeability tend to saturate at a lower flux density. In general, permeability also varies inversely with frequency.
Magnetic hysteresis can be thought of as a magnetic
memory effect. When a magnetizing force saturates
material that has high-hysteresis, it remains strongly
magnetized even after the force is removed. High-
hysteresis materials have wide or “square” B-H loops
and are used to make magnetic memory devices and
permanent magnets. However, if we magnetically
saturate zero-hysteresis material, it will have no residual
magnetism (flux density) when the magnetizing force is
removed. However, virtually all high-permeability core
materials have some hysteresis, retaining a small memory of their previous magnetic state. Hysteresis can be greatly reduced by using certain metal alloys which have been annealed or heat-treated using special processes. In audio transformers, the non- linearity due to magnetic hysteresis causes increased harmonic distortion for low-frequency signals at relatively low signal levels. Resistor RC in Figure 8 is a non-linear resistance which represents the combined effects of magnetic saturation, magnetic hysteresis, and eddy-current losses.</p>

<p>Edit: interestingly there’s apparently a method for making low-hysteresis magnets by pulverizing the magnetic material and suspending it in an epoxy material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, slip is more akin to lag because the magnetic fied in the rotor is induced by the stator which creates a magnetic phase delay, there is more physics involved but thats the closest way to explain it, things get even more strange if you involve switched reluctance motors which are gaining lots of popularity as rare earth prices skyrocket due to electric vehicles, im a perm magnet motor the rotor field is &quot;free&quot; you get it from the magnets, both induction and srm you have to pay for the field with some percentage of stator power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, slip is an inconsistency between actual armature speed and the speed of the reversing poles of the motor. Which is science. What you're thinking of is transformer isolation.  Which in terms of audible distortion is magic.  The way each transformer &quot;sounds&quot; is down to its construction.</p>
<p>So, slip is kinda like &quot;latency&quot; and transformer flavors are dependent on physical construction of the transformer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it's doubtful they are direct on line. modern escalators are driven by VFDs which will control the speed and torque of the motor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, especially escalators which are on a timer and slow down or even stop when they are not in use.</p>
<p>Another question from my side: How much power does it take to run an escalator?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR - depending on height and number of passengers, between 6 and 30kW (7.5 and 40hp)</p>
<p>If we consider the case of an 'up' escalator, then the work done (ignoring friction etc.) is roughly the weight of the passengers times the height they are lifted, increasing their potential energy (m X G X h) (plus the weight of the mechanism, though at any given time, half the steps etc. are going back down around the loop underneath, which will be being assisted by gravity, so we can assume the mechanism weights roughly balance out).</p>
<p>If we suppose 10 people on the escalator, weighing 100kg each, then the escalator is moving 1000kg up some height, say 3m (one floor of a building), against the pull of gravity (9.81m/s2) which is roughly 30000J.</p>
<p>For power, you need to know the time it takes, hence we need to estimate the speed, which is probably around 0.3 m/s. If we assume a slope ratio of about 3 to 1, then the vertical speed is 0.1 m/s, taking 30 seconds to reach the top (which sounds a bit slow tbh). Power equals energy over time, or 30000/30 which is about 1000W or 1kW. This sounds a bit low as well, but if we assume we are in the right order of magnitude, then a motor of between 1 and 10kW could run a small, slow escalator like the one in this assumption. This is about 1.3 to 13hp.</p>
<p>If we assume more weight (more passengers), a steeper slope, or a faster speed, then the power requirements would obviously be greater. There may also be some energy required to move the passengers along the horizontal axis of movement, but my physics is a little rusty on that point, and I know the vertical component is the important one, in terms of how much potential energy is gained.</p>
<p>A quick Google for 'escalator motor power', brought up an article (<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2010/08/how-much-energy-do-escalators-use.html" target="_blank">https://slate.com/technology/2010/08/how-much-energy-do-escalators-use.html</a>) that says a small 5m / 15ft escalator in a shopping mall for example, would use a 7.5hp (6kW) motor, so we are in the right ballpark, as the real world scenarios would allow for much greater peak loads (more passengers at any given moment), allow for frictional losses etc., And have some redundant capacity for safety and reliability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the escalator. Some use a variable frequency drive (VFD) to just vary the output frequency so they can ramp up speed when starting/stopping. This is similar to what the commenter above you is saying, just using different frequencies to control the speed of the motor. Others might use a VFD with some sort of feedback device to actually control the torque/speed directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t forget about the precision gearing as that is critical to move that much weight smoothly and with that much load variability. A direct drive motor for that much weight would be massive. </p></div>		</li>
