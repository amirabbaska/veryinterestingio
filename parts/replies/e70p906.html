			<div class="markdown"><p>And as to some explanation why such a small element has such large effect: Nearly all electrical signaling in the nervous system is due to different concentration of smallish ions like sodium, potassium or chloride. That's most likely how Lithium works. By either blocking some ion channels or the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a lot more complicated than that. Lithium causes many changes and appears even to have some regulatory effects on neurotransmitters including seratonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and GABA. On the other hand, sodium is itself regulated by neurotransmitters  like seratonin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, But the way a small ion affects those neurotransmitters would be due to ion channels or potential differences. And because it's so small, it would be extremely unspecific in its effects.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Didn't 7up have Lithium in it for a while?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithium is also in the same family or period as Sodium. So it’s chemically very similar. I don’t know about the pharmacology of it, but I do know about the chemistry of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also there are studies that find that lithium in the water supply helps reduce suicide. So it's not just bipolar, you can get a low dose for heavy frequent suicidal thoughts. Though at a lower dose. I'm on 300mg. Normal dose is 600-900mg for bipolar. I can still get side effects if dehydrated. Which happened once. I got attacked by lights. A both hilarious and terrifying experience. I now stay hydrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lithium needs to be at a specific ratio in the blood in order to be therapeutic. A safe blood level of lithium is 0.6 and 1.2 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Lithium toxicity can happen when this level reaches 1.5 mEq/L or higher. Severe lithium toxicity happens at a level of 2.0 mEq/L and above, which can be life-threatening in rare cases. Levels of 3.0 mEq/L and higher are considered a medical emergency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While what you said is true the metabolization of lithium is relatively  variable person to person.  What is 300mg for you could be the equivalent of 600mg for me.  That's why we check the blood levels of it and titrate appropriately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve learned it really depends. My symptoms started when I first went on antidepressants, and last year I was hospitalized for psychosis. As soon as I started lithium and seroquel for sleep, things fell much more into place and I’ve had better motivation to take care of myself and consider this my best life. I should probably give myself more credit, since some of my issues did require changing harmful thought patterns, but the medication helped almost immediately. It’s not the same for everyone. But at least now I don’t live in fear of my own mind anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bruh most of the time I feel fucking fine, maybe the first 1-2 years after my diagnosis I would've been on board with a statement like that but I think part of successful long-term management is walking back the &quot;I walk a lonely road&quot; narrative just a little bit. </p>
<p>My two cents, obviously some people's symptoms just don't respond to treatment or there's no access to treatment and I don't mean to trivialize those situations.</p></div>		</li>
