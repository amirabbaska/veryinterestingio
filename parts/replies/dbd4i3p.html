<p>What happens is not a reflection, but a refraction. If you have an interface, where two substances of different density touch each other, the light is broken into another direction. A bubble for example, consists of air in the middle, then a thin layer of water held in place by the soap molecules, an then air again. The ambient light comes, and because there are so many random bubbles, is scattered into all directions randomly, also into our eye, where we then see it. </p></div>		</li>
