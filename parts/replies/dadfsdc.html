			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow this is weird; I was cleaning mine with earbuds yesterday and I thought to myself. I should do an ELI5 to ask why is it yellow. '(Then my thoughts drifted to bogies being green, poop being brown, giggled and made lunch)'</p>
<p>So now that I remember that conversation with myself..</p>
<p>..why is earwax yellow??  </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> well I didn't find out why it is yellow just a lengthy discussion on why it may or may not be good for you to clean your ear, and something about pinkeye.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy cleaning my ears with cotton buds, it sends shivers down my spine. I have over 20 years experience of solo cleaning. I will do with my ears as I please. So, fuck you all. Haters gonna hate, right?</p>
<p>Secondly, pinkeye doesn't come from cotton buds in the ear. It's best to fart from your bare ass, onto somebody's pillow, then the poo particles will cling to their eyes.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the ear canals have nerves of the parasympathicus which is why some people can get real orgasms by manipulation of the rear canal, and most people like the tingling feeling </p>
<p>Edit: *ear not rear</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Q-tips can actually push earwax deeper, dangerously close to your inner ear which can lead to hearing loss.</p>
<p>They also remove that protective wax and increase your risk of infection.</p>
<p>Hence why the boxes all say &quot;do not insert into ear canal&quot; on them! I still use them though because it just feels too gross not to. :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have one of those Japanese ear cleaners. Looks like a tiny egg whisk.</p>
<p>You twist it in there and all the wax gets collected in the spokes. </p>
<p>I feel disgust and fascination at the same time. Probably the same reason people watch YouTube videos of cysts being vacuated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.</p>
<p>But man, seeing this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ears like vaginas</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as the first several words of the response is weird. I braced myself for a far different response than you gave based on those first words.</p></div>		</li>
