			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is correct - see what /u/hitssquad said. The heat from the sun while in orbit isn't much greater, but there's no atmosphere to remove the heat. Only radiative cooling, which is substantially lower. In general, overheating is a significant problem that has to be addressed when putting people or satellites into space, often using arrays of fins. I'd hazard a guess that in fact you'd have no problem cooking the marshmallow.</p>
<p>Edit: did a quick back of the envelope calculation and I don't think you can quite get hot enough. You reach around 100C in space, and you need to get to 150C. If someone reminds me, I'll show my work, but it's late now, so it'll have to wait till tomorrow.</p>
<p>Edit 2: /u/Conotor did the same calculation further down but showed his work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with having only radiative cooling... is you have identical only radiative heating. Once it reaches equilibrium, the marshmallow would be about the same as The Moon, since it's experiencing the same physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, while the heat from the sun just outside of earths atmosphere may be insubstantial, the upper levels of the atmosphere itself range from 800 to 1700 fahrenheit  (420-920 Celsius). That being said, the air is so thin up there that it would take a while to actually heat the marshmallow to suitable cooking temperatures. Also due to the thin air, the marshmallow would not catch fire, and would expand substantially (slightly less than in the vacuum of space).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The higher you go upwards, the more dramatically less dense the air gets. Less dense = fewer air molecules bouncing around to transfer energy = less heat/total-energy transferred to the marshamallow. So even though particles in space can be extremely high temperature, there's so few of them that the heat/total-energy is almost irrelevantly low.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even higher. Much higher. Where this is talking about planes wouldn't have enough atmosphere to gain lift. I would assume their jet engines might also choke out as well. This is the very last layers of the atmosphere. Sort of the skin of the onion when looking at onions for a layer depiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What they are talking about is the thermosphere, which extends from about 60 km above the earth to 500 or 1000 km. This is where the space station resides along with several low orbit satellites. Temperatures can reach 4500 Fahrenheit but you would be very cold because there aren't enough molecules to transfer that energy to you. Temperature is a measurement of the energy of a system while heat is a measure of the amount of energy transferred. So something can have a high temperature but be very cold.</p>
<p>Edit: as pointed out below, it wouldn't be cold nor hot since the same logic would apply both ways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The max heat the marshmelow will reach is the heat that allows it to emit blackbody radiation at the same rate the sun heats it.  </p>
<p>If you put 390 K in this calculator you get about 1300w/m^2, the sun's intensity around earth.
<a href="http://www.calcverter.com/calculation/stefan-boltzmann-law.php" target="_blank">http://www.calcverter.com/calculation/stefan-boltzmann-law.php</a>
That would also need a mirror behind the marshmallow so it is illuminated in the same area it can radiate from.  That is just 116 C.  </p>
<p>From this website
<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Rainy-Day-Quick-and-Easy-Oven-Roasted-Marshmallows/" target="_blank">http://www.instructables.com/id/Rainy-Day-Quick-and-Easy-Oven-Roasted-Marshmallows/</a>
it looks like you can cook a marshmellow at 200 C, ~475 K.  This is about 2900 w/m^2.  This means if you go sqrt(1/(2886/1300)) = 0.67 times as far from the sun as we currently are, you can cook a marshmallow.  Maybe you don't need 200C, we could try 116 C in the oven for a long time and see if it works.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what I did, just didn't include any work, so thank you! The one thing to consider is the emissivity and absorptivity may be very different, which would change these numbers, but probably not enough to make a difference in any case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we want to bring the outside of the marshmallow well above the temperature of the interior if we're going for the classic brown-on-the-outside marshmallow, as opposed to the marshmallow reaching an equilibrium temperature. Really, we need somebody with a big laser to test this for us. </p>
<p>Also, a marshmellow isn't a blackbody, so your number will probably be a bit off.</p>
<p>I guess if we want to refine it from a theoretical perspective, we need to know some of the thermal properties of marshmallow (heat capacity and thermal conductivity, mainly) as well as it's opical properties.</p></div>		</li>
