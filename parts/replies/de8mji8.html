			<div class="markdown"><p>Both jokers are important in the card game &quot;Pitch&quot;; they count as two of 6 possible point cards in each hand: high, low, four jacks.  Two of those 4 jacks are the jacks in the color of the trump suit, and the other two are the jokers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the Wikipedia that I linked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Created as a trump card for Euchre, it has since been adopted into many other card games where it may function as a wild card.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/euchre/" target="_blank">http://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/euchre/</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Euchre (and its variations) is the reason why modern card decks were first packaged with jokers, a card originally designed to act as the right and left &quot;bowers&quot; (high trumps).</p>
