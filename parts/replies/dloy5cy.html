<p>Typical yields are under 1%, so to get 1 gram of graphene, you're usually looking at about 1 kg of graphite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess it is not an error since you say that the typical yields are unter 1% but 1% of 1 kg would be 10 g  -  just wanted to say this because it made me stop and calculate...</p>
<p>btw - nice explanation </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but more commonly the yield ends up around 0.1 to 0.3%. I didn't want to give too specific a range though, as exact values are highly variable, and some papers so claim yield closer to 1% or even more. Devil is in the details though, usually higher yield methods in this route directly implies lower quality and not purely monolayer graphene. Depending on application, this can be a big problem.</p></div>		</li>
