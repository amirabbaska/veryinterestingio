			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that Corona is intentionally exposed to UV light after packaging. The hop presence in the beer is so minimal that the effect isn't great, and it creates &quot;that Corona flavor.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: it seems Corona only does this with their canned beers, with makes sense of you think about it. In this case, the slight &quot;skunky&quot; flavor is desirable.</p>
<p>Other clear bottle beers like Miller MGD don't use real hops.</p></div>		</li>
