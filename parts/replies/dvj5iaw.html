			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, doesn't seem a valid study because if the give them oxygen it would be because their state requires it and if you don't it would be because the can breath properly. So you'd wind up comparing them by development stage at birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about the how the epi studies in humans were handled (it was a slide from one of my colleagues lectures). From that I know that premature infants exposed to a higher concentration of oxygen compared to others (as they'd have to be exposed to oxygen regardless) have a higher odds of early childhood heart failure (thus, controlling for the effect of prematurity and only looking at oxygen and presumably other confounders/effect modifiers). I recall there also being studies with high oxygen in infants exposed to it for other health problems that aren't premature. I also do know that in experimental studies with mice, they note that hyperoxia in neonatal stages of pups equivalent to humans at 24 weeks causes permanent changes to the architecture of the lung.</p>
<p>As for mechanism: Anti-oxidant genes are not highly expressed in a developing infant before birth (as they're inside the uterus, unexposed to atmospheric oxygen). Those anti-oxidant genes are highly expressed after birth, but if the infant is born prematurely, the developmental switch to transcribe those genes will not yet be turned on, so the premature baby, also exposed to higher than atmospheric oxygen will suffer from greater oxidative stress during early life development without the molecular mechanisms to deal with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the study: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Stevens+et+al.+Pediatr+Pulmonol+45%3A+371-9%2C+2010" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Stevens+et+al.+Pediatr+Pulmonol+45%3A+371-9%2C+2010</a></p>
<p>And my mistake, it was babies with low birth weight and cumulative oxygen exposure, not prematurity. Another slide showed some data from premature babies with varying oxygen concentrations but it hasn't been published yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really work that way.</p>
<p>Reactive oxygen species are important signaling molecules for a variety of normal homeostatic processes. We need those molecules to turn sulfur switches on cysteine residues on or off, which regulates many cellular processes. They only become a problem and damage DNA and other macromolecules when the amount becomes so high that it overpowers anti-oxidant mechanisms like Nrf2 signaling or glutathion oxidized to reduced form ratio.</p>
<p>Anyway, science aside, breathing less oxygen as an adult human will not help you be healthier.</p></div>		</li>

Are elderly people that use o2 tanks at more risk to develop problems? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s really hard to say, as cancer is a very complex disease, involving multiple mutations to genes to occur. We evolved around oxygen, so if there had been less oxygen to begin with, our relative sensitivity to it would probably end up being the same. We are constantly bombarded with oxidative stress, and to an extent we are resistant to it and also dependent on it for normal signaling pathways needed for cell survival (ie. some stress is good). Also as we depend on mitochondria, oxidative stress is inevitable.</p>
<p>If we suddenly lowered O2 in the air now, it may be possible, as fewer mutations would happen. Though we would have to adapt ways to deal with low O2, like more red blood cells in those living at high altitude, or those born at high altitude tend to be shorter and barrelchested in a way that’s based entirely on environment and not genetics.</p></div>		</li>
