			<div class="markdown"><p>It gets better...</p>
<p>Ever wondered why most, if not all AR-15 type rifles have flash hiders on the end of the barrel?  </p>
<p>That's because the 5.56x45mm rifle cartridge was designed for a 20&quot; barrel.  So the powder charge is designed to keep burning and pushing the bullet all the way through that 20&quot; barrel, with little to no burning propellant left over.</p>
<p>Most modern rifles prefer a shorter (14/16/18&quot;) barrel for weight, balance and ergonomic reasons, which is fine...  But that cartridge is still designed for the 20&quot; barrels of yesteryear.  So when the bullet leaves the end of those modern barrels, there's still anywhere from 2 to 6&quot; worth of burn time left on the powder charge, and that blasts out behind the bullet as a fireball.  And if you're shooting in low light conditions or at night, that fireball is going to ruin your night vision really quick.</p>
<p>So the flash hiders serve to scatter and dissipate those leftover fireballs so they have as little impact as possible on your ability to see what you're shooting at.  As a happy extra benefit (for the military, at least), it makes it a little bit harder for anyone you may be shooting at to fire back at a series of nice, clear muzzle flashes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most ordinary bows are considerably less powerful than 150 pounds. You need an incredible physique to draw a bow like that. It's an efficient, cheap, primitive weapon. But an asthmatic weakling can easily load a 500-pound crossbow. Which is easy to teach and learn, but complex to manufacture.</p></div>		</li>
