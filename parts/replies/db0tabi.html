			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say balancing two hearts would be much more complicated than two of other organs. I thought that would qualify as irreducible complexity with no practical evolutionary path. Your point about our hearts being <em>like</em> two hearts is a good one, though. Perhaps they <em>were</em> separate and then solved the problem of coordinating them by combining into one organ with a unified control system. Or maybe we evolved from Gallifreyans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The right and left heart do essentially function as two separate organs. The right heart provides blood to the lungs and the left heart to the rest of the body. </p>
<p>I don't agree with your characterization that they 'fight' each other. If anything, they complement one another. If the right heart cannot deliver enough blood to the left heart, the left heart cannot do its job. This is common in right ventricular failure or pulmonary hypertension. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think if they were running in parallel (both moving blood from and to the same places), or if they were in series with one pumping straight into the other, they would be fighting each other, but since they run in series with the body and the lungs between them as loads, they work together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yours is an interesting and original post on this topic. Yes, the heart may be in fact two hearts fused together. Now that's a very interesting and notable creative moment. </p>
<p>I'd bet you do this a lot of the time, too. Creativity is so very rare, and wonderful. 1 of the &quot;pleasures of philosophy&quot; as Aristotle knew and wrote.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heart is essentially two pumps; however they affect each other quite intimately because of their proximity. When the left ventricle is exposed to high pressure or volume, it transmits the pressure through the share septum and compress the right ventricle, affecting its function. </p></div>		</li>
