			<p>Look into Japanese sword making as well. They have known about this issue for a long time. So what they do is use a soft metal on the inside of the sword so the inside is flexible but they use a hard steel on the outside for durability. <br><br>Cool thing with certain Damascus swords is they have Carbon Nanotubes in them. We are still trying to figure out how ancient sword smiths use to input the Nanotubes. It was most likely from a certain process they accidentally used.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah I originally had a bit in my answer contrasting Japanese and European sword making but I cut it out for brevity.<br><br>Damascus swords were known to have plant fiber burned in with the steel (intentionally), which I have heard as the explanation for how they were able to consistently produce carbon nanotubes.  I don't buy the idea that it was an accident, as that contains a bit of the common modern condescension for the past, as if the people back then were less intelligent (they weren't), or less knowledgeable (with regards to swordmaking, they weren't), and doesn't jive with the consistency of the sword quality.<br><br>They didn't know the chemistry behind carbon nanotubes, but swordmaking back then was a very empirical process, and the beautiful thing about that aspect of science is that you don't <em>have</em> to understand something to make it usable.<br><br>Also, at cutting competitions with Katanas it is not unusual for Katanas to be bent, and then be manually straightened out.  Even with the lamination they just aren't springy like European swords, which had to deal with fencing, parrying, and generally heavier armor, which would bend and break stiffer blades.  Japanese sword fighting is all about the big, killing slash, even against armored opponents.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think you are confused. Japanese knife makers use a very hard and brittle &quot;core&quot; with milder steel at the sides (less carbon content), to prevent the blade from breaking. The metal with more carbon content is in the middle and cuts. The sides support it and help making the knife stronger. <br>Or maybe I'm misinterpreting  your comment. Both steels are outside at some point. The spine should stay mild to give the blade toughness tho.</p>		</li>
