			<div class="markdown"><p>This also works in Words With Friends game app; and is one reasons (there are others) my GF and I refer to it as Make Believe Words (MBW).  It's kind of a silly game but gives us something to do in our medium-long distance relationship.</p>
<p>One feature of MBW is the &quot;Tile Bag&quot; that let's you see what letters have not yet been played.  There's a bug(?) in this feature such that as the game nears it's conclusion and all the letters have been distributed to the players, you can still see letters in the Tile Bag, but they are actually the letters in your opponent's tray (the letters they have left to play).</p>
<p>So one day we're getting to the end of a game and I'm leading by just a few points,  and I notice she has a Q and no U in her tray and there are no open U's on the board.  So I send her a teasing note saying &quot;Have fun playing that Q!&quot;.</p>
<p>She played QAT and I lost.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a bug, it's giving you access only to the information you already have, were you to do a tally yourself. You could start with spreadsheet of all tiles, and cross off everything you see is played and on your own rack, and you'd know what was on your opponents final rack (and have a good guess at the general end game before that). It's more work but it's simple and evident. So the program automates that process for you, giving both players the benefit without the notetaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Always bugged the hell out of me that you can have &quot;qi&quot; but not &quot;ki&quot; (the Chinese vs Japanese transcription of the same character). It's not like either are commonly used in English and if English speakers are writing about &quot;qi&quot;, they usually spell it &quot;chi&quot; anyway.</p></div>		</li>
