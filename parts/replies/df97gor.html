			<div class="markdown"><p>It does sound a bit inaccurate, but quick research indicates it's not entirely implausible. Based on <a href="http://www.thyssenkruppaerospace.com/materials/aluminum/aluminum-sheet/weight-calculations.html" target="_blank">this example</a>, a 1mm thick sheet of the aluminum alloy described that's 2.5m x 1.25m weighs 8.75kg. Furthermore, curiosity is a fairly large vehicle (like a small car) and has six wheels. I'm not going to do all the math, but I think it's reasonable to estimate it's possible. </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/08190630-curiosity-wheel-damage.html" target="_blank">This</a> source claims 1mm would add 10kg. I'm not sure how reputable it is, but just throwing it out there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Curiosity's wheels are roughly 50 cm in diameter and 40 cm wide. u/Tre3beard says the current design has the wheels at 0.75 mm meaning the current inner diameter is approximately 49.925 cm. If we were to add another mm that would change to 49.825 cm. We can approximate the added weight by modeling it as a hollow cylinder with an outer diameter of 49.925 cm, inner diameter of 49.825 cm, and width of 40 cm. Plugging that into <a href="http://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1340330749" target="_blank">this calculator</a> gives us an added volume of 1,253.5 cm^3 per wheel. With 6 wheels the total volume of new material would be 7521 cm^3. Aluminum's density is roughly 2.7 grams/cm^3 meaning this added material would have a mass of approximately of 20.3 kg. It would seem that such a seemingly small addition would add mass on that magnitude. Crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beer cans are made from sheet metal, created by rolling metal between gradually closer sets of rollers, until the correct thickness is achieved.</p>
<p>Milling, on the other hand, is done by removing material with a spinning tool, whuch looks a bit like a cut-off drill bit. Much more force involved, much more likely to tear the material or cause heat stresses.</p>
<p>Search youtube for &quot;metal milling&quot;, and you'll see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In lower gravity, though...</p>
<p>Actually, it's fairly thick. It's about the thickness of the sheet metal in your car, and it has plenty of support structures.</p>
<p>Milling to that thickness, though, requires precision.</p></div>		</li>
