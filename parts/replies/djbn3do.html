			<div class="markdown"><p>Most current crypto currencies allow new money to enter the supply as a reward for contributing &quot;work&quot; to maintaining the block chain. There is a no reason it has to be that way. </p>
<p>The block chain is just a public ledger of transactions so you could use any mechanism you choose to add new currency to it. So there is no reason that the current system of money control (central bank lending and new the issuance of new bank loans) couldn't be used instead to new money to add to the ledger.</p></div>		</li>
