			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I mean, I can't speak to that totally because it depends on the cross-reactivity of the viruses and the antigen that the theoretical vaccine uses. Since we don't have one yet, it's hard to answer. Ideally, there would be. </p>
<p>In theory, in some theoretical bivalent vaccine that deals with both HSV-1 and HSV-2. A patient who receives the vaccine but has HSV-1 may be protected against HSV-2 or vice-versa, indeed there is already some mixed evidence that natural infection with one may confer some incomplete protection agains the other, though the data for this goes back and forth often. </p>
