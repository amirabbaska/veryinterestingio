			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing you didn't mention is that most babies will stop crying if the person carrying it starts moving in a rhythmic way, i.e. running. This is thought to be a instinctual response to flight from predators or a call back to locomotion between trees where the parent and child would be exposed to predators. It is also why a child can be calmed by rocking, bouncing and swaying.</p></div>		</li>
