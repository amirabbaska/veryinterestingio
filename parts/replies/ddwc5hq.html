			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer.</p>
<p>Race is a largely meaningless (from a biological perspective) cultural construct which asserts that specific combinations of arbitrary physical traits are grouped together to define a universally common subset of humanity. This is imprecise at best, and misleading at worst. Humanity is diverse and not uniform. There is a full spectrum of variation between people, and this variation is mixed and matched often and at will. Any categorization of such a system is inherently meaningless since there is little to justify such differentiation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I don't get is that the human family tree is literally a directed acyclic graph. Physical traits are hereditary and follow this graph and are geographically clustered. There is some meaning in that structure.</p>
<p>Certain isolated parts of it will correspond to specific social ideas of race quite well. Of course there are people with ancestries so varied it would be meaningless to try and classify them with a race label but that isn't a reason to throw the baby out with the bath water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, which is why he said it's imprecise at best. Of course if someone's black or white it's easy to tell, but if you're ever met a &quot;brown&quot; person you'd be amazed at how many weird guesses we get based on someone's half-baked idea of what races are - are you Israeli/Sicilian/Armenian/Arab/Indian?? It breaks down pretty fast if it's your #1 criteria for identifying people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some racial differences beyond the superficial ones.  For example, some first line blood pressure medications have diminished effect for black people, so they're not recommended to be used.  Another example being that a certain blood thinner doesn't work in half the Asian population due to a variance in liver enzymes.</p>
<p>I realize your post is probably talking about social situations, but I just thought I'd mention this in case anyone found it interesting.</p></div>		</li>
