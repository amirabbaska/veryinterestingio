			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explaining, </p>
<p>On your first edit, you said blowmold heads replaced.
Are you talking about the mandrels?</p>
<p>And molds do not really wear, except for trimming area.
We have had ours for 5 years and it still not broke in.</p>
<p>Thin or thick bottles have to do with the mandrel getting opened more or less.
Only thing is we usually keep it at 57 grams or a little higher.
If you adjust too much on one, it would take away plastic from other molds and cause issues.</p>
<p>That video is very correct ( I see it 4 days a week) and there cooling bed is better shape.
That is a 4 head blowmold.
Suprises me how slow its actually running ( this machine in video )</p>
<p>My machine runs 6 jugs in just under 6.5 seconds</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey thanks!  I was thinking about the mold - the part that shaped the jug.  I know maintenance would be called and on occasion they would &quot;replace&quot; one if QC asked for it.  They would also make &quot;adjustments&quot; that only they could perform.  I think when I said replace I was overly simplifying it trying to stay ELI5.  It gets complex fast.</p>
<p>I was told that &quot;full replacement&quot; was $10,000's so that was not done frequently.  I don't really know what maintenance did with them when they swapped one out on occasion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I apologize for getting complex.
We do not have maintenance work on the molds or any part of the machine if avoidable.
Mostly because of experience I do most of the maintenance and along with another person that I work with. I would rather keep maintenance out of the room :)
You are correct about full replacement value.
Problems you can have with any swap outs are many. Mold themselves do not wear out. Except for areas that get trimmed off in time. Or someone sticking a wrench in the molds.</p>
<p>One of the problems you can have is clamping on other molds , if you replace one ( and have a spare) it would mess up the other ones clamping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know them better than I do!!  I thought that video was slow too, maybe just for the video they slowed it?</p>
<p>I buy a competitor's milk sometimes and their jug seems like its built like a tank compared to ours.  Not sure if they just use more plastic or what.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't find a video of the plastic bead infeed where they are heated and melted and extruded to form that &quot;little plastic bag&quot;.  That bag is enclosed in the mold and blown where it takes the shape of the jug mold and then cooled and ejected.  The rough edges are trimmed off as you can see a bit of.</p></div>		</li>
