<p>The media is only a small part of the problem. Political socialization, especially for Americans, has started well before the decision to pick a news channel you like.</p>
<p>Remember, a person's formative years are most heavily influenced by their parents, schooling, a group of self-selected peers, and possible religious affiliation. So before the mass media could attempt to influence you, you've already made some decision.</p>
<p>Now you could say that there are studies show that the most rigid family structures results in teenagers (up to 50% of them) who reject the political ideology of their parents, but in that case, that is still a decision independent of media influence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Government and leadership are not binary, this-or-that-only concepts. They are complex and nuanced most often.  </p>
<p>Plurality/FPTP voting is extremist-inducing, habitual-contrarian-inducing, tribalistic garbage at this point in our evolution. We are better than that. </p>
<p>The diversity we see in culture and landscape across the nation and world needs to be reflected in how we vote. Something along the lines of &quot;Olympic style&quot; voting can do just that. A score of 0-10 given to each candidate in a race, highest score wins the election is much more in-tune with...you know, <em>reality.</em> </p>
<p>We owe it to ourselves and posterity to remove plurality/fptp voting. </p>

<p>Yet notice how we went from media automatically to news channels? Even if you watch the news you might not be able to grasp and understand some complex connections fully. Reading a detailed and well-acclaimed newspaper often gives better results but this is more time-consuming, more arduous and also more difficult. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the job of &quot;the media&quot;' to educate, it's their job to report accurately on the news (which, in fairness, often doesn't happen). And even if they did educate, if they started showing special reports every evening on political spending, people wouldn't tune in. People choose what content they want to consume, people tailor their Facebook/Twitter/Reddit feed to include the outlets of their choice. And actually America is one of the better countries in terms of being able to actually choose whom in &quot;the media&quot; they want to listen to. It's not as if FOX News is the only thing on TV. Now Australia on the other hand... there's a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even if we have law enforcement, criminologists, data scientists telling us year after year that the war on drugs has failed and is doing more harm than good, politicians will always run on a tough on crime, tough on drugs policy because the average voter won't be reading research papers on the drug war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a similar way, doctors keep prescribing (and patients keep asking for) ways of treatment that have been proven to be useless or even harmful. This means that resources get wasted and patients don't actually get better. </p>
