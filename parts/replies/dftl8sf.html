			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting how many people get to see animals. Then just think &quot;oh that's cool&quot; but in reality they saw an animal that no one has ever seen before. Or not in 100 years. It happens. We're not scientists. Most people that come Andries stuff won't be able to think too much of it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were actually really accurate. There's a great documentary on Netflix I believe(at least it was a few months ago) that has the story of the 1938 rediscovery of the species. A photo of a dead Coelacanth was sent to a specialist at a museum, and she was like &quot;I've seen this before!&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was giggling at the photographer who just threw some diving gear over his oxford shirt and khakis. I imagine that he hadn't planned to dive, but couldn't resist the opportunity to see the fish face-to-face. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No its all real. Also coelocanths are know to produce ambient musical tones. It's thought that this is to lull their prey into a false sense of complacency.</p></div>		</li>
