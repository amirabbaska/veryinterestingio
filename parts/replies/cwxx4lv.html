			<div class="markdown"><p>Fixing internall bleeding, breaks that require metal rods and screws or they won't heal at all, antibiotics to kill off Bactria that's killing you, controlling your temperature so that your brain dosent boil itself in your skull, those are just a few of the ways doctors actively heal you.
I'm sure I'm missing a whole lot more that would be examples of directly healing as I'm not a DR lol just a nursing student.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and all of the below. Anti epileptics, anti hypertensives, surgically removing cancers/chemo, stenting of arteries...we aren't totally useless. Though I'm a firm believer of 'getting better despite the doctor' though I wouldn't tell my patients that...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fresh clean blood, especially when you've lost a lot of your own, is just used by the body to then heal itself... I wouldn't say thats far different from lining up a bone. hip replacements don't happen in the ER. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the thing.  I think rerouting the plumbing of your heart is a good example of medicine actively fixing you.  Or diagnosing that you are missing some gene to produce an enzyme, and then using gene therapy to fix that gene, etc, etc.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a ridiculous question (which it is), but I'm genuinely curious. Say you have an abdomen injury as described above. Could you still get an erection? Or would the body just say, &quot;hey, fuckboy, priorities!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually in a lot of men when they die they get an erection, when you pass away your body relaxes the muscles that keep the artery to the penis closed, so blood can go in. This can, especially when combined with a position where the penis is not to high compared to the rest of the body, result in  post mortem erections.
This can be made even worse when during the embalming phase the embalming fluid is massaged trough the body, if the embalming fluid goes into the penis then it will be embalmed in an erect state . Morticians generally deal with this by applying duct tape. </p></div>		</li>
