<p>V vs B</p>
<p>Th vs T</p>
<p>Th (as in the) vs D</p>
<p>his vs her</p>
<p>she vs he</p>
<p>(his and her are just one gender neutral term in tagalog I think)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the mixup is because those letters aren't in the Filipino alphabet. </p>
<p>C, F, A, and V were originally not part of the Filipino alpabeto. </p>
<p>&quot;Siya&quot; is the term for him/her so a lot of Filipinos will confuse another person's gender. Don't be offended when a Filipino refers to your male friend as &quot;she&quot; because there's just no distinction in Tagalog. </p>
<p>Also don't be offended if you see Filipinos waving KKK. It was a rebel group (Katipunan) that sought independence for the Philippines from Spain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>When we say they don't have those letters, we mean their language doesn't distinguish them.</strong> (example time. Look at &quot;th&quot; in breathe and breath. (same mouth shape but one uses vocal cords) They are very similar sounds, but we differentiate them and they change the meaning of words the way mad and mat are different words. In Mandarin, x and sh are different sounds but in English we don't differentiate them and they both sound like sh. It's possible we can make/use both sounds in different contexts, like in between various vowels, but we don't hear the difference and just think we're saying sh each time. Like we could say esh and ash but a Chinese speaker would hear exsh and ash. (Exsh to say the Chinese sh sounding x, not eks which doesn't sound like esh. We use x to represent different sounds so maybe not clearest explanation.) <strong>They're basing the names off the vowel sounds eee and ehh.</strong> We may notice the p and f at the end but they don't. <strong>Ep and ef sound the same to them</strong> the way &quot;exsh&quot; and &quot;esh&quot; are both esh to us in my imaginary sounds example, which in imaginary Mandarin could be ironic as well, we just wouldn't notice. It could have been eff and fee, it just happens to not be this time. There's underlying reasons but they're too much to type right now. </p>
<p>Sorry for format and all the parentheses, my phone keyboard has been making things difficult lately so I'm stream of consciousness-ing instead of organizing paragraphs. I can try to elaborate or rephrase later if need be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the other way around. Filipino alphabet was latinized by the spaniards, so it used the abecedario, which is practically the same as the modern filipino alphabet.  I think the difference being is it used to have the letters ch and ll.</p>
<p>The abakada was a creation of Lope K. Santos which was adopted as the alphabet for the new &quot;Filipino&quot; language which was supposed to amalgamate different filipino languages but in reality is just really Tagalog. It was a way of indigenizing the abecedario, since practically no one really read and wrote alibata then (which was also very limited by then).</p>
<p>Also, this is why most places are spelled with letters not in abakada. e.g. Cebu, Boracay, Zamboanga (pronounced with an S, not Z), Nueva Ecija, etc...</p>
<p>Also, if you read, old Filipino literature, you'll find they will follow spanish ortography.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I was told is that when they come to America it's hard to adjust and sometimes they overcompensate and P turns into fee and then naturally F turns into ep. </p>
<p>There is P in their alphabet but no F. But like in most countries, dialects different from place to place so results may vary.</p></div>		</li>
