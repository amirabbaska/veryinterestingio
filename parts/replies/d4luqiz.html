			<div class="markdown"><p>As an interested layman:<br />
how could one explain an &quot;evenly laid out&quot; large number of black holes?  </p>
<p>Wouldn't they affect each other with their gravitation and make them cluster and collide?<br />
Certainly there is no way that their setup is so evenly balanced that they don't.</p>
<p>With all the movements in the galaxies, there is no way for such a balanced system to remain stable - too much entropy involved.</p>
<p>Or are there some explanations?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Stars in galaxies do not constantly collide either and are laid out fairly evenly distributed.</p>
<p>They most likely affect each other with their gravity in that they orbit the center of their galaxy, which is basically the main reason we came up with dark matter in the first place: &quot;What is all this stuff that has to orbit these galaxies but is not stars or other stuff we can see?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they are evenly distributed gravity from one would be roughly cancelled out by another one most of the time. Even if they were slightly out of alignment their mass is so ridiculously large that the deltaForce would be relatively small resulting in very little momentum change. </p>
<p>Since they are likely gravitationally bound to the galaxy but being on the rim means they'd have a lot of momentum. Whether something would clump would depend on their initial momentums. Gravitational objects can orbit each other billions of times before decaying enough to actually collide because their momentum causes them to miss until they lose enough momentum. Honestly, neither would likely decay enough to collide without 2 losing large amounts of momentum do to colliding with other stuff but then .... they still have incredibly large masses making it hard for them to lose much momentum in most collisions. </p>
<p>TLDR: these black holes are roughly evenly distributed and in orbit around the galaxy so no they wouldn't collide very often unless they are colliding with lots or very big stuff causing their orbit to decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't there some reason why dark matter was meant to be something other than blackholes? </p>
<p>(I remember blackholes being the obvious answer to &quot;what is dark matter&quot; and the reply being something like &quot;no, no, dark matter is different&quot; or something)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because these black holes must be in the halos of galaxies like ours where we should be able to detect them due to gravitational lensing. We didn't detect any so far. Much smaller black holes would not be detected but they would evaporate too fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A black hole that would evaporate now would have started out with the mass of a small asteroid at the beginning of the universe.</p>
<p>A black hole the mass of the earth would not even have started to evaporate because it would still be absorbing the &quot;too warm&quot; CMB.</p>
<p>Black holes the mass of the sun in the galactic halo would be absolutely invisible to our current technology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, black holes evaporate? What does that entail?</p>
<p>Do black holes that are small enough simply radiate more energy than they consume? Does/could this happen to larger black holes?</p>
<p>(I'm obviously not a physicist)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats what I thought too. But does this mean then, that the idea of ebenly distibuted primordial black holes is wrong?
I would think there are a lot of other mechanisms to get black holes with the same mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, you've answered my frustration that Ive had for years. Every article Ive read about where to find dark matter all sounded like they were making stuff up. Im glad there is finally some common sense discussion again.</p>
<p>No more billion dollar wimp detectors!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't see these smaller black holes, and we've looked.  However, this new observation of the gravitational waves might lead to the discovery of many many of these smaller black holes.</p>
<p>Black holes would fit into the category of dark matter, because we can't see them.   What we can &quot;see&quot; are the super huge black holes at the center of galaxies but only due to the effect of their gravity on the nearby region, and those are not the solution to dark matter.</p>
<p>Also, just to clarify some terms:  from <a href="http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/dark-matter/" target="_blank">http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/space/dark-matter/</a></p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps one of the most surprising discoveries of the 20th century was that this ordinary, or baryonic, matter makes up less than 5 percent of the mass of the universe.</p>
<p>The rest of the universe appears to be made of a mysterious, invisible substance called dark matter (25 percent) and a force that repels gravity known as dark energy (70 percent).&quot;</p></div>		</li>
