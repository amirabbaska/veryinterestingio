			<div class="markdown"><p>You gag because your distant ancestors gagged when exposed to potentially harmful substances.</p>
<p>That response kept enough of your ancestors alive, while your ancestors without that response died out.</p>
<p>Realistically, you gag because a million years ago your ancestor are something bad, and didn't die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple. Evolution's primary tool...<strong>death</strong>.</p>
<p><em>(Or more precisely, whether you get to reproduce or not. Being weakened and therefore unable to compete for mating rights also counts. It doesn't need to go so far as death. Simply, not being able to breed).</em>8</p>
<p>You are the product of a long and unbroken chain of surviving organisms, going all the way back to the first primitive single-celled life forms. The ones that survived did so because they inherited the adaptions of those that came before. While developing new ones by random minor variations.</p>
<p>One day, an animal had the variation to retch on seeing someone else retch. And they survived the poison they ingested where those around them did not. Therefore they survived. And reproduced, passing on this advantage down the chain. And then they too retched before they ingested something poisonous, again passing it on while others just died.</p>
<p>It's so useful in fact, that we're not the only species to evolve with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/N35z1UsXWSY?t=17" target="_blank">Dogs have it as well</a> (warning, dog vommiting).</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong> - On the variations part itself (as in how did the <em>first</em> animal get the gagging reflex), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU-7d06HJSs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=41" target="_blank">this is a great video talking about the number of mutations happening for each human</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wow that's one of the strangest genetic variation I have seen.But haven't humans evolved from eating raw carcasses of dead animals a long time ago making this variation useless? so a large part of our population today shouldn't have this trait.</p></div>		</li>
