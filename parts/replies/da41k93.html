			<div class="markdown"><p>I read the question a little differently: do the actual mechanics change with speed or turning? They can move their legs faster or slower, or take longer steps on the outside of a turn, but I wouldn't qualify those as different gates.</p>
<p>A run is not just a fast walk. A horse's trot is not just a slower canter.</p>
<p>In my uninformed observations, it appears that centipedes have one gait. They move a few legs forward at a time in a wave, and repeat the process. They can do this quickly or slowly. But I am completely unqualified in centipede observation. Can a centipede gallop?</p></div>		</li>
