			<div class="markdown"><p>it goes on of course, a newton is the amount of force needed to accelerate one kilogram 1m/s^2, a joule is the expension of one newton through one meter (the metric equivalent of foot-lbs). A degree celcius is one 100th of the difference between the freezing and boiling points of water at mean sea level pressure.  And so on.  </p>
<p>The french went so far as to try and develop a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar" target="_blank"> decimal time tracking system</a>.  They divided the day into 10 hours, every hour into 100 minutes, every minute into 100 seconds.  </p>
<p>Furthermore they setup 4 seasons as 3 months each of 3 10 day weeks.  </p>
<p>Obviously, this did not catch on.</p>

<p>Funny enough, it's also the precise amount of work required to move a 1C (coulomb) charge of electricity through 1V of potential. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Through Paris? Is that relevant? If we're talking about the geographical North Pole and not take mountains into account, the length should be the same through any point on the northern hemisphere, shouldn't it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was to the French; and, to be sure, the earth actually isn't a perfect spheroid. They actually surveyed the Paris meridian to determine the measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. Any great circle on earth is roughly 40,000km. Any two antipodes are roughly 20,000km apart, etc.</p>
<p>Not perfectly accurate, as earth isn't a perfect sphere and the original measurements were off by a fraction. But 40,000km is only &lt;0.5% over the true polar value and &lt;0.25% under the true equatorial value.</p></div>		</li>
