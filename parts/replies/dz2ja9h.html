As some pingos degrade, they can form rings ( I call them Ringos), but the rings tend to still have some relief or elevation. Also you should note that in areas that are prone to pingos, they still take 1000’s of years to form; that’s not likely during glacial retreat. I don’t think there is any evidence of pingos in Michigan. Not a bad guess though!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Glacial ice maps for that area of michigan show it completely covered 14K years and only a few miles from the ice front 9K years ago. One suspects it was both cold enough and remained that way long enough for 1000's of years to elapse and still form. I'm no expert and will take an experts opinion that they're not Ringos; however, I would be willing to bet they're some remenant of the glacial/post-glacial landforms rather than man made as the OP is seemingly wanting to convince himself. The age of the trees and level of erosion suggests they've been there long enough that some of the features you suggest (raised rim, conical central island) would have had time to subside. They are also relatively close to a stream/river and could have been formed during a glacial lake drain collapse - e.g. potholes formed along the outflow/outburst. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that area would have been under a tremendous amount of ice during the last glaciation. Another point to why they are not relict pingos, is that closed system pingos (by far the most common type) form under very specific conditions. Usually they occur as a lake drains very quickly, and the pore water of the soil is exposed to extreme cold. The soil tends to be a very fine silt, which allows capillary flow of water. This is why they are very common in the McKenzie River delta. What they are.... i have no clue. They do not appear to be any geomorphological feature.. so they may be man made? If they were glacier features, I’d expect to see evidence of erratics or moraines as well. Just a thought</p></div>		</li>
