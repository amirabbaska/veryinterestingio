			<div class="markdown"><p>According to wikipedia </p>
<blockquote>
<p>An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) is called a vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, and it must be obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it would appear that in some humans Vitamin D is a vitamin, and in others it is not...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a sliding scale of course...sometimes your body produces it, but not in enough quantity.  Vitamin B12 being one example I'm all too familiar with (to be accurate, it's your gut flora that produce it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's such a great point. Here's a great quote from the Wikipedia page that will validate you and your astuteness :) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vitamin D from the diet or skin synthesis is biologically inactive; enzymatic conversion (hydroxylation) in the liver and kidney is required for activation. As vitamin D can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient sunlight, it is not an essential dietary factor, and so not technically a vitamin.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it's technically not a vitamin! It's in this weird in-between space because it's not biologically active until it's converted from its inactive form to its active form via UV exposure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being directly biologically active isn't how one defines a vitamin. Most vitamins, especially variants used in pills, aren't very active on their own either, needing some other biological process to make it bioavailable</p>
<p>It is not always necessary to supplement Vitamin D, but it can be. It's better to call it a vitamin because there are plenty of people who do need to supplement their Vitamin D intake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will add two more things.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes you'll look at the Nutrition Facts on a food label or vitamin bottle and it'll say &quot;2000% of your daily required intake of Vitamin A&quot; or whatever. That just means that whatever you consume that isn't necessary will be excreted in the end. However, <a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/guide/effects-of-taking-too-many-vitamins#1" target="_blank">it is possible to overdose on vitamins</a>, just as it is possible to overdose on most things, so be careful.  </li>
<li><strong>This is crucial:</strong> vitamins and supplements are overwhelmingly not chemically verified by the FDA! <a href="https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm118079.htm" target="_blank">While they are subject to some FDA oversight, the truth is that the vitamin market is saturated with companies who market their products as one thing but who know there's no federal structure in place for validating this.</a> I really recommend looking into a place like <a href="https://labdoor.com/" target="_blank">LabDoor</a>, as they will validate a company's claims in their labs.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup one can overdose. The Inuit in Canada's far north use every single piece of everything they kill, but they don't eat the liver of seals because a few bites can kill a person due to vitamin A toxicity. There are a few theories that some of the first explorers of that area came to an end for this reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great question! There's actually some disagreement on this. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-get-your-nutrients-from-food-or-from-supplements" target="_blank">Here's a great article from Harvard Medical School about the subject.</a> Generally speaking, the idea is that your best source of vitamins will be from fresh foods, but that supplements are exactly that - they supplement your diet.<br />
Great example is scurvy. Back when being a sailor (especially across big oceans) was a common trade, tons of people got symptoms like fatigue and swelling. They called this scurvy, but what was really going on was a Vitamin C deficiency. They just weren't getting it in their diets. As soon as <a href="https://askabiologist.asu.edu/explore/sailors-called-limeys" target="_blank">sailors started to consume citrus fruits</a>, they got better!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something I think more research will be done in. The supplement industry is pretty large and at yet it seems there isn’t a consensus. Some vitamins and minerals seem to be more bioavailable than others in pill form or when isolated from other nutritional elements. </p>
<p>The fresh foods thing you’ll see commonly in the marketing of organic supplements. Organic supplements are commonly made of compressed food (the usda will certify basil/spinach/blueberries as organic but not, say, iron or vitamin c). As a result you’ll commonly see them say that raw/organic vitamins are more bioavailable but like I said I don’t think there’s a real consensus</p></div>		</li>

<p>So when it's just about the vitamins, the source doesn't matter, right? So the preference for fresh foods would be mainly because they contain fibers/fat etc. ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they do in the sense that they will prevent vitamin deficiencies. But the health benefits from eating fruits and vegetables go beyond just not having vitamin deficiencies.
Part of it is the fiber, part are probably the antioxidants, and part we don't quite know yet.</p></div>		</li>
