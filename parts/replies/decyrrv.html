			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked in OR as a nurse and confirm.
We had a fire alarm go off during a colonoscopy (PT was under IV sedation requiring airway support and O2) and continued as usual until we heard back from the department TL as to what the alarm was for (turned out to be a hospital wide drill)
As far as the anesthetist was concerned unless the fire was cutting off a exit or inside the zone it was safer to continue.
While As far as the surgeon was concerned the alarm was too loud and the anesthetist cost too much per hour to stop for it...</p>
<p>That said, if we got cut off from the elevator or ramp on the other side of the hospital (we were on a sloping hill with the OR being on the 2nd floor) we'd be fucked... i mean, we could easily get the patient to the stairs but we'd either have to could push them down the stairs or if we had a stair slide, slide them down, but they'd still be unconscious from the midazolam, fentanyl and propofol used to put them under, if they were under a general anesthetic they'd need to be manually ventilated with a bag and if anything happened we wouldn't have access to any emergency drugs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Audible alarms are not a thing in all hospitals - in some wards on the hospital I worked at, audible alarm is turned off (instead a alarm lights at the nurses' station). This is to prevent mass panic amongst bed-ridden patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems odd, I'll take your word for it. All of the hospitals that I've worked at had audible fire alarms everywhere, including outside. All of the fire alarms are also announced on the overhead system along with the location.</p>
<p>The overhead announcements reach every area, of the hospitals that I have worked at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true, I'm a Fire Alarm Guy (yeah, I know, trade term is fag, hear it all too often). During my work at the local hospital, we had speaker/strobes in all hallways and such, but none on the 3rd floor, which was specifically for psych patients. There's a few instances in electrical work where it SEEMS dangerous to do something (or not do something), but it's because the risk of not doing (or doing it) it is greater</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't belief it at first either. I heard it during a mandatory safety course provided by the hospital. It seems to me be you would want to alert everybody, but I guess they don't want panic.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hospital I work at definitely has audible alarms, though I couldn't say if every single unit hears them. I normally hear it right after an announcement that they're testing the fire alarm system, so everyone knows it's not real. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's just an activation with no evidence of an actual fire, they'll continue to operate, and receive any needed updates from security or other staff outside the OR.</p>
<p>It's unlikely for a large fire to occur in an OR, since it is full of people, and would be noticed well before it got out of hand, so it could be addressed with an extinguisher. Also ORs usually dont have much of a fire load to burn, so any fire would be confined to a piece of equipment or maybe a small amount of flammable materials like cloth, gauze, etc. Generally they have a clean extinguisher, such as carbon dioxide (as opposed to a powdered dry chemical standard extinguisher), so there is little risk to equipment if it's used. Once the situation is addressed, the team can assess if they can continue or need to stabilize the patient and figure out an alternative. (I don't know the specifics of that process)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe there was a big fire in an OR in the Netherlands not too long ago where a faulty/damaged oxygen supply contributed significantly to the fire.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hospital I worked at (I worked in surgery) had a system where beyond the compartmentalized system others have mentioned. If the OR had a fire. Even if the patient was anesthetized they would be moved to pacu and the anesthetist would keep them sedated until the patient could be closed. They would have a drape put over their wound and would.. roll. On an or table on a stretcher. Any way they could. Dangerous? Of course. But better than burning while you're high on propofol and God knows what else. </p></div>		</li>
