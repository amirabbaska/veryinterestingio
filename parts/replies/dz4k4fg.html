			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, I'd like to add that 1.1 eV corresponds to photons with wavelength of 1100 nm.  </p>
<p>(So if you look at the spectrum that cantgetno197 posted, the area of the graph with wavelengths below 1100nm is used in a silicon cell. Higher than than no photons excite electrons anymore and lower than that only part of the energy is used, for example, a 600nm orange colored photon produces the same energy as a 1100nm photon, the 500nm difference in corresponding energy is wasted as heat.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are many tricks to use this energy. (or to bypass the so called Shockley-Queisser limit the original poster talked about).  </p>
<p>First you can simply use the heat as is, in the form of hybrid systems, PVT (pv-thermal systems).  </p>
<p>Other options are to waste less of the photon energy, as you now understand any photon energy higher than the bandgap (1.1eV for silicon) is wasted, a solution is to use multiple bandgaps. In the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-junction_solar_cell" target="_blank">multi-junction cells</a>, where first the photons go through materials with higher bandgaps, and sometimes also through materials with lower bandgaps (to catch more of the infrared). Basically, you stack materials with different bandgaps. This method is quite costly though.<br />
There are other ways but they are mostly experimental, you can find most of them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes. In practice this type of co-generation is not used much since 'useful' heat is pretty limited, especially compared to dedicated solar thermal installations. <a href="https://www.ecn.nl/fileadmin/ecn/units/egon/pvt/pdf/EFP1713_00-0014.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a>'s an outdated but extensive report, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_thermal_hybrid_solar_collector" target="_blank">here i</a>s the wiki for these so-called PV/T solar collectors. </p>
<p>Personally, I think it has potential. Especially for building-integrated PV the waste-heat is a real problem since higher temperatures actually decrease the efficiency of the cell, and in the integrated panels the heated air has nowhere to go. Transporting this heat away and using it seems like a sensible option then. Once solar becomes more of a part of the design of buildings, PV/T collectors seem like a sensible option.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK wow that is highly informative.  I know silicon is used in the creaiton of most solar panel cells, but is that because of cost of creation and the low band gap, or is silicon just that dang perfect?  Similar to how copper wire is used over gold in most everyday applications, because of it's high conductivity to cost ratio (gold being more conductive, but more rare of an element than copper).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It isn't.  Silicon is what is called an &quot;indirect gap&quot; semiconductor.  Basically what that means is that an electron in a state below the bandgap, say the bandgap energy is Eg, it can't just grab a photon of energy Eg and hop up to a state above it.  In gallium arsenide, for example, which is a &quot;direct gap&quot; semiconductor, it can, but in silicon it can't.  The reason is because the states above the bandgap aren't just at a different energy, but also a very different momentum.  Light carries SOME momentum but it's not enough.  So for an electron in silicon to jump to a state above the bandgap it needs to grab a photon of energy Eg and SIMULTANEOUSLY some momentum from atomic vibrations (these are called phonons).  Thus you don't just need a photon of the right energy in the right place at the right time but also, at that time, a phonon with the right momentum in the right place and the right time.  It's called a &quot;second order&quot; process.</p>
<p>Because of this, the absorption depth (how far light makes it before being mostly absorbed) of silicon is quite long and you need a fairly thick slab (compared to something like gallium arsenide) to absorb all light.  The <em>problem</em> with this is that a solar cell needs to do three things:</p>
<p>1) grab all the photons it can and make sure each photon produces an electron-hole pair.  &quot;Absorption&quot;</p>
<p>2) make sure the electron and hole, which results, are separated by the built-in electric field that results from what is called the pn-junction in the solar cell. &quot;Carrier separation&quot;</p>
<p>3) and finally, those separated carriers need to make it through the cell and to the electrical contacts without hitting something or recombining with an errant hole/electron either directly to re-emit a photon (direct recombination) or through the help of a phonon (Shockely-Reed-Hall recombination). &quot;Carrier collection&quot;</p>
<p>So the issue is that 1 and 3 are in conflict.  The thicker a solar cell is, the more likely it is that the carriers you've created will meet some end before they make it out of the cell.  Si cells need to exist in a trade-off between being thick enough to grab most of the light and being thin enough that created carriers make it out without recombining.</p>
<p>Something like gallium arsenide has a mostly comparable bandgap to silicon but doesn't have this problem.  Which is why GaAs cells are far more efficient:</p>

<p>What Si has going for it is that: 1) It's literally sand.  SiO^2, silicon dioxide, or &quot;rusted silicon&quot; is the most abundant material on Earth. 2) Because of its value in semiconductor chips we know how to make it really, really, really, really pure very cheaply.  The purer it is and the less impurities and obstacles, the better we accomplish &quot;carrier collection&quot; above and, 3) it's non-toxic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, more fun follow-up questions. I love that chart.</p>
<p>What are those guys doing futzing around down in the 10-13&#37; range? Apparently, we had cells 40 years ago that were doing better than that.</p>
<p>What do those guys know? Is there some much-much higher theoretical maximum with those technologies and we just haven't gotten there yet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - room for solar cells is pretty cheap. It's usually better to install 40 $100 panels of 20% efficiency than to install 10 $500 panels of 40% efficiency. The exceptions are space and other &quot;mobile&quot; (automotive, portable appliances) applications where extra mass or surface is not worth the savings, but for stationary solar power it just pays to go less efficient but cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The popularity of silicon photovoltaics is largely due to the Chinese government subsidizing the technology since the 70s making it incredibly cheap. Silicon has the highest <em>theoretical</em> efficiency according to the Shockley-Queisser limit but has many practical limitations largely due to being an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_and_indirect_band_gaps" target="_blank">indirect bandgap</a> semiconductor (requires both energy AND momentum for an electron to jump the bandgap), which is why the limit still hasn't been reached. Hence why direct bandgap photovoltaics such as GaAs, CIGS and CdTe exist (only requires energy to jump the bandgap).</p>
<p>Like the comparison between copper and gold wire, GaAs is actually <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2016/04/f30/efficiency_chart_0.jpg" target="_blank">more efficient than Silicon these days</a> but comes at a high manufacturing cost and is toxic, so is generally only used in space applications where you need the most bang for your buck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but in space you have the yellow curve above rather than the red curve.  The red curve is what happens after Earth's atmosphere has grabbed all the photons it likes.  There is an issue in space with any power source of how you extract heat.  All the heat energy needs to be dispersed somehow.  Though, I have no knowledge of how they actually do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the spacecraft.  Certain ones use an ammonia closed loop system to take the heat to the radiators.  Others just use direct contact radiators. </p>
<p>Ultimately the only way to deal with heat in space is a thermal radiator.  Not very efficient.</p></div>		</li>
