			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, most high-speed, long-distance, not daily-commuter trains are having a similar pricing scheme as commercial airlines. Commuter traffic is usually a subsidized public company where the goal is to transport people, not to make money, hence the non-aggresive fare-tactics on (sub)urban transport. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UK is similar with on and off peak pricing, but it is pretty much just that you do what to worry about. Can be far cheaper getting a train 20 mins later when off peak starts for example</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we are talking a different kind of bus service compared to commuter busses. Things like long haul bus routes between a place like New York to Omaha or if you are European taking a bus between Madrid and Munich. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flixbus* pricing is similar to airline pricing.</p>
<p>(Flixbus is the German de-facto monopoly on intercity busses)</p>
<p>The cheapest tickets are a few euros and I have seen a ticket that cost as much as train ticket for the same route.</p></div>		</li>
