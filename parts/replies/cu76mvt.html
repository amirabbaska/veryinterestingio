			<div class="markdown"><p>I found The Untold Story of Marvel Comics pretty dry. It's a very thorough breakdown of the company on the business side of things. But it's only going to really resonate with those who are already hardcore fans and want to know more about the behind the scenes of the company over the years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but comic fans and usually only those that have read the late 60's and 70's issues.</p>
<p>I went back years ago and skimmed through the original X-Men 60's title simply to see how it started even though it was terrible, then I read all of Claremonts ~2 decades run on X-Men and it was fantastic, then learning about Claremont and his history with marvel clears up a lot.</p>
<p>Non comic readers probably wouldn't give 2 shits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say most comic readers wouldn't give a shit. There are more interesting ways to write comic book history. It's not a bad book, but like I said before, it's just so very dry.</p></div>		</li>
