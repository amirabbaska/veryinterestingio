			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a few laws involved.</p>
<p>The Duty of Care Act of 1990 and Workplace Regulation of 1992 means sanitary bins are a basic requirement for female employees.</p>
<p>The Water Industries Act of 1991 also states that sanitary waste should not be flushed down toilets where it can cause blockages in drains.</p>
<p>This means most business make sanitary bins available in both staff and public toilets. Business generally have a contract with a waste disposal company who provide, maintain, and empty the sanitary bins. I believe incineration is the recommended way to dispose of bodily fluids and biohazards.</p>
<p>Were yours just emptied by the staff / regular cleaners and thrown out with the normal rubbish?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when I was working at a movie theater we just put the brown bags from the feminine boxes right into the main restroom yeah bags what were thrown away at the end of the night. when I was getting trained at the beginning, the other employees told me that if there were only one or two things in the bag, you can just dump the bag into the large trash can, then cover it with paper towel so the customers don't see it. I always just changed the bags so I didn't have to think about it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same person but I cant tell you first hand that we just grab the bag out of the sanitary bins and put it in the regular trash. Gloves on of course but disposed of in the same way as say normal office trash</p></div>		</li>
