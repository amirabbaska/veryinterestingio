			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I'm definitely investing in a bidet when we buy a condo or house, that sounds amazing. </p>
<p>I think they have something similar that attaches to the toilet too, and if so and I can find it, I'm gonna go that route and hop on the bidet train like now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at the Astor Bidet from Amazon! It costs about $20 and is super easy to install and later remove. We're in a rented apartment, so those are pretty strict requirements. The only downside is that it doesn't heat the water, it just pulls from the same (clean) water source that would fill the chamber. It hasn't been a problem for us in the Midwest, even in winter, but if your water source is really cold, you might feel it. Still, at $20, I think it's worth the risk to try it out. I'm a changed woman now... no pooping experience compares to my bidet &lt;3</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a month in Indonesia and while I wasn't a fan of squat toilets the western toilet + bidet hose attachment thing was awesome. Gets you all cleaned up and then you just need to use a few squares of TP to dry. I'll miss them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really not that fancy. I got a bidet because I was a 'wipe till it bleeds'er and ended up with anal fissures. Turns out, bidets solve anal fissures if they're being caused by your own obsessive cleaning of your hole.</p>
<p>Also, never see blood while I'm pooping anymore. Major relief. I had been to doctors and everything thinking something was seriously wrong. I've had more than a handful of doctors stick stuff in my ass trying to figure out what was wrong. Nothing's wrong, I literally just wiped my ass too much.</p></div>		</li>
