<p>According to <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88961" target="_blank">this article</a> the cold wake is due to the hurricane winds stirring colder water from below the warm surface layer. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hurricanes are created and sustained by a plethora of ingredients. They require various atmospheric effects to intensify and sustain themselves (wind shear, sensible and latent heat fluxes, instability). A popular model used to explain a positive feedback mechanism which converts a standard storm into a hurricane is conditional instability of the second kind (<a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/hurr/grow/cisk.rxml" target="_blank">http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/hurr/grow/cisk.rxml</a>), which could have triggered in warmer waters upstream (over Eastern Atlantic for ex).</p>

<li>Oceans contain a high amount of thermal inertia, ie they take a long time to gain or lose heat by means of conduction and radiation, and surface currents transporting warmer tropical waters take a while to replenish temperature in the area. I suspect the timescale is around a few days to a week for an anomaly this small though.       </li>

<p>I think by this you mean that water has a very high specific heat and is constantly moving in a way that feeds the hurricane continuously even though it is sucking the energy out of the water. Correct?</p></div>		</li>
