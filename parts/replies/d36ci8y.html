			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that and you don't necessarily need 100% DV of everything just from a vitamin, right? Like based on the average American diet, there's no point in including sodium or iodine in the pill because you're pretty much guaranteed to get enough from other sources. I'm no dietician but I bet there are better examples than mine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah. I struggled with that word. I didn't want to write vitamin, because it's not that. I wasn't too sure on food, either, but I suppose it does qualify. To me soylent is a weird thing in its own category. If it had been around when I was single I definitely would have given it a try.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expiry dates are educated guesses by the science group in the company as to when the vitamins degrade below their label claims, and when the product is no longer able to resist pathogenic organisms such as E. coli (or when other problems occur, such as tablet disintegration, separation in the product, unacceptable sensory due to oxidation, etc.). There are so many variables that it's impossible to know exactly what the shelf life will be, so the product is launched with an educated guess.</p>
<p>Often the guess is wrong which means the product will need updates a year or two after it's launched. The company is only in noncompliance of GMPs when they know the product fails and makes no attempt to fix it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I bet if it drops to 80% efficiency they have to declare it out of date. But 80% is still pretty useful.</p>
<p>So it is more like &quot;it is not close to 90% efficiency/usability&quot; than &quot;close to useless&quot;</p>
<p>I take ginko 3 years out of date, and it still causes livid dreams, so still efficient....</p></div>		</li>
