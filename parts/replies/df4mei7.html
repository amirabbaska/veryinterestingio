			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't actually calculated and it is bullshit to come up with a number.</p>
<p>Brains do not work that way. Our brains store information based on association networks with an analog response.</p>
<p>If you said a light bulb was 1 bit. What would a lightbulb with a continuous dimmer be equivalent too??  Maybe not infinite bits bit pretty damn close.  Now take 50 billion interconnected lightbulbs that each have continuous dimmers and turn on and off to varying degrees not only due to dimmers but also due to how bright the other lightbulbs around them are and how bright the lightbulbs connected to them are even if they are in separate rooms, hell separate hemispheres of the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an estimation not a measurement. I don't think &quot;brain capacity&quot; is that well defined either... does it mean &quot;number of words a person can remember&quot;? &quot;Muscle movements a person can remember&quot;? &quot;Pictures a person can remember&quot;? &quot;Shapes a person can remember&quot;? I think a good definition is needed otherwise nothing fruitful can come out of this thread.</p></div>		</li>
