			<div class="markdown"><p>1)No i would not. But i suspect i know some folks who would maybe?</p>
<p>2)i did know that and i'm not seeing it even a little. But those people probably get to take a dip in their Scrooge McDuck money vault every morning so that's on me i guess. There's found footage out there though that makes BWP look like goddamn Star Wars which is what i was talking about. Put it this way; never pick a Red Box movie at random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...how the fuck did the Blair Witch Project cost $60,000? I would've thought the budget for that movie was a bag of sandwiches, a few water bottles, and some printouts of the script to mess around in the woods with. The special effects amounted to &quot;stack rocks here&quot; and &quot;bundle some twigs together&quot; so no budget there either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually that's kind of a neat idea for a sort of horror ARG. Present it as like a tube site with snippets of found footage, maybe with like clues to what's happening in the different videos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years ago, I found a pack of poorly taken pics in a Kmart parking lot. Had a mostly naked normal looking college couple &quot;doing it&quot;. I assume the Pics were taken by a friend that had a bad case of the shakes. At the time, I thought they were awesome!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair that was a test video the guys shot themselves before they pitched it. They showed that shitty version to execs who bought the rights to the show, and they re-shot the pilot which is the version they aired. That episode had a much higher budget. </p></div>		</li>
