<p>Different animals have different strategies. Remember that from an evolutionary point of view, all that matters is passing on your genes by any means. Workers ants are all infertile. They won't be passing on their genes anyway. So there wouldn't really have any been any pressure to develop internal competitive drives because that would actually compromise the chance of them the queen passing on her genes (and that is where all the worker ants get their genes from too)</p>

<p>Exactly. Since it’s only the queen’s (and the male’s) genes which get passed on it makes more sense to think of an ant hive as a single organism. A worker ant is altruistic in the same sense that your arm is altruistic.</p>

<p>Humans might be a social group animal, but there is still competition for resources between different members of the group and between different groups. An individual that manages to stand apart from the others and get higher status has more chance of passing on their genes, so that sort of behaviour got selected for.</p>

<p>For a beautiful explanation of this topic I can recommend Richard Dawkins’ “The Selfish Gene”. It explains nicely why truly altruistic behavior can never <del>evolve</del> propagate. Altruism only makes sense when it’s for the benefit of your close relatives which share lots of your genes. Egoism will prevail up to the point where it’s useful.</p></div>		</li>
