			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer your last question, yes there has been! In the early 1900's Americans planted a huge amount of American Elm trees all across the country (because they are visually appealing). What happened afterwards is that once we had this huge monoculture of American Elms, one disease, Dutch Elm Disease, basically eradicated the American Elm population. Most Elm trees in the U.S. today have the Dutch Elm disease or will in their lifetime. Interestingly enough Elm trees have a sort of camoflaging effect on other trees in the sense that they hide them from pests. Often insects like the Emerald Ash Borer will fly around looking for a specific type of tree, in this case Ash trees, but if that tree is planted between two Elms the insect will almost never find it.</p>
<p>Edit: source: I am a junior majoring in Agronomy at Kansas State University. Entomology classes are sometimes interesting!!</p>
<p>Edit edit: Basically plants defend themselves with chemicals. These chemicals often are used to dissuade insects from feeding on them. Elm trees give off a lot of these chemicals so basically the area stinks to insects causing them to avoid it. This is how Elms hide other trees. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3493419/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3493419/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the record Monocultures are almost always a bad idea, its reduces genetic diversity which leaves the monoculture susceptible to negative externalities such as disease, climate change, and even an overuse of the resources used to produce the monoculture which can all result in an environmental crash.</p>
<p>It also makes it much harder for the environment to recover since there are no other organisms to take over the niche of the monoculture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It doesn't matter that they're not grown as a &quot;monoculture&quot;, the codling moths have no problem finding every single pear and apple tree in peoples backyards and infesting them. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the main arguments against conventional farming as it reduces genetic diversity because all of the plants in a given field are near genetic copies of one another. While this does help to increase things like sprouting rates and yield, it is amazing to see how easy it is for a pest to annihilate a field. You are basically giving them an all you can eat buffet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a project underway now that makes the chestnut resistant to the blight infection. It uses a gene from wheat to reduce the blight's damage to the tree. And then this huge tree just pulls the carbon out of the air for it's own growth. </p>
<p>Here are some details about that project. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2016-01-genetically-american-chestnut-decimated-iconic.html" target="_blank">https://phys.org/news/2016-01-genetically-american-chestnut-decimated-iconic.html</a> </p>
<p>They are testing the GMO chestnuts in a &quot;century&quot; experiment right now. You can see more about that here: <a href="http://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/chestnutrestorationforest" target="_blank">http://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/chestnutrestorationforest</a></p>
<p>As the video noted, there are no terminator seeds. Chestnuts used to provide huge amounts of nutrition for animals and humans. You can also make beer with them :) . Restoring them to their ecosystem will have many benefits besides being carbon sinks. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The issue was revived recently, though, and in the video links there's this piece: <a href="https://theconversation.com/terminator-seeds-will-not-usher-in-an-agricultural-judgement-day-21686" target="_blank">Terminator seeds will not usher in an agricultural judgement day</a>.

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to look at only the life cycle of one tree, then yes, most of the CO2 it absorbs during its life will be released as it decays. That's why we need to not just plant a tree, but establish forests, so when one tree dies, it gets replaced. (Urban forests are especially good because trees benefit people in many ways beyond just absorbing CO2.)</p>
<p>Edit: I found an <a href="https://news.uns.purdue.edu/x/2009a/090610JacobsChestnuts.html" target="_blank">article specifically about the American Chestnut.</a> Evidently it's a good carbon sink because it is fast growing (so it absorbs carbon quickly) and its wood is good for building. When you cut down a tree and build something from it, the carbon in the wood is effectively stored for as long as you have it. So buy more wood products. (As long as the wood isn't from the rainforest.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely. A lot of the the carbon is either put into the soil for use by plants as humus or sent up the food chain by the things that eat the things that help break down the tree. Some is put back into the air during aerobic processes, but this is by very small organisms over potentially decades which can be reabsorbed by other plants in the forest. It takes a long time for a full grown tree to be &quot;digested&quot; by the fungi and bugs that break down dead trees. <a href="http://treesforlife.org.uk/forest/forest-ecology/decomposition-and-decay/" target="_blank">Here is a site explaining decomposition in the wild.</a> And <a href="https://extension.umaine.edu/gardening/manual/soils/soil-and-plant-nutrition/" target="_blank">here is a site that explains the use of organic matter in soil composition and soil composition in general.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>There was a point about the American chestnut tree being great at carbon fixing, and how GMO trees could be used as a carbon dump.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carbon fixation is an extremely difficult mechanism to tweak. Rubisco, the protein at the center of both C3 and C4 carbon fixation is very delicate and basically has already climbed to peak efficiency.</p>
<p>To get around this local maximum in rubisco, plants have evolved different strategies to help Rubisco fix carbon in optimally (called C3 and C4). This involves physiologic sequestration to remove oxygen from the reaction. The point is, since this pathway is so essential to organism fitness, it has already been pushed to near peak efficiency and is highly sensitive to climate changes.</p>
<p>As a result. I doubt there will be any single genetic modifications which can increase carbon fixation. It will take a whole redesign of the pathway to eek out more efficiency if at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, as weird as this question may be, has the ecological impact of planting a fuckton of one tree been studied?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very common among non-GMO tree farms. It tends to create ecological dead zones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is pretty much the conclusion I had come to myself, but there was a paper published in <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6314/857" target="_blank">Science</a> last year which increased yield of tobacco by 15 % under field conditions by tweaking the xanthophyll cycle. I'm still quite sceptical though since I find the argument in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3586628/" target="_blank">Darwinian Agriculture</a> that plants will have evolved to optimise photosynthetic efficiency quite convincing. It will be interesting to keep an eye on.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are already better RuBisCOs, we just have to import the proper machinery for increased local CO2 concentration into plants (carboxysomes, bicarbonate transporters, carbonic anhydrases).
