			<p>For starters we were indoctrinated into believing that a degree leads to the easy life. Also there are jobs you cannot do without a degree, it's as simple as that. <br><br>As for your experience, ignoring that it's anecdotal, it's really vague and lacking details. What was your economic background at the time? What did you end up going into? Did you have help of any kind, if so than from who? What kind of business do you own, are you the sole owner? What country/state do you live in? How much do you make a year? How many hours did you work a week? What kind of house and card did you get?<br><br>And so many details. Obviously you can't list all of those but you see my point?<br><br>It would be economically impossible for everyone to be a business owner. And not everyone is cut out for it. It's a risky investment and if it goes belly under, you're fucked.</p>		</li>

			<p>And that is bullshit. There is no such thing as an &quot;easy&quot; life and the sooner we see it this way, the better off we'll be. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Really? That's what you choose to reply to? <br><br>When I say the easy life I mean the life our parents had. Getting out of high school, getting a decent job, going to college and getting a great job, then buying a house a few years later while climbing up the job latter. <br><br>Easy is misleading but I'm not the one using it, they are. It's still hard work, it's just much more straightforward than what our generation faces.  <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Not saying you are, sorry for taking the &quot;easy&quot; route with my reply. :)<br><br>I graduated, worked construction for two years, hit the oilpatch in Alberta, saved up enough money to finance a house, bought a VW and an F-150, and then i bought a Semi truck. Thats my business now. My background, well its safe to say i did not come from money, my dad is single handedly paying the way for my mom and 5 sisters, he's worked hard his whole life and i guess that carried on to me. Hopefully I'll have that influence on my kids and so on and so forth. Anything else I'm missing here? </p>		</li>

			<p>Wait so what's your business...trucks or oil?<br><br>Honestly people are waiting to rent because rent is absurd right now. So why not save money and help out the family? <br><br>I figured you went into construction. Thing is that isn't an option for everyone. If you can even secure one. I know every guy I knew out of high school wanted one, but could not get one with little to no experience in it. </p>		</li>

			<p>What I'm seeing more and more in my generation is laziness. Plain old fashioned laziness. Living at home till your 25? And I'm not saying its everyone, but my gosh people are just so hard to motivate nowadays!!!</p>		</li>

			<p>Well sorry but not all of us make enough money to afford rent, a car, student loan repayment, food, utilities, etc at 18. <br><br>I see no issue with staying at home till 25 and saving up so you have enough rainy day cash saved up. As long as you are working. I've been paying a good chunk of my parents bills since I got my first job. I know a family with 2 of the kids throwing a huge chunk of their income into trying to help the family stay afloat financially so they don't lose the house.<br></p>		</li>
