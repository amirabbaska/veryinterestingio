			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally, temperature in the troposphere decreases as you increase altitude (up to the stratosphere). A temperature inversion is an when this relationship is inverted - a cool layer of air is trapped beneath a warmer layer of air. That warmer 'middle' layer of air is called the inversion layer.</p>
<p>Ground inversion happens almost every other night on a small scale, as the Earth quickly conducts surface heat away and leaves a cooled air layer at the surface, trapped underneath the heated air above.</p>
<p>I guess what you're asking is if an inversion layer contributes to the temperatures at Death Valley. From what I understand yes, but it doesn't play a very large role. The primary factor, I think, are the steep valley walls which trap, compress and cycle the air, increasingly reheating it. The second is the below sea level altitude which delivers crushing atmospheric pressures to this already constrained 'bowl', not allowing the heated air to rise very far. I've also just considered that there's a whole array of mountains between Death Valley and the Pacific. I'm sure the fact that barely any moisture reaches here contributes to the heat, as water can absorb and retain A LOT of heat.</p>
<p>Would love it if someone with actual meteorological knowledge chimes in. Do cap inversion layers form in Death Valley? If they do, what effect do they have on temperature at the surface? I imagine stronger winds, but no big change in temp</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a place like Death Valley during hot sunny weather, there is no cap or inversion layer, and the atmosphere mixes freely through an enormous depth.  The lapse rate might be reduced in the upper parts of the troposphere, but the lower half tends to have an extremely strong cooling rate with height, which we call a 'dry adiabatic lapse rate'.  In desert regions like this, it is mostly driven by ground heating and extensive mixing in the lowest 3-6 km.</p>
<p>The compression is not caused by terrain interactions but by subsidence (sinking motion) within the subtropical high, which in turn is caused mostly by convergence of the poleward moving upper-level wind field at subtropical latitudes.  There will indeed be tertiary circulations superimposed on this field, consisting mostly of the strong warming on mountain slopes, producing cells of rising motion on the mountain ranges and sinking motion in the valleys (valley breeze / mountain breeze), but I am skeptical this contributes much extra subsidence in the valleys.</p>
<p>For those who have a little more knowledge, here is a sounding (skew-T) profile for today for Death Valley, from a small scale dynamical model:
<a href="https://s22.postimg.cc/klu46nuht/temp.png" target="_blank">https://s22.postimg.cc/klu46nuht/temp.png</a></p>
<p>This shows (red line on right) a very strong decrease in temperature with height, and then a reduction in the cooling rate as you reach the upper portions of the subtropical high.</p>
<p>According to a few tests I ran on the model data, it doesn't appear valley/mountain breezes affect the temperature profiles much as the potential temperature profiles are about the same between mountains and valleys.  I think the stronger factors at play in Death Valley is the reduced cloud cover (clouds forming mostly along mountain peaks in the rising portion of the cell) and the lower elevation (which naturally adds to the heat the lower you go through adiabatic warming).</p>
<p>There is indeed a ground-based radiational nighttime inversion at Death Valley (and most places in the US in the summer), but it will only be a few hundred meters deep and broken very quickly by afternoon heating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re correct on all counts, but there’s a rain/heat shadow going on as well.  That area of California is dominated by a fairly consistent westerly breeze (5-15mph) off the Pacific.  As it hits the high mountains west of Death Valley, it's compressed upwards and cools, which squeezes out any accompanying humidity.  When it then tumbles down the east side into the basin, which is at an even lower elevation than the ocean where it started, it's now extraordinarily dry and very hot.
At that point, all the patterns you mentioned above also kick in to hold it there, and the heat just builds on itself with nowhere to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would extending piping in a geothermal factory absorbing heat be able to transfer heat out and cool the green house while providing energy? Hypothetically? Or would the hot air still not rise due to pressure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes, economically no. Geothermal plants rely on hot water and temperature gradients to generate energy. Water has a much higher heat capacity than air and can transport more energy at a given temperature differential. A lack of hot water, and water in general in Death Valley, would put a big damper on the attempt. Additionally, geothermal plants usually need water that is in excess of 200C to operate. Death Valley only notches out a little above 50C. DV is hot, but it isn't hugely hotter than the higher valleys around it. A day I was there, it was 127F in the valley and &gt;95F in a little town, ~4000 ft higher. </p>
<p>While yes, some sort of setup might be able to generate small amount of energy based on an air temperature differential, the expense required to pipe hot air a few dozen kilometers would be incredibly expensive compared to the tiny amount of energy that would be generated. In fact, a better solution for energy generation using the DV heat might be a &quot;reverse&quot; geothermal plant, where the heat at the surface is used against cooler temperatures a several meters below the surface. A very efficient heat engine might be able to generate small amounts of power off of this. It would still be very uneconomic when compared to solar other renewable options.</p></div>		</li>

Great answer here, doing something like this is neither feasible to produce energy, nor for reducing temperatures in Death Valley, as air is a poor conductor of heat, and the scale involved is far beyond human capability.</p>
<p>Though you bring an interesting question. If for whatever reason we wanted to transform Death Valley into Life Valley... What would it take?</p>
<p>Even if we could carve out entire mountain ranges, or want to do so, we're still below sea level... So there's no way of channeling the heated air away from the gradient.</p>
<p>We could try to artificially support vegetation growth, though the insane amounts of salt and almost no water sources would make that a very demanding task. I guess the main problem is that any water will be very easily evaporated and carried away, yet almost no water comes into the area.</p>
<p>I wonder how much water would we need to channel / pump into DV for to make a dent in the temperatures? How much to reach equilibrium? <a href="http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/201505/popup.htm?img=images/aral/Aral_Sea_chronology_lg.jpg" target="_blank">We've killed massive bodies of water with irrigation before,</a> what would stop us from doing the reverse?</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p></div>		</li>
