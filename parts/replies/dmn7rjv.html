			<div class="markdown"><p>practically, mixing sound is extremely cheap, so that the convenience of running the program as normal (but multiplying all amplitudes by 0) outweighs the mild performance gain of not mixing and writing to the sound buffer</p>
<p>for example, because the user can hit unmute at any time a counter would have to be stored for each sound played while muted, so that when unmuted the proper place to begin the sound can be calculated</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be too small of a benefit to make the code more complicated to allow stopping and starting audio processing seamlessly on the fly that it wouldn't be worth the headache. Nobody is going to watch a movie on mute because it uses slightly less resources. </p></div>		</li>
