<p>In the mid-Atlantic region where I live, there are numerous utility companies which pretty much cover the state, so no, not only one company per city.</p>
<p>And the reason there was a past precedent of assigning monopoly territory to utilities is because having dozens of companies tearing up public streets so each can provide their own sewer system, own electric power cables, etc is a pretty ludicrous idea.   With internet service communications lines (fiber and broadband) that's not really an issue.</p>
<p>The internet is far more than an entertainment delivery system.  Access to the Internet is already considered a human right by several countries, the U.N. and more.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access</a>.  The power to make rules and control what we can and cannot do on the internet should not be in the hands of private corporations.  By the same token, those who do not trust the government say the same about the government.  The big, big difference is:  citizens have the power to throw out the people running the government and elect new people to make rules that suit them.  You can't do that with private corporations.</p></div>		</li>
