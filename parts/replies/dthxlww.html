			<div class="markdown"><p>With a grip dynamometer.  You can get a decent quality on Amazon for like 30 bucks or so.  Or, if you're a student, go over to your exercise science building/department and ask around if you can test your grip on a dynamometer.  They would more than likely be happy to do it.</p>
<p>The most I've hit was like 151 lbs with my right hand, and 132 on my left.  The 151 was sort of a one time thing though, I usually hit 130s.  I have a 585 lb deadlift and have pulled 445 lbs with a double overhand grip.  Mark Henry has easily maxed out a 300 lb grip dynamometer, and I'm sure other top strongman competitors can do the same.  Head over to r/griptraining if you're interested in becoming a gripster.</p></div>		</li>
