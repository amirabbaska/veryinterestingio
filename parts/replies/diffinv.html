			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation </p>
<p>The reason for false positives are generally that some hand creams, perfumes, etc when ionized can create ions similar to that for what they're looking for with explosives </p>
<p>The reuse of the swab and getting it dirtied over and over increases the risk of this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ions are molecules or fragments of molecules that have an electric charge. You can make ions by &quot;injecting&quot; energy into a compound, causing it to break apart into charged ion fragments. Ions are commonly created by producing &quot;rogue&quot; electrons (e^(-)) that will collide with molecules in the sample to ionize them.</p>
<p>I think X-rays would be overkill. Generally, there is an electron source (high voltage source that &quot;sparks&quot; to ionize air and create e^(-), radioactive metals that release electrons), but there may also be a thermal desorber that heats the sample. Heat can melt or boil volatile compounds (<em>e.g.</em> explosives) to get them to gas phase without ionizing them.</p></div>		</li>
