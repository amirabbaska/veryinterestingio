			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there's studies on that sort of thing.</p>
<p>If I haven't spoken one of the other languages I speak for a while I'll find myself interjecting the correct word, but from a different language.</p>
<p>Also, when I'm living overseas and interacting with non-native speakers of English I sometimes find my own English falling into their patterns with odd grammer and such.  I tend to be a bit of an unintentional language mimic at times, picking up accents and speaking patterns without realizing it. I have to make a conscious effort not to do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think your comment has much to do with the post that you replied to. What you were describing are effects from 'activation', which means if you encounter a word, phrase, structure, etc, it gets a higher activation level and you are in turn more likely to use it / using it is much easier. That's why you might interject a word from a different language, because the other language's word has a much higher activation level for the same meaning. That's also why your English can get a bit funny if you are talking to a lot of non-native speakers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be because English, as a second language, is much more of a conscious thing and thus you are relying on different pathways in your brain to produce it. When you speak your native language, it's all unconscious like you said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deaf people are often dyslexic where phonetic scripture is used (Latin, Cyrillic, etc), because the letters represent sounds and it just doesn't make sense to them. Deaf people however do not have a problem comprehending the pictographic Chinese scripture. </p></div>		</li>
