			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I agree! </p>
<p>In your opinion, what caused some northern parts of Morocco along with Algeria and Tunisia to survive the desertification process? Could it be the Nordic air currents carrying a huge amount of humidity hitting against the Atlas mountains?</p></div>		</li>
