			<div class="markdown"><p>And then the government started giving out cheap loans to artificially prop up the housing market after 2008. </p>
<p>Because older people were using that equity as a nest egg so the government wouldn't want people's wealth to suddenly cut in half.</p>
<p>They basically made a decision to artificially prop up home values to keep the older generations wealthy and kneecapped younger people trying to buy for the first time by keeping things astronomically inflated.</p>
<p>House values should've corrected massively after 2008 and stayed that way. Instead the government made loans extremely cheap to inflate things back to where they were pre-2008.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, anecdotes get to be exceptions to the rules.</p>
<p>My inlaws survived 2008, but 20 years worth of equity practically went down the drain. When I married their daughter that was their last kid, so they went ahead and downgraded house and they essentially broke even on the initial cost of their house. They didn't remain wealthy, they barely got to keep the house.</p>
<p>I do agree that on the other hand, my wife and I are kneecaped because we won't be buying a house anytime soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>housing prices 2008-2012 have little to do with interest rates. Banks were unable to lend due to high capital requirements and tough lending standards. Many wannabe customers had poor credit due to effects of missed payments on loans due to job loss on family members.  Everyone seemed to be helping someone make a payment on some kind of loan.</p>
<p>Prices have to do with demand.  It's like the price of Super Bowl tickets or Bama/Auburn football tickets.  </p>
<p>When you have a limited number of tickets and for the top 15% the price doesnt matter.  The price doesnt matter.  the demand to get those tickets for those seats allows the University to charge a high premium.  </p>
<p>Right now The issue is housing supply. For America it's the love for bigger homes in the suburbs vs smaller homes 30 years ago,</p>
<p>In 1976 41% of homes were on lots smaller than 9,000 sq ft while in 2017 62% of homes sold were on lots smaller than 9,000 sq ft.</p>
<p>home size... 1950- 983 sq ft and 1970- 1,500 sq ft.and 2017 2650.</p>
<p>Here's the best graph I made for recent history <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/i8abCjT" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/gallery/i8abCjT</a></p>
<p>Of the new homes built in 1973 the furthest the data was kept</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>51% did not come with air conditioning vs 7% in 2017</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>81% had 2 or fewer bathrooms vs 66% of 2017 homes have more than 2 bathrooms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>76% had 3 bedrooms or less vs in 2017 46% of homes had 4 bedrooms or more</p>
</li>
<li>There are less homes being built, along with many smaller home being bought and expanded or knocked down to build a bigger home in a certain neighborhood</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In 2017 there were more homes built selling for over 500,000 then were built that will sell for less than 200,000</strong></p>
<p>No matter the house, Site prep,Sewer, Power, and Permits is around 10 grand of the home cost.  If cities were able to subsidies this on lower costing homes it would give smaller homes a big incentive to being built.  </p>
<p>Contractor's Profit/Overhead is about 10% of the selling price. When many smaller homes were built they are built in larger neighborhoods, where as today's homes are more scattered around.  To make smaller homes profitable to contractors there has to be a lot of small houses in a nearby area.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Defaulting in finance means neglecting to pay the loan. In this case, failure to meet debt obligations in regards to mortgage payments would be considered defaulting.</p>
<p>The house serves as collateral on the mortgage, so the banks would repossess it and ultimately put it up for sale.</p></div>		</li>
