			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  OP starts from a fictional place where everyone had the stereotypical (as seen on TV) 50s lifestyle. In reality, a small slice of the population lived that way or better.  A lot of folks were out in the country without much or living in grittier parts of cities.</p>
<p>Creature comforts are a dime a dozen now.  That doesn't mean life's easy now; our labor market and the vagaries of temporary employment make for a stressful life for many.  But to act like the 50s were some amazing time for all and that things have gone to shit is to make a false comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny how the 50's are regarded as an era of worry-free, stable paychecks and idyllic lifestyle. screw that. shitty dangerous cars, small houses, smoke-filled offices and snail mail. No thanks, I'll stick with the 2000's.</p></div>		</li>
