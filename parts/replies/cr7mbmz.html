			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure these kinds of overly simplistic considerations are excluded from the hypothetical premise presented in the question. Maybe the person trapped underwater in the question is equipped with an oxygen mask with a ridiculous amount of oxygen. At any rate, I assume the OP knows a person trapped underwater for any significant period of time would drown (or freeze if the water is too cold, or suffer heat stroke if the &quot;air&quot; is too hot, or whatever). At least, I hope the OP realizes these things. :P</p></div>		</li>
