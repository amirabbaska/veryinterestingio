Did he immediately believe it was an &quot;invisible light&quot; or did he just simply believe that the energy coming from the red was &quot;bleeding&quot; over in a way? (I apologize for my lay terminology) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unable to answer what the energy difference is,  but it was represented with temperature variations across the spectrum, with purple being colder and red being warmer.  The control was similar in temperature to red because it was placed in the ir spectrum spot, which the experimenter did not know about.  </p></div>		</li>
