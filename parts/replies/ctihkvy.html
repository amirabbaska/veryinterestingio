			<p>Good answer.  <br><br>&gt; All you have to do is rub off the top layer and as many layers down as the ink has absorbed (which isn't likely to be that deep).  <br><br><br>I bet Sharpie (felt tip, indelible) ink is absorbed deeper than ball point ink, which may (in part) explain why it's a bit harder to rub/clean off?  <br></p>		</li>

			<p>Depends on the solvent as well. But if you get sharpie on you, draw on top of it with dry erase marker. Then they both wash right off. </p>		</li>

			<p>Neat, why?<br><br>Edit: Love this sub.  20 years ago I was that kid everyone hated cause I wouldn't stop asking questions in class.  Here I get to ask, and instead of rolling the dice on how much the teacher knew, I get informative easy to digest answers.  The best teachers I had would admit they didn't know and find an answer, this skips that process!</p>		</li>

			<p>The solvents used to keep Dry Erase Markers liquid until the marker ink gets onto the whiteboard and dries are also great at disolving other inks.</p>		</li>

			<p>Better or worse than rubbing alcohol? That's what I've always used.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's actually the same solvent normally. Isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol) alcohol, or sometimes ethanol (ethyl alcohol - same alcohol in liquor). What may work best actually, but may damage the surface you're using is acetone (In most nail polish removers- you can actually buy 100% pretty cheap at walmart.)</p>		</li>

			<p>Without going into the actual science of it:<br><br>Permanent markers tend to be alcohol based. Modern dry erase markers also contain alcohol (originally they did not). <br><br>Dry erase markers also contain an oil solvent (or another oil and a separate solvent) The solvent is mixed in just the right amount to kind of create a barrier and prevent the ink from penetrating deeply, and also allows it to wipe off. That's how dry erase boards work, and over time the oily solvent can break down leading to stuck on dry erase marks. <br><br>The solvent in the dry erase marker also works as a solvent on the alcohol based permanent marker. It begins to break up the ink and then it will clump up on itself and you can wipe it off. <br><br>You can also use a cleaner like 409 to get permanent marker off surfaces like dry erase boards, but you need to rinse the surface off with water or alcohol afterwards or you risk damaging the slippery coating on the board which will make it harder to get even dry erase marker off next time. </p>		</li>

			<p>Alcohol evaporates quickly. When it evaporates, it can no longer carry the pigment to the board, it stays in the felt tip.</p>		</li>

			<p>Theoretically yes, but it'd be quite hard to create a homogeneous solution. Chances are you'd make a tip that is too diluted, which means the ink would leave poor coverage, and everything else would not be diluted enough, so it'd still not work. <br><br>This would mean that you'd have a poor working marker until the ink in the tip has been used up, but the ink in the bottom would remain there. </p>		</li>

			<p>That makes sense.  Maybe a marker that was just beginning to dry out at the tip could be improved... but by that point the deeper portion may be dried up, no longer wicking alcohol to the tip, hence the dry-out.<br><br>This whole mechanism seems to be how Plastidip works as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>The ink inside is kept liquid by the solvents it is suspended in.  This allows the ink to flow through the felt.<br><br>The cap prevents the solvents from evaporating by forming an air-tight seal (or damn close to one).<br><br>Without the cap, the solvents evaporate (somewhat slowly because they still have to work through the felt tip).<br><br>Without the solvents, the ink dries in place.<br><br>If you dip the tip in a solvent, or alcohol, or sometimes even just water, you can still make a mark with a formerly dry marker. (but then you're treating it like a water-color which is just inconvenient).</p>		</li>

			<p>The dry erase ink has solvents that dissolve the Sharpie ink. This is also a great trick to get rid of the inevitable Sharpie drawn on a whiteboard.</p>		</li>

			<p>I used to think that all of those striations, or the <a href="http://imgur.com/ZF4NtZB" target="_blank">extremely tiny webbing on our hands</a>, were actually cells, because they are so tiny.

			<p>Sort of, but not quite. I've only skimmed over the wiki entry, but that seems to be 'bigger' lines of skin tension all over the body, rather than the tiny lines on hands.<br><br>Of course, I'm a layperson with a 2 minute Wikipedia knowledge, so the term may still be applicable to smaller lines on a specific part of the body as well.</p>		</li>
