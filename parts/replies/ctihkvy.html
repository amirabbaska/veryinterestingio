<p>All you have to do is rub off the top layer and as many layers down as the ink has absorbed (which isn't likely to be that deep).  </p>

<p>I bet Sharpie (felt tip, indelible) ink is absorbed deeper than ball point ink, which may (in part) explain why it's a bit harder to rub/clean off?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the solvent as well. But if you get sharpie on you, draw on top of it with dry erase marker. Then they both wash right off. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Love this sub.  20 years ago I was that kid everyone hated cause I wouldn't stop asking questions in class.  Here I get to ask, and instead of rolling the dice on how much the teacher knew, I get informative easy to digest answers.  The best teachers I had would admit they didn't know and find an answer, this skips that process!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to think that all of those striations, or the <a href="http://imgur.com/ZF4NtZB" target="_blank">extremely tiny webbing on our hands</a>, were actually cells, because they are so tiny. So I was so confused as to why everyone said cells were too small for the naked eye.</p>
<p>Edit: Added a picture for clarity. Does anyone know what that pattern/texture is actually called?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, but not quite. I've only skimmed over the wiki entry, but that seems to be 'bigger' lines of skin tension all over the body, rather than the tiny lines on hands.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm a layperson with a 2 minute Wikipedia knowledge, so the term may still be applicable to smaller lines on a specific part of the body as well.</p></div>		</li>
