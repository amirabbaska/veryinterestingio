<p>In the Seattle area it's absolutely OK and not abnormal at all. People open drinks while they are shopping and then run them through with their regular groceries all the time.</p>
<p>Unless things have changed over the last 14 years (I no longer live in the US).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. I may also be biased, since now that I think about it my family may have instilled in me the idea that it wasn't okay as a kid. The  store I worked at (in southern Wisconsin, if it helps) took most of the city's EBT/foodstamps, so even though everyone was pretty friendly we did have some problems between theft and the all-too-often foodstamps shortage. I worked there and really didn't like to open stuff til I got to the register, just out of habit.</p></div>		</li>
