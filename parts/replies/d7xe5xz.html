			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't until I watched my kids wake up that I found the most natural method for me to wake up before coffee.
I also don't wake up to the screaming of an alarm, my alarm is a more soothing melody instead of the fire alarm sound making me jump awake.
To each is own, but the hubby doesn't usually stir with the more quiet alarms. Medically retired from the military, I'm cautious as to how I wake him!</p></div>		</li>
