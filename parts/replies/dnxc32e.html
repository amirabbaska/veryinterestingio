			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback onto the top comment, these DNA &quot;mistakes&quot; are sometimes something called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced &quot;snips&quot;).</p>
<p>Geneticists can look at populations and the frequency of SNPs within that population, and determine heredity based off of whether an individual has this SNP or that SNP at which position in their genome, and then determine how closely related somebody might be to a specific gene pool from one geographic locale versus another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Not OP, but I am a genetics student :) A SNP is just a single letter change. For example, originally you might have had 'ACCTG' but your kid has 'ACATG' - a change from a C to an A at position 3. No one SNP would change your hair colour or eye colour - lots of genes control these and add up to have the overall effect of 'blonde', bluey-green' etc etc. Some SNPs can cause disease - and bad ones, too - but even those of us without genetic diseases have plenty of SNPs!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a variation in your DNA does not immediately mean that that variation is visible or detectable without looking at the DNA itself. We describe it as having a <em>genotype</em> (the collection of your DNA) and your <em>phenotype</em> (your characteristics resulting from your DNA). For instance, the color of your eyes (having the <em>phenotype</em> blue eyes) is a result from a certain <em>genotype</em> (a combination of areas in the DNA). What is important to know that 1) not all changes in <em>genotype</em> result in changes in <em>phenotype</em> and 2) not all changes in <em>phenotype</em> are a result of changes in <em>genotype</em>. To make it more complex, <em>phenotype</em> are most often a result of a multiple variations at different locations in the DNA.</p>
<p>A lot of the <em>genotype</em> does not result in variations in the <em>phenotype</em>. That is because either that particular part of the DNA is unused, or because a change in the DNA just has not effect on the function of the DNA, or because another part of the DNA has the same function. </p>
<p>When we do comparisons of DNA to determine ancestry or paternity, we don't look specifically at areas that would describe things like hair color, skull shape or the ear shape. We rather look at a lot of SNP in our <em>genotype</em> that are known to vary between people. Most of there are probably SNPs that have no effect on the <em>phenotype</em>. </p>
<p>EDIT: <em>ph</em>, <em>f</em>, what's the difference? (fixed spelling of <del>feno</del> phenotype).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Single Nucleotide (the bases or letters that make up the DNA code - A, T, C, G) Polymorphism (&quot;poly&quot; - many, &quot;morph&quot; - form). A SNP is just where there is a single letter change between two or more bits of DNA. </p>
<p>ACCC[T]GGTGA    &lt;- DNA sequence 1
ACCC[A]GGTGA    &lt;- DNA sequence 2</p>
<p>Between the two sequences above, the letters in square brackets are a SNP. Even though the sequence is different, it's actually not common for a SNP to directly result in a particular trait (slanted eyes, blond hair...).</p>
<p>However, sometimes they can. For example, sickle cell anaemia can be caused by an A being replaced by a T in the HBB gene.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An SNP is a specific type of mutation. &quot;Single nucleotide polymorphism&quot; literally means that there are multiple (&quot;poly&quot;) forms (&quot;morph&quot;s) of a specific nucleotide (like, say, the 154th nucleotide in the gene that codes for the CDH11 protein on chromosome 16) existing in the population (like, say, for most people it's a C, but for some it's a T). But like &quot;mutation&quot;, &quot;SNP&quot; can refer to the event that caused caused some people to have a different form, or it can refer to the result of that change (so if most people have a C, but a mutation caused some people to have a T, then the T is the polymorphism or &quot;SNP&quot;).</p>
<p>So an SNP is a specific type of mutation (or the result of that specific type of mutation: different people having different nucleotide types at a specific point in their genome). But there are other types of mutations, like insertions or deletions (which could make a gene shorter or longer, respectively, if they occur within a gene and don't mess up the gene entirely).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some specific groups of mutations only appeared in certain ethincities, so by looking at specfic sections of genes, they can determine what ethnicity(ies) you are. That's why if you only have like only one or a few mutations that are similar to another ethnicities, you still don't have as many as one who is actually of that ethnicity. As for percentage, they figure out and compare how much of each group of mutations you have, and then find a percentage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well ethnicity is the social construct usually associated with ancestry. As such, most of the consumer level tests don't necessarily specify ethnicity. For example they may give you percentages based on regions like central european, southeast asian, eastern Africa, etc. It's up to the consumer to interpret how that fits into their ethnic identity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this question: How does this comparing of DNA help them to find your relatives? For example: My aunt and I matched on Ancestry.com as 1st cousins. How do they figure out relationships and how close or distant the genetic relationship is? (since 1st cousins are arguably genetically as close a relation as an aunt/uncle and niece/nephew)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is statistically based, A child has 50% of its DNA from each parent. A slightly different way of saying this is that 50% of a child's DNA is the same as its mother or its father. The average percentage of DNA that is the same between 2 full siblings is 50%. The percentage is 25 % for Grandparent/Grandchild,  Aunt or Uncle/Niece or Nephew, or Half Siblings. Note that I said average, it can vary. First cousins are 12.5%. Guesses of relationship are based on the percent of shared DNA. Looking at who shares these matches also gives you clues as to the identity of the shared ancestor. If you share a particular marker with your first cousin on your dad's side then it is more likely that the gene came from one of your paternal grandparents but that is not proven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Comparing the DNA means they calculate the number of differences in your genome and your family members' genomes relative to each other or a standard. Someone distantly related to you will have a greater number of differences in their genome than between you and your aunt who share a very recent ancestor.</p></div>		</li>
