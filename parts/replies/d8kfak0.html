			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up calculation: suppose (very generously) that this question is equivalent to &quot;how many bananas must I eat to get radiation poisoning?&quot; </p>
<p>Obviously, you'd get a lot less radiation from being next to a banana than from eating it. More so when most of the bananas are not next to you, and their radiation must pass through other bananas en route.</p>
<p>According to xkcd, it takes 400 millisieverts to get radiation poisoning, whereas eating a banana gives you 0.1 microsieverts. So, you'd have to eat 4 million bananas to get radiation poisoning.</p>
<p>Assume that these bananas are medium sliced bananas, which are about 8 bananas per liter (1 cup per 2 bananas). (<a href="http://homecooking.about.com/od/foodequivalents/a/bananaequiv.htm" target="_blank">http://homecooking.about.com/od/foodequivalents/a/bananaequiv.htm</a>). So, a 400-mSv dose of bananas will occupy 500 kL, or 500 m^3 , which could be a large room with dimensions 10m x 10m x 5m.</p>
<p>Edit: OBVIOUSLY, this number is not to be taken literally. Sitting next to a banana is way less exposure than eating one--especially if most of the bananas have other bananas between them and you. This is meant to put a (huge) lower bound on the number of bananas it would take to irradiate you.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this point deserves a bit more emphasis, since the difference between the two situations is huge. First of all, like /u/RobusEtCeleritas pointed out below, only about a tenth of the ionizing radiation released by potassium is in the form of gamma rays. For all intents and purposes, this is the only radiation you really have to worry about if you're just sitting in a room with the bananas. But this factor of 10 is just the beginning. You also have to consider the fact that the bananas will emit radiation in all directions. If you treat each banana as an isotropic emitter, then the fraction of the radiation that would reach you would only correspond to your surface area/the surface area of a uniform sphere at that distance, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Q0PzgLO.png" target="_blank">like this</a>. As you would expect, the intensity that would reach you will decrease as the inverse square of the distance. Moreover, the radiation that reaches you will be even less since part of the energy will be absorbed by other bananas in the way.</p>
<p>Tl;DR: You would have to <em>eat</em> an entire room full of bananas to have a chance of experiencing radiation poisoning. However, if you are only standing next to the bananas, you would probably be safe even in a huge warehouse chock full of bananas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, what if you puree'd all of the bananas and were made to swim in it so that your entire surface area is covered in it? Disgusting thought, but  would the general reduction in empty surface area change anything? How long would you have to stay submerged for it to be possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of potassium in your body is kept within tight bounds and will not rise persistently after eating a banana; the percentage of K-40 in your potassium is equal to that in the banana's potassium, so that is not changed either. So the dose increase from eating a banana, assuming you're not potassium deficient, is zero, anywhere except maybe around the GI tract if the other foods have less potassium.</p>
<p>And if the amount of potassium in your body was to increase then it would kill you by chemical toxicity of excess potassium.</p>
<p>Furthermore the other issue is that bananas, nearby humans, and other essentially non-radioactive &quot;radiation sources&quot; do work as a radiation shield and generally shield other background radiation more than they irradiate you.</p></div>		</li>
