			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer, and in the spirit of the original question, absolutely. There is nothing &quot;used up&quot; in the lifespan of the panel.</p>
<p>More realistic answer: it will probably be more efficient and cheaper not to, especially if the technology continues to improve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the situation. If you have a residential rooftop system chances are you won't have room for any more panels. Also over 20 years the cost of panels will have fallen considerably.  You are right in that many situations it will not be cost effective to replace them after 20 years.</p></div>		</li>
