			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer, but I think another point needs to be made.</p>
<p>As noted in other replies, uranium is mainly an alpha emitter, this mean the bulk of its emissions have almost no penetration into living tissue.</p>
<p>Outside of your body, alpha radiation is a non-concern unless in massive amounts.</p>
<p>Inside of your body (ingestion or inhalation of powders), it becomes a very serious issue even in limited quantities (in the case of uranium, it's toxicity is probably still more relevant).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Well the alpha decays of both ^(235)U and ^(238)U often populate excited states in the daughter nucleus, meaning that many of the alpha decays will be accompanied by subsequent gamma decays. While alphas don't penetrate very far, gamma rays travel much further in matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never seen someone in a &quot;radiation suit&quot;, and I work at a nuclear plant.  What I have seen is people in anti-contamination clothing, which basically protects their skin and clothes from getting radioactive particles on them.  Consider that typical lead shielding is one inch thick, and to give you 12 square feet of that would be 700 pounds.  Instead, the anti contamination clothing stops alphas and betas, and you just get exposed to the gammas.   It's a fact of life working at a nuclear plant, but if reddit loves to teach me anything, at least I'm not working at a coal plant!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I inspected the top of the reactor while standing 6 inches away not one month ago.  But this was a PWR, not a BWR.  Either way, I think the suit you're referring to is to prevent internal contamination, not to shield against gamma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question; is there any proof those suits actually prevent radiation from entering your body? It seems like radiation could pass right through them but they would still be offered to people as a sort of placebo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that there are still short-loved by products that make it very hot. As these die out, the radiation drops significantly until the dominant contribution is from these longer lived materials. Also, thousands of years in still a really short half life. Short enough to make it pretty hot, I think. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but it does become less dangerous over time as shorter lived isotopes decay away and stop emitting. There are some isotopes that are hard to shield against, emit very high energy particles, and continue to do so for a long time. i.e. Co-60. </p></div>		</li>
