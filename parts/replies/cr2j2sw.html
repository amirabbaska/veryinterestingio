			<div class="markdown"><p>If a baker could charge you $40,000 for a cake he would.  </p>
<p>High/inflated/manipulated pricing is not exclusive to oil companies.</p>
<p>Baker 1 Charges $40,000, Baker 2 charges 4.00</p>
<p>Who do you go to?</p>
<p>It works the same way with gas.  There no nefarious shit going on. Pricing fluctuation come from <em>mainly</em> (but not all) competition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gas in the underground tank isn't a fixed cost to the station.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My Dad owned an Amoco for 12 years, unless things have drastically changed in 20 years, this is not accurate.  You buy the gas. This may not be the same for non franchise? But it's a set price paid when the tanker drives off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas stations don't make much money off gas,  that's why they charge you money at the store for shit food,  and this only gets a reasonable living.  The large companies don't even make much per unit,  and many are struggling in America because they can't get oil and gas at competitive rates, and many of those companies  are on a large downswing. On top n that, if oil Companies  could charge whatever they wanted,  why the hell would the USA have some of the cheapest gas and oil in the 1rst world? Countries can obviously handle higher oil prices like in Europe,  but hey &quot;choose&quot;  to keep it low? Yes there are tax differences,  but you would think the prices would be at least sort of close if it was just th whim of oil companies and not economic forces.  </p>
<p>OPEC countries though we're manipulating prices  though,  and we can be mad at them, because Yeah they did have an oligopoly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure I agree entirely.  If Baker 1 is actually selling cakes for 40k, what happens when baker 2 decides to sell cakes for 40k?  It's not quite collusion, but it's certainly unethical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept in economics is called price elasticity of demand.  Gas is &quot;inelastic&quot; in the medium-long term, meaning that people will pay what they have to to consume it.  In the short run, though, people can wait a few days to fill up.  That's why stations put their prices up higher and then gradually lower them over the course of a couple weeks.  They get the inelastic demand from people who have to fill up now, and then they attract the people who can afford to wait a bit longer.</p>
<p>A quick thing to note, though, is that the station's inventory would be a set per-unit cost, unless they're not paying for it until they sell it.  Or do you mean fixed cost in the business sense of fixed cost (i.e., a cost that doesn't change with the volume of sales/production)?  Because you're definitely right that it isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only answer that I've read so far that reads like an actual answer to the question. Everyone else stating &quot;Refining prices mean more than crude oil costs&quot; / &quot;Refining prices have been steady and even dropped since the early 2000's&quot;. These are not answers. These are ruminations. Yours, my friend, is an answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Viper640 gives a poor answer though. Supply and demand, contrary to popular belief, does not alone set prices.</p>
<p>Crude oil only accounts for about 40% of the cost of gas at the pump. Refining is about a quarter, distribution and marketing around fifteen, and taxes anywhere between 10-15 (depending on where you are).</p>
<p>So let's imagine a gallon of gas is 4$. </p>
<p>The value of crude oil makes up 40% of that price (A little less than 2$ out of 4$.</p>
<p>The value  of crude oil drops by 50%, meaning that now those 2$ only costs 1$.</p>
<p>So now, the gas station charges 3$, instead of 4$.</p>
<p>The math perfectly matches OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So weird how you think that's a good answer when it's incorrect. It has to do with cost of goods sold and other things that factor into a logarithmic-ally changing price, not a proportionate one.</p>
<p>Other people said that, too. You just ignored it.</p></div>		</li>
