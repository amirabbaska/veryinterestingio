<p>IIRC, there was also something about this doing away with the phase problem of X-ray diffraction. Would that be correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's certainly not just around the corner but it's definitely close enough that people see it as a real goal.  </p>
<p>There are a variety of ways of addressing the phase problem using Fourier analysis. There are payoffs involved. Certainly, the capabilities of the XFELs and surrounding tech will, as they improve, make it more feasible to use these techniques in more applications. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a Nature article about a guy who is very successful in writing a computer program which can accurately predict the folding and therefore structure of proteins from their underlying DNA. He claimed to solve the problem of not knowing how a protein will fold in a few years. I guess together with the facility you reported about a lot of advances may be possible.
Edit: It was in Science Magazine

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without reading the article, that's probably David Baker. Rosetta is pretty impressive but it works best for proteins that will also crystallize well. The same problems that plague current structural biology are also issues for Rosetta for the same reason: They introduce too many degrees of freedom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right about Baker and Rosetta. Though Rosetta was a very early program of his lab, which was only accurate for sequences under 100aa. Their new approach with DNA sequencing is a different approach though and yields great results. AFAIK it does not have the restriction to just be accurate for small proteins. The challenge with cristallography is that it is expensive and slow. When their claims hold true and they have a decent program which can accurately predict protein structure even for bigger proteins, that would be a breakthrough. With this program they would increase knowledge way faster than cristallography is able to do, but cristallography is still a good check whether they predicted accurately.
They could go even further and start to engineer proteins and enzymes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't heard of this before but the problem I can see with predicting protein structure from DNA is that the basic sequence of amino acids in a protein is far from the only thing that determines their structure. Just for one, there are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification" target="_blank">vast number of post-translational modifications that can take place on a protein.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, but when I recall correctly that is the reason why most methods up to date failed (or had a low accuracy) but this approach is so revolutionary in contrast. They compare DNA sequences of conserved proteins in different species and can infer from the changes what parts of the protein have to be in proximity to each other.

They also mention a competition where they predicted some proteins correctly compared to cristallography. (Disclaimer: I did not reread the article today and it has been a while since I did.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are also a lot of other efforts to do this including solution phase NMR and gas phase diffraction. Cryo Em is getting close to the resolutions we need too. I'm partial to anything solution phase though as it better represents the conformations likely occupied in nature. NMR is already better for many RNA systems, which seem to be poised to seriously challenge proteins in terms of research focus. </p></div>		</li>
