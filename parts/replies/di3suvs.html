			<div class="markdown"><p>I strongly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Science-Cooking-Cooks-Illustrated-Cookbooks/dp/1933615982" target="_blank">The Science of Good Cooking</a>, a cookbook with explanations of why certain things work and how to improve some aspects of your cooking by making small changes before the food enters the pan all the way through serving it at the table.  The Maillard reaction is one of the 50 concepts they go into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087" target="_blank">The Food Lab</a> is a good book to read as well, has similar information on cooking I assume as the book you've suggested. I actually have it next to my bed right now and it's a pretty good cookbook / reference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Butter is about 80% fat, and most of the rest is water. It's a dairy product because it's made from milk, but that doesn't mean it's not fat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a chef, butter is not always the most optimum for frying due to a lower smoke point than, say, canola oil.  But it'll do in a pinch.  And it works fine for pan frying, generally.</p></div>		</li>

<p>there must be a barrier between the hot oil and the migrating water. This barrier is typically something starchy.</p>

<p>Ah, I always wondered why <em>most</em> fried foods are also breaded/battered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To reach 160℃, you would need approximately 620kPa, or basically 6 atmospheres.</p>
<p>That would be fairly easy to reach with modern equipment, but a typical home pressure cooker only goes to about 200kPa, so not quite high enough (it would only get the water up to 120℃).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are industrial combi ovens that use a combination of convection heat and steam to cook food. They're really a wonderful piece of technology and I'm sad I don't get to play with them more. They can be used for an amazing amount of applications and even have preset computer controls for specific jobs. They're amazing. </p></div>		</li>
