			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact:</p>
<p>The Swedish noun &quot;pundare&quot; is a derogatory term for someone who uses, and is addicted to, illegal drugs/substances. The verb &quot;punda&quot; is a derogatory term for the act of using drugs.</p>
<p>Originally the word punda was only used to describe the behavior, and came into use after the research conducted by the Swedish scientist mentioned in the Wikipedia article. When or how it's meaning got twisted into something derogatory, and the birth of the noun, I don't know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you can say that. Though pundare would be used to describe speed addicts whereas junkie was originally used to describe heroin addicts. </p>
<p>The reason for this is probably because amphetamines are the dominant hard drug in Northern Europe whereas opioids remain more popular in America. So this influences the terminologies that develop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And while not meth, I can’t miss an opportunity to share how they identified a chemical that induces Parkinson’s. MPTP was identified after a bunch of young <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345642/" target="_blank">drug addicts tried a new synthetic heroin and became zombies.</a></p>
<p>Edit: You can skip to the Prologue of that article, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPTP#Discovery_in_users_of_illicit_drugs" target="_blank">here's the wiki for MPTP.</a></p>

<p>We were able to obtain samples of the synthetic heroin through police raids and friendly dealers</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most dealers are friendly. They are selling a product and grumpy shopkeeps don't get many repeat customers. </p>
<p>Honestly, the friendly dealers were probably supplying the residents with uppers for when shifts got too long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a result of Parkinson's treatment, punding is caused by overactivity in off-target dopaminergic circuits; the original commenter in this chain is incorrect in asserting it's an occasional symptom of the disorder itself and and not an iatrogenic effect covered under dopamine dysregulation syndrome. More broadly, punding is usually drug-induced and tends to improve with dose reduction or cessation. </p></div>		</li>
