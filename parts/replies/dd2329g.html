			<div class="markdown"><p>It's about the whole sub-shell being filled, not just the outermost p orbitals. Those two things coincide, but it's a rather strange way to put it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep you're right. Helium has it's 1-s orbital completely filled. If you're interested you should look up first ionization energies. You'll notice that noble gases have very high first ionization energies. This is because they are naturally very stable when neutral. You'll also notice that each subsequent noble gas has a lower first ionization energy, lending credibility to the notion that each subsequent noble gas is less stable.</p></div>		</li>
