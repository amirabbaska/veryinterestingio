			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I would just add: sunscreen isn't going to improve your odds, but there are things one can do improve your odds. The catch-all solution for &quot;best way to improve you odds with least amount of effort or investment&quot; is to go inside. Sunscreen is just a tiny layer of nothing. But a building — especially if you are in the middle of said building, or in the basement — adds quite a lot of layers. While very little helps you if you are in the zone of total destruction (which for kiloton-range weapons is smaller than people think), if you are outside of that range then taking shelter does affect your survival odds considerably, both for the initial effects and the residual effects (e.g. fallout). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More accurately, it's the most dangerous part of fallout that your body readily accumulates. There's more of other stuff, but your body takes it in and then excretes it. Iodine tablets will have the best protective effect. Radioactive iodine also has a very short half-life, so it produces radiation fast when it is inside you. Your body will also accumulate Strontium, which will replace the calcium in your bones, but where iodine-131 has a half-life of 8 days, strontium-90's is 29 years, </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the bulk of the fallout but it's a particularly nasty isotope that has a very easy intake pathway (because your body craves iodine). </p>
<p>Taken not long before exposure, yes, potassium iodide helps. The difficulty is that most people don't have it and might not known when to take it. Taking it <em>after</em> exposure does very little; taking it too <em>early</em> also does not help. And it does not make one immune to radioactive effects — it just protects your thyroid. Which is a good thing to protect! But I think some people (not saying you are saying this) think it is kind of magical in a Rad-X sort of way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For singular (or small numbers of) kiloton-range weapons, within 48 hours the fallout is essentially safe to evacuate through. In the case of a small weapon (e.g. a terrorist attack) 24 hours is enough. Which is only to say, it is less time than people popularly think, but a reasonably long time if you haven't made any preparations or don't know how long you are supposed to wait.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://fas.org/irp/agency/dhs/fema/ncr.pdf" target="_blank">Lots of info here</a>.)</p>
<p>Even during the worst visions of multi-megaton Cold War weapon exchanges, people would only need to stay in the shelter for two weeks or so. That doesn't mean the world wouldn't need a lot of decontamination more generally in such a scenario, or that everything would be &quot;fine&quot; when people got out of them (there would be chronic contamination issues, to say nothing of the total destruction of much of the infrastructure of civilization and governance). But the <em>acute</em> threat from fallout is a relatively short period of time; it loses 100X of its potency every 48 hours, so even very large starting values decrease relatively rapidly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main goal is to avoid radioactive iodine.  Your thyroid will absorb it and then will give you cancer.  If you can say in the middle of the house, stuff all the cracks, because the iodine will float in the air and so you want to try to filter it out, thats why they say have &quot;plastic sheeting&quot; in a fallout kit, so you can make your house more airtight.   Store water as soon as it happens, because you dont want to eat or drink anything that might get contaminated.   It should last a couple of days beforel the iodine has decayed and become safe to travel in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yo my bad, I just noticed your question asked about &quot;not an atomic explosion.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyway, answer is still the same. Radioactive fallout hurts you in ways different from UV from the sun, so it's probably even more worthless in that case. I'll edit it into my post.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends on your distance. If you are far away and leave shortly after the explosion then UV radiation hitting your eye is a relevant concern simply because all other things are not dangerous. Applying sunscreen to the eye is not advisable, however - bring sunglasses.</p></div>		</li>
