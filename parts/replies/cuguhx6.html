			<div class="markdown"><p>The best I can suggest is to:<br />
have a raspberry pi on the same network.<br />
When power goes out, everything eventually shuts off.<br />
When power comes back up, your PC is off... yet the rPi will start right up.<br />
Configure the rPi to send a Wake-on-Lan signal to your PC.  </p>
<p>Alternately, same concept, yet hardwire the rPi to your computer's power button.  </p>
<p>Let me know if you want help with this.<br />
I love odd-ball projects like these!</p></div>		</li>
