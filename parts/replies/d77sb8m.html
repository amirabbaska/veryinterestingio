			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun somewhat related fact: In Denmark, and i think in most other Northern European countries too, we use H insted of B. My music teacher told me it was because of some german monk, who wrote down a lot of music, but had such shit handwriting, that people mistook b for h and and everybody just went along with it. Don't know if it's true though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that the reason why B is H is because in older music it was the Mixolydian (Major scale with a flat seventh degree) mode that was the common scale instead of the major scale we use today. What we today call Bb (B flat) was called B in the old system. So the scale was:
C D E F G A B + H.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in Germany. Bach used this idea to write music based on the notes B-A-C-H, most notably in &quot;The Art of the Fugue&quot;. Dmitry Shostakovich (spelt Dmitri Schostakowitsch in German) did a similar thing with DSCH, where S is E (S is pronounced Es), and the H is B natural.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that when they say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then Western music developed a particular love for Major keys, and 'C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C' happened to be the simplest one <strong><em>(read: the only way to construct a major scale using all natural notes)</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not a special property of the scale starting with the <em>frequency</em> we call C, but for the fact that we named 440Hz A. If we had named the frequency we call C as A, then the C major scale would sound like what we call E-flat major (everything shifted by 4 half-steps), but would still be all white keys. It's that A happens to be the &quot;La&quot; of Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do when &quot;Do&quot; is C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course it's not a special property of the scale starting with C, the names of the keys can be arbitrarily chosen. But once the lowest note was chosen to be A, the major scale using all natural tones began on C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all the Spanish world we use another notation of seven natural notes: <em>Do</em>, <em>Re</em>, <em>Mi</em>, <em>Fa</em>, <em>Sol</em>, <em>La</em> and <em>Si</em>, corresponding to C, D, E, F, G, A and B.</p>
<p>In fact, it is hard for a Spanish speaker to understand why the notes in the English system is shifted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti is used for teaching music to children in English. It is a newer notation system than the A-B-C notation system and thus didn't totally spread everywhere, even though Solfege (the system that uses the eight named notes) is the basis of Western music.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Music notation systems have used letters of the alphabet for centuries. The 6th-century philosopher Boethius is known to have used the first fourteen letters of the classical Latin alphabet,</p>
<p>A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-K-L-M-N-O (the letter J didn't exist until the 16th century),
to signify the notes of the two-octave range that was in use at the time[6] and in modern scientific pitch notation are represented as</p>
<p>A2-B2-C3-D3-E3-F3-G3-A3-B3-C4-D4-E4-F4-G4.
Though it is not known whether this was his devising or common usage at the time, this is nonetheless called Boethian notation. Although Boethius is the first author known to use this nomenclature in the literature, Ptolemy wrote of the two-octave range five centuries before, calling it the perfect system or complete system—as opposed to other, smaller-range note systems that did not contain all possible species of octave (i.e., the seven octaves starting from A, B, C, D, E, F, and G).</p>
<p>Following this, the range (or compass) of used notes was extended to three octaves, and the system of repeating letters A–G in each octave was introduced, these being written as lower-case for the second octave (a–g) and double lower-case letters for the third (aa–gg). When the range was extended down by one note, to a G, that note was denoted using the Greek G (Γ), gamma. (It is from this that the French word for scale, gamme derives, and the English word gamut, from &quot;Gamma-Ut&quot;, the lowest note in Medieval music notation.)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sort of notation was also used by other European composers for transposing instruments in the orchestra, most commonly the horn. Before we as a society had the mechanical proficient to create piston or rotary valves, the horn was pitched in one key and played the harmonic series that was built off of the fundamental. A horn in C, for example, would be able to play C-C-G-C-E-G-Bb-C-D-E-G-Bb-C... and the horn player could use their hand in the bell to manipulate the pitch to produce the notes between. This instrument, by switching out the main tuning slide (&quot;crook&quot;), could change keys and play the same harmonic series, but with a different fundamental note (Horn in F could play F-F-C-F-A-C-Eb-F... or Horn in Eb could play Eb-Eb-Bb-Eb-G-Bb-Db-Eb...). This feature of the instrument was invaluable to composers who wanted to write pieces in multiple keys but couldn't expect their musicians to bring or afford several instruments for rehearsals and performances.</p>
<p>The same way that the horn players had to think (and still have to think when playing era pieces) is identical to the Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si/Ti-Do scale. The horn can always play Do-Do-Sol-Do-Mi-Sol-Ta-Do... regardless of what key it was in. </p>
<p>In your music classes, you may even have heard about the debate between a &quot;movable/adjustable Do&quot; vs a &quot;static Do&quot;. A movable Do means that what pitch Do represents changes based on the key you are in (In the key of C: Do = C, Re = D; in the key of F: Do = F, Re = G) like with the horn and their crooks. A static Do is much more prevalent in Western Music in which Do always is C, but your scales adjust syllables based on key (in the key of F, a major scale would be sung: Fa-Sol-La-Ta-Do-Re-Mi-Fa). This debate ultimately comes down to the question of whether it is more important to develop absolute pitch in students or to develop relative pitch.</p></div>		</li>
