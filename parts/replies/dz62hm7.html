			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. </p>
<p>In addition to this it has always been the stated mission of SpaceX to colonise Mars. Mars' atmosphere is about 1% as dense as Earths' atmosphere, which means that parachutes are <em>MUCH</em> less effective. This accentuates the problem of parachute weight and controllability, so designing a system using retro propulsion rather than parachutes was really just SpaceX designing for their own future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Presumably due to the lower gravity on Mars retro propulsive landings are also easier than they are on Earth making them a double win over parachutes there? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are easier in the way that you need less thrust to land on Mars, but often you are going to need more fuel because the atmosphere isn't slowing you down as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Landing softly on Mars is actually one of the more difficult engineering and technology challenges, because there is enough atmosphere to cause objects to burn up if they are entering the atmosphere at orbital speeds, but the atmosphere is too thin for parachutes or ablative shields to shed enough kinetic energy.</p>
<p>Gravity on the Earth's moon, for example, is less than Mars, and without an atmosphere, spacecraft landers do not have to worry about compressive heating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never even considered this question, or the answer, but had that &quot;oh, damn.&quot; moment after reading yours. Simple answer is parachute, better answer is designing all this shit to lighten the load and get the job done more efficiently.  The precision blows my mind.  It's things like this that just put me in awe of what is going on outside my little bubble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same a few years ago.  There is already the rocket engines, tanks, fuel lines, etc... it is just adding more fuel &amp; LOX vs. adding parachutes.  Also parachute landings are not exactly slow, gentle &amp; completely vertical - the bigger the load, the bigger the chute and the longer the line, which creates a bigger pendulum effect and more horizontal velocity when touching down.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would a mixed system be feasible? Limited suicide burn at low altitude followed by parachutes? Or does that just combine worst parts of both systems?</p></div>		</li>
