<p>Although, the reason for this is relatively subtle.  To double the voltage you double the turns which means half as much conductor area per turn.  Since double the voltage means half the current (at the same power), the larger resistance doesn't cause any increased loss.  </p>
<p>The trick is that the insulator thickness stays the same even as the number of turns increases, since each turn sees the same voltage.  As the wire thickness shrinks, the area of the conductor decreases by thickness^2 while the area of the insulator is still proportional to thickness alone.  Past a certain point the area of the insulator is larger than the area of the conductor.</p>
<p>For a 10 um thick insulation (not unusual) the area of the insulation and the conductor are equal when the radius of the conductor is 24 um (<em>extremely</em> small, much finer than hair).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Real transformers can be astonishingly efficient (97-99.3% depending on size), but this question was not about efficiency in general but specifically about turns ratio. </p>
<p>The permeability, susceptibility, non-linearity, and losses in the core material are independent of the turns <em>ratio</em>. The number of turns, the frequency, <em>and the current</em> in the primary determine the relevant portion of the core's operating characteristic. If the core saturates at 1At at 60Hz, then you can just reduce the current to 0.5At; this has nothing to do with the turns ratio <em>per se</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although the permeability of the core is independent of the turns ratio, the actual size of the turns will potentially affect the size of the core which can affect the permeability and will definitely affect the core loss.</p>
<p>I mean, you're right, but in practicality it's always complex.</p></div>		</li>
