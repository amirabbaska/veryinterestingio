			<div class="markdown"><p>You're totally right, sea water is not OK to drink. But if we look purely at the term 'hydration', yes you would (re)hydrate yourself because the extracellular fluid in the body increases after drinking sea water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda confused a lil here hope you can clear it up. What fluid compartment does the term hydration refer to? After drinking say sea water wouldn't your oncotic pressure in the blood increase and in concequence draw water out of your cells to try and balance everything again, the same effect as not taking in liquid in say 2 days, in which case you would be dehydrated no? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add on the pure water is not exactly hydrating. Your intestines need sodium to facilitate absorbing water. This is especially important when you have diarrhea and try to rehydrate by drinking water only. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great comment. That's one of the reasons why tap/bottled water is never electrolyte free. </p>
<p>The best way to treat the symptoms of diarrhea is to drink a solution high in sodium and glucose (glucose increases sodium uptake). You can buy an Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS), or make one yourself.</p></div>		</li>
