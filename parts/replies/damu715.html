			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to what /u/jns_reddit_already point out.</p>
<p>For transmitting to a satellite, a direct transmission makes more sense. On earth we are not as constrained by power as we are with a satellite. It is therefore easier to position the antenna, and generate the large amount of power needed. </p>
<p>Because of the power restrictions, a very large number of satellites would be needed. Those things are expensive. </p>
<p>So really you have two options. Option 1, spend a lot of money making a large number of satellites, and then a large amount of time to position them correctly, repair them (or replace them more likely) when they break. Option 2, increase the code length in software^([1]).</p>
<p>[1] Not actually in software, ECC decoding algorithms can be really bulky. Usually they run at a lower level. </p></div>		</li>
