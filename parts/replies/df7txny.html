			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in general, that is what happens, just not atom by atom (you could say that is the case where domains are atomic size). It comes down to the fact that it requires energy to create those separations (domain walls) to begin with. See, if all the moments were align uniformly throughout the material, it would create a magnetostatic field outside of the material (this stores magnetostatic energy). But that would be a very high energy state, so the single domain splits into smaller domains (in order for the macroscopic field to decrease with each division), each with different orientations of their moments. To create these seperate domains requires some energy (in order to seperate the adjacent dipoles that would be in different directions along the domain walls), so the separation continues ocurring until the energy saved from decreasing the field equals the energy cost of creating a domain wall. The orientation of the domains is typically random within the material (similar to grain size varying randomly within a material) and is typically a net zero magnetization. Though, you can magnetize the material and cause it retain some magnetization, since you'd disrupt the domain orientations with an external field, and when you remove the field, it never quite returns to the original state (this is hysteresis, and varies with how the material responds to the field, ie ferro/ferrimagnetic).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is due to the exchange energy. It is a quantum mechanical effect which essentially arises from the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons whos spins are paired will have a higher repulsion than those in a parallel configuration. For some metals it is favourable for the spins to be paired and the magnetic moments are cancelled out, they do not display ferromagnetism. For iron, cobalt and nickel, the electrons arrange themselves into a parallel orientation as the minimum energy state and therefore they have a large magnetisation (magnetic moments per unit volume). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazing explanation - cheers. Though I was wondering where I could find a more layman explanation of magnetic moments, magnetic dipole orientation and exchange interaction as I've come across some of those terms but don't know what they mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything that talks about classical electromagnetism (Griffith's EM is amazing, and I believe hyperphysics has a few good pages on it) can be used as an adequate analogy for mangetic moments and dipoles, really (to give you a taste, standard magnets are dipoles, they have a north pole and a south pole. A magnetic moment is simply a magnetic vector quantity that allows you to predict how a dipole reacts to an external magnetic field. What you'll have is that the external field will exert a torque on the dipole in order to orient it along the same direction as the field). As for the exchange interaction, it is purely a quantum mechanical phenomena, and I have yet to see any classical analogy of it (though truthfully, any classical analogy would cause a lot of misconceptipns, just as the classical analogy of quantum spin does).</p></div>		</li>
