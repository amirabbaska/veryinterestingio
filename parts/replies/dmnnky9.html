			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice job....except not correct. Visible light has a wave length on the nano meter scale while 5GHz wifi is just over 0.5cm...in other words wifi &quot;light&quot; is about 100 million times LARGER than visible light. So, according to your explanation wifi is so tiny it travels through walls, yet light that is 100 million times smaller doesn't (since we all know visible light doesnt pass through walls).</p>
<p>Let me give it a shot: When you hold up a piece of paper to the light, you can see light coming through. Since wifi &quot;light&quot; is 100 million times larger than visible light (see above) your 1 foot thick wall appears 100 million times thinner to wifi than it does to visible light. So your wall is like a thin sheet of paper as far as wifi is concerned and you can easily &quot;see&quot; it through you &quot;paper&quot; wall.</p>
<p>Leaving the 5yr old explanation realm; the whole thing about wifi being so small it passes in between the molecules is wrong, BUT that is the proper explanation for things like x-rays which are much smaller than visible light and does fit between atoms of low density material, but this is a totally different mechanism than the wifi thing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always liked the explanation that compares waves with tunnel drillers. Following a high-frequency-like pattern of drilling a tunnel through a wall of a certain width, makes you go up and down many times without moving so much forward, so for a certain distance higher frequencies have to travel a much longer path. For a given number of wave peaks, lower frequencies extend across a larger distance, colliding with less mass (due to following a more straight-like path than high frequencies) and thus attenuating less. Would that be correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. However I will qualify this idea with a big &quot;it depends&quot; lots of interaction s occurring that could change how one frequency propagates vs another. However, you have the general idea, everytime a wave crests it loses some energy, so if visible light crests 1,000,000 to go through a wall you wont get anything, hence we dont see through walls, but a 2.5cm wave 5GHz signal crests a few times in the same wall goes right through.
By the way, thats why 2.4GHz wifi has less range than 5GHz wifi...the 5Ghz is a shorter wavelength and 'crests' more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An electrical engineer should realize I said the <em>particles</em> were small, not the wavelength. The particles are so tiny they travel through stuff. All kinds of particles do it. Hell, Neutrinos are so small they can travel through millions of miles of lead without hitting anything. Although, Wifi isn't made of neutrinos.</p>
<p>Edit: Actually, you should /really/ know this because electricity travels through wire as a waveform and the electrons barely move. The distinction should had been really obvious to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sooooo.....not so much. EM 'waves' are a combination of electric and magnetic fields, though they do exhibit properties similar to particles(photons), there are no particles shooting around. And waves like you see in a text book are just a very simplified way for us to visualize what is going on, there is no up and down motion by anything. Imagine this: you have a sting of billiard balls and you hit one end so that they strike each other down the line. That is a 'wave.' no up and down, all linear but we think of this as a wave. (Now imagine that in 3D going in all directions.)
Current in wires has nothing to do with this either. (Though a change in current does create an EM wave, but thats beside the point) I assure you that electrons in wires are not bouncing up and down clunkin and clacking all the way down the wire.</p></div>		</li>
