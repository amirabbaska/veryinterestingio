			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you for this reply, this is very helpful. one question. by “everything expanding” do they mean galaxies are getting farther apart, or so they mean that everything is getting bigger, you, me, all atoms? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we still dont know what we will be able to do in the future, we might be able to work around those problems, and we still havent figured out black holes either. I choose to stay optimistic about humanity's future.
It all depends on whether or not we blow ourself up before we unite as 1 planet tho, which i doubt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That galaxies are getting further apart. Space is expanding even on atomic scales, but at that scale it is <em>extremely</em> weak, to the point that it's unmeasurable. It is a force easily overcome by electromagnetic forces holding atoms together. Even on galactic scales, it is easily overcome by gravitational forces holding stars together. It's only on the scale of large groups of galaxies that it becomes a significant factor. The galaxies don't enlarge, they are simply carried away from one another, like rafts on a divergent stream.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can somewhat comprehend these ideas but this is always the one the breaks my mind.<br />
Why is there even something rather than nothing. How can something just appear into existence and why? Especially when you take into account the first law of the thermodynamics that energy cannot be created or destroyed. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a question that the scientific method is not equipped to answer (no matter what Lawrence Krauss says).</p>
<p>Regarding energy being created or destroyed, though, the big bang and expansion of the universe doesn't necessarily violate that - there are negative forms of energy, like gravitational potential energy of mass close to another mass - it requires an input of energy to move them apart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is a slight misunderstanding</p>
<blockquote>

<p>the implication here is that there was a <em>before</em>, <em>then</em> the big-bang happened, and <em>then</em> space as we know it formed. this is not an appropriate implication. space and time are one and the same (&quot;spacetime&quot;) and one does not exist without the other. there was no <em>before</em> the big-bang, because spacetime came <em>with</em> the big bang. the big bang is just as far back as we can extrapolate timeable things.</p></div>		</li>
