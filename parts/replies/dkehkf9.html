			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting idea. On the other hand, the human body may have evolved to be dependent on cooked food. There are few environments so rich in calories that people could survive on raw food alone, so it may be that people who forgot how to use fire would have starved or been replaced by people that did.</p></div>		</li>
