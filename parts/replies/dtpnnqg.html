			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, sorry about that. </p>
<p>Imagine you are sitting in a room with a black door on one end and a red door on the other. People can only walk in through the red door and out through the black door, but every time they do, they flick your ear.  The red door takes ten people to open it and to keep it open, so it can’t open until ten are there, and it closes when one of them passes through to flick your ear.  </p>
<p>Now, put a thousand people outside the red door. They will start pouring through and flicking your ear really fast. The people are the salt and the flicking of your ear is the pain that your brain is sensing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the tiny parts of your body send messages to each other, they do it by pushing little bits of chemicals in and out, including tiny split pieces of salt. </p>
<p>When you dump all that extra salt in there, a lot more of it seeps in, and they start thinking everybody's shouting so they shout louder too when they pass on the message.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that it isn't actually bad for you?</p>
<p>Most pain occurs proportional to the amount of harm the action causes, so things that hurt more should be avoided more.  Does this short-circuiting mean that it's cheating the system and causing severe pain without severe harm?  Or can it actually damage the nerves or surrounding tissue?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, yes. Most pain arises from things we should avoid, but it does so via very sensitive circuitry. An electrical signal is being generated, and since your brain associates that signal with pain, you feel pain. It doesn't matter that theres no real danger, your brain is dumb and confused and defaults to pain.</p></div>		</li>
