			<div class="markdown"><p>I just gave one. In Snow White (1937) the evil potion is green, the poison the apple is dipped in is green. In Sleeping Beauty all of Maleficant's magic is green.  In Disney animated movies in general green is the evil/dangerous color. In the Little Mermaid, Ursula's lightning is green. In the Lion King, Scar's lair is green. Most of the evil characters have green eyes. The list goes on.</p></div>		</li>
