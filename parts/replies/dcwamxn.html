			<div class="markdown"><p>Great info.  I always think of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as being a static &quot;oil tank&quot; that is always filled and ready in case of war or oil shortages.  Does this reserve need to be rotated or refilled somehow that would justify a $1B subsidy per annum?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Petroleum Engineer here:<br />
The SPR are generally just easy to access reservoirs with nearby facilities for turning the crude oil into useful products in Louisiana, Texas, and the Gulf.  It doesn't need to be filled regularly as it isn't used very often (last time was 2005 after Hurricane Katrina), but was originally filled with direct purchases. We currently have around 700 MM barrels (~40 days usage, at max drawdown).  </p>
<p>Think of it like this:<br />
If the government didn't 'subsidize' the oil companies who own the reservoirs, then the companies would simply produce the oil on their own.  This would mean that the government wouldn't have an emergency oil fund and would be extremely susceptible to outside interference with the oil supply.  It was designed specifically with the actions of OPEC in the 70's in mind.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually makes great sense, thanks.    </p>
<p>If I understand what you are saying the oil companies actually own the oil, not the U.S.  Therefore, technically, if they got a better offer from another country they could forego the subsidy and sell the oil? (not likely, I understand)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geopolitics is interesting. The notion that oil companies produce oil is silly; they are permitted to remove oil from our planet.</p>
<p>edit: trying to make it make more sense...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would definitely have ongoing costs for things like maintenance and security. It's an unfathomable amount of oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also obligations as a part of the International Energy Agency were we have to loan out the oil to other countries, and there's certain costs associated with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a lot, in the grand scheme of things.  It's only about 700MM barrels (40 days @ 2013 US consumption).  As far as security goes the reserves are underground reservoirs of oil that are readily producible, not in surface tanks susceptible to tampering.  </p>
<p>EDIT:
<a href="http://clui.org/ludb/site/bryan-mound-strategic-petroleum-reserve-storage-site" target="_blank">Here</a> is an image of the Bryan Mound reserve site (Capacity: 226MM barrels).  You'll notice that there are only 4 surface batteries (which aren't really for storage in the way you'd probably think though they can / do contain oil).  This facility has 20 underground chambers located below salt dome traps.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I feel like an uninformed swine. I always thought of myself as being well informed in all means of political issues. I guess I had always assumed that subsidy meant exactly as you said. No one had ever spoken out against that. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen this explained many times, but the fact is that it is simply more fun and comforting to one's biases to ignore it, and assume they get a cheque due to the end game results of some kind of evil master plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this. I personally work in the oil industry, but in just about every way I would consider myself a progressive. I'm obviously biased, but I think that big oil is unnecessarily vilified. By this point all major oil companies are on board with climate science. It took some of them longer than others to admit it, but now most are positioning themselves for a greener future. </p>
<p>Heck my company has an entire arm now dedicated to this energy transition. That part of the company has been set up to lose billions over the next decade just so that they can further investment and research into alternatives. We even support responsible regulation on our industry. There is money to be made as a responsible company that cares about the future. </p>
<p>As in most scenarios, it's too bad both sides don't realize that while they may disagree on how to get there, they're really working towards the same things. We'd get there a lot faster if we just worked together. </p></div>		</li>
