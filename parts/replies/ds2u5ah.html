			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not going to happen now, but we could look at Mars for an example.   Scientists believe Mars once had much more water on it's surface.  Mars does not have very much atmosphere, only about 1% of earth's, and has almost no magnetosphere.

<p>with no magnetosphere the solar winds and radiation can and will strip much of the water and other resources out into space.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The earth actually used to have no ozone. Until photosynthesizing life showed up, there was almost no oxygen/ozone in the atmosphere, and creatures mostly lived in the water, because the sun was too strong on land. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth eventually <em>will</em> become a desert planet, inevitably. The sun is gradually increasing in intensity, and its habitable zone will eventually expand outside the orbit of the Earth. The oceans will boil and enter the atmosphere. Luckily we are talking on the timescale of over a billion years, but it will happen.</p>
<p>If you wanted to do it artificially, you might try hurling large asteroids at the planet. A single large impact would be enough to vaporize the ocean, and successive impacts are theorized to be capable of blowing away the atmosphere entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree with your answer, but one more compounding factor here is that as the water level rises over areas that were previously land, the weight will actually sink the earth’s crust down as it does during ice ages, decreasing the maximum altitude the water needs to reach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For shallow coastal seas I don't expect this to be a major factor, and you also have to consider that in some areas the land is still rebounding from the ice ages--which is why in the baltic, for example, the sea level is falling relative to the local land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We’re not really talking about shallow coastal seas though - we’re talking about topping everest which means 8.85km of ocean in areas at 0m elevation, or over 7km deep above Denver (the mile high city). For reference the Antarctic ice sheet is only 2km thick on average. Glaciers also only really stretched to Seattle on the west coast, somewhere around New York on the east.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick maffs for u big shaqs out there: </p>
<p>Earth radius (google) is: 6371 km
Volume Extra=4/3 pi(6379.8^3 - 6371^3 )
Volume extra would be closer to 4 billion cubic km of water. But do to my Google skills I'll say good nuff</p>
<p>Ting goes Skraaaaa </p>
