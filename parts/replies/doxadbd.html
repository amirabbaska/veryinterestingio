			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good question.  One to which I don't have an answer.</p>
<p>The trends I spoke of prior are relevant to one's genetically-encoded body size and brain size.</p>
<p>For those who experience a change in body size during adulthood, I would be surprised if they had a rapid growth of additional neurons / nerves to handle the potential for increased sensory input.</p>
<p>(completely conjecture / theory) - I'm not sure if you would feel less pain (as your existing nerves would quickly generate more nerve endings).  However, I would not be surprised if the resolution was poorer on a fat person.</p>
<p>When I say resolution, I mean the minimum distance one could perceive the movement of something small like a pin-needle on someone's body.</p>
<p>I theorize this because, in this situation, the number of inputs in the brain is unlikely to change much.  As such, one neuron on a skinny person may monitor less skin area than the same neuron when that person is fat (still conjecture).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah I think I see the confusion. I interpreted &quot;do fatter people have more nerves&quot; as &quot;no&quot; because to me, if the T12 spinal nerve branches to cover it's respective dermatome, I don't see that as having &quot;more nerves,&quot; just more branches off the same nerve. </p>
<p>Regarding the brain involvement, I defer to your judgement, I am still a student after all!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much for this insightful answer! The &quot;sensory resolution&quot; is the thing I was also trying to say. No need to go out of your way to find more literature, though.</p></div>		</li>
