			<div class="markdown"><p>Some years ago I noticed a charge for a set of golf clubs to my credit card.  I found this surprising since I don't play golf.  I contacted AMEX and the shipping company as well.  I was able to find out the clubs were going to be delivered in the next few days to an address in my town.  I was so pleased with my Sherlock Holmes abilities &amp; looked forward to my own private episode of COPS - the police stakeout, swat teams entering the building, the perp walk, etc.  But when I contacted the local police (medium sized city) they weren't interested at all.  They couldn't care less even though I was giving them all of the info on a silver platter.  Pretty disappointing . . .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We recently identified the woman who stole my wife's wallet via surveillance at the Walmart she used the physical credit card at and were able to get both the footage and the identity of the woman to the police. So far all we've heard from the cops is a question as to whether we want to press charges. We said &quot;yes,&quot; but haven't heard anything more over the last few weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That IS disappointing. If I had a CC fraud case like that, I'd be sooo happy... doing hours of paperwork for a case you know you can't solve is insanely frusterating at times. Being fed a perp...that's gold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I once had someone western union themselves $300 out of my account. When I called western union to find out what happened, they couldn't tell me anything. I asked can you at least tell me who I supposedly wired this money to? Who picked it up? Nope, privacy laws prohibited them from telling ME, the person who supposedly wired this money out of my own account, who I wired the money to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense when you allow for the possibility of errors. If someone accidentally transposed a couple of account numbers and just happened to get money from your account by mistake. Western Union would rather just resolve the issue than hand out the personal information of someone and risk the party that perceives itself wronged from attempting to get misguided retribution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the biggest things about Western Union is that they won't give you your money back. It's pretty much once it's gone, that's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like you're getting a lot of flak just from speaking an unfortunate truth. I got your back :)    </p>
<p>Digital Forensic Engineer/Investigstor here (well I do almost all things infosec, but started as an investigator). While I work in the private sector,  I happen to have an abundance of law enforcement friends from local to federal. My old company was often asked to assist on cased and projects that they either did not have the time or expertise for. I can back up everything you are saying here.     </p>
<p>While I did not deal so much with Cc companies and trying to get things filed in court, I do know how difficult it can be to get anyone to cooperate.     </p>
<p>Hell, many of my coworkers and myself included have had our Cc numbers stolen many many times. Usually happens 3 or 4 times a year to me. We follow the steps needed to report,  cancel,  and get refunds but we also try to gain as much Intel as we can and then turn it over to some of our friends. Many times we have tied the cards back to organized crime groups that have moved into the cyber world.    </p>
<p>A note on repack and reship scams,  happened to my good buddies dad. He was laid off and needed work bad, found a work from home gig on Craigslist. After a couple of weeks it started to seem more and more scammy. My buddy contacted me to look into the company only to find they didn't exist. They reported it to law enforcement and followed the proper channels. The funny thing was when a manager of the postal service in their town came to their house to talk about them,  he brought the rest if the packages that were addressed to my buddies dad and left them. He didn't say to keep them or turn them in,  just basically sat then down,  smiled, and left. He got a nice collection of brand new computer parts,  tablets, and phones out of the deal.    </p>
<p>Anyway,  keep fighting the good fight brotha/sista. Don't let the haters get you down. Thanks for what you do and stay frosty!</p></div>		</li>
