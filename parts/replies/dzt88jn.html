			<div class="markdown"><p>How is the signal different from the noise? Aren't they both just photons, one from the source we want and the other not?</p>
<p>I imagine the source of the signal is being followed in some way, while the noise isn't? If you have a source on this, I'd love to read about it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think u/mandragara is referring to <strong>shot noise</strong> specifically, or does that rule hold for all noise?</p>
<p>This is only one way for noise to be introduced, and it covers what you may be thinking of, that photons aren't consistently perfectly in the same spot, so the longer your exposure the more likely you can pinpoint exactly where they're coming from. </p>
<p>There are other ways to intruduce noise as well. For example, the camera itself is noisy. If you took a photo with the lens cap on, the electronics of your camera would generate noise from the electric fields of the electronics. Also, the sensor filters may not be perfectly collecting the wavelengths you expect. Maybe ultraviolet light is being recorded by the blue pixels and infrared light is being recorded by the red pixels, so you may consider this noise if you only wanted to record the visual spectrum.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but I was trying to keep it simple. Other sorts of noise, dark noise etc, are all real sources of noise and have different properties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's super interesting, and it comes from Maxwell's equations, right?</p>
<p>Thank you, never thought about applying it to such cases!</p></div>		</li>
