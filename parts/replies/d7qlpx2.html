			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be top comment and not the vague ones above, since it's the only one that actually goes through the theory to a sufficient degree. I'll try to put it even more succintly: <strong>Whether a material behaves as a liquid or solid depends on the strain rate and temperature</strong>. No material is exclusively either at any shear rate, and which one dominates depends, but &quot;liquidity&quot; can be defined unambiguously: viscous flow with loss of energy to viscous heating must exceed the elastic, reversible, spring-like energy storage.</p>
<p>There are Newtonian fluids, for which the viscosity is the same regardless of strain rate. No real fluid is a Newtonian fluid at all shear rates, but some are pretty close. There are solid-like, springy gels, which could be called Ostwald-de Waele power-law fluids: their viscosity decreases with shear rate, and is very high with low shear. They never truly &quot;flow&quot;, only resist less with more shear. (<a href="http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/toc/id:kpSRCF0007/structure-rheology-complex/structure-rheology-complex" target="_blank">Larson 1999</a>) Also, you have mentioned &quot;Cross fluids&quot; (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0095-8522\(65\)90022-X" target="_blank">Cross 1965</a>), which combine these two extreme cases: they have a &quot;zero-shear viscosity&quot; that they approach at lower and lower shear rates, but then become &quot;springy&quot; with a higher shear rate, approaching power-law behavior with a lower viscosity at high shear. There is also a further model, the Carreau model (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2509\(68\)87018-6" target="_blank">Bird 1968</a>), where the liquid eventually &quot;breaks&quot; from the stress at high shear rate and there's another Newtonian plateau where it behaves like a liquid.</p>
<p>For Newtonian fluids, the loss modulus is always higher than the storage modulus: they're always liquid-like. For power-law fluids, the loss modulus is always lower than the storage modulus: they're always gels. But for Cross fluids, there is a <em>cross-over point</em>: over a critical shear rate, the storage modulus overtakes the loss modulus. For glass, the critical shear rate is impossibly low at room temperature and we're safe to call it a solid. But for cheese, only moderate heating is enough to put the cross-over point into a realistic shear rate. Interestingly, if there's no chemical change in the liquid, you can overlay shifted high-temperature viscosity vs. shear rate data on the low-temperature data and they match. Effectively, heating can give you access to higher shear rates, and cooling to lower shear rates. Sounds like a totally magical correlation but it actually works for Cross fluids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make your own! (though by cheating) take some honey and freeze it in liquid nitrogen and you can (likely) fracture it like steel. Alternatively, to do this at room temperature, you would have to pull on honey very very quickly, likely faster than possible without very specialized equipment but potentially possible to see with high speed cameras.</p></div>		</li>
