			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on your area. Parks near me rarely have more than a few people in them. I work next to a beautiful park and often marvel at how few people utilize it. So asking someone to go for a walk in the park would be seen as more of a romantic &quot;let's be alone&quot; type of situation. This would obviously add some perceived risk from the other party's perspective.</p></div>		</li>
