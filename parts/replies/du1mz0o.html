			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I'm a speech pathologist. I work in a medical setting and don't do a ton of traditional &quot;articulation therapy&quot; but I have some clinical thoughts on this. Unfortunately I have no research to back it up.</p>
<p>A &quot;speech impediment&quot; (as in predictable speech sound errors that emerge in childhood and do not arise from a known deformity or neurologic cause) are usually grouped into two categories: <strong>articulation disorders</strong> and <strong>phonological disorders</strong>.  Articulation disorders are what most people think of:  an audible distortion of a sound made as a result of improper placement of the articulators, or improper direction of the airflow through the articulators.  These are your standard lisps (like producing an /s/ by placing your tongue between your teeth, or by directing the airflow across the sides of your tongue instead of the center).</p>
<p>A phonological disorder is harder to grasp without a background in linguistics, but is the predictable pattern in which speech sounds are substituted, omitted, or altered according to the psychologically real patterns that exist in and across languages.  An example of this in English would be the process of &quot;fronting&quot; in which velar stop sounds (/k, g/) are replaced with their alveolar counterparts (/t, d/) resulting in words like <em>tootie</em> for cookie.  There are many of these patterns (referred to as phonological processes), and the majority are developmental, as in most kids will grow out of them without therapy. However, some will eventually overlap with articulation disorders.  For example, the common process of &quot;gliding&quot; one's /r/s (<em>wabbit</em> for rabbit) is a normal process for a 3 year old, but will eventually turn into a long-term articulation disorder as that child approaches 7 or 8 if they don't ever learn to produce a true /r/ and grow out of it independently.</p>
<p>My guess is that based on the phonological rules that are common across languages, there are always going to be normal, developmental phonological processes that are approximately equal in distribution across languages because they appear to be based on psychological constructs of how we perceive and organize speech sounds.  However, articulation disorders are overwhelmingly more common on certain sets of phonemes - in English, it's liquid phonemes /l, r/ and sibilants /s/, &quot;sh,&quot; and &quot;ch.&quot; This is because they tend to be the more complex phonemes in terms of placement and coordination of airflow than a simple stop sound such as /p/ or /t/.  This would lead me to conclude that phonological disorders are likely to be seen at similar rates across languages, but that articulatory disorders are likely to be more common only if the language has a disproportionate representation of complex continuant sounds such as liquids, fricatives, and affricates.</p>
<p>Again, no research to back this up, just a couple years of working with kids and adults with a variety of speech disorders. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that Indo European languages have (roughly) comparable numbers of stops vs. continuant sounds, because they are derived from the same source. My knowledge of other language families is limited but I do know that there exists at least one language with no continuant consonants (Rotokas), so presumably that would be the one least likely to have articulation disorders. </p>
<p>Edit: I looked it up and I'm incorrect - Rotokas does have voiced continuant consonants.  So now I'm not sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do know that in Russia, it's considered a prominent and full-blown speech impediment if you can't properly roll your R's - like how &quot;speech impediment&quot; to Americans usually means someone who can't pronounce a rhotic R properly. Vladimir Lenin was one person who couldn't do it, and he has dozens of impersonators that overly exaggerate it for comic effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is considered a speech impediment in every language which uses the roller R but is usually corrected by a speech language pathologist in childhood. It is the most common form of speech impedient in children, and it someone doesn't get it fixed and still speaks it like an adult, they should like a child. If someone wants to impersonate a child, they speak without rolling the R. The mayor of my town has a problem with rolling his R's and everyone mocks him for it behind his back...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not every language. Standard Swedish uses rolled R:s and anything else is considered a speech impediment, <em>unless</em> you're from the south where all local accents use glottal R:s or silent R:s. </p></div>		</li>

And we hear a V instead of a R in people with this speech impediment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A rolled /r/ is not considered a disorder; however a distorted /r/ is.  So if an /r/ sounds like a /w/ then it would be considering an articulation error.  /r/ is one of the last sounds to develop within phonetic development. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason it takes so long to develop is because /r/ isn't really /r/ - it's /ɻʷ~ɹʷ~ɻ~ɻ/. It's a retroflex or alveolar approximate, which is already an uncommon sound, and sometimes it's even labialized. </p>
<p>If someone pronounces their retroflex labialized approximate (/ɻʷ/) as a velar labialized approximate (/ɰʷ/ or /w/, same sound) all that's happening is that place of articulation is moving back a stage. It goes from having the tip of the tongue pulled back to the molars, to the back of the tongue going to where /k/ is usually made. </p>
<p>This is relatively easy of a mistake to make, retroflex consonants basically require folding your tongue in half - something that's easy once you're doing it every day your entire life but that's tricky when you're four.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most languages that make an R sound roll it, but you can roll it in two different ways. The Spanish R is rolled in the front, the French/German R is rolled in the back, and the English R is not rolled at all. </p></div>		</li>

<p>languages with larger phoneme inventories... more things to potentially get wrong</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hijacking this to ask another question, do speakers of languages with smaller phoneme inventories have an easier time communicating in noisy environments?</p>
<p>With English, there is so much that could be similar that you might mishear in a noisy nightclub or factory, but a speaker of a language with only two sounds would be like communicating via radio CW mode and less likely to mistake one for the other.</p>
<p>Bilingual speakers, do you switch languages for use in noisy places?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I speak Italian (native speaker), English (on a daily base, you could say I'm quite proficient) and a very little bit of Japanese.</p>
<p>In a noisy environment, I find really difficult to understand English, more than with Italian of course. It's pretty funny, though, that I can distinguish a lot better Japanese sounds, even better than Italian, albeit I can not understand their meaning 90% of time.</p>
<p>So, at least for me and for Japanese (which has very simple sounds), I'd say your statement is true up to a certain extent.</p></div>		</li>
