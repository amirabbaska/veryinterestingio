			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that's the result of a difference in pressure between your inner ear and your outer ear, and not really considered in my original reply. I'm not sure what the ramifications are as far as damage to one's hearing, but my best guess is that turning up the volume on your music probably would not increase the net pressure on your ear drum (not sure about the stereocilia, though). Maybe someone with more medical knowledge than I have can answer.</p>
<p>The simple answer would seem to be a stick of chewing gum to open up the eustachian tubes and equalize the pressure, but as someone with chronic sinus issues, I know that may not always do the trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your ears will quickly equalise on the way up, so during the cruise you won't experience any pressure related volume reduction.</p>
<p>Lower volume should mostly be because of the loud engines.</p></div>		</li>
