			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, women also have a cremaster, it just doesn't develop so it's much smaller. There's thus nothing technically stopping them from getting some sensation though it's unlikely. Though I will say that this is also a bit of simplification. The tingling feeling OP is describing is likely a combination of several different aspects of the panic response and the other aspects are probably less gendered. The cremaster thing is just the main suspect with regard to the testis tinglies.</p></div>		</li>
