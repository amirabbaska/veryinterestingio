			<div class="markdown"><p>In capacitive touchscreens the electrically conductive layer is actually on the <em>inside</em> surface of the glass. When a conductive object, like a finger, is pressed against the outer surface of the glass the whole system - two conductors separated by an insulator - forms a capacitor (thus capacitive touchscreen). This change in electrical properties of the inner layer can be detected.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then why does it not work if there a crack in the screen?</p>
<p>Last week i got my first tablet ever, it felt during the initial charging,  then there was a hole in the screen. Now it is not reacting to touch anywhere, even far away from the crack, where everything looks fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see people with phones that are cracked all to hell but work fine (iPhones seem to, for one example), I cracked mine once and it didn't work anywhere below the crack but worked fine above the crack. In some designs a crack breaks the actual wires that make the sensor grid, since they are attached to the glass, in others it's a layer down and doesn't care what shape the glass is in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cracked screen should work fine capacitively.  I used an absolutely shattered screen for months.  </p>
<p>In your case, I would guess that some electrical contact inside was broken by whatever impact damaged the screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the key thing with capacitive screens is that the capacitive coupling between your finger and the front-plane conductor isn't very strong, and so you need to bring your finger quite close to the screen surface in order for the electronics to detect its presence. Capacitive touchscreens are essentially possible due to two key materials developments: high conductivity, high transparency transparent conducting oxides  (TCOs, of which ITO is the gold standard), and extremely thin, very tough glass substrates (e.g. Gorilla Glass). Better TCOs mean that you can detect smaller changes in capacitance, while thinner glass means that you can bring your finger closer to the active material, increasing your capacitance signal.</p>
<p>Practically, that means that should probably get a worse touch response with a screen protector, because your finger will be farther away from the TCO layer, and the capacitive signal will be weaker. The touchscreen software is usually tuned such that it only detects a signal at a distance close to the thickness of the screen itself so you don't get phantom clicks from stray capacitive fields.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to that, similar to the actual physical pressure in resistive screens, the new iPhone uses a laser network and measures the deflection in the beam/glass to detect pressure sensitivity. </p></div>		</li>
