			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad told me that, in Romania at least, during the Communist era, &quot;twinning&quot; cities was also done to prevent destruction of cultural items. So the communists couldn't destroy a church or some monument because the twin city would object. It would be nice if someone could confirm this theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting. I've always wondered about a place I used to commute through and saw a sign about it's twinned cities (Spelthorne, UK and Grand Port, Mauritius).<br />
Turns out they have <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/mauritius/4161699/Surrey-borough-twinned-with-Mauritius.html" target="_blank">next to nothing in common</a>, the mayor for the district just liked Grand Port as a holiday destination.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Paris, Kentucky.. they had a guy (Main Street Steve) who was the most incredible downtown advocate there ever was (RIP, Steve :( ) and evidently we in Paris, Kentucky were sister citied to Paris, France and he coordinated a trip (for the well established) to visit France. I'm sure no one in Paris Kentucky would be so nearsighted as to attempt to eradicate the real Parisians, but I thought it was a nice gesture and lament my financial situation that I have yet to obtain a passport or go anywhere since the passport became a requirement to visit Canada like 11 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I though that Paris (France) was only twinned with Rome (Italy). But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_twin_towns_and_sister_cities_of_Paris" target="_blank">it appears that</a> there is a difference between twin city and sister city. </p></div>		</li>
