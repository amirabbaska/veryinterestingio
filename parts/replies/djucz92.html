			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound pressure level can be measured (often given in dB) and does a decent job of quantifying loudness of sounds. For humans, an A-weighting frequency filter is used, to amplify the perceived sound amplitude in dB according to our biological bias with frequency response, because the human ear is more sensitive to some frequencies of sound than others. This adjusted amplitude scale is called dB(A).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, the perception of loudness is modulated. Humans have built in defence mechanisms (m. Stapedius and tensor tympani) which will reduce the transmitted amplitude of loud noises. If an animal lacks these they would experience certain loud noises differently (like some humans with paresis of the facial nerve).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are correct though that we cannot make comment about how an animal perceives loudness, to an extent. We don't have access to their view or experience and they can't tell us.</p>
<p>Generally we can get an idea of such thinga by seeing how the brain does its thing. But assuming it to be essentially similar to us is not wrong.</p>
<p>This is really more a philosophy thing though, I guess! You are entirely right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can test animals through some training. An investigator is an animal testing animals by playing a prize game. For the voices given to the animals, if they go to get the reward, it sounds like they heard that voice. If they do not take any action, it sounds like they have not heard a voice.</p>

<p>while dogs as an example hear from 67 to 45,000 Hz (or 45 kHz)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A question I have always had about this is, we hear an increasing pitch of the sound as the frequency rises. What kind of sonic perception do they have in their minds at frequencies beyond 20KHz. It is interesting in that I can more readily imagine what a pit viper snake sees in infrared, or an insect sees in ultraviolet than I can imagine what the dog, or for that matter bats (hear up to ~100KHz),  at those higher frequencies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to imagine because no human has ever truly heard any sound at that frequency. We have turn things from that frequency to audible ones for us, but never truly staying at the original  high range. Have you ever heard of The Shepherd Scale? It's an audio illusion that makes it seem like it goes forever higher and higher in pitch as you listen. Thats the closest I can imagine to getting something to show you how it might sound after a long enough time listening.</p></div>		</li>
