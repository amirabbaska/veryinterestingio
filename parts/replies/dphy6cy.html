			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the same thing prior to reading your post.  That lack of empathy gives the good nurses a bad name.  By the way, the &quot;fillers&quot; are the last thing that causes and OD.  From a business standpoint the &quot;fillers&quot; are usually something that is cost effective (baking soda, baby laxative,  etc.), nothing that will cause an OD.  Cutting cocaine with baby laxative, cost effective, will not cause an OD.  Cutting cocaine with meth, would most likely get you supernova high, and cause an OD.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they mean heroin with fentanyl. Fentanyl has become very cheap and because it's active in such small doses it only takes one 'hotspot' (a part of the powder having a higher concentration of fentanyl to heroin) to OD. </p></div>		</li>
