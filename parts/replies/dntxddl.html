			<div class="markdown"><p>Does buoyancy really come from they pressure gradient? I thought the pressure gradient comes from gravity and the buoyancy comes from gravity also, but the gradient doesn't produce the buoyant force. Can you clarify please? I'm confused.</p></div>		</li>

Say you have a cube with edge length of L. </p>
<p>The buoyancy equation is</p>
<pre><code>   B = rho_f*V*g = rho_f*L^3*g</code></pre>
<p>The pressure on top of your object is:</p>
<pre><code>   P_1 = rho_f*g*h_1  (h_1 is the depth of fluid on top of your cube).</code></pre>
<p>The pressure on bottom of your object is:</p>
<pre><code>   P_2 = rho_f*g*h_2 </code></pre>
<p>All the pressure around your cube is obviously cancelled out.</p>
<p>So, the difference in those two pressure is</p>
<pre><code>   P_2 - P_1 =  rho_f*g*(h_2 - h_1) =  rho_f*g*L</code></pre>
<p>To get the force, time it with cross section area A=L^2:</p>
<pre><code>   B = A*(P_2 - P_1)=L^2*rho_f*g*L=rho_f*g*L^3</code></pre></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aah ok that makes sense, seems counter intuitive that you can't have buoyancy without a pressure gradient but i suppose the gravitational field necessitates a pressure gradient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are somewhat correct. The presence of gravity indeed creates the pressure difference in the atmosphere. Due to this pressure gradient you will experience asymmetrical forces on an object, which when summed up will result in a force that points towards the decreasing gradient (upwards basically). Depending on how large the force is on the object caused by gravity (pointing downwards) it will either sink, stay in equilibrium or rise.</p>
<p>You can basically use a slope as a metaphor: the high side being higher pressure on the surface, and the bottom being lower pressure up in the air. A ball will naturally roll from the higher side towards the lower side. But depending on how hard you push against the ball (gravity) it will either still go down, stay there, or be pushed up.</p>
<p>Edit: I haven't really explained the influence of the mass/density of the object in regards to its surrounding, but I'll leave that as something to further explore yourself!</p></div>		</li>
