			<div class="markdown"><p>Ants are a million miles from being &quot;toy robots.&quot; A little online research reveals that ants actually have huge brains as a proportion of their body weight - maybe the biggest of any insect. Sure, they probably can't do math, but their communities are complex and capable of great feats. According to Wikipedia, &quot;ants may be the only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed.&quot; The idea of humans creating a toy robot as compactly complex and efficient as the ant is preposterous - at least for the next few hundred years.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ants follow very specific scripted actions. They're amazing little animals and we can see some very complex constructs from their colonies. Unfortunately brain size alone is not a good indicator of intelligence.</p>
<p>I agree that they're incredible and I'm glad you've found them so fascinating with just a little online searching. There's a lot more about them. Unfortunately I only learned about them for the first year of my neuroscience work, then moved on to mammals.</p></div>		</li>
