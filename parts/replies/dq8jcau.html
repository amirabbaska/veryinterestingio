			<div class="markdown"><p>This question brings up a a couple of important notes about how science interacts with the public, which I wish everyone would know about:</p>
<p>1) It is extremely common for hypotheses to be proved wrong, and for exciting data to turn out to be misleading.  This is a normal part of science.  The problem is that the exciting new data gets a huge amount of media coverage, and it quickly gets overblown to &quot;OMG NASA proves there's life on Mars!!!&quot;  But the careful analysis that happens later which shows that data was misinterpreted is usually highly technical, and kind of a downer, so it doesn't get any news coverage.  It's great that /u/hopkinsonf1 took the time to take another look at this story: very few people do.  A related problem: because people tend to take the exciting initial report as truth but never hear about the disappointing followup, when we <em>do</em> discover more evidence, the public thinks it's old news.  &quot;Life on Mars?  I thought we already found that 20 years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>2) NASA is not one thing.  It really bothers me to hear &quot;NASA announces such-and-such&quot;, especially when followed up with &quot;NASA denies such-and-such&quot;, suggesting they're kinda schizophrenic.  NASA has ten different research centers, each with tons of scientists looking at the same problem from different angles, plus it funds and collaborates with hundreds of universities and private research institutions around the US.  Some of them may discover something interesting and put out a press release; then other scientists at another lab may find something that contradicts it.  Sometimes NASA headquarters may make an official statement (as in the Mars asteroid case), but they're just amplifying what a research group found, and it doesn't mean it's the last word.</p>
<p>NASA is a community, and like all communities, it's made of many people with many different beliefs, saying many different things.  We shouldn't treat it like it's one very smart person.</p></div>		</li>
