</blockquote>
<p>...no. Some reptiles are more closely related to surviving dinosaurs (birds) than they are other reptiles, though. Turtles are closer to birds than they are to snakes and lizards. Crocodiles are surprisingly close to birds, much closer than any other reptile.</p>

<p>No. But to be fair they are more closely related than any reptile is to birds. And you are correct, pterosaurs aren't dinosaurs, the clade split of Ornithodira is in fact right there (pterosaurs on one side, dinosaurs on the other).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So wait, are &quot;reptiles&quot; not their own clade? When you say crocodiles are closer to birds than snakes and lizards,does that mean that the most recent common ancestor of birds and crocodiles was more recent than the most recent common ancestor of birds and snakes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain a bit more to these and other question that have come up.</p>
<p>In biology there are different ways of grouping animals together. One is by looking for similarities and putting all animals that look similar into one group, the other way is by common descent: you group all species descended from the same ancestor in one group.</p>
<p>The two ways mostly get very similar results. The based on similarities way is the one we used to use exclusively before we had genetics fully figured out, but the new one based on common descend is the one that feels more accurate and is often preferred today.</p>
<p>If you group all species that have a common ancestor together in a group that is called a clade.</p>
<p>When treating the term dinosaurs as a clade, birds are part of it. In fact the definition of dinosaur can be stated as something along the lines of: &quot;All descendants of the last common ancestor of the triceratops and the pigeon&quot;</p>
<p>It does not always make sense to group animals together in a clade. For example we have a group of animals we call fish. They are obviously related to one another but since vertebra land animals are also descendants from fish, treating them as a clade would mean declaring all vertebra such as cats, dogs, elephants, pigeons and humans as &quot;fish&quot; which makes no sense for how we want to use the word.</p>
<p>Another example are wasps. There are lots of different species of wasp out there and the similarities between them makes it logically to group them all together under the general term of wasp. It turns out however that if you look at the family tree of these species of insect you have the big family that all wasps belong to, but it also includes bees and ants. In fact some of the species of wasp that we recognize are closer related to bees or ants than to other wasp species.</p>
<p>This is a problem. We don't want to use the term &quot;wasp&quot; so that it includes ants or bees. So we have come up with a solution: We have a scientific name &quot;apocritia&quot; (meaning waistless or having no waist) which is a clade and includes bees and ants and we have the common name &quot;wasp&quot; which is not a clade and excludes bees and ants.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs are a clade and thus include all animals descendant from dinosaurs, which currently is just birds. If you want to only talk about dinosaurs that weren't birds, then there is the phrase often used by scientists &quot;non-avian dinosaurs&quot; (avian is the adjective for aves which means bird), this group is not a clade and only includes the non-bird dinos, all of which are extinct.</p>
<p>Repitles is another thorny issue. Reptiles is a class that includes all sorts of animals. Traditionally this would include dinosaurs or at least the non-avian dinosaurs.</p>
<p>If we were to use the word &quot;reptile&quot; to mean a clade of species than birds would be reptiles, which is not really what we mean when we use the term. It doesn't help that crocodilians (crocodiles, alligators,  gharials and caimans) are sort of a sister group to dinosaurs and more closely related to them than they are to any other reptiles. So a crocodile is more closely related to a pigeon than it is to lizards, snakes, turtles or tuatara.</p>
<p>For the most part reptile is used to mean all reptile and their descendants excluding birds but it can be used to mean including birds. Usually in scientific context the names of proper clades like diapsids are used or it is explictily stated what is meant.</p>
<p>Pterodactyls were flying reptiles. They were not dinosaurs, but rather distant cousins of them. The same goes for the giant aquatic reptiles that live alongside the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Birds evolved as a distinct subgroup of dinosaurs long before the other dinosaurs became extinct. The closest well known relatives among the dinosaurs would be other theropods like T-Rex and velicoraptors from Jurassic Park.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! I could ask you stuff all day! Okay, I have just one more quick one (I hope). </p>
<p>I've noticed when watching Planet Earth et al. that they talk about aquatic species of mollusk sand insects and worms. </p>
<p>I'm wondering, how is it that you can have aquatic mollusks and terrestrial mollusks and it's still the same group (mollusks)</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Mammals and fish are different groups?</p>
<p>It seems like an ocean mollusk must have a lot of adaptations (compared to a land mollusk) to breathe under water. Why are those differences not great enough to kick it into another group</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>The differences between mammals and fish are great enough to put them in different kingdoms?</p>
<p>Or, to phrase the question under the clade system, did aquatic mollusks and terrestrial mollusks have a common ancestor that includes just mollusks? </p></div>		</li>

Even velociraptors themselves probably appeared <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Velociraptor_dinoguy2.jpg" target="_blank">very bird-like</a>, being about the size of turkeys and covered in feathers. A later ancestor is the <a href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/naturelibrary/images/ic/credit/640x395/a/ar/archaeopteryx/archaeopteryx_1.jpg" target="_blank">archaeopteryx</a>, a sort of halfway point between birds and dinosaurs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I know that's an artists rendition and may look different but how far have we come to believe that most raptors already had feathers. </p>
<p>Like from the time we thought that raptors had no feathers and just covered in the &quot;scale&quot; like stuff on chickens feet (say, I don't know 20 years ago) to today. My question being how accepted in science is it today that they were fully covered in feather vs only partially?</p>
<p>Have any interesting studies on feathers on raptors from the time of the impact would be awesome but an explanation is nice.</p></div>		</li>
