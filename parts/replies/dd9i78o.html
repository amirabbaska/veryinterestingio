			<div class="markdown"><p>My old supervisor suffered with complete anosmia, as well as anomic aphasia.</p>
<p>He was a battle-proven Critical Care Transport Paramedic (CCT-P), for more than 2 decades when I practiced under his tutelage, but the man couldn't differentiate between a bowel movement of a patient with clostridium difficile, versus a patient with a healthy gut biome to save his life.</p>
<p>He couldn't even tell when his car was burning oil, or leaking antifreeze. He had no memory of smells whatsoever. He couldn't even differentiate the smell of frying bacon opposed to other foods.</p>
<p>The same molecules were hitting his olfactory sensors as mine, but he just couldn't associate them. He could say if it smelled good or bad, but not what it smelled &quot;like&quot;.</p>
<p>Smell is a weird sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I can't recreate a smell in my head or  technically remember them (or any sense for that matter), I do recognize smells when I come across them. With aphantasia, the knowledge is there, I just can't randomly access it. I'm like a computer without the screen.</p></div>		</li>
