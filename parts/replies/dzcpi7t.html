			<div class="markdown"><p>Pidgin languages dont really have much to do with translation though. Pidgin languages are the simple bastard of two or more different languages, but they dont explain how translation occurred. If I had to wager a guess, translation probably occurred through trial and error, bilingual children, and the ability of (some, often young) humans to acquire a language simply by being surrounded by it.</p>
<p>Pidgins that evolved into creoles and later became full blown languages (it's believed that this is how English was formed) probably played a role in later translations, but those initial translations had to have occurred differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually not true. Studies, such as Patricia Kuhl's study with babies and Mandarin phonology, show that our ability to acquire language drops off sharply after infancy. Some humans retain this ability, but not all, and even then, the older you get, the less able you are to acquire a new language. I use the term acquire rather than learn, because language acquisition is passive, and I am not referring to the ability of an adult to be taught a foreign language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An example of this is Russenorsk (Russo-Norwegian) that was used in the Pomor trade in arctic Norway during the 1800s. Funny thing is many Norwegians thought they were speaking Russian and many Russians thought it was Norwegian. </p>
<p>A few words from Russenorsk is actually still in use in Northern Norway, like &quot;kartanka&quot;, which I only recently discovered the origin of.</p></div>		</li>
