			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Google, you need about 11lbs of U235 to go super critical.</p>
<p>Little Boy was 141lbs, and yeilded 15 kilotons, so we could guess about ~1.3 kilotons. Enough to level a moderately sized city. Anything smaller would just be a &quot;fizzle&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/" target="_blank">This</a> should help you visualize it if you put the numbers in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In <em>theory</em>, the lower limit is extremely small. The critical size depends on the density of the object, and so as you increase the density of the object (through extreme pressure), you can make the mass required very small. There are a handful of lower limitations, most notably the simple fact that atoms are discrete things, and so you run into the square cube law in a more obvious way. However, density of solids doesn't change very quickly under pressure. It requires dozens of times atmospheric pressure to even change the density of something by 1%; usually density over pressure graphs are shown on logarithmic scales as a result. </p>
<p>Therefore, <em>practically</em>, the lower limit is somewhere in the 3-5kg range. It probably can be even further reduced, but research on this is a) very classified and b) not good for a country's image. </p></div>		</li>

<p>With a beryllium neutron reflector layer you can get <a href="https://www.jackliu.technology/single-post/2017/02/11/Californium-Atomic-Bullet" target="_blank">its critical mass</a> down to &lt; 2kg. For an overall weapon of about 2.2kg mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever heard of the Californium bullet? Supposedly Russian cold war developed to be not bigger than a .50 cal snipper round and yield up to 10kt. All conjecture, from what I understand, as to be useful the neutron output would kill the snipper before he had a chance to get in position to fire, let alone the difficulties of charging the electron shells in a reactor and getting payload to deployment site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you define &quot;fizzle.&quot;  </p>
<p>In the second incident, the Demon Core went supercritical for probably half a second, but did <em>not</em> go prompt critical, generating heat, neutrons, and gamma and X-radiation.  The heat generated in the process caused it to return to subcritical, as it expanded the plutonium, which quickly brought it back below critical density.  Slotin flicking the beryllium reflector away from the core prevented it from returning to supercritical as the plutonium cooled.</p>
<p>The first incident was similar.  Henry Daghlian was conducting a criticality experiment, stacking bricks of neutron-reflectors around the core.  He accidentally dropped one on top of the core, causing it to go well onto the supercritical range, but not prompt critical for several seconds until Daghlian could remove the brick.</p>
<p>We know for a fact that neither incident went prompt critical because there was no Earth Shattering Kaboom™.  Prompt critical in weapons-grade plutonium generally leads to detonation.</p>
<p>Neither experiment was intended to result in a detonation, so I wouldn't call it a fizzle, in much the same way that I wouldn't call accidentally setting fire to C-4 a fizzle if I wasn't intending it to detonate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an aside, but it's unclear whether their movement of the pieces (in either case) prevented prompt criticality. My recollection from reading the reports is that the systems were inherently self-limiting, and that the reactions had finished prior to any human being's reflexes to do anything about them. Unlike a bomb, they were not confined and compressed, so they were just tilting over the border of criticality, and at &quot;worst&quot; would have just heated up until the system disassembled (like the Godiva machine did in its criticality accident). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say yes.  Technically classified as a &quot;criticality accident&quot;, it didn't release enough energy to break apart or vaporize the fissile core -- but was still a momentarily supercritical mass.</p>
<p>For a more regular explosive device, it would need to at least put out enough energy to break itself apart and stop the reaction -- the part where it stopped because someone broke the device themselves makes it a weird case.</p></div>		</li>
