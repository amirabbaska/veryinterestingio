			<div class="markdown"><p>The power output to weight ratio isn't good enough. Lower atomic number elements like Strontium have been used extensively in earth based radioisotope thermal electric generators. But these are often for very low power use applications using rather large RTGs. Space needs ones that are more efficient, and that means using plutonium which has obvious political concerns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible, but not practical.  Plutonium-238 and maybe americium-241 would be suitable for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">Radioisotope thermoelectric generators</a>.  With reprocessing, there are likely some other suitable isotopes that are common in spent fuel.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you're talking about a very small amount relative to the total amount of spent material.  There are thousands of tons of spent fuel and (for example) the Cassini orbiter only used 33 kg (73 lb) of plutonium-238 in its RTGs.  The total mass of the orbiter was 2,150 kg so we're talking about 1.5% of the mass and the total mass lifted into orbit (or further) each year is only hundreds of tons each year (worldwide).</p>
<p>The other problem is that we generally don't like putting radioactive material on top of rockets because they tend to explode a little too often.</p>
<p>There's also the issue of how <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/nasa-nuclear-battery-plutonium-238-production-shortage-2017-8" target="_blank">expensive and complex it is to create fuel for RTGs</a>.  (They incidentally don't even start with Pu-238.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea is that you start out with a non-spent fuel source that is efficient for it's weight, and then it decays over time reducing power output.<br />
The space craft accommodates for this by switching off non essential systems for a given power level, but if you already start off with 0.5% power output for a hefty mass there's not really much point.<br />
Each gram or lb of payload is going to cost $$.</p></div>		</li>
