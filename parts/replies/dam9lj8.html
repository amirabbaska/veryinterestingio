			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mostly right, but it isn't done through transcription of genes, that would take much too long. The external signal causes increased actin polymerization on the edge of the cell closest to the signal. The mechanism is complicated and involves lots of intermediaries (Arp2/3, Rac1, some other GTPases, etc.), but the end result is that actin polymerization basically pushes the cell membrane towards the signal, and the rest of the cell is dragged along (again, through a complicated mechanism, this time mostly involving microtubules). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, so the cell just grows towards the source.  And then the other end of the actin filament must be undergoing degradation such that the cell doesn't actually grow/stretch, but rather just moves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actin is usually really really really fluid. It polymerizes and depolymerizes at just about the same rate all of the time, which means the net result is that it stays about the same size. When there's a signal for growth, the actin grows just a little faster than it shrinks, and that causes the cell to be pushed in that direction. The same kind of thing happens on the other end, just in the other direction. Slightly more depolymerization than polymerization = the actin shrinks and the cell can be pulled in the other direction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds about right...except:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>including transcription of genes that remodel the internal structure to make it move in a direction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this mechanism of action would be way too slow. Instead there is probably a cell surface receptor with an intracellular messenger (GPCR), that would directly affect the microtubules in the area, causing that directional motion.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct. Cytoskeletal remodeling and chemotaxis are not regulated at the transcriptional level, they are induced by signaling (e.g. through chemokine receptors, which are often coupled to GPCRs). One minor correction however: it is the actin cytoskeleton (and particularly its regulation by Rho family GTPases), not microtubules, that enable lamellipodial/filopodial extension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For parasites, the main line of defense is eosinophils. They're a type of white blood cell called a granulocyte, meaning they have tons of &quot;granules&quot; of chemicals. When they get an activating signal, they degranulate and release tons of those chemicals in the area around them. The main thing they do is poke holes in the parasite's cell membranes so they and other cells can get various toxins into the parasites. The toxins are usually things like reactive oxygen species (like hydrogen peroxide) or things that degrade the parasite's RNA, among other things.</p></div>		</li>
