			<div class="markdown"><p>Risk is relative. Saying hedge funds are riskier is just plain wrong. It also ignores sharpe ratios. In theory, a hedge fund is less risky than a pure index tracking fund (whatever the asset class). But that's not always the case.</p>
<p>Investment horizons are driven by investors, who have typically quarterly lockups and expect monthly performance. Trust me, plenty of people would like to put on structural positions and let them play without having to worry about redemptions.</p>
<p>Pure arbs do not really exist today (expect for US equities). Typical traded arbs do not necessarily close in seconds, and sometimes it may take a long time for an arb to close (and you may be stopped out prior to that...mkt can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent).</p></div>		</li>
