			<div class="markdown"><p>Good summary. I'll jump in here:. </p>
<p>I've been a cold water swimmer for some years. My experience is that I was about 70th person in the world to complete an Ice Mile, that's swimming a mile in under 5 C (actually 3.3C the day I did it), without a wetsuit. Here's a link to the <a href="http://loneswimmer.com/cold-water-swimming-articles-index/" target="_blank">over 50 blog  articles I've written on cold water swimming</a>.</p>
<p>The very first adaptation is habituation. Just getting used to getting into cold water. Adaptation takes about 5 or 6 repetitions. Stress hormones decrease, heart rate is more controlled, fight or flight response is attenuated. Part of the natural response is peripheral vaso-constriction (your no. 3, which happens almost everyone as soon as they encounter cold water and is the reason why people have to pee after a cold shower or swim).</p>
<p>Acclimatisation takes much longer, and increases over years. There is some development of BAT, brown fat. BAT spot develops on the shoulders, upper back and midriff after only a small number of regular exposure to cold. More importantly in cold water swimmers is the continued development of a mental sense of control, reduction(further reduction of fight or flight and stress hormones). </p>
<p>I've seen some cold &quot;gurus&quot; over the years, (and don't consider myself one.) Mostly they will be in still air, and not moving around. I think they allow a microclimates/still air layer to develop. In cold water, there's not chance of this. Water will transfer heat away at 30x times air. and every coldwater swimmer will know that wind is their second worst enemy after the cold.</p>
<p>Thermogenesis: Simply put, generating heat by exercise and food digestion. A cold water swimmer will burn 1000 calories an hour. (I swam the English Channel, 16C, not cold by my standards. Calorie consumption about 800 calories per hour). A cold swimmer will continue to burn calories at a high rate for a couple of hours after swimming, depending on how much their core temp dropped.</p>
<p>Something worst mentioning are thermoceptors. With heat our hot-sensing thermoceptors perceive a continuing heat increase right up to burning. With cold, the equivalent thermoceptors stop &quot;measuring&quot; below about 5 Celsius so we go numb instead. </p>
<p>You can't out-smart cold. You can't ever beat the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Hypothermia gets us all. People are adapted to have a fear response to extreme cold. That can be trained, and once that happens, they realise that cold isn't such a mystery of the provenance of few. I'm completely biologically normal (76kg at 170 cm) and I don't like the idea that some people pretend that cold adaptation is extraordinary. It's a natural normal adaptation that most people (maybe excepting some with Reynaud's or similar) can train.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh, I love this post. I did cold-water training in high school, swimming against the current in lazy rivers in the winter, but nowhere near as cold as what you did. There's a lot to be said for forceful adaptation particularly in water - South Korean pearl divers start in early childhood and continue to dive throughout the winter, and swim in water down to about 10*C. They have a TON of characteristic adaptations including metabolic and fat distribution adaptations. Really cool to see!</p></div>		</li>

<p>When you say this, are you saying they allow a &quot;microclimate&quot; to generate around their body?.. If so that's awesome.</p>
<p>Also, what do you think about Wim Hof and the Wim Hof Method? I've begun training recently. I'm a week in and I've discovered that taking a cold shower has quickly become the highlight of my day. It's invigorating!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bit of a tangent, but what if somebody has more T4 than normal, either because of a hormone issue or because they are getting it supplemented?  Does that crank up a person's metabolism, maybe causing them to lose weight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! Hyperthyroidism, when there's too much T4, basically makes you skinny, makes your heart race all the time, gives you diarrhea, makes you hot and shaky, etc. So yeah, it cranks up the metabolism...but in a really bad way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the effects of T3, is it not the active form of the hormone? I know T4 is more abundant, but I thought T3 is what made magic happen. It has been a couple years since I had endocrinology so I could be mixing things up.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I bike in the cold my fingers will start to hurt at first, but after a while they feel comfy and warm  again. Do you know why this is? Is it because my brain gets used to it, because my body pumps more warm blood in my fingers, or for some other reason?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a bunch of things happening here. The blood vessels in your fingers are clamping down, which prevents cold blood from returning back to the heart and giving you a heart attack. That produces part of the pain. The other is just straight up your body telling you you're going to get hurt soon.</p>
<p>Your nerves work by basically letting tons of sodium in, then kicking it all back out, but when it's cold the nerves have a lot of trouble kicking the sodium back out. This means that you can send way fewer signals per minute. The side effect of this is numbness. After enough cold, your nerves can't kick the sodium out at all, so they can't fire. That's why you get numb and eventually can't move the fingers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, thanks for the explanation!
But what happens that makes my fingers feel warm and comfy again 15 minutes later, although I am then still biking in the same cold? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about alternating heat showers?</p>
<p>I shower in the morning after running. Warm (not boiling) water at first. At the end, I switch the water to cold. My water tank is outside and the temp is around 5 C at night, so the water is pretty cold.</p>
<p>In the beginning the water burns from the cold. At 10-15s in, I'm used to it and shower with cold water for a few mins with ease. It's even pleasant. </p>
<p>What's the physiological process there? </p></div>		</li>
