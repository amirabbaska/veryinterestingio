			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally you'll only start sweating once the fever has broken. When your temp is rising you'll be extremely hot, but dry. Once you start sweating you'll know your fever is lowering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the reason the body tries to cool itself down is because if it remains at higher temperatures for a long period of time, your organs will start deteriorating, and eventually stop functioning.</p>
<p>This is especially true for children, as their organs are much more sensitive. So doctors usually monitor their body temperature closely, and if it goes beyond a certain temperature, they will suggest medication to &quot;break the fever&quot;, which tries to reduce body temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends.</p>
<p>How well an organ functions depends on how well the cells within them function. Cells are created, serve their purpose, and die away. They have a programming in them which tells them to committ &quot;cell suicide&quot;, known as <strong>apoptosis</strong>.</p>
<p>Older cells also function less well. So in some organs, cells die and are not replaced, so the number of cells decreases. A decline in one organâ€™s function, either because the person has a disorder, or because of aging, can affect that organ's function.</p>
<p>This is a large number of elderly people pass away because their body's immune system isn't able to fight whatever is causing the virus. HOWEVER, if their immune system kicks in, and a fever is set in place, then they may be able to overcome whatever is plaguing them. But if their fever doesn't break away, then their already weakened organs will be even more susceptible to higher temperatures. The elderly have a double threat to face. Not just high temperatures, but already weaker organs to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>enzymes stop functioning properly long before organs will start deteriorate from heat. it would take A LOT of energy to break down an organ. Just clarifying the cause is not directly temperature but the enzyme which affects the body's ability to undergo chemical reactions to function properly and dispose of waste products.</p></div>		</li>
