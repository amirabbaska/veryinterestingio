			<p>^^^ This! Lol everyone is saying 'depends on this', 'depends on that'. Obviously it depends on the relative amount of each, and there is no way to know which method would be faster without defining several external variables. Its a cost-benefit, it depends on your local humidity and access to dehumidification, as well as your tolerance for sun damage (the sun's energy degrades the dyes and even the fabric) as well as environmental hazards. I'm not personally sure, but my guess is that at low humidity, 'air' drying would be more than sufficient (water&gt;&gt;&gt;air so faster fan=faster drying) while at (relatively) higher humidities the sun's energy would be necessary since (water&lt;&gt;air) so a faster fan isn't really speeding anything up. <br><br>In your specific case, my guess would be either adding convection to the indoor sun approach, or finding a sunny spot outside with a breeze would be ideal. If speed is ever a serious issue, just go to a laundromat?<br><br>Really interesting question, but besides controlling for specific environmental factors, there's really no way to determine (from a generalized perspective) which of the two forces is relatively more potent. </p>		</li>

			<p>I live in japan, and laundromats are incredibly rare, so yet another location based issue which alters which is faster. </p>		</li>
