			<div class="markdown"><p>D is a symptom of not having mating seasons rather than a reason why. Human infancy grew as we rose through the food chain and our tribes became stronger. When you're getting chased by predators all the time, you need a quick infancy to get on the move. Humans instead have deep tribal connections and a village raising a whole child that infancy can be extended. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you will forgive the pedantry, &quot;even <em>other</em>&quot; makes more sense in this context - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae" target="_blank">the <em>Homo</em> genus is one of the members of that family</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that D is more a symptom of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrical_dilemma" target="_blank">obstetrical dilemma (wiki)</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The obstetrical dilemma is a hypothesis to explain why humans often require assistance from other humans during childbirth to avoid complications, whereas most non-human primates give birth alone with relatively little difficulty. The obstetrical dilemma posits that this is due to the biological constraints imposed by two opposing evolutionary pressures in the development of the human pelvis. As human ancestor species (hominids) developed bipedal locomotion (the ability to walk upright), decreasing the size of the bony birth-canal, they also developed ever larger skulls, which required a wider obstetrical pelvic area to accommodate this trend in hominid infants.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often wondered about this.</p>
<p>When our ancestors were still in the trees, a baby that was up all night crying and screaming was probably a serious liability.</p>
<p>Yet that's what babies are known for today.  </p>
<p>Did our infants always have a hard time sleeping through the night -- particularly around certain stages (i.e. teething) or was it a recent development as became able to create better shelter?  Or were our distant ancestors just &quot;better&quot; at soothing a screaming infant? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Neither, but closer to the latter. A lot of research shows that part of the reasons Western babies sleep so poorly is that they're not really supposed to be in a separate room. In many (most?) hunter-gatherer tribes, newborns just sleep in between the parents and are much less disruptive.</p>
<p>FWIW, many don't really think adults are supposed to 'sleep through the night' either. There's a lot of evidence showing that there were two sleep cycles with an interruption in the middle of the night, right up until the invention of electricity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone explained the noisy baby thing in a similar askscience or askreddit thread, and the gist of it was that humans typically live in groups, and a group of humans is really formidable.  Chances are that ancient humans didn't silently cower during the night, but would yell, talk, laugh, do a lot of the stuff that we do now, with little fear of a predator approaching a group, so having a loud baby screaming the night away was really a non-issue when you consider that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wondered that too, especially at 4 am with a screaming infant. One theory I read is that there was a lot more baby wearing/carrying, co-sleeping, nursing on demand, so babies didn't have as much of a transition from internal living (with 24 hour food, always being rocked) to external living. </p></div>		</li>
