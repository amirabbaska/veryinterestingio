			<div class="markdown"><p>Well explained. The whole thing assumes a premise that you want to do something in a time that has already passed. So if I traveled at 20km/h yesterday, there is no way I can really increase the average. All it does is present this in a more obscurantic way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 laps at 200mph is 400 miles. </p>
<p>You'd have to run 300mph for the last lap to reach the desired 400 miles at the end of 2 hours.  </p>
<p>Edit: It just clicked. Should have thought about it lounger than a second. </p></div>		</li>
