			<div class="markdown"><p>The great majority at least, and likely all of them. Viviparity (live birthing) has AFAIK not been confirmed in any dinosaur species, while oviparity (egg laying) has been confirmed in many. And birds, the modern descendants of dinosaurs, also lay eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That being said, while crocodylomorphs are not dinosaurs, it is interesting to note that a group of marine crocodilians known as the metriorhynchids may have been viviparous: <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/earth-and-environmental-science-transactions-of-royal-society-of-edinburgh/article/div-classtitlemorphology-of-the-sacral-region-and-reproductive-strategies-of-metriorhynchidae-a-counter-inductive-approachdiv/AE3A4183C5925CFE4F6F3108B3B2C147" target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
<p>This may have implications regarding the widely-perceived &quot;barriers&quot; that prevent archosaurs in general from becoming viviparous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I would have to guess, I would say monotremes (which includes platypuses and echidnas (go knuckles!)), but they also have a cloaca. Maybe we there's a platypus or echidna novelty account that can give us more information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Permeable eggs laid in water can simply exchange ammonia or urea with their environment. But for species with hard shelled eggs that excrete urea, I don't really know. </p></div>		</li>
