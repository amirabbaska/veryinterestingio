			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've heard on other reddit posts, the &quot;hunger panes&quot; experienced are usually just the body being used to eating so often like you said, and desiring the gratification from a meal that we often get. After the panes pass, as long as you maintain your required healthy intake of vitamins/fibre/proteins/etc and drink water, you'd be able to maintain the fast/lack of eating relatively easily. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much correct. Hunger pangs tend to be linked to low levels of blood sugar if I remember correctly, and whilst they can get low when you've not eaten for a while once your body starts metabolising fat they start to rise and stabilise. </p>
<p>It's also the reason you tend to get hungry after a night out drinking. Your body has been metabolising alcohol (and the sugary medium it tends to be contained in), and overshoots the insulin production, blood sugar falls once the intake of alcohol has stopped, and ta-da people get hungry and want a late night kebab etc. </p></div>		</li>
