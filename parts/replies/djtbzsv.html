			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you happen to know what sort of neurotransmitters trigger the action potential?  I ask because it seems that dopamine can be used to trigger some muscular actions, as well as be involved in consciousness.  I am trying to learn the different ways that neurotransmitter can be used on the thought that muscular actions and conscious actions may have different qualities in their respective receptor sites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what the insect muscles use. But dopamine has numerous receptors, usually grouped into two families: D1 and D2. D1 is generally stimulatory whereas D2 it's generally inhibitory. By which I mean D1 usually causes depolarization, bringing the target cell closer to firing an action potential. </p>
<p>But really, neurotransmitters are just molecules that activate receptors. They don't have to have a universal function (&quot;involved in consciousness&quot;). Most are made by multiple different parts of the brain and released onto even more parts of the brain. They're just tools for neural computation. So dopamine is involved in both reward (including drugs but also natural rewards like food or sex or getting a compliment) and deciding to move, because it's used by two different neural systems. It's made in the VTA and released into the nucleus accumbens for reward, and made in the substantia nigra and released into the striatum for movement. So what I'm trying to say, is when talking about what a neurotransmitter does,  anatomy is really important. </p>
<p>Also - any neuroscientists out there, be nice. I know I'm simplifying.</p></div>		</li>
