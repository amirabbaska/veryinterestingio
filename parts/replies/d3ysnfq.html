<p>So volume of universe at neutron star core density approx. 11^11 m^3  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also keep in mind that we don't know how big the universe is. We can see the observable universe, but since it's unlikely we are in the center of the universe, there are parts that we cannot see since they are over 13.7 billion light years away. At that distance one can only see the cosmic background radiation, but that doesn't mean that there aren't other Galaxies out there.</p>
<p>We are in a sphere and all around us, as far as the &quot;eye&quot; can see, we see at 13.7 Billion light years away the cosmic background radiation. If you were to travel instantly for 1 billion lightyears in any direction, the assumption is that you would also see galaxies up until 13.7 billion lightyears in all directions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's no such thing as &quot;center of the Universe&quot;. If a thing looks the same in every direction and from every place, it has no center.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, mass of the observable universe is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe" target="_blank">10^53 Kg</a>. Density of a neutron star is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star#Density_and_pressure" target="_blank">4x10^17 Kg/m^3</a>. Ignoring the gravitational forces, the neutron star with the mass of the observable universe would be about 2.5x10^35 m^3. Once again, ignoring the gravity and assuming a perfect sphere - that's the radius of 3.91x10^11 m </p>
<p>To give you a sence of scale - If that neutron star was placed at the center of our Sun, the neutron star's surface would fall just outside of Mars - between Mars and Jupiter. (Sun to Mars - 2.3x10^11 m, Sun to Jupiter - 7.8x10^11 m) But that neutron star will have the mass of observable universe.</p>
<p><del>Not sure if i made a mistake or not, because according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius#Parameters" target="_blank">this page</a></del></p>
<blockquote>
<p><del>The observable universe's mass has a Schwarzschild radius of approximately 13.7 billion light years</del></p>
</blockquote>
<p><del>Which, if I understand it correctly, means that a black hole of the same mass as an observable universe would be much larger than this neutron star. Maybe it's because I ignored the gravity?</del></p>
<p>Edit: Schwarzschild radius is not what I thought it was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A black hole will always have a radius of 0 - it's a singularity! The Schwarzschild radius is simply the radius within which the gravitation is too large for light to escape. A Schwarzschild radius of 13.7 billion light years means that is all mass in the observable universe was compressed into a sphere with a radius of 13.7 billion light years, the surface of that sphere would have an escape velocity of <em>c</em>. </p></div>		</li>
