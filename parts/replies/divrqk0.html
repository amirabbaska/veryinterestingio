			<div class="markdown"><p>Production would be expensive on terms of energy yes, those few 10s Anti hydrogen atoms would require lots of beam time and probably cost hundreds of thousands in electricity.  What limits the amount of atoms you can have is the trapping life time, even once you manage to confine the anti-atoms is that they will eventually gain enough kinetic energy through collisions to escape the trapping potential and annihilate with the walls of the vacuum chamber. </p></div>		</li>
