<p>Two 17 year old boys were on the the ice bridge. One survived with a “desperate jump” while his chum was stranded and died. You can see someone on ice and someone on shore in the picture. Sad</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if they've ever stopped the Canadian side. But they're planning on shutting the American side down again in 2019. There's a video of the last time at the bottom of the article. </p>
