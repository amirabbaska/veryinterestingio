I'm a poor working class bruh in the us who can't afford insurance, and going to the hospital requires visiting the er which charges wild prices for anything they do.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insurance is a scam anyway. My s/o had to go to an &quot;out of network&quot; emergency room a few months ago. After months of talking to the insurance company and the hospital, they agreed to pay $1,200 of the $4,200 bill. What a fucking joke. </p>
<p>So, she's on the hook for $3,000 for something that was completely out of her control. Insurance does nothing. It's all so infuriating. She wants to just pay it to get it over with, but I'm losing my fucking shit, I'm so mad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a $3500 bill for a procedure that involved a camera going down my throat. Idk how to spell it -.-
There was no way for me to obtain insurance, and my friend had to pay over two hundred dollars just to have me seen. That's not to say anything about the condition my teeth are in, despite brushing and mouthwash; I cannot afford a dentist to any degree. It's so hard and concerning that any medical issue will result in poor care (if any) and an early death that could have been prevented if the lives of humans weren't proportional to their income. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi - insurance agent here. This sounds weird to me. Usually if you go to the emergency room for an emergency it should be covered at an in network rate even if you are traveling outside of your state. Did you contact the person who sold the policy or ask the hr person at the employer what you should do? A lot of times insurance companies will screw you over without the proper advocate </p></div>		</li>

<p>I would agree for facilities being modern, but staff is a problem and a pretty big one. Just talk to any french nurse and you'll quickly realize the system isn't without flaws. We also have a problem with the repartition and number of doctors on the territory afaik. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah i agree, but it depends a lot of when you are, last public hospital  i went to was much better funded than others, i think because it's primarly for the army (but of course everyone living near enough has access to it), some other public hospitals are much less well staffed, and i'm not sure the part about &quot;no overtime, home by 6&quot; is any close to reality, it's not rare to hear about doctors doing 20h+ shifts, because they are so understaffed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd go as far as say it just isn't reality, I consider our system highly but we can't turn a blind eye about our staff problem. You can hear from literally anyone working in a hospital how it goes with lack of staff. And i doubt they all decided to lie to everyone simultaneously. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The doctor repartition is actually a pretty big one in some regions indeed. And the staff is clearly not without overtime and stress-free at all, health is one of the hardest field of work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the us and I was really happy to read that and wanted it to be true, but I read too far down the thread to be disappointed. My family has a lot of nurses and it's a miracle they don't make more mistakes that end up seriously harming people (ie wrong medicine) with some of the conditions here. I'm not saying they're the worst work conditions we have in the us or anything close to that, but they're certainly not the conditions you'd want someone with that much control over your well being in. Understaffed, so everything is insanely rushed and the legally required break doesn't always get taken, some have 12 or 16 hour shifts, and it can be an incredibly stressful and emotionally taxing work environment. On the physical side, sometimes they never get to sit down on a shift, and of course, depending on where they work are exposed to a variety of contagious illnesses. </p>
<p>Don't take this the wrong way- all the nurses I know love their job and find it extremely rewarding. The shit they have to put up with goes widely unnoticed though, and they do a lot of the interaction with the patient, so of course most of them will stick on a happy face for their shift. </p></div>		</li>
