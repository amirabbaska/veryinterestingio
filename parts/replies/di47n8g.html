			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense, I am just surprised the violence has never spilled across Afghanistan's borders. I don't think I've ever once seen any of those countries mentioned in the media. </p>
<p>Edit: I apologize for the ambiguity of my comment; I meant &quot;spilled across Afghanistan's borders&quot; as in to the north. I know Pakistan is dealing with an insurgency, that is why I did not mention Pakistan in my original question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well note that these states are Former Soviet states and so have the security apparatus of the Soviet Union still in place.  Tajikistan for example has closed borders with Afghanistan, and very few foreign reporters are allowed in. They also expelled Uzbek militants</p>
<p>These countries also don't have the  economic problems of Afghanistan and are generally far better-developed.</p>
<p>Long before the Cold War, in the 19th century British colonial troops were fighting in Afghanistan, where they had carved out the area to act as a buffer, protecting India from Russia, but with no coastlines or access to international trade routes etc there was no development possible.</p>
<p>Also there are reports about terrorism and civil strife in the countries of the former USSR around Afghanistan <em>if you look for it the news</em>.  However since the average Westerner doesn't really care, and the US is keen to improve ties with the rulers of those counties, it doesn't get much coverage</p>
<p>For example the former ruler of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, is reputed to have boiled people alive</p>

<p>But Britain and the US look the other way and it is not made into a big issue</p>

<p>We don't hear much about it in our news, for the same reasons that we didn't hear much about the abuses under Saddam (until we decided to care) or the abuses under the various other Presidents-for-Life etc like in Azerbaijan or Turkmenistan etc <a href="https://iwpr.net/global-voices/uzbekistan-turkmenistan-among-worst-worst-civil-liberties" target="_blank">https://iwpr.net/global-voices/uzbekistan-turkmenistan-among-worst-worst-civil-liberties</a></p>
<p>In the 1990s Tajikistan experienced a huge civil war after the fall of the USSR in which 50K people were killed and a 10th of the pop was displaced  -- there are still restrictions on people and travel there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tajikistan doesn't have a closed border with Afghanistan, well it didn't when I drove along a good portion of it from Dushanbe to Korgos (sp?) in 2010.</p>
<p>That stretch of border is covered by a wide, swift river, that makes it pretty impassable and easily defensible. Sections that were less swift were covered by mine fields on the Tajik side. The Afghan side only had a few roads leading to villages and a couple of bridges, where markets for cross border trade were established on the Afghan side. Road building on the Afghan side was being undertaken at the time to create a transverse road parallel to the river.</p>
<p>The Tajik side was more alined with the Northern Alliance, whom were anti Taliban. </p>
<p>Each village had a security detail to deal with threats and the entire area is highly mountainous, that restricts travel, so outsiders easily contained.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you would like to know what makes Afghanistan rather unique in the region, I highly recommend the documentary Afghanistan: The Great Game.  </p>
<p>It gives an excellent look at the peculiar history of Afghanistan and makes for a much more understandable context for continued  conflict there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meddling in Afghanistan occurred long before the US and Soviet Union got involved.  There were two Anglo-Afghan wars in the 19th Century, and a third in the early 20th Century.  It is true that the US and Soviets used conflict in Afghanistan during the Cold War to advance their own agendas, but it is also true that Afghanistan has a long history as a battleground and has consistently come out the poorer for it.  It is not a strong state, is prone to corruption, and is riddled with internal ethnic fighting.  It often takes a dictator to impose order on such societies (e.g. Iraq, Libya) but with all the external meddling Afghanistan never even got to that point.  It's sad--it's such a beautiful country and the people deserve far better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree with this to some extent, the US has been there for close to 2 decades at this point and shows no sign of leaving anytime soon. I'd take that 5 year bet in a heartbeat.</p></div>		</li>
