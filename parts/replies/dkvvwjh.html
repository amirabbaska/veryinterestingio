			<div class="markdown"><p>Calico cats aren't actually caused by a mutation. It's because their fur color gene is on the X chromosome. Before a female mammal is born, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated (silenced/not expressed) in each somatic (non-egg) cell. The male cats have just one potential fur color, while females could have one of the two fur colors expressed depending on which of the X chormosomes was inactivated in each cell.</p>
<p>Some male cats are calico, but those are rare since the male calicos have three sex chromosomes instead of two (XXY).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not precisely so regarding calico cats.
That's due to a phenomenon called X-inactivation and has to do with which X chromosome the cell opts to express.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Unlike cats, humans don't have a pigment gene on their X-chromosome, so we can't <em>actually</em> see it. But the process happens in animals with paired sex chromosomes. (Through inactivation.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know it's not this simple, but it would be cool if they could some day edit the X chromosome in humans to display a certain hair or skin color from each parent. </p>
<p>I wonder what the difference is between cells that have either X chromosome turned off. </p></div>		</li>
