			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, what people don't understand is that those test results show probabilities, not an actual definite breakdown of where your ancestors came from. They say &quot;there is a 50% probability that you are of Irish descent&quot; not &quot;50% of your genes are from Ireland.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>They can say you're similar to Ireland of today, but they can't compare to Ireland of 200 years ago.</p>
<p>It can also underrepresent ethnic groups that are less likely to take the tests, such as Native Americans.  You might have a grandfather from &quot;those guys over there&quot; but if the only one who took the test is &quot;Bob,&quot; you're only getting compared to &quot;Bob.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not completely correct. Some of the estimates are based on anthropological study of human admixture over time, and the probability of certain segments/haplotypes. Some of these are even explained on 23andMe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>With ancient DNA, they pretty much can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is more than that.  You could have a great grandparent that was 100% Irish, but you may actually not get ANY of that Irish DNA.  It is incredibly unlikely, but possible.  You always get 50% of your father's DNA, and 50% of your mother's.  But, where that DNA comes from is random.  The DNA from your father could end up being 50% from his dad and 50% from his mom...or it could be 80% from his dad and 20% from his mom.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is possible but very unlikely to get an 80/20 split.  More likely a 45/55 split or something like that.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... My brother has done family research, and he also did the DNA test. From what he has conducted from the research (dating back to early 1500's) the DNA test is accurate enough.</p>
<p>edit: Oh! Some of our relatives had also done the test. He found some new ones that could also be confirmed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. When I did my family ancestry and found mostly Greeks past my grandparents' generation, I took the DNA test and found out that my entire family is basically Greek and not what Tito made us believe.</p>
<p>It helped resolve a lot of ethnic identity issues, but it's really hard to explain that to my highly nationalistic, pro-Macedonia family.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really a finding founded in reality. Historically speaking ethnicity is kind of a construct. Especially in the Balkan where differing populations lived in close proximity and relatively mixed. Traditionally under Ottoman rule identity was based on religion or to a lesser extent on language. Only with the rise of the nation state in the 19th century and rising nationalism ethnicity became widely used. Problem was nobody knew how to draw lines exactly if neighbours don't even share the same religion and languages and those combinations aren't exklusive. So mostly language was used to construct ethnic divisions by blood. </p>
<p>23 and me, in my opinion and as far as I understand the service, enables people to conflate two concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The probability that your ancestry comes from a certain geographic region defined by the borders of modern countries</p>
</li>
<li>A composition formula of your ethnic make up.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, while it is possible that your ancestors lived in what is now Greece, this doesn't preclude that they would have identified themselves as ethnically Macedonian.</p>
<p>Edit: a mistyped word</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter sent her DNA to 23 and me for kicks.  I told her she is 50% Finnish because I am as close to 100% Finnish as you can get.  She found out that yes, she is 50% Finnish (did you know they separate Finnish out from the general Scandinavian?)   A few weeks later, she was contacted and told that there was a possibility that she has a match, possibly 1st or 2nd cousin.   She and this young woman talked over email about this. My daughter asked me...Mom do i have any cousins from sub-saharan Africa?  After much back and forth, turns out my brother is her dad.  So...young black woman startled to discover that she is 50% Finnish finds her dad!  My brother never married and never had any children...except he did.  They have met, live a few hours away from each other, and totally enjoy each other.   This is wonderful!</p></div>		</li>
