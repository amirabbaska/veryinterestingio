			<div class="markdown"><p>I was surprised at how much abuse internal bits can take. I watched a video of an operation to repair an abdominal hernia on a cat. The vet was just jamming intestines into the abdominal cavity like he was stuffing a turkey. It seems like guts would be a lot more fragile than they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw that same vid.  If you think about it, if you get punched / kicked in the gut (or say a cat does for whatever reason), the insides are going to be moving around quite a bit, kinda have to be durable to take that.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>A hollow cylinder isn't necessarily weaker than it's solid counterpart, due to it's comparable weight (or lack of)</p>
