			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this, cable or satellite service includes paying for those physical entities: laying cable to homes or operating satellites. Netflix and Amazon are more akin to the individual channels - they come through someone else's infrastructure (your internet service provider). It makes more sense to think of Netflix as ESPN or the Disney Channel than as DirecTV or Comcast. People forget that in addition to paying Netflix, they also pay $X/month for internet service. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Keep in mind, you can't just pay $10 a month and have Netflix. You also have to pay the cable company $30 a month so you can access Netflix.</p></div>		</li>
