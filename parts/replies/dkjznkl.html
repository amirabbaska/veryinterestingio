<p>Weeds grow in harsh conditions because they grow and photosynthesize very slowly to survive. Non-native plants need watering because they produce more rapidly than the local environment can support which leaves them vulnerable to dehydration. </p>

<p>How come that many weeds grow so much <em>faster</em> than native plants, then?  I have a wildflower meadow, that is full of native flowers, and they are hugely outcompeted by native weeds.</p>
<p>My understanding was that they're often really only felt to be weeds <em>because</em> they grow so fast, so tend to take over a carefully planned garden.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best answer I've read is that weeds are noxious to gardens because they are experts at stealing water, space, and resources from other plants and some even produce hormones that inhibit growth of other nearby plants to decrease competition. These factors combined is what allows weeds to dominate gardens and even outgrow plants that are being cared for.</p></div>		</li>
