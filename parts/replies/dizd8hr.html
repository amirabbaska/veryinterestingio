<p>Traditional solutions to this problem involve supposing there is new physics that does the fine tuning for you, but as more and more searches keep not finding any of this new physics, some people have turned to the anthropic principle</p>

<p>This is really good summary of the pro-anthropic argument. </p>
<p>The point isn't that the Anthropic Principle <em>has</em> to be deduced from first principles â€” which contention scientists quite rightly bristle at. </p>
<p>The point is that we're trying to find alternate (physical) explanations for the astounding fine-tuning of key constants, and basically no progress has been made at that since we started looking. </p>
<p>At some point that lack of progress is going to seem significant to basically everybody. And to pro-Anthropic types that point is pretty close. </p></div>		</li>
