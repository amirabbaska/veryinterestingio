			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the speed of the electrical <em>impulse</em> (not the electrons themselves) is essentially the speed of light, regardless of temperature. A good way to think of the impulse traveling faster than the electrons is as a long line of cars stopped at a light. As the light changes and the first car begins to inch forward it makes room for the car behind to move forward, and so on up the line. Thus the speed of the impulse (the ability of a car to move forward) is faster than the speed of the actual cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only in a vacuum - if the wires are embedded in a dielectric medium (like rubber), then the speed of propagation is actually slowed down, just like light is slowed down travelling through glass or water. That’s because in some sense electricity travelling down a wire is an electromagnetic wave (this makes more intuitive sense for AC) and the speed is affected by the medium.</p>
<p>However the speed is still going to be close to the speed of light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, the wire itself is the medium.  Why does it matter if the wire is in vacuum or rubber?  Does the surrounding material somehow impede the EM wave?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which way do the electrons travel? I've always been taught positive to negative... but hole flow they seems to state the opposite...</p>
<p>When I would calculate voltage drop in electronics in college, we always went negative to positive to do the calculations... but we're taught the + -&gt; -</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This derivation was so mind blowing to do in my Physics II class, because then you find that the actual transport speed is only about 0.5 m/s or something right around walking speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because &quot;electrons moving&quot; is only a way to teach students about electricity. Energy in electric form always moves at the speed of light (carried in the form of electric and magnetic waves). Electrons moving inside a conductor is mass transport, and it does happen, but is not really &quot;electricity&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Analogy is wrong. Electron moving forward doesn't matter. Actually when the light changes all the cars move forward at the speed which the light reached them - but in a metal the speed of light is slower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The analogy accurately describes the speed of an impulse. Even with electricity i don't believe that the impulse is quite as fast as the speed of light in the material, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does not seem obvious to me that the moving bumper cars create more impacts with the electron than the same number of bumper cars standing still. Sure, some cars will move into the path of the electron just as you approach them, but wouldn’t an equal number of other bumper cars get <em>out</em> of your way, too? Or am I not thinking of this correctly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really the speed at which they move, it's how far they move. Maybe instead of bumper cars, think of it as like a foosball table - the electron is the ball, and the atoms are the paddle dudes. At low temps the paddles move side to side a little, and at high temps they move side to side a greater distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my professor's lecture he explained electrical currents with a tube. If you could put the electrons into a tube, you'd end up with long tube, probably extending twice the size of the universe because when you... collapse the universe, it expands, and it would be uh... You wouldn't wanna put electrons into a tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not only moving faster but also occupying more space. As an atom moves faster it has more energy to fight the forces holding it in place. Imagine the bumper car is mounted to the ceiling by a spring. The distance its able to move from where the spring is mounted is dependent on how fast its going (assuming the engine isnt continuously running). This means faster cars are effectively larger. These larger impact areas reduce the amount of open space and increase the frequency of collisions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand this explanation best. Does this mean that the atoms “bumper cars” are moving at a faster speed than the the electron? Or is there some latent “shadow” of the bumper car that sticks around after the bumper car passes through?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, if you are in a conductive medium such as a metal cooling it will increase the drift velocity(speed of an electron in a material) of an electron, but this isn’t the case for all materials. </p>
<p>If you are in a semiconductive material higher temperatures will actually increase the drift velocity. This is because in semiconductors you worry less about the alignment of the electrons but more about the ‘holes’.  I’m a bit rusty on my semiconductor physics but in some super conductors these holes can be aligned to get very high velocities. (Such as when superconductors are created without cooling metals to almost absolute zero)</p>
<p>Lastly to answer the question about the power lines. This question is more complex as power lines actually transfer energy via electromagnetic waves in an insulator surrounded by conductors. So there you would have to look at the properties of the insulator at different temperatures to more look at the speed of the electromagnetic waves. </p>
<p>Hope this adds a bit of clarity, and sorry for any errors, I’m traveling and on mobile. </p></div>		</li>
