			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that source! I now know that optical fiber is made of either glass or plastic; from the handbook: &quot;Fiber optics is a method of carrying information using optical fibers. An optical fiber is a thin strand of glass or plastic that serves as the transmission medium over which information is sent. It thus fills the same basic function as a copper cable carrying a telephone conversation, computer data, or video. Unlike the copper cable, however, the optical fiber carries light instead of electrons. In so doing, it offers many distinct advantages that make it the transmission medium of choice for applications ranging from telephone calls, television, and machine control.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a fibre install tech and it's pretty cool to handle and stuff, but it's also pretty dangerous. Because it's so small it can go through your skin and enter your bloodstream, but because it's so fiddly it's really impractical to use gloves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you were deploying fibre optic cable, just put a camera on the end and you'll see the seabed. It's kinda deviated from the original question.</p></div>		</li>
