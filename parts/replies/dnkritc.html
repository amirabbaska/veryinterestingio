			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is exactly right. It would be physically impossible to eat enough in a single day to wipe out months of daily deficits.</p>
<p>Where you'll run into trouble, OP, is if you do like many people and have a cheat day every week and go hog wild every time. I can &quot;cheat&quot; weekly, because even when I let myself go nuts I only mildly overeat. If all you're doing on cheat days is adding a scoop of ice cream or slice of pizza to your regular diet intake, you'll be fine. But if you have tendencies to binge, you could wipe out a week's worth of progress in one day easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who is getting into the whole cut/bulk thing, this is what I see the most when people cut. They cut at 2000 cals and their maintenance is 2500. Then every Saturday they have a &quot;cheat day&quot; and eat 5k+ then get pissy because their &quot;diet isn't working.&quot; and it's not their fault cuz it was &quot;just one little cheat day.&quot; Do the math, if you are at a 3000 deficit after 6 days, then eat 2500 surplus, you are now at a 500 deficit for the week. AKA you'll lose less than 1 pound a month.</p>
<p>Not to mention that just about everyone overestimates what their maintenance is. I've had people my size (5'9, 155lbs) that work out less than me try and tell me their maintenance is &quot;like 3000 because I workout 4 days a week for 2 hours at a time and it's super intense so my calculator says that's my maintenance.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah... the drive to and from the gym doesn't count. Your 20 minutes in the lockerroom doesn't count. All the time you spend standing in front of the mirror doesn't count (except between sets). The 30 minutes you spend chatting with your bros don't count. Also you <em>really</em> don't need 5+ minutes rest between sets (unless you're maxing maybe). </p>
<p>So yeah... your 2 hour extremely intensive workout is more like 30 minutes of light-moderate exercise and your maintenance is probably more like 2400 calories. Which is why you gain 3-4 pounds per week on your bulk. /rant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think iv dieted pretty well at around 2000-1600 calories and i do also lift and do cardio. Keto works great for me. I don't understand how people even need 3000-4000 calories because i would become michelin man if i consumed that amount everyday. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely agree with that whole rant! And people don't realize how big a difference a sedentary job makes either... it's hard to make up for all that time sitting on your butt. With the same workouts, my TDEE at an office job would be about 1000 calories less than it is at my very physical job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other thing most people don't think about is that <strong>it isn't too hard to fast for a day or even two</strong>. If you have a fun cheat day and consume 4000 calories (I could probably do that easily), you could always fast twice for 24 hours and completely average down that one cheat day.</p>
<p>I see way too many people get caught up on the calorie counting but completely forget that fasting is the easiest way (WAY easier than exercise) to make up for lost ground. In fact I'm a big fan of fasting a few times per week when I've wanted to drop weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do think that depends a lot on the person. I absolutely hate fasting for an entire day and feel miserable if I skip more than one meal in a row - so I don't think you can make a blanket statement that it's &quot;not too hard.&quot; Different things are easier for different people. But if fasting works for you, that's great... it's certainly the fastest way to get back on track!</p></div>		</li>

<p>World records for eating seem to be around ten kilograms in one sitting. I couldn't find anything for a daily volume, but let's take that as our number.</p>
<p>Lard has 1849.1 calories per cup and weighs 216.62 grams per cup. So eating 10 kilograms of lard would be 85361 calories in one sitting, which would average out to  1423 additional calories per day.</p>
<p>Enough to wipe out even a substantial daily deficit.</p>
<p>I don't think most people guzzle twenty pounds of lard on their cheat days, but who am I to judge?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered about this... I'm way overweight and was doing a diet through my gym, just counting calories and macros. Personally I don't care about macros (currently not even counting calories but may again soon). They wanted me eating about 2,000 cal a day, but some days I found I was content with 1200-1500, some days I felt like I could get away with a 24 hour fast, and other days I just wanted to eat twice as much. For me personally I have always felt that rather than trying to eat 2,000 everyday, I could manage it better giving myself 14,000 a week and letting the &quot;cheat&quot; days and fasting or low cal days kind of just work themselves out throughout the week.</p>
<p>Is that something that sounds like it would be effective?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything that brings your calories down to a reasonable level will be effective.  Some people are just fine on a 60% deficit.  Some can't bare to go over a 20% deficit.  </p>
<p>First you figure out your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).  There are thousands of calculators online that will get you a rough number.  Then you figure out your target weight.  You'll know exactly how many calories you need to eat daily/weekly/monthly to get you there in an expected time frame.  It's all about what you are mentally and physically able to handle.  Don't forget your nutrients even if you can handle a big deficit.  I can't do much more than 25% without needing to eat small portions every 90 minutes.</p>
<p>People just don't realize that 500 calories of bread is not going to fill you up or satisfy you as much as 500 calories of fresh fruits and vegetables.  I could eat 3500 calories in one meal if we're talking lasagna and be hungry again a few hours later.  If I tried to eat 3500 calories in chicken breast and vegetables in one sitting I'd fuckin explode.  I was fasting 20/4 on keto a few years ago and tried to fit 1600 calories into one meal of chicken thighs and salad and broccoli or whatever.  I could almost never finish the meal.  Meanwhile I could finish 1600 calories at mcdonalds before I even touched my fries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Preach. That's like 6-7 pounds of chicken breast probably... Meanwhile, it's like 2 bowls of that tasty tasty pasta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went from 335# to 250 two years ago by cutting my calories to an insane number. Like 800 a day and also fasting once a week. I actually felt great at the time but gained it all back since. I'm around 320 now and starting to ease back into getting my act together. Luckily even at this weight I've always been able to get good workouts in (when I can motivate myself to go). But at 260 I was running spartan races and stuff, need to get back to that and beyond.  </p>
<p>I also had a ton of issues and had my gallbladder removed as I hit that lowest weight. Not sure if the two are connected but since I spent two weeks in the hospital from compications I've been curious about it. Haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds better than forcing yourself to eat more at the 1200 days but also often struggling to keep it below 2000. If you can stay below the 14000 a week easily this will be more effective simply because you don't have to fight mentally against eating more all the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMO, you should find something that works for you, and is something you can maintain long term.  Everyone is different, and everyone has different levels of discipline and self-control.  If you can stick to 14,000 calories a week instead of 2,000/day, go ahead and try it.  </p>
<p>If you do go down this road, I'd still encourage tracking daily, because it feels like it'd be easy to have a tough week and get to day 6 with very few calories left...</p>
<p>I lost 60 lbs a few years ago, and have kept it off for 3 years by maintaining my calorie logging.  I got to my goal weight by sticking more or less religiously to the daily goal calorie number, but now I shoot for somewhere within 200-300 calories, plus or minus (usually plus, lol).  </p>
<p>The act of logging, of KNOWING, what calories I'm consuming is absolutely critical to my continued success, but I no longer confine myself to an exact number.  (That's what works for me -- you might be different.)</p></div>		</li>
