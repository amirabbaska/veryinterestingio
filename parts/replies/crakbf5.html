<p>Or, at least someone who claims to be...</p>
<p>As proof, we're going to need to see you holding your history degree and... inspecting some concrete. </p></div>		</li>

The subreddit structure does an amazing job at keeping the place feeling like a nice community.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But take facebook for example.. If you posted this question on your wall, you don't get responses like that. I'm sure I can speak for a lot of people when I say you would get mostly ignorant or funny answers back. I get the networking aspect of facebook vs reddit, but that's why reddit is amazing... because it is <em>the</em> website where you can post what you want, and get what you want back.. as in if you want serious, you'll get serious. if you want funny, you'll get funny. etc. It's the perfect place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't been with reddit since the beginning, it took some time for me to actually stick around.</p>
<p>I've long wanted communities like the ones we find in certain subreddits, and I often wonder how it was in the beginning. Did it just grow organically into something this big? Or did the developers know what they stumbled on was something awesome.</p>
<p>Posting news links/topics to forums is nothing new. Neither is specifically dedicated forums. I guess I could look into reddit's history, but I'd rather just browse... ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish google+ could adopt a structure similar to that of Reddit. Their Communities are pretty much Subreddits but they're not as active or fun for whatever reason, and their comments could use a nested structure just like reddit's</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, as a technician for one of the leading concrete sealant companies in the nation, while this answer is somewhat correct, it doesn't address the most important part, which is the actual chemistry of the cement. Soil, and ground prep can make a difference, but the way Romans could make concrete last in saltwater, let alone on regular ground, is due mostly to their superior cement composition. You can have perfect ground prep, but if your finishing sucks, and your cement sucks, then you will have cracking, scaling, and a whole host of other problems. The chemistry of cement is surprisingly complex. Here is a article that makes some sense of some recent developments though

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I think he's just saying they had a practical knowledge and didn't have like a system of scientific standards for determining things.</p>
<p>There's a difference between finding out yourself or from someone that this is how things work, and reading it in School and knowing that it will work.</p>
<p>And in those days, Knowledge like that was horded, so you'd have generations of the same families building things, and it was much like a Medieval Guild in many ways.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Science would have figured out what that didn't work, and why the other thing did work.</p></div>		</li>
