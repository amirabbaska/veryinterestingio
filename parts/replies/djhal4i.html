			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with this answer because it isnt an answer. This &quot;you cant understand&quot; quantum mechanics thing comes from the days when people didnt grow up with quantum mechanics around them. They tried to relate it to classical mechanics and it made no sense to them.</p>
<p>Today we have generations of physicists who grow up with this subject. If you dont try to relate quantum with classical and take it as its own world then it makes perfect sense. </p>
<p>Now back to the answer - the electron is a wave when you dont measure it but when it interacts it interacts as a particle. A wave cannot be at a stationary point - it needs to occupy a volume. So it does occupy a volume which encompasses the nucleus. If you keep measuring where the electron is, once in a while you will find it inside the nucleus. (Sometimes it even interacts with the nucleons and they undergo a radioactive decay.) See - there is no magic here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about this:</p>
<p>The electron is a wave when you dont measure it but when it interacts it does so as a particle. A wave cannot be at a stationary point - it needs to occupy a volume. So it does occupy a volume which encompasses the nucleus. If you keep measuring where the electron is, once in a while you will find it inside the nucleus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the one class in undergrad that never really &quot;clicked&quot; for me. There were some classes I would struggle with for a few weeks, and then everything would all of a sudden make sense. Not so with quantum mechanics... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite example of this comes from my QM professor in undergrad. On the first day he started with the double slit experiment and some of the philosophy behind quantum theory, but towards the end he said something like, &quot;If you want to understand QM, it takes a long time. But for people just starting on the subject talking about what it all 'means', I say 'shut up and calculate.'&quot;</p></div>		</li>
