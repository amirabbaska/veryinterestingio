<p>in fact, in the PFC we see a decrease in gray matter with age into the 20s and 30s which is thought to represent synaptic pruning, or removal of redundant connections and fortification of efficient ones.</p>

<p>I thought synaptic pruning ends in adolescence. Yet gray matter continues to decrease throughout life. Are you sure about this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i meant that the 20's-30 is the limit of synaptic pruning, poor wording. so generally yes, during adolescence and up until about that time, synpatic pruning contributes to gray matter loss (increasing &quot;efficiency&quot; of neural networks and processing with maturing of the PFC). i see adolescence ending in the third decade sometime but it could be a few years earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that synaptic pruning usually ends in the late teens. In the cases where it continues into the 20's, it's usually associated with pathological cortical thinning and psychotic illness.</p></div>		</li>
