			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the velocity of rotation at a specific distance from center is a constant, the further you get from the center of rotation, the higher velocity you would have to move in order to counter it. So if it is constant, as you get further away, eventually you would get crushed against the floor by the centripetal force. In order to lessen the force needed to counter the centripetal force, you would actually have to be closer to the center of rotation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Centripetal acceleration is v^(2)/r, so for acceleration equal to gravity, or 1g (9.8m/s/s), you’re looking at 9.8=v^(2)/r. At a radius of 9.8m, velocity is 9.8m/s, or a good sprint. At a radius of 100m, velocity is 31m/s or 110km/hr (~65mph). </p>
<p>The only practical catch to what you’re saying is that before you get a radius so small that a walking pace overcomes the velocity of the station, it would be too small practically for humans. For instance a human is about 2m tall, so to have head clearance that’s the absolute bare minimum. A 2m radius at 1g would be a velocity of about 3m/s. You could overcome that walking, but would also only have about a 12m long circle. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The artificial gravity in this case is actually <em>centrifugal</em> force. The centripetal force here would be the force exerted by the floor of the space station pushing up on your feet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Centrifugal force. NOT centripetal force. Centripetal force, in the case of running, is the normal force that keeps you from passing through the ground.</p></div>		</li>
