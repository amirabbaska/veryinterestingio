<p>One of my favorite chapters of World War Z talks about the extremes of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Numbers on cell tower power is a bit low.  LTE is about 60 watts a carrier so maybe 3 carriers per site. 1x will be 30 watts or less per carrier.  EVDO about 16watts total 200 watts or so per sector and 3 sectors per site total 600 watts. Each vendor like sprint or VZW would have about the same power out depending on load.  So 600 times who is on? That's your answer in watts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are those figures the Effective Radiated Power (ERP) or the actual power?</p>
<p>You often see the ERP quoted, because for many purposes it is the most relevant number, but it doesn't necessarily reflect the actual amount of power radiated by the tower.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the main conclusion remains the same, the amount of radiation that you receive from a cell tower is completely negligible compared to what the Sun is blasting at you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the perspective of someone standing anywhere away from the antenna/transmitter combination the ERP  <em>IS</em>  the important number.  Since that is the amount of energy sent in any particular direction.  </p>
<p>To be more clear, an omni antenna will radiate in all direction (there are not= real spherical radiators, so we'll just simplify to 2D for now), whereas the section antennas will effectively shift some of the radiator from one direction to another.  This increases the &quot;effective&quot; radiation in one direction while decreasing it in another.  This would be equivalent to increasing the transmitter power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes ERP power out. I also agree with your statement on power from the sun one thing no one has mentioned is radio AM FM use 100k watts transmitters. It all adds up but I doubt it's 5 percent of the sun impact on us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your answer. It is about what I expected. A quick googling seems to verify your numbers. How about just microwaves though(around the frequencies of wireless comms)?</p></div>		</li>
