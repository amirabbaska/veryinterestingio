			<div class="markdown"><p>I posted this below, and am reposting because I hope more people see this. This is sadly, more scientific, but it helps some people grasp the WHY behind what is happening in your body. </p>
<p>“Carbohydrates stimulate the release of insulin like growth factor 1. After release, the body decides what to create. On a sedentary person with no physical demands, the body creates adipose tissue (fat) to sustain life in case of famine. On a regular exerciser, IGF-1 starts a cascade of events that end with the refueling the lost muscle glycogen and then building of lean mass to aid future exercise. “ </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's almost impossible to gain lean mass. Unless you calculate EXACTLY the right amount of food you need...you're more then likely going to overshoot your needs and gain a little extra fat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the body determine what it needs though? Fat cells tends to accumulate/ enlarge bc they're not being used as a fuel. How does the body know it's been active? How does it know to allocate towards muscle instead of fat...how does it know of famine? There might be a few misconceptions on how and why the body does what it does. It's actions are more of gross movements then precise maneuvers</p></div>		</li>
