			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t remember the similar test at the eye doctors, but the test they make you do to get your license. </p>
<p>It’s one of the tests where you put your head up to a display, and your right eye is shown one image while your left another. The specific test I remember shows a music stanza and a red dot in one, and a bunch of random labeled notes in the other. You had to say which note the dot was under. </p>
<p>I had a lot of lazy eye issues/bifocals/eyepatches which eventually ended up in me seeing dominantly out of one eye at a time and the ability to control/switch which eye that is at any time. It also made it so that I can only look at one of those given images at a time, and just have to use my smarts to put two and two together. </p>
<p>What is this trying to test? Because always thought of it as cheating considering I am technically failing the test, but it’s just a easy guess. I always assumed it was something about depth perception, because that is important for driving and mine suckkkkkssssss. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi!   So I have something similar, I have what is called an eye turn...where one eye will turn inward after a while.  It's usually after they've been used pretty heavily and get tired.  It definitely affects depth perception.  Like you, I can switch between eyes at will though it requires a conscious mental effort.</p>
<p>The medical term is Strabismus.   I can't say for sure that's what you, or even I have, but it's worth looking into.  This website ( <a href="http://www.strabismus.org" target="_blank">http://www.strabismus.org</a> ) has a lot of info on the types of Strabismus and the treatments for it.  I'm sure there are other resources out there, and always your optometrist is a great starting place.  Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve been wondering about this:  Once and only once the eye doc made me do a peripheral vision test where I was supposed to hit a left or right button to indicate when and on which side I saw a squiggly.  I don’t know why but I couldn’t pass that test for crap.  I failed badly like three times and they gave up, saying if my peripheral vision was really that bad I’d be walking into walls.  I can only guess that I’m just super unobservant.</p>
<p>Is that not something that is always part of an eye exam?  I’m not even sure what they were testing for, glaucoma?  I’m just curious because The last few times I’ve had my eyes examined that hasn’t been part of it nor has eye dilation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if I recall correctly.  I had to put my eyes up to a viewfinder looking thing that covered my eyes and I could see just a blank white image but occasionally there would briefly be a squiggly distortion to the right or left that I was supposed to notice.  Some of them were pretty subtle though and I wasn’t always sure if I saw one or not.  This was at LensCrafters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I’m super light sensitive so I pretty much have tears streaming down my face during that part. My doc was really nice about it, apologized and said he had it on the lowest possible setting.</p></div>		</li>
