			<div class="markdown"><p>Super bass heavy music will more than likely not have any infrasonic sound in it.</p>
<p>When producers make bass music, they send it to a mastering engineer after the mixdown is complete. They will make sure there is no unecessary frequencies in inaudible frequency ranges to reduce the size of the final master and to prevent &quot;artefacts&quot; (sounds that can take up headroom in the master and potentially cause damage to sound equipment) from being present in the final master.</p>
<p>Its also a requirement for most CD/Vinyl pressing facilities that there be no frequencies below a certain number because their equipment could malfunction during a mass press if they try and &quot;press&quot; frequencies that are too low and have a high DB signal rating. </p>
<p>What you are feeling is the sheer sound pressure level of the music, as in, the speaker moving the air very violently, when the music is loud. The bass vibrates your body as certain frequencies interact with your muscoskeletal structure and &quot;resonate&quot;. Your bones and muscle and soft tissue vibrates to specific frequencies that naturally resonate at those frequencies. </p>
<p>Don't worry you won't vibrate to bits. The sound pressure required to do that is basically a shockwave from an explosion so big it would have to be produced by plastic explosive or artillery rounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not for CD's, CD's are digital data and there is no way to damage anything by having a signal with low frequencies or even a with a DC offset, as shown by the fact that data CD's can have arbitrary data. </p>
<p>That said it will end up using headroom and that is definitely to be avoided. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think he means that he can feel the vibration of bass, not that it uses infrasound. as for vibrating to bits, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp5Do_R_3pE" target="_blank">well...</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're called LFE or low frequency effects and it's what your sub generates... It's a huge part of music and movies and is very important and integral to the experience imo... </p>
<p>Some people can hear over 20kHz, up to 22-24kHz but that's very rare - most of us adults cant hear over ~15kHz.... In any case, it doesn't hurt to have the higher frequencies represented as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's interesting is it's only because we're not able to accurately reproduce sub 20 hz frequencies at a high enough db. Check out the Thigpen rotary woofer. You can hear low frequencies, but it is more or less just your ear drums and body noticing the pressure changes. It is VERY apparent. That is though after all, what sound is by definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most woofers I've had produce 5-8 hz accurately enough... That's why they call it an effects channel. It's more to be felt than heard... That's also why subs are almost always placed on the floor. So that they can transmit low frequencies through the floor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sensation of a house being haunted has been linked to infrasonic vibrations combined with low light. In the absence of clarifying information the brain overamplifies the little bit of sensory input it does get and it all contributes to freaking people out.</p>
<p>Infrasonics are more likely in older buildings where aging wood doesn't fit as tightly as it once did.</p></div>		</li>
