			<div class="markdown"><p>What I still don't understand is that most of the errors could be spotted by a basic spell checker, like ms word have... It would underline in red all words that ain't in a dictionary. Writting in MS Word then copy pasting would take basically no time. If in firefox and chrome I'm pretty sure that there is even some spell checker extension that is available that would do the same thing. So really, basically zero time used for correction and most typo would be fixed.</p>
<p>In french, we have a great piece of software: Antidote. It also do english but I never tested the english part. It integrate in many programs, including internet explorer, firefox, chrome and of course words. In case the software don't support it you can copy paste the text to it. This take a bit more time to correct, but does a great job!</p>
<p>I don't understand why nobody do that... I'm guessing: lazyness. </p></div>		</li>
