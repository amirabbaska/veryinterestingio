<p>I want to make sure but can modern AC still dehumidify just as how it was initially designed? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait holy shit. So the best way to defrost is to have the AC on, with the defrost setting, and turned to hot air? I have a 2010 so I still got the knobs. </p></div>		</li>
