			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely possible. But the simplest alternative is that it's basically one thing. The properties that we can observe or deduce about it seem to be pretty uniform. Now obviously, simplest doesn't always mean much, but it's the best place to start. </p>
<p>For instance, let's say a book falls off of your desk for no reason that you can see. You might blame a ghost, or a poltergeist, or a gremlin, but you're not going to bother to blame all three of them at once. There's no reason why it <em>couldn't</em> be a collusion of all three, but that requires three suppositions where one would do. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And if we can blame it on your colleague bumping into your desk two seconds before the book fell, we can cut that number down to zero. It <em>could</em> have been a ghost, but it would be much more convenient to test a simpler theory first. We still have the option of investigating the ghost theory later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there's one theory that postulates that dark matter may be black holes in the voids between galaxies. So, in that case, it would be regular matter that's just very difficult to detect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black hole dark matter isn't just regular matter. If it were to be true they would need to be primordial black holes, formed in the very early universe before normal matter even existed. They wouldn't collapse from normal matter like stellar black holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be black holes, but they would have to be in galaxies because we know most galaxies including our own are full of dark matter. If they were much more massive than the black holes that formed from stars it would explain why we haven't detected them yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no, the problem is that the title &quot;dark matter&quot; means two different things. There is the dark matter that is the mass that is missing, and Dark Matter that is the major componant of said effect. </p>
<p>For example, MACHOs or what we call Massive compact halo objects are a candiate for dark matter, heck they are technically dark matter. However, when you account for the MACHOs we know about, and the ones we don't know about, their main contribution doesn't even begin to crack the few percent points. So while yes, multiple things can be dark matter most of the things that we know that can be doesn't contribute enough to worth a mention. </p>
<p>Now the question is, could it be that the main componant of dark matter is still a collection of various things? Sure, but most of our models that we have point toward one main componant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that 'Dark Matter' is basically a generic term for some unknown thing/force that is responsible for known effects that clearly do happen makes the term kind of useful and useless at the same time. </p>
<p>It is sort of like when biologists didn't know that DNA was the genetic molecule of inheritance but still had a clear understanding of basic genetics....once DNA was clearly shown to be the molecule of inheritance it didn't change previous genetics, it just made it really clear why previous data made sense and then opened a wide array of new experiments and ideas to explore.</p>
<p>So in that sense, dark matter does exist. We just don't have any clue what it is or if it is even 'matter'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Unknown thing/force&quot; -- he's describing the unidentified &quot;matter.&quot; Dark matter isn't gravity, or at least it hasn't been proven to be gravity. I've never heard of dark matter being gravity as &quot;matter&quot; or substance. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, there are a handful oh phenomena we see that requires Dark Matter to exist, but the most basic one is this:</p>
<p>When we observe the galaxies outside the milky way, and try to simulate them using the known matter of the galaxy, we find that the galaxy should rip apart, instead of maintaining its form.  In order to keep the galaxy together, there must be more massive objects in the galaxy that we can't observe directly.  These unknown massive object are called &quot;dark matter&quot;, because we know Matter must exist there, but we don't know anything else about it.</p>
<p>Now, this may seem contrived, but there are other observations made which have solutions via dark matter.  Recently we observed 2 galaxies colliding, and the resulting pattern required that there must be some unknown massive objects inside these galaxies (i.e. Dark Matter).</p>
<p>We known Dark Matter exists (and in large quantites) by the effects it has on regular matter through the gravitational forces that they exert on eachother.  Gravity is extremely weak though, and if Dark Matter is composed of small particles, it makes them almost impossible to detect.  If they are huge objects (like black holes), it is going to be hard to setup an experiment to test that hypothesis.</p>
<p>Dark Matter is a term we use to describe something we know exists by its interactions (via gravitational force) on other objects we are familiar with (light/atoms).</p>
<p>Dark Energy, likewise, is the term for an energy source that we know exists, but we don't know anything else about it.  The universe is expanding at an accelerated rate.  Our understanding of gravity dictates that all objects must be slowing down, and eventually the universe should collapse in on itself.  The fact that it is expanding (at an accelerated rate) means that there must be some force which is pushing the galaxies apart.  The energy source of this unknown force is &quot;Dark Energy&quot;.  It must exist, but we don't know anything else about it than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that the above question assumes, with most laymen, that &quot;dark matter&quot; is some mysterious other state of matter, like antimatter, and does not realize that it quite possibly is just be regular old non-luminous stuff that we predict to exist because of the observed motion of the luminous stuff we can see.</p>
<p>I would start any answer by saying that there is nothing magical about the &quot;darkness&quot; of unobserved mass and also include the fact that discovering that hypothesized mass would <em>confirm</em> our assumptions about physics, not overturn them, since the observed motion of bright stuff like stars requires a bunch of extra mass that we can't see in order to make sense <em>given</em> our current understanding.</p>
<p>E: in fact, the real mind blowing thing would be if it didn't exist, since that would mean something really crazy, like that physics behaves differently at large scales, which would imply that a lot of our large scale understanding is wrong</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Composition" target="_blank">I don't think that's correct</a>. Dark matter could certainly be normal baryonic matter, though as that article points out there is mounting evidence that this isn't the case. There's nothing about the <em>definition</em> of dark matter that says it can't be &quot;normal&quot; matter however. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We assume it is transparent to electromagnetic radiation but as has been said before we don't actually know what dark matter is. We can't see it so we make the assumption that it doesn't interact with light but that doesn't change the fact that it could still be normal matter that we simply can't detect due to other circumstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda a way off theory but what if dark matter is actually just a tear in space time that is formed from a black hole (or something else, maybe what the great attractor is made of) and the effect we are seeing is just it's gravity leaking from it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there was a bunch of stuff that looked weird before we had the proper perspective.</p>
<p>If you think the earth is the center of the solar system, then the &quot;retrograde&quot; motion of the planets (we pass them moving around the Sun and it looks like they suddenly move backward in the sky) looks really weird. When we had the proper perspective, it made perfect sense.</p>
<p>Whatever the story with dark matter is, when we see what's going on, it will probably end up looking simple and intuitive.</p></div>		</li>
