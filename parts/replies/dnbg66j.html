<p>Don't forget that in practice, employers can just lie about why they fired someone, and fire for discriminatory/retaliatory reasons all they want.  Best case scenario, the fired person sues, and maybe gets a settlement years later.  </p>
<p>One perk of union membership is that members can't be fired without the employer presenting <em>evidence</em> of the reason. The employee gets a representative to argue on their behalf.  Falsified records, which employers sometimes make, are harder to make stick if the union has kept it's own records.</p></div>		</li>
