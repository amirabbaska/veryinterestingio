<p>But a steady laser that can melt <em>anything</em> is still probably worth calling high density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>*<em>femto</em> seconds. Pulsed lasers for 2-photon excitation or multiphoton microscopy are very high power but deliver the power in short bursts on the order of 100x10^-15 to 1x10^-12 seconds (100 femtoseconds to 1 picosecond). This is so that the time averaged power delivered to your sample is still quite low and so doesn't cook it, but the probability of hitting the fluorescent molecule you're trying to excite with two simultaneous photons goes up. This works because you can either excite with a photon of energy of x or two photons with energy of 1/2x...but in order to the two photons of 1/2x to hit simultaneously, you have to have a lot of photons delivered at one time...ergo high powered lasers for short durations and the name &quot;2-photon.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: in contrast, a microsecond is 1x10^-6 seconds. One million times less than 1 picosecond and 10 million times less than 100 femtoseconds.</p></div>		</li>
