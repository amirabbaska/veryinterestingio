			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this!! I hate this recent Stan backlash. He worked tirelessly during the early years of what we know of as the Marvel Universe to actually write the comics. People act as if Stan did nothing and the artists did all the work. That's true to an extent, but Stan still worked his ass off, scripting between five and ten comics a month and having creative input on every title Marvel put out from essentially 1961 to 1970. After that, he still worked as an essential part of the company for another ten years. Stan might not have been the sole creative force behind Marvel, as his media omnipresence might suggest, but he was still an invaluable part of Marvel.</p>
<p>Edit: If Stan Lee were working in the comics industry today, his work would more rightly be classified as &quot;scripter and/or co-plotter&quot; as opposed to being credited as sole writer. This, in my opinion, does not discredit his influence within the genre, the company, and the industry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By conquering the media and being so likable he made comics respectable. Remember that in the 1950s comics were treated as either harmful or kids' stuff. He changed this.</p>

<p>This is a biggie. Comic books were the violent video games of their day. There were people out there hell bent on banning comic books just like today with games. When was the last time a comic book came up as a negative aspect to someones life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all seriousness, though, inking is a really sought-after, specialized skill. They're not just tracing; they're adding a sense of depth to the image. Sometimes, they have to make corrections to the original drawing. Sometimes, they get handed a page scribbled out by Rob Liefeld and have to bullshit and basically <em>actually</em> draw the entire page.</p></div>		</li>
