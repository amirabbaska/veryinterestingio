			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is. It's from the caesura.</p>
<p>Play is a right facing arrow because we read right to left (derp!) left to right (thanks, /u/ShipBobbin ) in the West, it's a cultural thing. Other UX elements have right facing arrows to mean &quot;next&quot; or &quot;progress&quot; for similar reasons. Rewind is, of course, the opposite.</p>
<p>Eject is an line and an up arrow from old top loading VCRs.</p>
<p>Stop is a box because it's the only simple geometric shape which wasn't already used (a circle was, originally, power off, but then became record) and it looked like a &quot;more complete&quot; pause.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™d imagine a literal break in the line or space to signify a pause or end. It probably later got shortened to just the two lines above the measure, especially if you had drawn out the measures before you wrote the music.</p></div>		</li>
