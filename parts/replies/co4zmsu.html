Your brain doesn't check what the cells in your eyes are reporting at a fixed frequency, the cells in your eyes send electrical signals whenever they manage to detect a photon striking them. These signals are then processed by the brain in a whole manner of different ways. And the way in which the information is processed by the brain has the largest impact on how you perceive things. The best way to think of it is as being able to see changes rather than collecting a series of pictures of what is there at different moments in time.</p>
<p>As for what kinds of things you would and wouldn't be able to see, it depends largely on persistence of vision and the flicker fusion threshold. This is what makes a particularly strong flash of light appear to last much longer than what it actually does, and what makes you perceive flickering artificial light as continuous lighting. The actual flicker fusion threshold depends a lot on color and absolute intensity of light, but mostly on lighting contrast. So light flickering in a dark room would appear constant at a much lower frequency than light flickering outside in daylight. Usually at frequencies somewhere between 20-70Hz depending on intensity, lighting differences, and the individual person.</p>
<p>This is something absolutely different than how short of a flash of light you are able to notice, though. And tests have been done both demonstrating the ability to detect and identify the silhouette of a specific plane flashed at less than 1/220th of a second (by the USAF) and being able to detect just handfuls of photons entering the human eye in extreme low light conditions. And then you have things like being able to identify visual patterns in artificial imagery that wouldn't occur with real life motion. Like seeing multiple copies of your cursor on your screen if you shake it back and forth really fast, both due to image persistence of the display and persistence of vision. Something that could only be resolved by having the display show images at a rate higher than the rate of pixel movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more like a CID (Charge Injection Device) than a CCD (Charge Coupled Device).  Essentially, it doesn't scan lines, but your brain gets updates when individual photoreceptor cells fire off membrane action-potential signal cascades.   (The sequence of &quot;updates&quot; for signal vs. non-signal is inverted of course, but not discussed here.)</p>
<p>The individual photoreceptive proteins respond usefully to electromagnetic radiation in three wavelength ranges between 0.4 and 0.7 Âµm.  This corresponds with the atmospheric EMR non-absorption window hovering around that range.  Absorption for these bands probably results in a specific conformational change for those proteins.</p>
<p>There is even an interesting kind of signal averaging going on within the cells and at the neuronal level.  If an insufficient number of photoreceptive proteins activate in a short enough span of time, then the cell membrane potential will not be triggered.  Likewise, if a down route neuron requires several inbound axonal junctions to trigger to get above threshold for signal propagation, it can filter out minor signals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I like how they get started:</p>
<p>How many frames per second can the human eye see?
This is a tricky question. And much confusion about it is related to the fact, that this question is NOT the same as:</p>
<p>How many frames per second do I have to have to make motions look fluid?
And it's not the same as</p>
<p>How many frames per second makes the movie stop flickering?
And it's not the same as</p>
<p>What is the shortest frame a human eye would notice?</p></div>		</li>
