			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, exactly! The lye makes it alkaline which allows it to brown much faster and more thoroughly.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Browning is more of a function of time at a given temperature then just the temperature itself. It can occur below 300 but it takes much longer, and often that is desirable when cooking roasts or barbecue- large hunks of meat with lots of collagen that needs to be broken down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there's no caramelization when cooking a roast. That's why some recipes have you braise the meat in a pan before roasting - to get that tasty caramelized crust (which also can lock in moisture).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between caramelization and the Maillard reaction! Although they both result in browning, the Maillard reaction is when a sugar bonds with an amino acid, and caramelization occurs when sugars undergo pyrolysis. Meat searing is the Maillard reaction at work.</p></div>		</li>
