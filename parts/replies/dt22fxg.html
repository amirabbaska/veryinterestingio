			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the clear answer.</p>
<p>So, basically Ethiopia's statement, i.e. <strong>&quot;The dam will increase water flow to Egypt by reducing evaporation on Egypt's Lake Nasser&quot;</strong> is like saying, &quot;I'll retain $750,000 of your $1,000,000 with me, so that if a thief tried to rob you, he'd only be able to steal $250,000, however, you'll have to beg me later to get your $750,000, which I might refuse to give them back to you&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more precise, it is:<br />
&quot;I can reduce the total amount of taxes that both of us pay combined by holding on to more of the money.&quot;<br />
The evaporation rate of the GERD is expected to be much lower than from Lake Nasser. So the dam should result in more total water being available to Egypt and Ethiopia combined, but it seems extremely unlikely that Ethiopia will only draw off the water saved by those efficiency gains.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just incorrect. Dams can increase water supply when you need it, I.e when the flow is low. So on sum you won’t get more water, but your minimums will be way less minimum, while your maxes will be lower by a similar amount.</p>
<p>If managed well,
This is a good thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He actually didn't answer your question. The reason there's less evaporation is because of surface area to volume ratio. Think of how a water spilt on a table evaporates quicker than water in a glass. The glass is essentially the dam in that analogy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally dams increase the surface area at a lake, as the area fills up the water coverage spreads out. Someone else mentioned the elevation or geographical location was more likely to reduce evaporation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but to generate power they will need to release the water at fairly high rates. I doubt they would shoot themselves in the foot and hold back the water supply as they would not be generating power </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but once the lake is filled the flow would return to normal since the amount of rain has not changed (over the time period of construction). If water is used for irrigation that would reduce flow but otherwise the water budget doesn't change much (there would be some evaporation from the lake but that would be minor compared to the total flow).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're probably right, it actually depends on the surface area, elevation and environmental conditions at the location of the two lakes.   It might be that Lake Nasser is very large and shallow in an extremely dry area, and the newly created lake in Ethiopia is extremely deep with almost no surface area.  I'm not sure what the situation is or the proposal, but they could be correct...not saying it's a good deal as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lake Nasser was made by making a lowland dam. The main function is as a reservoir to store monsoon water so it can be used for irrigation. It is shallow, plus it is in a desert climate. </p>
<p>Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is designed to deliver A LOT of power so it is very deep. Plus be very deep plus in an arid mountains climate. </p>
<p>The new lake is estimated to loose 1.5 km^3 compared to Lake Nasser in Egypt loses between 10–16 km^3. So about a 1/10th evaporation for a reservoir storage a little over half the size.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have the specs for the Ethiopia reservoir so I don't know that for sure. Certainly the relative humidity is higher in Ethiopia so that would reduce evaporation in the Ethiopian reservoir relative to Lake Nasser. That wouldn't increase flow in Egypt though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Currently the blue nile flow is seasonal. a wild river in the monsoon season, then slowing down until is a slow trickle just before the next monsoon season. The damn will change that to a steady flow as power is generated. </p>
<p>As this mean that the blue Nile will continuously fill lake Nasser, the amount of water needed after monsoon season to irrigate the fields for the next year is less. So lake nasser will evaporate less leaving more water for the Egyptians. At least until Sudan discover the steady blue Nile means that the surrounding fields can yields crops just as in Egypt. </p>
<p>Overall there will be more water to share with everyone not only by less evaporation but also better control so less water will have to be let out into the Mediterranean sea.</p>
<p>How it will be shared is a political question, where currently Egypt is getting the best deal and Sudan stile have to deal with monsoon floods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OTOH if a lot gets used for irrigation around the Ethiopian dam, then evaporation could be significantly worse and lower downstream flow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't Egypt's Lake Nassar basically nonfunctional as a hydroelectric source  as well as having a very high evaporation rate due to the lake having rapidly silted up after construction of the dam? This is a serious question about Ethiopia's statement. I recall reading the lake trapped huge amounts of silt that were previously carried down the to the delta (resulting in land subsidence there as well); but also that the silt had reduced the depth of the lake to such a degree that water losses from evaporation were huge. Is Ethiopia's statement one that is basically saying &quot;stop using that useless dam, it's wasting water&quot; . </p>
<p>---EDIT---  </p>
<p>Found this <a href="https://courseware.e-education.psu.edu/courses/earth105new/content/lesson06/04.html" target="_blank">education module</a> on the adverse affects the Aswan High Dam had on agriculture, diseases, land subsidence and political tensions in the region. One of the interesting comments is that Egypt essentially allocated for its own use the majority of the water flow over Sudan. Ethiopia's use/claim wasn't even considered even though a full 59% of the total water flow in the river originates in the Ethiopian Blue Nile drainage basin. While the Egyptians may claim the right to prior use, their current usage doesn't forgive or negate their obligation to negotiate  good faith water sharing agreement with the Ethiopians. It's not good enough to say &quot;We took it first&quot; when the water comes from Ethiopia and their own needs/rights were never considered.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Aswan High Dam which regulates Lake Nasser provides 10% of Egypt's electricity. And considering they are already dealing with rolling blackouts due to too little installed capacity, shutting down Lake Nasser would have massive consequences for Egypt's economy. This is simply not something that Egypt can accept without losing billions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>While Lake Nasser is indeed silting up (all dams do) but it still has a maximum depth of 180 meters and an average depth of 25m. While that is not perfect for a dam in such a dry environment, it certainly is not an unusual shape. As far as I know the delta is not subsiding since sediment runoff is small. Sea level is rising however which does threaten the delta and is already causing coastal erosion which is costly to fix.</p></div>		</li>
