			<div class="markdown"><p>Having moved from SE Australia to NE North America I really noticed the reversal in the variability of the seasons. To illustrate the consistency of Melbourne winters and the variability of the summers I looked up the record maximum and minimum temperatures in January vs July. The data really confirms my own qualitative observations that summer=variable and winter=consistent in Melbourne</p>
<p>January temperature range: 72 F (record high: 114 F; record low: 42 F)</p>
<p>July temperature range: 47 F (record high: 74 F; record low: 27 F)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep Melbourne has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_climate" target="_blank">temperate oceanic climate</a> , which features a small temperature range. Iâ€™m always amazed when I see American cities that have temperature ranges from -30C to 40C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah here in Philly the January range is 81F (-7 to 74) and the July range is 53F (51 to 104). Really interesting how the season with most variability is switched</p></div>		</li>
