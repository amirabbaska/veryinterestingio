			<div class="markdown"><p>That's meconium - basically the adult insect's first poop. It consists of junk and byproducts left over from the metamorphosis process, and is often brightly colored because of leftover pigments.</p>
<p>In my experience water and regular detergent does the trick, I've never had trouble cleaning it away. Do you know what kind of butterflies they were?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they're Gulf Fritillary butterflies! We've got a ton of Purple Passion Flowers around our yard and, from what I understand, that's where they mainly lay eggs and what the caterpillars like to eat best. Most of our neighbors cleared theirs out, but we liked them and now our yard looks like a butterfly garden in the spring and late summer. I've got a ton of pictures of the cocoons and the caterpillars from when I was first trying to figure out what they are, but the two sides of our house closest to the woods were absolutely covered in them. </p>
<p>I'm actually considering planting more Purple Passion flowers in the spring, not only do I love the butterflies, but the flowers are gorgeous and they help choke out some of the other less desirable weeds.</p></div>		</li>
