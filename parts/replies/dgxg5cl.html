<p>Is this related to the Higg's boson? (How?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The strong force is spin-dependent. If you have three identical quarks, and you couple their angular momenta to 1/2 or 3/2, they'll have very different energies due to the spin-dependent part of the strong force. That means the masses of the two hadrons are different as well because of E = mc^(2).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you please be specific how the spin enters in QCD? I thought this was a Pauli-effect, like the one experienced by electrons in the hull around an atom. If the baryon has spin 1/2, two quarks have opposite spin which allows them to have overlapping wavefunctions. Only the third must be in a non-overlapping state. This the most compact situation, the ground state.</p>
<p>If the baryon has spin 3/2, all quarks have the same spin and their waveforms cannot overlap, effectively they are pushed apart more than in the ground state. Since the strong force is attractive, being further away means that more energy is stored in such a state, just like a spring stores more energy if you pull the end away further. Since energy is equivalent to matter, the baryon in this state has higher mass.</p>
<p>EDIT: As RobusEtCeleritas pointed out, this picture was not correct because the quarks in the baryon are not all identical up to spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, first you have to read up on quantum mechanics and get a decent understanding of quantum mechanical spin and quantum numbers in general.  Something like Shankar - Principles of Quantum Mechanics, though there are tons of textbooks on it.  You won't really get into particle physics, but should read at least to the point of understanding addition of angular momentum and spin (typically in context of hydrogen atom).</p>
<p>Then a text on particle physics like Griffiths' Intro To Elementary Particle Physics.  (You could also start Griffiths' Intro to QM).</p>
<p>You could also consult free resources like the <a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/reviews/contents_sports.html" target="_blank">particle data group</a>, but their reviews will be largely gibberish if you don't understand the basics of QM / particle physics / group theory.  (Articles like <a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/reviews/rpp2016-rev-quark-model.pdf" target="_blank">Quark Model</a>, or <a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/reviews/rpp2016-rev-naming-scheme-hadrons.pdf" target="_blank">Naming Scheme for Hadrons</a>).</p>
<p>If you are looking at hobby-level interest without getting into any math/textbooks, the best I can suggest is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/QED-Strange-Theory-Light-Matter/dp/0691024170" target="_blank">Feynman's QED</a> but it won't talk about isospin or hadrons or particle naming conventions but is a great layman introduction to quantum electrodynamics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terrific, thank you so much. I've read a decent amount on spin and angular momentum, however this was about a decade ago so I desperately need new material to refresh what I once knew, and learn to a depth I didn't before. I'll be checking out all of your suggestions. You're the best. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also recommend the Griffiths Elementary Particle Physics book. The first two chapters are somewhat within a layman's grasp. At the very least you'll get a &quot;folk history&quot; of particle physics.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, though, we now believe quarks to be the elementary constituents that make up all of these other particles (hadrons). The quarks have all sorts of properties like spin, flavor, color, isospin, etc. What particle you get when you combine quarks depends on the complicated combination rules in quantum mechanics. Due to the relatively large number of properties and the various combinations, it turns out you can create dozens and dozens of different particles by combining quarks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't entirely agree with djimbob. As always with physics it depends on how deeply you want to understand something (&quot;why is X like it is?&quot;) and how much you are willing to take as granted (&quot;ok, I accept X as a given, just tell me what follows from X&quot;).</p>
<p>Paul Dirac used to say that the whole field of chemistry is described by his famous equation, and in principle, he is correct. If you think that's amazing, welcome to the club. And yet, people didn't stop doing chemistry, because you don't need to understand Dirac's equation to do chemistry. Chemistry has its own rules, like the periodic system of elements, which emerge from relativistic quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>I would not recommend a hobbyist to read books on quantum mechanics, because you cannot really understand these books without the required math and some prior reading on theoretical mechanics. That requires several years of study. It is not impossible, but hard to do outside a professional course at a university.</p>
<p>So, if you are willing to accept some rules as a given, we have something like the periodic system of elements in chemistry for baryons and mesons, that one is explained in the reference <a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/reviews/rpp2016-rev-quark-model.pdf" target="_blank">http://pdg.lbl.gov/2016/reviews/rpp2016-rev-quark-model.pdf</a>. You can appreciate that without knowing all of relativistic quantum mechanics. It would be great if there was a simple book about this system but I don't know of any. Perhaps a gap that someone should fill.</p>
<p>djimbob gave you some good references, but for a layman I would only recommend you to read Feynmans QED, which is fantastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a physics major in college, but left that for literature and psychology which I ended up loving a lot more. I still really enjoy physics though. I took 3 physics classes in high school and 2 physics classes in college, as well as having read several books by Stephen Hawking, two books by Brian Greene, and have watched several lectures by Neil Degrasse Tyson, and watched Cosmos (and many other documentaries on Astro/particle physics), but Brian Greene and the Tyson lectures are probably the deepest I've ever gotten. It's mostly the &quot;pop physics&quot; stuff, so while I've read more than the average person, I know that I know much less than even a low-level grad student, haha. </p>
<p>I'm very willing to accept X as given, and to learn what follows, so I will definitely check out the chart on baryons and mesons. I'll be checking out everything each of you has pointed me toward, and if they're too above my level, I'll either drop them, or look for something to fill in that gap. </p></div>		</li>
