			<div class="markdown"><p>The issues are largly the red tape and franchise agreements, not technological.  The tech issues for a WISP were solved a while ago and have gotten easier with time. It's more a money and physics/coverage problem (both of which aren't even that crazy) outside of the red tape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying we shouldn't.  ISP monopolies and Net Neutrality are different issues. Net Neutrality is simply a bigger concern to more people because of ISP monopolies.</p>
<p>However, even if we had the ability for a 100% free market of ISPs, Net Neutrality would still be important. Not everywhere would have multiple ISPs, let alone a plethora.  Think of a rural town of maybe a thousand people. Just because they're rural and small doesn't mean we should allow the only ISP serving them to block or throttle traffic for anticompetitive reasons. (Selling tiers of bandwidth and throttling to that bandwidth is 100% OK in my book.  Actively throttling Netflix but not Hulu, for example, is 100% not OK.) (Again, the assumption here is that another ISP could drive both out of business, or even if it doesn't, would take a while to be able to provide service to the entire town.)</p>
<p>I really don't think that preventing ISPs from actively shaping traffic or preventing connections is too much to ask. I'm not saying they can't price bandwidth. I'm not saying they can't offer their own services. I'm not saying anything akin to a new &quot;fairness doctrine&quot;. All I'm saying is that actively shaping traffic or preventing connections should not be allowed.</p></div>		</li>
