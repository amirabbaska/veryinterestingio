			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is a big part of the reason. I decided to stop using the lift at work, and my house is on three storeys, so I probably go up and down 12 flights of stairs every day. It was just something my body got used to. Yes, it's probably made me a bit fitter generally but mostly I'm just a lot better at climbing stairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of the episode of Friends with guest star Danny Devito. 10 seasons in, the friends never say anything about the 3-floor walk-up. But when they open the door for stripper Danny Devito he doubles over gasping and says &quot;WOOOOO that's a lot of stairs!&quot; </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a fairly unfit guy who lives on the fifth floor. When people come to visit, they are always out of breath and complaining on the stairs. I've had no idea what they were talking about. I guess when you've carried two kids plus shopping bags up those stairs every day, you adapt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say this is most likely it.  Your body responds to specific exercises, and open chain exercise(leg press machines) do not translate fully to closed chain activities(stairs).  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5905669_A_Comprehensive_Rehabilitation_Program_With_Quadriceps_Strengthening_in_Closed_Versus_Open_Kinetic_Chain_Exercise_in_Patients_With_Anterior_Cruciate_Ligament_Deficiency_A_Randomized_Clinical_Trial_Eva" target="_blank">One study here.</a>  But it could also be muscle timing/activation patterns and OP isn't using gluts effectively in stairs and is relying on quads more.  So many variables...</p></div>		</li>
