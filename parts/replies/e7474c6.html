			<div class="markdown"><p>Accelerometer and some other sensors combined. They probably did a lot of testing under various conditions including falls and set a rather strict window of conditions that defined a fall. The watch likely undergoes a rapid deceleration thats probably only common to falling</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your punch would likely not accelerate at the same rate as falling thus putting it out of the range of possibilities. Plus, a fall isnt likely to happen as quickly as a punch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its the magic of Machine Learning algorithms running in the background. Your watch has accelerometer but it is very hard to manually specify all conditions for a fall. That's where they train their algorithms to correctly identify a fall. It never has a 100% accuracy but if it trained well enough then it can be commercialized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of all the other things stated here, keep in mind that an accelerometer will always know to a reasonable degree where down is at it picks up gravity.</p></div>		</li>
