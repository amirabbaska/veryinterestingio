<p>Places like Fermilab and CERN use superconducting magnets in their particle accelerators, but those are (relatively) small tubes and &lt; 20 miles long. Even then CERN uses ~100 tons of liquid helium to cool them, simply not possible with a long range maglev track.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How are you measuring efficiency here? When you say they aren't more efficient in general do you mean that in terms of mass of train moved per unit distance per unit of energy consumed? Or just general power consumption in total? </p></div>		</li>

<p>The Concorde jet made a similar compromise - it was much more expensive to operate and burned more fuel than a conventional jet, but it got business customers (who put a lot of value on their time) back and forth across the Atlantic much more quickly than other options. Unfortunately for the Concorde, when given the option, it turned out the customers didn't actually value their time as much as they thought they did.</p>
<p>Really, the maximum efficiency for distance and payload as a function purely of cost/energy is a super-container ship. They sip energy and take weeks to cross the ocean, and carry huge payloads. Plus, you don't need energy to build the rails, they just float. But people like to go far away quickly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That makes sense, thanks.</p>

<p>Also working remotely became significantly more viable in the late 90s and early 2000s so even for these demanding customers, flying across the Atlantic just to attend a meeting that they could conference into was not as much of a consideration.</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>compared to standard slower wheeled trains</em>, correct.</p>
<p>But maglev trains are still substantially more efficient per passenger-km than, say, cars. And substantially more amenable to low-pollution power generation methods too.</p>
<p>(Quick numbers: Transrapid says <a href="http://www.transrapid.de/cgi-tdb/en/basics.prg?session=9be8fa13451ed8b9&amp;a_no=47" target="_blank">52 watt-hours per seat-km</a> at 400km/h. That translates to <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=52+watthours+%2F+km+%2F+%28energy+density+of+gasoline%29+%2F+%28density+of+gasoline%29+%2F+%28L+%2F+100km%29" target="_blank">~0.55 L / 100km / seat</a>.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A conventional train uses a given amount of energy to move a given mass, the maglev train uses far less to do that, but it uses far more in the cooling system for the rails.  The energy still gets used, just somewhere else in the system.</p>
<p>It's just like with electric cars.  People say they aren't really as green because the electricity still comes from fossil fuels and that not being burned in the vehicle doesn't count as making them &quot;green&quot;.  The thing these people forget is that a coal plant is a hell of a lot cleaner than the 10000 gasoline engines it could technically replace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a question of scale at this point. If you build say 50km of maglev track, and have to cool it down it costs money for refrigeration systems. Running the train over it is just simply energy cost of speed/acceleration, the levitation is nearly free. If only one train uses this track, it's just terrible waste of energy and money. If track is saturated, cost of running individual trains gets much lower, bordering fixed costs ending up insignificant. Now in comparison to standard steel-track rolling train, which has to overcome much higher resistance, pushing the maglev train is much easier, the efficiency of moving <em>n</em> passengers from A to B is higher because energy expedited is considerably lower.</p>
<p>Of course money wise break-even point isn't obvious, since maglev infrastructure needs so much higher up-front cost and is high-maintenance. So maglev trains make sense in super-high speed lines that have very high passenger numbers, much less on metropolitan-class lines (until there is very, very high amount of money to blow).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hold on a minute.  I thought superconducting magnets were still very expensive and impractical, due to the extremely low-temperature cryogenic cooling required.  As far as I am aware, we still haven't solved the problem of producing high-temperature superconductors capable of this kind of application.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please read the second paragraph of my post - I allude to the extra cost required to keep them supercooled.</p>
<p>Research into the use of perovskites - a type of naturally occurring ceramic - has garnered some success in developing high temperature superconductors, but it is often only seen for low currents and in peculiar conditions. Recent breakthroughs have meant that superconductors above the boiling temperature of Nitrogen have been developed which has meant that they can be cooled by liquid Nitrogen, which is generally very cheap to buy (in the Materials Science department in Oxford we had the saying that Liquid Nitrogen is cheaper to buy in bulk than beer, but it doesn't taste as nice).</p></div>		</li>
