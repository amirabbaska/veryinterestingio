			<div class="markdown"><p>The particles themselves could take a long time to travel that far, but think more of it as the prey having bled, then itself swam off. Shark strolls on by, picks up the scent, and can then easily trace it's target over a large distance due to (as already noted in this post) the fact that they can pick up on very small concentrations of blood particles.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because then your finger stump will be bleeding. The best option is clearly to drain yourself entirely of blood and then leave, so the shark can't track you anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would depend on how still or volatile the water it. Surface water is usually far more frantic but the waves settle the deeper you go under water where sharks usually are at deeper depths. So if you are in really choppy water the blood could travel away really fast and settle down at calmer depth. Where Sharks can pick up on the chemicals and follow in the direction where the chemicals are stronger, hence trace it back to the source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SO! If a shark were to swim in to a strong current stream like the one in Finding Nemo, it'd get all the smells from last few days from hundreds of miles away. It would be like reading a newspaper. The Daily Stream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well in air it's easier to calculate. </p>
<p>the average energy the particle has is 3/2 <em>(k</em>T) where k is boltzmanns constant and T is temperature. This could be true in water to but it may not be because you have to consider whether or not the particle interacts with the dipole moment in water.</p>
<p>For a molecule like sugar floating around in the air it's thermal velocity is around 6 meters per second. However there are random walk considerations to make ie: the sugar molecule bumps into shit, so something in that order of magnitude will still be the speed at which smell travels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that (3/2)kT is the mean kinetic energy of a free particle in a gas, but that doesn't directly tell you how long it takes for a particle to travel a particular distance. Motion of particles in a gas is diffusive, not ballistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's why I added the random walk thing in there, and I couldn't remember the exact formula without looking but it doesn't change order of magnitude too much.</p></div>		</li>
