			<div class="markdown"><p>The pieces of ice could be sticking due to the cohesion effect experienced by water molecules, which would be quite similar to cold welding, but the settling of the molecules into fixed positions in the ice crystals should point them in haphazard directions, resulting in no net force from the molecules' polarity (which causes the cohesive effect of water, like magnets being attracted on opposite ends).</p>
<p>I would say the ice sticking together is mostly friction, similar to the phone books with the shuffled pages. The ice in the cooler somehow gets water on its surface, either from moisture in the air condensing on the cold ice or from the ice melting while the cooler is open and refreezing once it's closed. The water on the surface naturally collects between ice cubes, similar to the way water forms a bowl-shaped meniscus in a beaker. The water between the ice cubes refreezes, extending the crystal structures, which expand into each other and intertwine like the phone book pages. Pulling the ice apart would be like trying to push something along the ground; the object resists the movement because of friction, until you push hard enough. The ice similarly resists the movement until you pull hard enough to break the ice crystals stuck inside each other.</p></div>		</li>

You can also stick them tigether via air pressure and if you don't unstick them they also get cold welded. Interesting as fuck if you as me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that is interesting! Never heard of them, but I looked them up and of course the first two results are AvE and Cody'sLab, two of my favorite youtube channels. I had never seen either of their gauge videos, so it's kind of unsettling how they said pretty much everything I did. Cody even brought up the phone book pages, but I guess most kids who are really into science would have seen that Mythbusters episode at some point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The oxidation explanation is incomplete, as it just pushes the question further: why don't the oxide layers fuse together then? Or for instance, I have a block of a pure crystalized oxide, I can still break it apart and it won't recombine if I touch the parts again.</p>
<p>So the main reasons for it to not recombine is the topography of the break,  the roughness of the two pieces against each other, and the specific atoms that get exposed. This roughness captures non-binding molecules like gases from the atmosphere between them. The oxidation layer isn't uniform, so there's plenty of roughness.</p>
<p>Even in a vacuum, this roughness would only make a few points fuse together (and only if the right atoms get close enough and energy is provided for them to bind), which wouldn't stick strongly enough for you to notice.</p>
<p>Ionic compounds like table salt, for instance, don't fuse even though they are highly crystalline, are not oxides and have the right atoms exposed to bind to one another. So contact roughness has to be the main reason.</p>
<p>If you have a cleanly cut surface down to the molecular level, you could do all of this.. Metallic bonds are just very easy to form compared to the others. </p></div>		</li>
