			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand what you mean about the competition. Do you mean that symmetry in your visible abs is so uncommon that if you were to have it, you should utilize it by competing in bodybuilding? I'm slow, it's like a Monday to me since I was off work yesterday. So, it may be obvious what you mean to everyone but me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Its even much more uncommon if you have a few muscles that are symmetrical.</p>
<p>Most people muscles are not symmetrical. Bodybuilding champions have symmetrical muscles. Symmety is one of the big factor to win, muscle insertions and development being the other factors.</p></div>		</li>
