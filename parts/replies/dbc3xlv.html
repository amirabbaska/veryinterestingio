			<div class="markdown"><p>Vet here. There's a lot of observational clinical improvements noted in dogs and cats getting acupuncture. I recently saw a middle aged Dachshund with bad chronic inflammatory rhinitis. It was difficult to manage even with steroidal therapy. Then started getting acupuncture, and the 1-3 days after acupuncture it would release the flood gates of cloudy mucoid nasal discharge, and feel great for a few weeks before needing another treatment.
I've also personally seen positive gains in energy with dogs that have cancer.
I'm also pretty sure the NIH concluded that acupuncture had benefits in pain management analogous to traditional therapies (i.e., pharmaceuticals).
I absolutely hate medicine without evidence, and hate even more the alternative medicine racket and supplement bullshit. But acupuncture is on my list as something to always consider. Especially when it has no real harmful effects. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It looks like &quot;/s&quot;, but I've been disappointed in humanity condition few too many times to be sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't need to be a &quot;/s&quot; at all. Anecdotal evidence is usually the beginning point of all observable science. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw this person get better after he ate some bread with mold on it.&quot; &quot;Maybe we should study that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The moon disappeared last night, and I saw somewhere that it happened exactly 80 years ago as well.&quot; &quot;Lets see if it happens again in 80 years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This dog got better when this other guy stuck it with a bunch of needles.&quot; &quot;we should study that and see why.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering when it comes to understanding how the body works we are basically still in a dark ages it makes sense to look at anecdotal evidence and run with it to see if it is valuable or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely not /s. /u/LostWoodsInTheField explains it well. There are also many logic problems that can be solved by a single datapoint. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. While I was in college, I worked part time at an animal hospital, and one of the vets used acupuncture on dogs to treat pain. I saw several dogs get back a lot of mobility after a few rounds of acupuncture. So while I don't know why it works, I don't believe dogs have a placebo effect, so it works somehow, sometimes.</p></div>		</li>
