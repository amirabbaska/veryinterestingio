			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, yeah.</p>
<p>However, the impedance of the headphone's voice coil and the electrical properties of the device the headphone is connected to will dampen any electrical ringing that is supposed to bounce back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radio output of the detectors is being absorbed by your headphone wires which are acting as a crude antenna. Antenna work by turning radio waves into electrical currents which when connected to a speaker produce noise. The closer your antenna length matches the radio wavelength the better it will pick up/absorb that signal to produce an electrical current. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theft detectors work via radio frequency which is carried by electric and magnetic waves through the air, headphones have coils in them that react to electrical and magnetic impulses usually provided by that cord you have to plug in but they can pick up these RF signals.</p></div>		</li>
