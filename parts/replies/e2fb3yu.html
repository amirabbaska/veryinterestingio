			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing about blue pigments. When commissioning a painting, in addition to what the theme/subject and size of the piece of art would be. They would ask how much of each color you wanted. And since lapis lazuli came from what is nowmodern Afghanistan it was the guac of the olde days. &quot;yeah I know blue costs extra&quot; That's how everyone knew how rich you were.</p>
<p>and this guy had lots of old money:

			<div class="markdown"><p>This continues on today to some degree- when you buy tubes of paint, if they are of a professional grade they will be priced in “series number” price levels, so for example a color provided by something common like iron oxide is a series 1, but a color derived from cobalt or cadmium, since they are heavy metals, will be a series 6 or 7. (Genuine Lapis Lazuli is now manufactured by very few companies and will cost you in the area of $100 per 40mL tube)</p>
<p>Edit: source- I work at a high end art supplier and have learned a lot through experience, but I have no formal education qualifications in this area and there are a lot of interesting, better-informed replies expanding on this below! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also why the Virgin Mary was depicted in blue clothes in most Renaissance pictures... because it was the most expensive colour to show respect for the mother of Jesus. (In other countries, she's shown in whatever their most expensive thing is - in Poland she was put in white amber!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if the following story is true, but when I saw the Sistine Chapel, the tour guide said that Michelangelo didn't use lapis lazuli to paint the ceiling because he had to foot the cost of the paint, despite receiving a contract for the princely sum of 3000 ducats.  As a result, the blues in the ceiling are quite faded compared to the Last Judgment.  Many years later, Michelangelo, now the wiser, negotiated better terms to paint the Last Judgment; he made sure that the cost of materials was included in the contract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, blue pigment is <em>biologically</em> expensive to produce in animals. As we see in birds, fish, and butterflies, it's easier to just reflect blue. It is more readily formed as a mineral.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Bluebirds and Blue Jays etc have reflecting/refracting structures in their feathers to produce that color. If you grind up their feathers, you just get a drab grey. Source: did research on bluebirds in college</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some butterflies too! Their wings are made of chitin assembled in a complex <a href="http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/18/85/" target="_blank">3D structure that artificially increases the reflected frequency of light</a>, causing them to appear blue even though Chitin should normally not be able to attain that color. My senior design project involved trying to mimic that in a solar cell design. Nature is so fuckin dope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;it's easier to just reflect blue.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm confused by this statement.  I thought that something looking blue meant that it was reflecting blue light (and absorbing other visible light).  But your statement seem to imply there is a difference between being blue and reflecting blue.  Can you explain please?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things that look blue can do so because the energy levels of electrons in the materials are at the right energies to emit blue light, or because light is reflected from multiple surfaces equally, but because some rays are delayed the colours other than blue will cancel out.</p>
<p>If you research absorption spectra it will explain the first thing, and the second is called interference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oops. I'm not good at optics. Basically scales and feathers can refract (in the case of iridescence like peacocks or morpho butterflies) light so they look blue, or reflect mostly blue light. Again, I'm not good with optical physics so hopefully someone else can explain it better.</p></div>		</li>
