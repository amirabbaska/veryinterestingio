			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna go with a yes on your assessment there.  </p>
<p>I work at a nursery,  and we sometimes bump up 3 gallon plants to 25 gallon buckets.  </p>
<p>That's not how all of our plants work,  though.  the point of a slow step up process is to protect the plant's root growth withing a certain volume of dirt,  so that your plant doesn't knock over and lose access to its food, water, and light.  </p>
<p>We go from rooted plants in a sprouting tray to 1 gallon buckets.  1 gallon to 3 gallon,  3 to 7, most of the time, and then 7 to 15 or 25 gallon buckets most often.  all of those are much larger than a 2 inch increase in pot size, and our plants do just fine.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard the reason you don't step up too much is that a small plant in a large pot will have a lot of soil that might hold onto moisture and cause root rot. So if you're using well draining soil it's probably fine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the reason right here, it has nothing to do with a conspiracy from 'Big Terra Cotta'.</p>
<p>First off, if you're doing a lot of growing, so much so that this is a serious concern, you're probably using plastic pots which are about $3 for a dozen. So much for big conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Price update, $2.95 for 10, cheapest prices I could find, but they're not far from it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mainly, because there is no benefit in the extra space. It's inconvenient for the grower.</p>
<p>Secondarily, though, some people are worried about drainage in all that extra soil with no roots in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tjat would be my thought, ijn the wild the p lant isnt alone, any extra water gets eaten by every other plant. In a pot, and extra water sticks around, without properly mai ntained drainage it cam rot the roots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the end user it doesn't matter much in well drained soil, but if a grower sells a plant (let's say a tree) in too big of a pot they increase the risk that the root will break during transplant after sale.  </p>
<p>A root ball that fills the entire pot is more stable and basically comes out in one piece like a push pop.   That extra soil at the bottom tends to stay wet even in good drainage and gets heavy enough to harm the roots if you're not careful during transplant. </p>
<p>Plus it's more money to have to spend on soil, which businesses want to minimize.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BS in Horticulture here. It really has to do with multiple factors. Plant itself and conditions. You put a 4” pot(starter plant) in a large 12” container it will most likely rot out. I’m  referring to my experience with ornamental varieties. Plant roots need air too. When you surround the roots in potting soil and it retains water you rot the roots. In a lot of cases it looks like the plant is drying up. That is sort of true. If the roots rot the upper part of the plant is not getting water. It depends on the soil you use as well. As far as in the ground or in nature  it depends on the soil and location. Is it full sun? Is it good soil, well drained?  Is it solid clay which won’t release the water due to bonding. What plant a you referring too? It isn’t one rule fits all. </p>
<p>If you are putting starter plugs in a farming conditions it’s mostly likely a raised row that has been tilled and had added organic material added. think strawberries, peppers, tomatoes . Again it varies on plant and conditions. </p>
<p>If you watch the video of the automated evergreen planting machine,  those saplings are being planted in A plus soil. It’s had layers of varying stages of organic material aerated nutrient rich. Plus those sapling grow much different than say a pepper plant. </p>
<p>I can edit and and elaborate on this tomorrow when I sober up. </p>
<p>Other things to consider hydroponics , ebb flow systems, perlite only beds, test tube cultures ( soilless mediums )</p>
<p>I actually don’t know if I answered you question. Oh well Prost !</p></div>		</li>
