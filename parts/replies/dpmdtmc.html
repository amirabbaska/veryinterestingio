			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the question was more like how would settlers living on other planets schedule their time and life.</p>
<p>In earth we use 60 seconds per minute, 60 minutes per hour, 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, what ever amount of days per month, and 12 months a year.</p>
<p>Would Martian humans for example follow Earth long days and 7 days per week?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! My question was referring on how we would count time, if there was e.g. a settlement. While thinking about it further, and having a classical clock with 360° in mind - would we stretch/condense hours to fit a new amount of time into the 360° to keep with habits, or take sleeping patterns into account and adjust to earth time basically, matching multiple planet days into earth 24 hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People could possibly design a new schedule.  </p>
<p>But if any one seriously proposed redefining the second, I strongly suspect all programmers will make everything go all Skynet. Assuming the computers aren't fast enough going Skynet first.</p>
<p>Now, while seconds are likely physics and computer programming, I suspect higher level time is more of a political / social question.  My  suspicion is that if we had enough people on Mars such that politics are a thing, and that day/night cycles are important, maybe they might have mars-day which is 24:40(?).  Your Jupiter moon colony might not look outside much though and might remain on earth-day schedule.</p>
<p>Hours and minutes are likely too fixed in the mind to change without a serious reason. And if French Revolutionary time didn't make it, well... </p></div>		</li>
