			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question for you! I was born with TWO lazy eyes but it’s somewhat minor and over time I learned to pull them back when they wandered. I went to a specialist for it eight years ago and she thought it was crazy that I could pull them back. I don’t know if that’s the norm or not but I remember she was shocked. This left me thinking it wasn’t a big deal and my eyes would be fine as I aged. </p>
<p>Last month I went back to the same specialist and she said the angles have gotten way worse. Is this common for a lazy eye? Should I expect it to get more lazy as I age? I really, REALLY don’t want to have the corrective surgery but if they’re just going to continue getting more lazy to a point that I can’t control them then I need to just get them fixed while I have the chance. </p>
<p>I did have an unsuccessful surgery to repair my eyes when I was three or four so I’m wondering if that has something to do with it too?</p></div>		</li>
