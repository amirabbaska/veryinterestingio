			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah this isn't the case for 99.99% of the shit you are thinking about when you think of &quot;fully charged devices&quot;.</p>
<p>We aren't talking about any laptops/modern cellphones/anything really I could think off the top of my head.....</p>
<p>I guess actual battery chargers I have heard that shit lol like a charger for a drill.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry but it's quite hard to hear, I can in fact hear it quite clearly on all those devices you mentioned. It's getting less clear while I'm getting older, but I still need most things unplugged at night or I won't sleep. </p>
<p>It's mostly audible at night though, when there isn't much background noise. And not every single charger seems to do it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, its a thing. I was quite used to hearing &quot;the tv&quot; when its on back before flat screen tvs.. I dont know what it was that i heard but since the only thing i know about the old tube TVs is that electrons are &quot;thrown&quot; at the tv, im assuming i heard the overwhelming frequency of thousands of electrons hitting a glass screen covered in powder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You heard a mixture of the flyback transformer and the horizontal deflection coils.</p>
<p>The picture is written line for line, using 15625 (50Hz PAL) or 15750 (60 Hz) lines per second. The electron beam is moved across the screen using powerful coils around the neck of the picture tube. Since the electrons get quite fast (actually near 1/3 of the speed of light) you need a strong magnetic field to do that. You used to hear those coils.</p>
<p>The current using to drive this coils (actually, the energy which is stored into the coils after you moved from left to right which you have to remove to get back to start, that's why it's called &quot;flyback&quot;) is also used to drive a transformer which creates the high voltage for the picture tube. You heard that transformer, too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always. Some devices are noisier than others. There's also sometimes coil whine coming from computers as well. It's a usually benign but annoying production fault. </p></div>		</li>
