			<div class="markdown"><p>The U(1) symmetry for electromagnetism is not known to break at any energy; it appears to hold all the way down to absolute zero.</p>
<p>My understanding is that electricity and magnetism individually are not exactly unified the same way electromagnetism and the weak interaction are.  Electromagnetism isn't something distinguished from &quot;electricity and magnetism&quot; the way that electromagnetism and the weak force are distinguished from the electroweak force.  The electroweak force isn't just &quot;electromagnetism and the weak interaction;&quot; it has notably different properties above the unification scale.  Electromagnetism however is no different from electricity and magnetism; rather, they are just two manifestations of the same thing.  They are tied together for relativistic reasons; you can't have electricity without magnetism and vice versa.  This is because something like a static electric field for one observer may appear to be both an electric field and a magnetic field for another observer moving at a different velocity.  Both are needed to describe either one or the other for all valid reference frames.  So it's kind of a different thing.</p>
<p>Hope that clarifies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To add to this, it's not just electromagnetism that exhibits this behavior. Gravity also shows a similar (but due to the effects of general relativity, more complicated) phenomenon, known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitoelectromagnetism" target="_blank">gravitomagnetism or more simply frame-dragging</a> which has been confirmed by experiment only recently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing you can think about is the non-relativistic limit of electromagnetism. It's a little subtle, because there are two valid limits you can take, which depend on whether electrostatic or magnetostatic fields dominate, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_electromagnetism" target="_blank">here</a> and especially the equations at the bottom credited to Le Bellac and Levy-Leblond. You can't completely disentangle the electric and magnetic fields, since going to a moving frame still mixes the fields up a little, but some of the symmetry of the full relativistic equations is broken down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding from E/M classes is that magnetism arises basically from relativistic transformations of an electric field; that is, it is &quot;electricity in a non-static reference frame.&quot; Net E/M forces felt by charged objects are the same in all reference frames, but the individual electric and magnetic forces can vary depending on your motion. Hence, I don't think there's any way to disentangle electricity and magnetism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this &quot;breaking of symmetry&quot; a continuous or a discrete thing? What I mean is: is there an energy where &quot;above that energy the symmetry is respected, below that it is not&quot;, or is it more &quot;above this energy, describing things using the unbroken symmetry is close enough&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The presence or absence of symmetry is a discrete thing; either the symmetry holds, or it doesn't.</p>
<p>The transition between them is a phase transition, just like melting or boiling of matter. However there are different classes of phase transitions, depending on what quantities are discontinuous at the transition. A &quot;first-order&quot; phase transition, like boiling or melting, has a discontinuous entropy across the boundary. These transitions come with an associate latent heat.</p>
<p>There are also continuous phase transitions, like the transition between a paramagnet and a ferromagnet at the Curie temperature. These transitions don't have a discontinuous jump in entropy, so there's no latent heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Melting&quot; does not have to be a first-order phase transition. In fact, my favourite example of a second-order phase transition is melting of butter: as it heats up, it gets softer and softer until it becomes liquid; there is no sharp transition between the solid and liquid state.  (It is my favourite because it is much easier to visualize than most other &quot;textbook examples&quot;, such as the ones you gave.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a heads up, the electroweak symmetry group is SU(2)xU(1), which is important because the U(1) subgroup that survives (EM) is not a subgroup of that SU(2), nor is it the U(1) of SU(2)xU(1), but is generated by a linear combination of the generators of the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks -- I kinda didn't want to include the xU(1) part because of this fact ... trying to keep my explanation as simple as possible.  But you are of course 100% correct!  I'll edit my post to bring it back in line.  Cheers!</p></div>		</li>
