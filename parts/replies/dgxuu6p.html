If you have the sender and receiver adress on the postcard you can put multiple postcards in a mail sack.
They are then transported to som sorting office and  a enormous amount of card can be transported in a single lorry to another sorting office in another city. The post cars are then sorted and distributed to the receivers.</p>
<p>That is quite similar how it is done in computer network. The truck would be the optical fiber cable and the sorting office is a network router. But the travel time will be fractions of a second instead of hours/days A fundamental principle in packet switching networks like the internet is is that you share the infrastructure. But the packet have the sender and receiver adress and will be deliverer trough the network to the recover like a post card.
So sharing the fiber is like sharing a post truck.</p>
<p>In a fiber you can use multiple colors of light to send multiple signals at the same time. They will not interact with each other and you can split them into the different color like you can do in a Prism with sunlight. Think of radio signals where the you can select station by frequency. Light and radio wave are both electromagnetic waves and color of light is a difference in frequency like radio.</p>
<p>The different colors are from treated like if there were on indifferent fibers ( in most cases) and i a way to reduce cost when it is cheaper to use multiple colors then to lay down another fiber.</p>
<p>The signaling is done by turning the light on and off and there is ways to determine how you signal a message so you know where a packet start and stops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One cable normally has multiple fibers inside. Each fiber, which is roughly the size of a human hair, is capable of transmitting massive amounts of data. </p>
<p>How many fibers are in a cable? It all depends - a company called Prysmian recently came out with a cable that is 23mm in diameter (0.9 inches) that has 1728 fibers inside. Each fiber is 200um in diameter (0.0078 inches). </p>
<p>Cost and need is always figured in when running fiber - so a cable may have 8, 16, 64 or whatever number a company costed out and was comfortable spending to meet their need. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the anti-explanation. Unlike analog telecommunications from 50 years ago, a single wire or optical cable would be grossly underused if it was only carrying one conversation or one user's data (which is what your explanation implies). The main answer to OPs question is packetization of data, and transfer of a lot of packets from different users very quickly through the same cable.</p></div>		</li>
