<p>But that rule only holds if the animal is short, so its eyes aren't too high off the ground, Sprague says.
And while a small pet cat has vertical slits, Sprague says, &quot;the larger predators, like lions and tigers, have round pupils.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tigers are mostly ambush predators I believe, but because they are high enough off the ground the vertical slit is perhaps less useful.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the [Pallas cat], which is about the size of a domestic cat and is also an ambush hunter, has round pupils. I wonder if that has something to do with the environment they live in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jaguars and Leopards are as well, in fact IIRC leopards climb on top of trees and lay in wait for prey to lurk aside trees for shade, this is when they pounce upon them, i believe jaguars do this as well, </p>
<p>But for anyone wondering, cats are quite a distant relative to the wild cats, a dog is more closely related to wolf than a cat to a lion</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct. In fact, the species <em>Canis lupus</em> includes wolves, dingoes and domestic dogs. They aren't just &quot;closely related&quot; to wolves -- they are the same species. (The subspecies for domesticated dogs is <em>Canis lupus familiaris.</em>)</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about to those wild cats they use to breed savannahs and bengals and stuff?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Environment would make sense.  As I understand it, most large cats are nocturnal hunters or hunt in regions with a mix of sun and shade, whereas house cats are generally derived from desert cats which hunted reptiles and rodents in full-sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it is actually the opposite (there are a few other posts explaining this). Slit pupils allow for greater contraction of the pupil area, which allows an animal to see much better in a wide range of light (from dark to very bright). </p>
<p>The largest cats, which have round pupils, hunt during the day (tigers, lions, cheetahs, leopards), while house cats and small wild cats (African cats, sand cats, servals) have slitted pupils. Small cats tend to hunt rodents, rather than large game, and rodents are almost always nocturnal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nearly all desert predators hunt in the night or in the dawn/dusk, nothing is out during the day as it is too hot. Feral domestic cats mostly hunt at night/dusk too. I think slit pupils might be most useful for the dawn/dusk type of hunting which domestic cats might do more than other species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also entirely possible the Pallas cat would be more successful of a hunter with slit pupils, and they have enough success with round ones to proliferate. Evolution doesn't make things perfect, it just makes them work.</p>
<p>It's very interesting though, I would love to find out if there is an advantage to the round one for them. I'm sure a pupil capable if changing shape like a slit pupil takes more resources to create and maintain than a round one, so if it doesn't make a big enough difference it isn't worth it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From the article: If you have a vertical slit, you're very likely to be an ambush predator, says Banks. </p>

<p>I love how the article is phrased as if some of it's readers are ambush predators.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that the slit pupils were better suited for sensing lateral movement of their prey. And this is why prey have evolved to stand still when they think a predator is watching them. Is there no truth to that? </p></div>		</li>
