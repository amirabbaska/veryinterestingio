			<div class="markdown"><p>There's two things going on.  One, the executions are controversial, so drug companies and doctors won't assist them.  Two, as a society, we want the executions to be soft and undisturbing to the public.  We inject someone and they &quot;go to sleep&quot;.  It's all very palatable, isn't it.  If we as a country want to kill people, then we shouldn't be squeamish about it. Bring back public hangings in the town square.  If you can't stomach that, then maybe we shouldn't be doing it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>See:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May 2, 2006. Ohio. Joseph L. Clark. Lethal Injection. It took 22 minutes for the execution technicians to find a vein suitable for insertion of the catheter. But three or four minutes thereafter, as the vein collapsed and Clark’s arm began to swell, he raised his head off the gurney and said five times, “It don’t work. It don’t work.” The curtains surrounding the gurney were then closed while the technicians worked for 30 minutes to find another vein. Media witnesses later reported that they heard “moaning, crying out and guttural noises.”[57] Finally, death was pronounced almost 90 minutes after the execution began. A spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Corrections told reporters that the execution team included paramedics, but not a physician or a nurse.[58]</p>

<p>And there's plenty more examples:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point of executing someone isn't for revenge, retribution or to set an example. It's to remove a person from society that has no hope of rehabilitation either incarcerated or not and will only cause misery through existing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't that the purpose of prison? To remove dangerous individuals from society. What's the difference between life in prison and execution at that point? Perhaps the point of prison <em>should</em> be rehabilitation but the fact of the matter is that in the majority of the US, it is merely a form of punishment and their removal from society. </p>
<p>Executing someone is in a way a form of revenge for victims/ family or friends of victims. A widely cited reason <em>for</em> executions is to give conciliation to those affected as well as giving closure to them that said inmate will never have a chance of getting out. But altogether executions could be seen as a failure by society to both justly and reliably punish and imprison offenders, as well as a huge failure in providing treatment for victims.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All it takes is one bad interaction and it's deemed &quot;inhumane&quot;, so if someone was allergic to it but didn't know...</p>

There's an interesting little documentary that I think you can still find on YouTube in which former UK politician Michael Portillo investigates more humane ways of administering death to those sentenced that way.<br />
Ed: It's a <em>Horizon</em> episode called &quot;How to kill a human being&quot;, the full ep is on dailymotion.</p></div>		</li>
