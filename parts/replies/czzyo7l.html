			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert but I find that there's potentially flaws in your statement.
Firstly 0.5+ 0.5 don't add up to 1.5
Secondly, the whole idea of relativity is that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. There can be no observable relative displacement of an object faster than light can displace itself from the original frame of reference.</p>
<p>The loaf of bread explanation doesn't really work here, since there is clearly something that must be explained more than by adding up speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but the loaf of bread is a great explanation given that this is ELI5.</p>
<p>That said, what's going on behind the scenes is that the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space" target="_blank">actual space between points itself is expanding</a>. It's not so much that the planets are travelling apart, its that the space between them is growing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting... Doesn't our current theory of universe expansion involve redshift though? Redshift means that objects actually have velocity away from us. Does an increase in metric distance have the same effect on light wavelength as increasing metric distance?</p></div>		</li>
