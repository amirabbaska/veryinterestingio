			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Don't misinterpret the message Pablo Escobars death sent. It wasn't cocaine is bad. It's you better keep quiet and only kill other drug dealers or we'll send delta after your ass. That way it's more American. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No just a sarcastic ass. I think this is why Pablo was so heavily targeted while their competitors like the Cali weren't given nearly as much attention. Pablo and his Medellin cartel were super brutal and it only made all the others more so. He inflicted political killings, killed tons of cops, and terrorist bombings. Totally glad he's dead. My point is actually that if he had just been smuggling coke we definitely wouldn't have put the same resources into stopping him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the show that’s true. I’ve never looked into it far enough to tell if that’s fully accurate. I know that they killed a shitload of people. They basically bankrupted a local government who couldn’t afford to do autopsies on all the dead bodies they disposed of there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colombian here. They might not have been as violent but he they were plenty violent.</p>
<p>Unlike Pablo, they didn't use it against the government out of petty revenge or as random but they definitely went around killing plenty of possible competition and even scorned lovers.</p>
<p>Lots of innocents died in the process and their mixing with guerrillas didn't make it any better. Also, they promoted Los Pepes (as many others did) and since the US was so afraid of communism, they put a Target on themselves while they thought the government was condoning their actions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Cali cartel was corrupting the government to the point of turning it into a narco state, from the top down (ie. Silently)... The US would lose its influence if this were to happen.</p>
<p>So its more like dont kill people besides drug dealers and dont fuck with the power structure/politicians, to a point, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, that does sound like a good way to go about it. People bitch and bitch about the &quot;drug war&quot; and how pointless and stupid it is, so wouldn't just taking out the people that commit and encourage other, more heinous crimes be a good policy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take it one step further.</p>
<p>How about we let drug providers who are otherwise nonviolent keep operating, and shut the violent thieves down. Then you could just treat the good ones like any other business, and even tax them. </p>
<p>I call this innovative approach &quot;legalizing drugs.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Bolivia we don’t have big cartels either BUT drug production is in an all time high. I think  this particular situation is caused by the involvement of our government in the whole value chain of drug production. Almost all politicians (from all parties) take bribes and/or take donations from narcos and some of them even help taking the drugs out of the country. I think the silver lining is that the government involvement accidentally creates a form of regulation and there are some implicit rules placed in order to make the whole system sustainable (no cartel wars in the cities, pretend we are fighting cartels, don’t get too big or make get too noisy, stay in the designated areas for drug production, etc.). It’s rather an interesting (albeit sad) phenomenon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard recently that Peru is exporting cocaine now at a very fast rate, maybe not big cartels behind it like Columbia and Mexico, but I remember my dad telling me about a drug lord in Peru, where he grew up, and when he was arrested he offered to pay off the national debt to be let go. His name was, &quot;crazyfly&quot; or something translating close to that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think Peru and Colombia are the biggest exporters of cocaine in the world, one year Peru is number one, and the next, Colombia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand and what I heard when I was in Colombia, you don't cross the Panama/Colombian border on foot.  It is still considered extremely dangerous.  There are a lot of people who make a living running sailboats/ferries from Colombia to Panama, so it might just be myth to push you into taking a boat instead of going by road, but I never actually met someone who was traveling that crossed the border on foot/roads.</p>
<p>Edit:  Not drug related.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dari%C3%A9n_Gap" target="_blank">Interesting swampland/dense jungle</a> instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crossing the Colombian/ Panamanian boarder by land <em>is</em> extremely difficult and dangerous, but not really because of narcos. That area, called the Darien Gap, is some if the densest, most inhospitable jungle on earth. You haven't heard of anyone crossing on roads because there aren't any roads. It's too difficult and expensive to build them there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adventurous people and immigrants can and do walk across right now and it's not construction difficulty stopping this project.  It's amazing that we can drive from tip of North America to tip of South America on Pan-American highway and 60 miles of Darien Gap is the only gap on this 11,000 mile route.</p>
<p>The reasons are more geopolitical than logistical.  Colombia have their reasons, Panama have their reasons, and influential foreign governments like USA have their reasons.  This was an unstable region for a very long time.  Maybe things will change as the region develops and stabilizes.  </p></div>		</li>

Like trying to build a road on top of a swamp. They would have to build over the treeline and create a skyway overtop of it. </p></div>		</li>
