			<div class="markdown"><p>It's clear to me at least that my body reacts pretty much the same in a dream as in an equivalent real life scenario. </p>
<p>I once had a pretty uncomfortable scenario where I fell madly in love in a dream and after I woke up the feeling stayed with me for several days. It was weird because I have kids and a woman that I love, so feeling hopelessly in love with someone else made it awkward. Obviously I knew on a conscious level it was a dream and completely made up, but my emotions wouldn't be swayed by that logic for a weirdly long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I already found him cute, but nothing overwhelming. Then I had a dream about him, nothing sexual, just that type of happiness that comes from dating in the first stages of falling in love. Being silly, smiling to each other a lot, looking at each other often, holding hands and you feel your heart skip.</p>
<p>When I woke up it went from &quot;u cute&quot; to a pretty crazy crush. It's been three months, still feel that way about him (it's manageable though and it just makes me silly-happy, no delusions). </p></div>		</li>

<p>We know for a fact that brain activity never stops while sleeping. Heck in most of our sleep cycle brain activity is even higher then when we are awake. </p>
<p>Brain activity is by definition &quot;thinking&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Eh, I dunno about that. Brain activity is &quot;processing&quot;, &quot;thinking&quot; i'd say is more akin to consciousness. Conscious manipulation of information. A little semantic, but more in line with popular conception I think.</p>
<p>My answer would be general anesthesia. Except in rare cases, the lights just <em>pop</em> go out and then <em>pop</em> back on with no thoughts in between, unconscious (ie dreams) or conscious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stage 4 - &quot;Deep Sleep&quot;  is as close as it gets. In this stage there aren't many &quot;thoughts&quot;, mostly just delta waves. Your brain activity never stops, but you aren't really conscious.</p>
<p>We mostly - but not completely - dream during REM sleep.</p></div>		</li>
