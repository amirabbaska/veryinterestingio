			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly, there's actually no lower limit to how deep the wetsuit can go. At least 1700m. I chalk that one up to sci-fi future tech though. Probably a combination wetsuit/spacesuit designed to convert any gas atmosphere into breathable air, somehow allow you to survive any amount of liquid/gas pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the only limiting factor is carrying enough O2 to make it to the depth you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also believe the amount of consumed oxygen goes up the deeper you are, although that can be solidly countered with the rebreather</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I highly doubt the wetsuit can withstand that much pressure canonically though, most likely it's something brushed off for gameplay purposes.</p>
<p>The reason I believe that is so is because of their technology is that advanced, it should stand to reason that the Seamoth and the Cyclops should be able to withstand more pressure than a bloody wetsuit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They probably are, but remember; the PDA is damaged and booted in emergency mode which means it scans the environment and uses available resources for building. It probably doesnâ€™t use the strongest stuff possible to build the vehicles. The Aurora took a shot from a surface to air laser, that is seen obliterating the sunbeam without any wreckage, and only crashed because it fell out of orbit due to some of the thrusters being hit, and not destroyed. Its not too crazy to imagine that Altera uses some pretty beefy stuff to build those suits, which was not built on the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, several sci-fi series I read recently involve some sort of pressurized wetsuit-type thingy that's relatively body-hugging for a spacesuit that would theoretically allow you to survive in a vacuum, so the opposite should work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily - body-hugging spacesuits are workable because they can still be pressurized, or at least could probably be made tight enough that your body doesn't undergo decompression.</p>
<p>The reverse is not so easy - if you take that same nonrigid suit underwater, you'll be crushed because it's not able to push the water away from you.</p>
<p>There's really no way of keeping a low internal pressure in a high pressure environment aside from having a rigid structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>diving to 300m with a wetsuit is reasonable.  doing that without heliox breathing gas and no decompression isn't particularly reasonable.  600m is the limit of commercial saturation diving, but that is 61 atm so 61x higher pressure than surface pressure and our bodies can otherwise handle it fine.   at higher pressures it looks like humans might actually start suffering issues with tissue damage simply due to the pressure.  mostly though the problem with deeper depths isn't that you're being &quot;crushed&quot; by the pressure -- you're mostly incompressible water.  the problem is the viscosity of the gas that you're breathing, the narcosis and other cognitive issues and the need to decompress.</p>
<p>a <a href="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/3-newtsuit-rescue-diver-alexis-rosenfeld.jpg" target="_blank">newtsuit</a> fixes that problem by keeping the diver at 1 atmosphere internally.  not so much to avoid the pressure on the body, but to avoid the pressure on the gas you are breathing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lighting inside the water is there to help with gameplay. There is a &quot;Filmic&quot; color grading option in the settings menu that makes lighting underwater more realistic. It gets extremely scary though, as you can't see anything without artificial lighting if you get around 100m deep, even at daytime.</p></div>		</li>
