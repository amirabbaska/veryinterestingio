<p>People tend to like what is familiar.</p>

<p>My father raised me to eat anything and everything.  If I didn't like what was on my plate, he wouldn't give me anything else.  I stopped resisting around age 5 and just ate whatever was given to me.</p>
<p>My wife, on the other hand, was the younger sibling of a particularly challenging girl.  Her mother raised her almost exclusively on Kraft Mac 'n' Cheese and super bland chicken dishes.</p>
<p>When the two of us met, guess who the picky eater was?</p></div>		</li>
