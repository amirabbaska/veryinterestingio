			<div class="markdown"><p>As a fluent French and English speaker, let me just adjust that saying 45 instead of 40 is just as &quot;harder&quot; in French than in English; you just say &quot;forty&quot; then add &quot;five&quot; to get &quot;forty five&quot;: <em>quarante</em> (40) + <em>cinq</em>(5) = <em>quarante cinq</em> (45).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We made real-life pro bending at my college. I mean, it was just glorified dodgeball with mini footballs, frisbees, and dodgeballs for the three forms of bending, but it was fun as hell.</p>
<p>Also, setup took like 2 minutes per game.</p></div>		</li>
