			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the question.  Regarding the large data sets, there are several ongoing  national and internation al efforts to standardize ocean data and to make these data easily accessed and shared.   At the international level there is the Global Ocean Observing System, of which the U.S. component is the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).  Through IOOS (ioos.noaa.gov), you can access a catalog of many of the coastal data collection programs around the U.S.   These include data from wave buoys (both NOAA and Army Corps/Coastal Data Information Program), surface currents from the High Frequency Radar, physical and bio-chemical data from the glider profiles, water quality data, and temperature, salinity and oxygen from mooring data.   The ipocoa.org website has a catalog of many of the ocean acidification monitoring efforts going on in the U.S. West Coast.  In the deeper ocean, ARGO is one of the larger data collection programs (argo.ucsd.edu).   ARGO is comprised of drifter  buoys that transmit both in real-time and delayed mode the temperature and salinity of the upper 2000 m of the ocean.  Another Program with real-time data is the Global Drifter Program (wwww.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/dac/index.php). Oceansites.org is a worldwide system of long-term reference stations measuring dozens of variable and measuring the full depth of the ocean. The U.S. Federal archive contains many of the above data sets( nodc.noaa.gov). All of these data are dependent upon high quality, sustained observations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully the AMA guest points you in some interesting directions. In the meantime, you can check out NOAA's open-access data at <a href="https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/</a>. There is <em>a lot</em> of data freely available from the US government if you know where to look. Sometimes it requires creating an account and submitting a request, but <em>most</em> data collected by US agencies is made available to the public.</p></div>		</li>
