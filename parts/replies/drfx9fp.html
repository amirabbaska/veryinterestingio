			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example of this is being convinced your thoughts were leaking out of your ears, and everyone can hear what you are thinking.  You then realize absolutely nothing is private anymore, and have a really bad thought thinking what if people thought you were thinking it, but because of that now you ARE thinking it, and everyone knows it now.</p>
<p>The good news is, after this night, you will never do 5 hits of acid at once ever again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LSD is a very powerful psychoactive drug. You know how a sudden serious moment when you've been drinking or smoking weed will sort of snap your focus back to reality? It doesn't sober you up, but you can sort of 'get it together' for a short while. </p>
<p>LSD is too strong for that. Your brain might send an adrenaline shot to try and snap you out of something that's incredibly intense and disturbing but it will not work, and can even make the experience more intense. </p>
<p>Basically, you might want to be done with your trip, but your trip is likely not yet done with you. You're a bit of a captive audience, and that loss of control can be quite terrifying. Some people can calm themselves within the trip kind of like a nightmare you can't wake up from, but that you can tell yourself is a dream while still dreaming. It's hard to explain, but standing on the edge of consciousness and...sanity, and being able to look down is a deeply intense experience that can be truly terrifying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just an expierience I had...</p>
<p>Took some in Chicago and went to the aquarium. I couldn't look directly into the tanks because I would feel like I was being sucked in. So I left. Me and my girl walked around the city ALL DAY. We made sure to eat and drink before taking it at 10am so we were fine throughout the day. You have no appetite at all through the trip. Just drink lots of water. Basically I felt that the beginning of the trip was your body trying to figure the chemicals out, at least that's how I felt. For the first 3 hours we were laying in bed in just underwear in a perfectly white room watching everything change shapes. After that your pretty much normal with this sense of happiness and sometimes you would see shit change randomly out of nowhere and realise &quot;oh fuck.&quot; Like you could b walking and see a lamppost just sink into the ground, or a normal fountain just be the most mesmerising thing on the planet. What was really awesome was sitting in the park watching everyone walk around with their families having a great time and I would have a great time just watching them. In my opinion LSD is an amazing thing but DEFINITELY is something to be careful with. It was really weird because I felt I couldn't talk to anyone besides my partner who took it with me. We both feel more connected after the experience together.</p></div>		</li>
