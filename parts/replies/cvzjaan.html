			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that is what if you actually want to type literally *bold*.</p>
<p>It's way to much typing. I would hate to have to start formatting my texts correctly. What I see on my screen text box is what should be received.</p>
<p>Imagine all of the &quot;autocorrect&quot; type shenanigans that are opened up by auto-formatting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm not understanding your point properly, but Hangouts formatting worked by, for instance, typing &quot;We <em>need</em> to do this&quot;  and having &quot;need&quot;  bolded. You wouldn't have to actually type bold if thats what you were implying </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but you would have to intuitively cue people that adding symbols may affect their text.  Imagine a scenario where you start a text with an emoticon that uses a special symbol and somewhere in your text you use the same symbol. Now you accidentally wrapped your whole text in italics or something.</p>
<p>You have to train people to escape characters now, and it doesn't make sense to train someone that they need to add a slash and asterisk to just use an asterisk.</p></div>		</li>
