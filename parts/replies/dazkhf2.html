			<div class="markdown"><p>I am aware that the symptoms I experience while driving are from the anxiety, so most times I can control it. It usually happens at night when there is lots of bright lights all around. I usually just roll down the windows and get fresh air and tell myself it will pass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just described my anxiety to a T. You mention getting light headed and dizzy. Do you ever have the problem where you space out for 5-10 seconds, vision goes blurry and you feel yourself drifting off? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most important thing you can do with an anxiety episode is accept it is there. Anxiety is a full on fight or flight episode but with no threat to focus on. Your body then pinpoints it on to something. My friend couldn't eat an apple for the best part of 2 years as he had a panic attack whilst eating one.</p>
<p>To help combat the anxiety acceptance of the feeling and situation is key. If you do not accept it your are feeding the cycle of adrenaline and so that off feeling of anxiety will be kept for longer. The next thing you can do is breathe deeply and slowly. 6 seconds in and 6 seconds out. This should activate the parasympathetic nervous system which will calm you down. But it takes time (more than a minute) and when you're amidst an anxiety episode a minute is a long time and sometimes it isn't possible to calm down. But the first step is to try and to know that this won't last forever.</p>
<p>Remember most of your bodily reactions are conditionings. Smell bacon cooking = stomach rumbling. It is far harder to break a learned pattern than to stop the association in the first place. It can be done but it takes a long time for the body to change how it reacts to stimuli. This means it will take time so, again, you have to accept the situation initially.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long answer but I went through a long period of anxiety and this is what I learned. I feel understanding what's going in helps to break up the emotion of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get them from time to time and talked to my therapist about it. For me, the biggest change was that my voice sounded completely different and I felt more like a puppet master controlling my body than actually inside of it.  </p>
<p>Apparently these are dissociative episodes and its basically your minds last defense to intense stress.  Its basically allowing you to continue to function as the situation isnt happening to you directly.  The puppet is the one in the situation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have the same issues. My throats would start to feel like it was closing and then I would start to cry. It's very embarrassing at work or school and there's no way to stop it. I didn't get help until I was an adult and now I see the same thing in my oldest daughter. I'm glad I know what it is and that I can help cause my parents didn't understand. </p></div>		</li>
