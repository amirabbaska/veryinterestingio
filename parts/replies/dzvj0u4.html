			<div class="markdown"><p>The portal vein in the liver is fairly easy to access for an islet infusion and wedging the cells in there gives them <em>fairly good</em> access to the blood stream so they can make glucose/insulin transactions. </p>
<p>People have known for a while that it's maybe not the absolute best place to put the transplanted cells, but it's at least good enough until we can learn more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another practical issue is that the pancreas itself is not an easy organ to work with surgically. It has an almost crumbly texture and is highly vascular, so suturing it is difficult and the risk of bleeding is high. Not to mention the risk of causing acute pancreatitis, which can be fatal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, taking insulin isn't some routine daily injection - it varies hour-by-hour according to what you eat, what exercise you do, whether you have your period, whether the weather is hot, etc etc.... it's a constant management exercise. It's work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, insulin doesn't increase your risk of cancer or have a bunch of side-effects. </p>
<p>Honestly I'm taking insulin and I think I'd rather stick with it than take immunosuppressants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Strictly speaking, insulin barely qualifies as a <em>medication</em>, because it's something your body evolved to require. Taking insulin injections doesn't actually change your physiology in any way. Compare that to taking a powerful drug that shuts down one of the most complicated systems in your body,  and it's an obvious and easy decision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with exogenous insulin is that’s it’s a treatment and not a cure. If you have your blood sugar levels in control, then you are fine. If you let them spike and drop, long term effects will kill you before you die of old age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the patient.  Surgery carries its risks and obviously you need a matched donor.  Immunosuppression can be nasty—increased risk of cancer, immunodeficiency, GI side effects, tremors (30-50% of patients), insomnia.  If I had diabetes and it was “stable” I wouldn’t opt for the transplant.  If diabetes had caused me to need a kidney transplant and I was offered a Kidney-Panc, though, I’d take it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. Though even in a healthy diabetic, we can't always expect the blood sugar levels of a nondiabetic. So nerve and blood vessel damage is still being done despite insulin treatment. It's not like a diabetic just shoots themselves up and doesn't worry about anything. It's a constant struggle. </p>
<p>Being on immunosuppressants obviously has its own issues. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re absolutely right, spikes and drops of blood sugar levels over time can have major repercussions over a long time, and that leads to complications down the road. Pumps help, but they are just a better treatment but they aren’t a cure. Beta cell replacement is a cure and there are a lot of companies racing for the cure, most of them are either xeno oriented or stem cell oriented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Due to rejection of the islet transplant, unfortunately it is temporary; typically the insulin independence lasts 3-5 years post-infusion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do consider many of them &quot;cured&quot; from a medical management standpoint as far as diabetes goes.  Though they do still need transplant precautions as far as I know.</p>
<p>Ive, generally, seen this with patients whos diabetes drove them to kidney failure.  Who then get a kidney transplant and the matching pancreas cells from that same donor though... so its possible they wouldnt need the transplant precautions if they only got the pancreas cells.</p></div>		</li>
