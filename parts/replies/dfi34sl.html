<p>Like, If I stood at the edge of the universe on the far left side, and you stood at the edge on the far right, we'd simultaneously be very far away from each other and also very close... i think. or would we just be close since our position is relative? </p>
<p>i've confused myself</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really, it's more that there is no edge.</p>
<p>This concept is a lot easier to understand in 2D. The surface of the earth is finite but it has no edge. If you move in one direction on the surface of the earth, you'll end up back where you started.</p>
<p>The universe is kind of the same, but in 3D. Instead of a finite surface with no boundary, it's a finite volume with no boundary. You can describe that 3D space as the ~surface~ of a four-dimensional object, in the same way that the surface of the earth is a 2D space which is the surface of a 3D object, the earth.</p>
<p>However, we humans aren't very good at picturing 4D. There is no way I'll be able to explain to you how to visualize a 4D object in a simple reddit post. If you're interested, there are videos which do a good job of explaining it, but even after watching that it's still nearly impossible to think in 4D. That's why it can be helpful to think of the universe but to stay in 3D, and one way to do that is to think of it as a finite volume with portals on the edges.</p>
<p>This is the pac-man representation of the universe. You imagine that it's a big cube, and when you get to one edge you're teleported to the other side. If you're on one side of the universe and your friend is on the other, you can see them right next to you, through the portals. In reality, there are no portals, and your friend is really right next to you. However, picturing portals is a lot easier than picturing a four-dimensional torus, so I recommend that this is how you think of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of it as how you explained, 3D space as a surface of a 4D object, analogous to the globe, but I don't see the pac-man concept as helping this idea. I think of it as trying to imagine being inside a sphere, and the &quot;edges&quot; of the sphere are connected to itself. As you said, its nearly impossible to imagine a 4D universe. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Pacman universe is a torus.  Why or how to see it is not the point. But imagine you are on a doughnut and you are moving around you will never see an edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This whole idea just trips me out. Even if #2 is correct, then what is beyond that? There must be something beyond it. There can't just be &quot;nothing&quot; because nothing is just the absence of anything. And absence is something. Even if pacman is able to infinitely loop around his universe, there is still the world around the pacman machine. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The words &quot;beyond it&quot; have no meaning. There is no such place as &quot;outside the universe&quot;. If the universe had solid walls, you could give the geographical coordinates of a point outside the universe and ask what is there, but because it's has no boundaries, any geographical coordinate you give will refer to a point inside the universe. You simply cannot define a point &quot;beyond the universe&quot;.</p>
<p>I know, it still feels weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. I think you're really just furthering my point. Maybe the way I said it didn't paint a clear perspective. But I'm pretty sure we're agreeing here.</p>
<p>My problem is that the point to which the universe extends can not be explained. You can't simply say it &quot;loops&quot; because that suggests that there is something outside of that loop. And as you have stated, there is no &quot;beyond the universe&quot;. Therefore the two ideas are contradicting.</p>
<p>I'm not arguing with you. I'm just trying to explain what I'm picturing here... which is suppose is the problem. It can't be explained... I'm glad OP asked this question because it's something I've thought about multiple times and it's interesting to talk about it with others.</p></div>		</li>
