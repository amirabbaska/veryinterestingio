			<div class="markdown"><p>Caveat:
Not all 4K TVs have a built-in digital upscaling feature.  Those that do not are often in the lower-end of the mid range product lines and below.  The TVs that do not have an upscaling feature will render the picture exactly as it is received, there are 1080p TVs that have digital upscaling built-in that will take a signal from something like a cable box and present a better, clearer picture than the same signal passing through a non-upscaled 4K TV.  Sources that send higher quality signals will look better on those 4K TVs (like a bluRay DVD, whose native quality is above 1080p but not fully 4K).</p>
<p>Another thing to look for is the HDR (High Dynamic Range).  HDR TVs attempt to correct for factors that affect image quality that are related to the medium of capture (film/camera color effects) and restore images to more &quot;lifelike&quot; qualities.</p>
<p>In extremely dumbed down terms, it widens the band of visible colors that the TV displays.  So for example, in the &quot;red&quot; spectrum a normal TV may have some number (let's just say 200 arbitrarily) of individual color tones between the two frequencies defining the boundaries of the color &quot;red&quot; in its spectrum.  On the other hand an HDR TV might have 600 individual color tones in that same boundary condition defined as &quot;red.&quot;</p>
<p>More colors available means that there is more distinction within objects that are of similar color quality.  Bright areas are especially affected by this effect, light effects on water or brightly colored clothing.  Sometimes you'll observe a &quot;blurring&quot; effect from non HDR TVs where something very bright seems like there are spots where everything is the same shade and there is no detail in them.</p>
<p>TVs with HDR and upscaling allow the TV to guess some of the undefined pixels from lower resolutions by interpolating between known color values and filling intermediate color values with colors that maybe weren't encoded in the original signal, or couldn't be rendered on a lower quality display.  </p>
<p>That's significant because even if you have more pixels, if you don't have more colors to go along with them, then large groups of pixels may have no difference in the quality of color, so the resolution IS higher, but it doesn't LOOK any greater because the visible effect on the screen appears the same.</p>

this link does a decent job of explaining HDR and why it's important.  There are a few side by side image comparisons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick note about HDR. It's part of the third format war between Samsung, LG, Visio, and Sony. The first format war was VHS vs Beta max. The second was HD DVD vs Blu Ray. The third is the 4k enhancement algorithms.</p>
<p>HDR is an internal algorithm that guesses which of the &quot;extra&quot; colors it has available to use. A side by side comparison will do you no good if the display you're looking at them on doesn't have those colors available. Instead, the camera will approximate the colors it sees in its reproduction.</p>
<p>In my opinion, HDR/dolby visual/SUHD look great in certain bright curcumstances, but make dark video look like trash, so it isn't yet worth the 300 bucks to me.</p>
<p>I agree with everything else you said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, now I didn't know that part about the third format war.</p>
<p>Very interesting.  HDR appears to be winning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what brand the TV is. In general the upscaling has gotten a lot better across the whole market though. Some brands and panels within those brands still have noticeably better algorithms and motion control which makes a huge difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this answer. Of course it depends on the upscaler in the TV. For example my Samsung has an excellent upscaler IMHO and a good 1080 source looks better on my 4K TV than on my 1080p TV when using the same source. </p></div>		</li>
