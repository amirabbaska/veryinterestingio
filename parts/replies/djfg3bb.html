<p>Your body telling you sooner rather than later that you should devote some time to finding food is a <em>bad</em> feature?  Not sure how that figures.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well... we're the overwhelmingly-dominant large animal species on this planet, so evolutionarily we must be doing ok.</p>
<p>There's a trade-off to being able to that.  A lot of it has to do with our brains.  One of the problems with having a massive brain for our size is that it's a carb/fat processing beast, and needs somewhat-constant nourishment.  Many of the early effects of starvation have to do with cognitive ability (hungry people perform worse on tests).</p>
<p>And we <em>can</em> go days without a meal and then gorge.  Not a lot of mammals choose to do that, though, and I imagine hunger isn't &quot;comfortable&quot; for those mammals that have to do it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's this really common misconception where people think evolution is trying to make perfect animals.  It isn't.  Evolution isn't trying to do anything, it's the process by which things accidentally end up good enough to survive for a while.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting that we also have better memory and alertness when we are hungry though? Makes sense when catching the next meal as we evolved.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans evolved in a feast-and-famine environment. Therefore, if there was an opportunity to feast, we should take it, because we might be in for a famine sooner rather than later. Therefore, if we could possibly stand to eat more, our body should let us know that, hey, if there's food, eating should be a priority.</p>
<p>Modern humans in the First World are always in a feast. First World people are always in a feast which is unimaginably nutritious and calorie-dense by the standards of how we lived for the vast majority of human existence, let alone the existence of our evolutionary ancestors. (Humans only developed agriculture relatively recently; the species has spent the vast majority of its time on this planet as hunter-gatherers.) So, yes, our hunger pangs are over-eager in the current environment, which has never existed before in the entire history of this planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any person essentially starves that way anyway: the lack of calories to burn will ultimately be what kills you if you don't get sick.  Just water will keep you going long enough to starve &quot;properly&quot;.</p>
<p>You wouldn't want to do this to lose weight, because your body has a strong response to starvation.  Your metabolism will drop, and when you start eating again, your body will try very hard to preserve and save up calories when it can.  It does this by giving you less &quot;energy&quot;: you feel tired, you feel like doing nothing.  It saves calories.  Plus, your body doesn't just go straight for fat.  It's hard to process compared to protein or carbohydrates once it's bodily fat, and your body will prefer to use protein: your lean body mass.  Your muscles and bone density and BRAIN SIZE will shrink in addition to your gut.  People who starve become incredibly frail, not ripped.</p>
<p>THEN, there's the digestive problems of not eating food regularly.  You can kill a person who hasn't eaten in weeks with a large hamburger.  Various organs get used to not doing much because you're not digesting anything.  They don't just start up immediately again when needed.  People in late stages of starvation need to be very carefully re-introduced to nutrition.</p>
<p>So technically, sure, that's what'd happen.  But a lot more would happen that you pretty much never want to have happen if you can help it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd always assumed that hunger was related to relatively low blood sugar level. I discovered, much to my amazement, that that was incorrect. Hunger pangs are partially independent of blood sugar. In fact, high blood sugar can lead to hunger pangs.</p>
<p>When I was having to manage blood sugar for about a year (as my diabetes was temporary), I noticed that I was hungriest when my blood sugar was pretty normal (for me at that time). Because I had a medication regimen to stick to, that often meant eating when I wasn't actually hungry.</p></div>		</li>
