			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, facial hair but our entire face (cheeks, forehead) isn't covered in hair like monkeys. and we mostly get pimples in regions not covered in hair (like cheeks and foreheads). When was the last time you got a pimple on where you hair is? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time that I get a really bad pimple on my face, it usually is in the same pore as a longer hair. The hair is not pigmented, but grossly enough, plucking the hair will unblock the pore and the icky contents will easily come out. I'm sure if I put more effort into exfoliating more often, I would get less pimples, but it doesn't happen often enough to fully bother me.</p>
<p>The life of a mechanic: I'm happy enough if I don't go to bed with oil or hydro fluid on my skin. </p></div>		</li>
