			<div class="markdown"><p>And your body can convert body tissue to energy, so it's not really that dangerous to go without food for a couple days, but your body can't just create water.</p>
<p>My guess is that's why your hunger comes in waves. Your body is like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, I've run out of easy food stores, you should probably find some more.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it, I've started breaking down some tissue.</p>
<p>Hey, I'm just about done with this far store here, you should get some food.</p>
<p>Alright, I'm moving on to lean muscle tissue that you don't seem to need, we're good for a bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>However, thirst just keeps getting worse because your body can't just create more. It starts out small, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, things are getting a little dry; I'll slow down the pee system, but it's probably too late for that anyway. Hopefully we don't get an infection.</p>
<p>Hey, things are getting pretty bad. I'm going to have to reduce saliva and sweat production to keep vital things running. You should really get some water soon.</p>
<p>Things are serious. GET WATER NOW! I'm starting to shut down some pretty important things now, so you'd better get water soon or we may not be able to recover.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ikr? I read here in Reddit that a sitter fat person went a year without eating (under supervision of a doctor, of course), but he needed a poop transplant to restore the beneficial bacteria that died because he wasn't digesting food anymore.</p>
<p>Bodies are crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, yeah. I've been getting into fitness and bulk/cut cycles, so I've been reading a bit about how the body prioritizes energy sources. It's pretty crazy, but you can discourage specific tissue loss by using it during a cut. It's like the body has a revolving list of unimportant tissue that gets updated when you use specific tissues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple more things to consider is that many natural foods already contain water and that salt is a desiccant. A person who's living off of fresh mushrooms and berries and roots and such is going to need to drink a lot less water than someone who eats beef jerky or chips.</p></div>		</li>
