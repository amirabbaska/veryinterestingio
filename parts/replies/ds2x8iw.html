			<div class="markdown"><p>Thatâ€™s pretty interesting. So how does the number of mitochondria increase? Are there more resources made available to the cell to make more mitochondria, or are they somehow made to reproduce more? Also, how does an increase of mitochondria affect the efficiency of the cell? Is it purely beneficial or does it waste cell resources to have more mitochondria if they are not needed?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This process is called <em>mitochondrial biogenesis</em>.  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3883043/" target="_blank">You can read more about the mechanisms here.</a></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Mitochondria are, at a basic level, bacteria that have been incorporated into our cells, similar to how chloroplasts are incorporated into plant cells.  They divide in a process very highly similar to how bacteria normally divide.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, how does an increase of mitochondria affect the efficiency of the cell?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More mitochondria = greater capacity to generate ATP from the usual substrates.  The <em>efficiency</em> of the cell doesn't increase, per se, as there is no increase in the ratio of substrates taken in to ATP generated.  However <em>capacity</em> increases.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it purely beneficial or does it waste cell resources to have more mitochondria if they are not needed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does not waste cell resources to have extra mitochondria, though it <em>does</em> take resources to <em>create</em> more mitochondria.  Mitochondria can decay and breakdown over time.  If there is no stimulus to create more mitochondria, the number of mitochondria in the cell will decrease over time because of this.  </p></div>		</li>
