<p>Do German cops seem to be under the same constant scrutiny of racism and overuse of force like ours do?</p>
<p>Edit: I'm confused why this is downvoted. It's a legitimate question. </p>
<p>Edit #2: from negative votes to highest votes in my profile. Holy crap. </p>
<p>Edit #3: and final. After reading some of the responses. It's not that I believe abuse of power / racism is non-existant, but I know several friends and family that work in larger and smaller police / sheriff's depts. And I will say that there is certainly some yellow journalism at play in our media. Does it exist? Yes. Is it a problem? Sure. Is it rampant? Negative. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A german cop did  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/AskLEO/comments/2dgwkp/what_makes_american_police_use_deadly_force_much/cjpgcbe/?context=3" target="_blank">a great piece on this awhile back</a>. </p>
<p>It basically comes down to the wild disparities that cops encounter in <strong>culture surrounding guns, personal rights, and the celebration of vigilante justice</strong> when comparing the USA to countries like Germany. </p>
<p>Guns are not the cause of the issue, but rather exacerbate the problem. Cops go out everyday with a legitimate fear that they will be shot as many citizens, cops included, have an inherent distrust in their government and feel as if the laws are being unfairly applied to them.
The cop in the aformentioned post put it well</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another reason for that is the difference in prison sentences. If I was a drug dealer in the US and I had 20 pounds of coke in my trunk when a cop stops me for a broken taillight, I'd seriously calculate my chances of killing him and getting away. There is simply no reason for me to do that in Germany. The prison sentences are laughable here. It's just not worth it. If they arrest me with the coke here, I do two, maybe three years. If I kill a cop, I get 15 years minimum. It's just not worth it. And while I, just as many other officers in Germany, get frustrated with the lax prison sentences, I do realize that they are a big part of what makes my job so safe compared to the US. Almost all of the people that do get shot by the Police in Germany are mentally unstable, hardly any of them are real criminals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>maybe this isnt exactly the answer to your question, but I feel as if its a much more likely answer when taken into account with socioeconomic status and the challenges that many groups in society face, as opposed to the more common view that &quot;oh, they shot him bc he was black, if a white person reached into their waistband quickly with no warning in this context he <strong><em>tooootally</em></strong> wouldnt have been shot/tazed.&quot;</p>
<p>For lack of a better term, things arent so black and white as many would like to paint the problems with policing in the United States out to be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>German police do a lot less killing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_Germany" target="_blank">7 in 2014</a>), than the United States (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">630 in 2014</a>, though it depends how you count it).</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States,_2014" target="_blank">from 2015</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Guardian newspaper runs its own database, The Counted, which tracked US killings by police and other law enforcement agencies in 2015, and counted <strong>1140 killed</strong>, with rates per million of 2.92 for &quot;White&quot; people, 7.2 for &quot;Black&quot;, and 3.5 for &quot;Hispanic/Latino&quot;, 1.34 for &quot;Asian/Pacific Islander&quot;, and 3.4 for &quot;Native American&quot;. The database can be viewed by state, gender (1086 male, 53 female, 1 nonconforming) , race/ethnicity, age, classification (e.g., &quot;gunshot&quot;), and whether the person killed was armed (853 armed, 224 unarmed)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The United States has 4 (Edit: not 8 thanks /u/Iblis_Is_My_Friend) times of population of Germany, sure, but that mean that in 2015 police in the US killed more people than police have in Germany <em>since 1952</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>First,if you want to have good chances to even be accepted,you'll need an Abitur.</p>
<p>Great,you've done that?If they are interested in you,you'll go to the nearest police acedemy.You will have to take both a theoretical and physical test.</p>
<p>I think the physical one comes first.And yep,it's hard if you're not well trained.Here in Bavaria you have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jump over bench for 30s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bench pressing(60℅ of your weight)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running.4 times between 2 benches 10m away.You have to jump over the bench,grab a cord that's on the ground and drop it the next time.Repeat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooper Test.</p>
</li>
<li>Swim 100m in under 2:45min.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then you have to pass the theoretical test which includes law stuff and you have to prepare really long for it.</p>
<p>Fine...Now you have a job at the police :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it's not like the military PT tests are that hard. The Air Force still has people doing sit ups. Once you get a bit of ab strength it's not even about how many you can do, but how fast can you go in a minute. It's ridiculous. Sit ups don't even really work your abs and they are bad for your back. </p>
<p>90% of the test is the run. If you can jog quickly the rest hardly matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it even matter? Both exercises are complete bullshit. A sit up takes the same amount of effort really. It honestly is about how much cardio ability have because it's all about speed. After getting 70 in a row my abs weren't even tired in the slightest. Sit ups don't really work your abs and no trainer worth their salt would ever have you do them. Plus they cause back problems.</p>
<p>BTW we had to do elbows to knees.</p></div>		</li>
