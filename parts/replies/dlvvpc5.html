			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the same for me in my mid 20s now. I became conscious of it in my early teens when someone asked &quot;were you in a fight?&quot; - great confidence boost! I'm very pale so they are a blueish purple color. I cover them up with some cheap makeup designed specifically for it and no one notices it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exact same! It's like my eyebags suddenly turned dark purple over the space of 1-2 weeks when I was 15. Someone asked me 'did you get punched?' and for a while I had to pretend I was so hardcore I was going to bed at like 4am. Now I just tell people 'I have hereditary deep set eyes and this is just my face.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh, in my case it always happens when I'm worn out and tired.  My face kind of falls a little and I get deep, dark circles.  Easy for my wife to tell when I'm ready to go home from wherever we're hanging out at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, if you've always had them it's genetic. It's highly unlikely that your entire life you've been getting too little sleep and too little water. And the idea that we're all supposed to drink copious amounts of water when we're not thirsty <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/upshot/no-you-do-not-have-to-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html?mcubz=0&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">has been debunked</a> anyway.</p>
