			<div class="markdown"><p>i couldnt agree more that living in america increases nationalism. once you experience what it's like to face racism, you realize your countrymen really are the only ones on your side. as an asian american, i feel like throwing the fuck up every time i watch asian shows and they idolize white people. they have no idea how whites really view asians. if only they knew how nasty and racist whites treat asians, they would be disgusted. the only whites they see are positive images in media and the white immigrants who go to asia. of course they're going to be nice, they're guests in someone elses' home. </p>
<p>it's really unfortunate that chinese parents don't know what life in america really is like for asian men. sending him to college in america where he's already full grown is one thing. sending him in when he's still a kid to go to high school there is going to mind fuck him so god damn bad. it's completely not worth it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have to disagree here. I see plenty of white expats in Asia who are dicks. </p>
<p>Out of curiosity, where in America do you live? Because my home in America was Seattle, so I didn't experience the sort of racism you describe so bitterly. My parents did when they first moved, but by the time I was born racism was less socially acceptable. </p>
<p>Also, most Chinese I know don't idolize whites, I assume it's only the media which does that (although I don't really watch Chinese TV or keep up with local media). The only time I see whites being idolized in China is at expat or high end malls- all the models are white. </p></div>		</li>
