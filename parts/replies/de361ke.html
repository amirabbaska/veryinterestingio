<p>I think we'll be able to use pre-JWST data to figure out if these planets have big H/He atmospheres (which we expect they don't), but any Earth-size atmosphere observations will have to wait for JWST.</p>
<p>I'm not positive about stellar activity, but I've heard it's pretty quiet. Which is to be expected for an older star like this. The problem is that all stars seem to be much more active when they're young, so the flares a long time ago could've ruined/stripped the planets atmospheres. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless I read incorrectly I think that the star is actually pretty young, approximately 0.5-1 billion years old, AND because it's so small it live much longer something like 1,000 billion years (our sun's life is approx. 10-15 billion years depending on if you're referring to it's stable period, or its entire life including shift to Red Giant)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope you get a more complete answer but I found two lightcurves, which is some measure of the intensity versus time. One is in what I think is in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v533/n7602/fig_tab/nature17448_SF5.html" target="_blank">infrared</a> (given a comparison with a 2MASS star and the filter sets are typically <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v533/n7602/fig_tab/nature17448_ST1.html" target="_blank">I/J</a>) and shows variability at the percent level. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01564.pdf" target="_blank">x-ray</a> lightcurve (figure 1) suggest that it can vary quite a lot on the timescale of hours. Table 2 of that paper suggests estimated mass loss rates depending on your model. Multiple Earth-oceans every billion years seems like that's not so good.</p></div>		</li>
