			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually think this comment misses the point. The reason internal organs are not necessarily symmetrical is there was no selective pressure for them to evolve that way. One could certainly conceive of a scenario in which gut-associated organs are broken apart into symmetrical halves (yes humans would have to look differently) and indeed some lower metazoans like worms look a lot closer to symmetrical. But i am not sure one can use embryonic development to answer this question. That tells you HOW internal organs form to be asymmetrical not WHY. </p>
<p>For external organs that serve to interact with the world, it makes great sense to have everything symmetrical because you want to sense things from both sides at the same time and you want to be able to grab things from both sides. This is probably why humans evolved to be billaterally symmetrical and complex symmetry breaking pathways to establish the two main axes of symmetry evolved to take place since an egg is fertilized. </p>
<p>For the internal organs however there was no such selective pressure. Everything is inside there so it matters less how it is distributed. So naturally with more degrees of freedom, a bigger mess resulted</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, it's worth noting that bilateral symmetry affects natural selection for another reason; it makes it easier to select mates based on deformities. In other words, it's easier to notice that there's something wrong with a prospective mate if they're supposed to look symmetrical, but don't. Studies have shown that humans find bilaterally symmetrical faces the most attractive across the board. It may simply be a way of better identifying negative traits in prospective mates. But since we don't see internal organs, symmetry on our insides is less important.</p>
<p>Odds are the reason for our external symmetry is a combination of this and several other listed reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No no no, this point of view means nothing. You don't know whether we evolved to think symmetry is better or because symmetry is better that we think it's better. Natural selection itself is a source of natural selection in a way. The being who think A is better will live better than those who think B is better if A is better than B. Selection of selections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely, there was selective pressure in the environment the organs are in (inside the body) to not be symmetrical.</p>
<p>Symmetry is easy and is the general default for many living things.  Asymmetry is far more unusual and is generally more of an indicator of selective pressure than symmetry is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it fits together and functions better to have asymmetry for some organs vs having joined organs in the middle or two on each side. This is just a thought so I don't know if its true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good answer in that it explains embryological development, but it really doesn't address the actual question which is why development happens like that. In other words, why the twists and turns happen and lead to an asymmetric placement. </p>
<p>The real answer is we don't know. That's just how development happens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it has to do with genetic selection.  Studies and investigations of why humans like facial symmetry have made the conclusion that humans probably use symmetry as a signifier of genetic health.  Lack of obvious deformity isn't a sure sign, but it is a factor that can lead to healthier offspring.  Thus it's believed there is a pressure in genetic selection to select for visual symmetry.  (Or, symmetry is sexy.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That only applies to external features, which can be selected for separate from internal features. People have no general way of knowing how your organs are arranged barring some massive deformity</p></div>		</li>
