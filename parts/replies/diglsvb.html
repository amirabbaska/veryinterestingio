			<div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, what OP described very well it's called market cannibalism. When you have multiple tactics that blurry and bleed over to the same consumers, you're cannibalizing your own market. (When cost is larger than what is gained from it, or larger than the net opportunity cost of strict differentiation and market strategy)</p>
<p>In a few circumstances, very few, this can be beneficial in reinforcing consumer stick, most often it's just a bad practice. One example would be coca cola, who constantly cannibalizes their own market, but then again, is really edging out tenths of percent in market eoy, vs only one real competitor.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good ELI5, but just want to point out that 21st Century Fox is a majority shareholder in National Geographic <em>Channel.</em> Not the Society itself, nor the  print publication. The National Geographic Society is a non-profit founded in 1888 to increase and diffuse geographical knowledge. That remains true to this day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I'm not arguing that. I'm just clarifying because you said fox owns &quot;National Geographic,&quot; which they don't, they are the majority owner of the Channel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correction: small corporations often do have morals. After all, they are groups of people and people arent perfect profit-maximizing automatons. They also like to hang around like-minded people. Also, it is rare, but very very very occasionally do those continue to stick around when the company gets big.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the best way to put it is people have morals, but morals are often detrimental to corporate profits. In a smaller business it is easier for people to control the corporation, while in a large one people with a lack of morals naturally rise to the top (because they are more profitable), and it is harder to enforce morals when you are dealing with a bigger entity. The bigger the corporation, the harder it is for people to move it away from profit maximization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Morality is an important marketing tool in the last few years. I forget where I was reading about it, but it's very important for businesses to keep both leadership and flagship policies that are &quot;ethical&quot; - think the openly gay Tim Cook or Sheryl Sandberg the feminist Facebook exec - who make the company palatable to consumers and investors. The flip side is Uber, where Kalanick is a public relations disaster with feet that may be the downfall of his company. Or, of course, may not - investors haven't actually been that spooked by his behavior as far as I'm aware, but it's something a really, really big one wants to avoid since it will also keep pressure from the government (antitrust) off of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>B corporations are meant to be &quot;moral&quot; companies, by (what I consider) a reasonable definition. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individually, B Corps meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability, and aspire to use the power of markets to solve social and environmental problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some examples include Patagonia, Ben &amp; Jerryâ€™s, and Etsy. </p>
