			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I was watching a tv show where they were trying to make a person ski on water using a rowing boat similar to ones used in olympic. The person who was skiing was having quite a difficulty to maintain his balance because the boat was alternatively speeding up and slowing down (though, not by much) corresponding to the power and recovery phases of all the players.</p>
<p>I didn't mean to say Olympic rowing is unsmooth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Either way, you actually reinforce one of the points here - nobody's saying that the way they do competitive rowing is the fastest or most efficient. It's a competition, and it has rules and traditions. </p>
<p>Whether that <em>is</em> the best way is a very different question - and probably belongs on /r/askscience rather than ELI5. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However it is most definitely the fastest and most efficient way to do it.</p>
<p>The way the weight would move in the boat would continually slow it down rather than the smooth way that the weight is displaced fwd then aft through the strokes. The boats are made to perform best when moving in sync.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Putting a motor on it would also be an advantage. Again, this is a sport and has to exist within the confines of this sport. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes no sense because the competition is rowing. Alternating is still rowing but using a motor isn't.</p></div>		</li>
