			<div class="markdown"><p>For TCP satellite links sometimes use spoofing to reduce the effect of long latency.  So usually the modem or the hub pretends it is the end user and acks the packet, before sending it over the satellite link with another reliable protocol.  </p>
<p>This only reduces the problem of TCP waiting for ages to send more data, it doesn't reduce the overall latency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very close, but not technically correct.  The modem isn't really spoofing an ack, it just appears to the computer and/or network to be the other end of the conversation when in fact it is reading the traffic into a buffer.  The difference is that it isn't sending an ack for a packet it hasn't actually seen or otherwise tricking (spoofing) the client into blindly sending traffic it isn't actually ready for; the network traffic between the client and the modem is your typical TCP. </p>
<p>What happens next is that buffer wraps the entire string in an encapsulating protocol (the one I'm familiar with is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-azmak-bst-00" target="_blank">Boosted Session Transport</a>, or BST, but there are others), blasts that up to the satellite and back down in one continuous transmission (that's the part that u/millijuna was explaining on the RF side with FEC and the like), and the master uplink sucks all that into another buffer that then strips the BST off and then sends it out on the internet as the originator of the traffic (which I guess is what you meant by spoofing?).  The size (length) of each of these frames depends greatly on how the satellite side of the network is configured, and BST is designed for flexibility in that to optimize for various applications.</p>
<p>The effect is the same, but on each end the ACKs are legit TCP between the satellite facing segments of the link and their respective networks, not spoofed traffic pretending to be something they're not.</p>
<p>I don't know if anyone even uses BST anymore (it's been a good 15 years since I was in the satellite biz), but the biggest issue we had was people trying to stick network gear between the computer running the satellite software that optimized the traffic and sent it to the modem and the modem itself.  Because it all was just encapsulated TCP, any network gear not designed for BST wouldn't recognize it and just strip it and send it as regular TCP traffic.  Then people would find their speed dropped to sub-dialup speeds because of the latency hit and bitch to us.  They would never understand that, no, they could not put a firewall between the satellite modem and the computer.  We had to deal with a lot of network admins who were very, very smart when it came to networks and very, very stupid when it came to satellites.  Trying to convince very smart people who usually know what they're talking about that this is one of those narrow case scenarios that their smarts are getting in the way of their understanding was rather difficult.</p>
<p>Eventually the satellite hardware folks got the bright idea to ditch the computers and software, put everything in dedicated hardware and strap a router with integrated firewall into the whole mess and that solved the entire issue (not to mention a host of other problems), but this was in the late-90s/early 2000s when that scale of integration just wasn't heard of yet.</p>
<p>Edit:  They're/their/there.  I'm a grammar Nazi, and I fucked this up myself?  I'm so ashamed....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in the case of WAAS, it's what I would consider spoofing. Say I want to send an email to gmail. My client on the far end of the satellite connection will open a TCP connection to Google's email server. As far as my email client is concerned, it's opened up a TCP session directly with google's server.</p>
<p>At the either end of the satellite link I have a WAAS appliance that is intercepting all the TCP traffic, so what happens is that during the TCP setup/three way handshake, the WAAS appliances will detect that the connection is going through another one, and kick into place. As the traffic continues to flow to google's server, the WAAS unit on my end of the satellite link will send back acknowledgements to my computer, even though it hasn't received them yet from the far end, and is sending them on behalf of google's server. This is what I would consider to be spoofing.</p>
<p>If I sniff the IP traffic flowing between the two WAAS appliances, they'll still look like normal TCP packets, though if de-duplication and compression has kicked in, they'll look mangled. However, the headers and so forth all look correct so I can still do QoS, prioritization, and basic firewalling/filtering.</p></div>		</li>
