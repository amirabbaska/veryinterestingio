			<div class="markdown"><p>I regularly have nightmares where I die. Last night's was having a bus drive over my car and crushing me, and then choking on my blood. I wake up when I die/lose consciousness. This happens quite often, although a different death and scenario every time. The pain can be excruciating, but sometimes not (apparently being shot in the heart doesn't hurt as much as I'd expect).</p>
<p>So...WTF is my brain trying to do? Trying to find the least painful way to die? o.0</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's not the thing, I'm not scared of death at all. I'm all aboard for hopping on to the next journey, actually. I'm not in the least scared of what causes my dream deaths, or the scenarios either.</p>
<p>I think my brain just likes to troll me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad that there's someone who has the same kind of nightmares as me. I had one once where I was in a collapsing building and I completely came to terms with dying. It felt so realistic that it fucked me up for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I was not saying that we dream about useful things, or even that we dream about the things we are trying to learn. Sometimes we do, and other times nonsense.</p>
<p>The answer really is we have no idea why we dream the specific content of what we dream. My idea is just that whatever you are learning, your brain needs to simulate experience to test the new connections in order to make sure it didn't &quot;break&quot; some other functionality. You would not want to be learning a new language and find out your forgot an old one, or forgot how to process faces or something. </p>
<p>In this idea our brains are like computers in that there is a software-update every night and the dream is the testing-suite to minimize the presence of &quot;bugs&quot;. There is basically no way to format and reinstall, so we need to test as we go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually sounds exactly like what I've experienced.</p>
<p>I remember going on holiday as a kid, and they had table tennis tables at the resort we were staying. My brother and i played loads and I was shockingly bad, then one night I had a dream which was basically a cheesy sports movie with me playing table tennis. The next day when we played I was much better, beat my brother for the most part, even though all I'd done was dream about it.</p>
<p>I learned to snap my fingers in the same way, though I don't recall actually having a dream about it, just went to bed trying to do it and I woke up able to.</p></div>		</li>
