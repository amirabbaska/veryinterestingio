			<div class="markdown"><p>The Adventure Zone is a great and extremely entertaining way to get in to the game. It starts with the 5th Edition starter set and a group of 4 people learning to play. By episode 4 the DM is telling an entirely home brewed story involving train murder mysteries, Mad Max-style battle wagon races, and an Aliens-esque trek through an infected lab. All of this is set against a fantastic larger story that were just now getting in to the meat of (episode 58 aired yesterday). I highly recommend it if you want to get in to the game but maybe aren't as interested in or familiar with the traditional high fantasy setting that DnD games are usually played in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spoony has great anecdotes with his Counter Monkey series. The Adventure zone is great especially for understanding D&amp;D 5e, but I think Spoony shows how to be a better player, eg, don't say &quot;I use persuasion&quot;, engage in a conversation. </p>
