<p>if you're lucky in the step 4 the protein will express soluble on the E.Coli... sadly that's not the case in most of the human proteins, the E.coli sends them into tiny concentration camps called &quot;inclusion bodies&quot; where the protein remains there misfolded ans it's a big problem trying to take the protein from there. That's why we used other cell lines... that raises the cost of the process</p>
<p>there's always the option of Animal/Plants bioreactors though  </p></div>		</li>

<p>And even in your super simplified step instructions, keep in mind that this one step is hard. Purifying a protein so that you don't have <em>any</em> other proteins the E. coli normally expresses typically requires several steps. Or you have to adjust the sequence in Step 2 to add a tag to make it easier to purify later, which you have to snip off anyway and you have to make sure adding this tag doesn't fuck with your protein's structure or activity.</p>
<p>Even if you have the sequence and you can somehow manually add amino acids to a chain by hand, it still won't fold as it would in a cell. Protein folding is insane and I don't believe we're anywhere close to doing it synthetically.</p></div>		</li>
