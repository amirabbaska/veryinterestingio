			<div class="markdown"><p>It means your heart is no longer able to pump blood effectively, which means that your vital organs don't get enough oxygen and start dying off and failing. Brain, kidneys, and heart are usually the first ones to go.</p>
<p>On a cellular level it means: electrolyte disregulation in myocardium leading to disordered ventricular contractions, generalized tissue hypoxia leading to disruption of oxidative phosphorylation, and accumulation of metabolic byproducts leading to oxidative stress and apoptosis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So at a cellular level, why does a lack of oxygen kill organs? Because they cant do celluar resp, so they dont have atp which kills them how? and for the 2nd explanation the summary is stuff builds up and diffusion gets messed up so they kill themsleves because theyre overrun?
Edit: im in ap bio and decently smart but not 100% on some things so bear with me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without water you are ion deficient which means the heart cannot do work because it lacks the correct salts necessary for the action potentials to actuate the muscle fibers. </p>
<p>Another more informed person, feel free to correct me. I believe i touched on the gust of it though </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding both: electrolyte derangement typically would kill you via life threatening arrhythmia. Starvation, I'd think, would kill you via hypokalemia with an inability to compensate.</p></div>		</li>
