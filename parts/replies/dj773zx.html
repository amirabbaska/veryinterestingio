			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>Tired Drunk</strong></p>
<p>This type of drunk occurs most commonly after a succession of busy events, for example you have had a tightly-scheduled work week or have been dealing with a number of minor inconveniences including moving, home repairs, an uncommon quantity of errands, etc.  However, there is some sort of event that has long been affixed to the calendar of your mind [or to your actual calendar, should you be the sort to maintain one] to the point where evading it is not an option, despite the fact that you feel vaguely dazed by your obligations of late. The event is likely someone’s birthday or a show to which you have purchased tickets. In the time leading up to your arrival at the event through your initial hour or two at the event you consume several drinks in the hope that you will ‘get a second wind’ or become more energetic, but as you drink you don’t feel especially good or more relaxed or more social, simply more tired, and you kind of just sit down on something while the evening seems to drift past you at a noisy remove.</p>
<p>Someone is highly liable to eventually ask you ‘are you tired’, doubtless curious about your half-lidded expression or disinterest in engaging. Eventually you kind of go around the room at an appropriate time to leave, being like ‘yeah, I’m just gonna get going,’ and everyone will say ‘you’re leaving?’ and you say things like ‘yeah, I’m tired,’ and feel sort of obligated to quantify why you’re tired or to enumerate all the things you have to do in the morning to each person, resulting in you listing your day’s events and tomorrow’s events multiple times to multiple people, all of whom stare at you a little blankly like they don’t actually care or like no amount of excuses could make your departure fair or logical.</p></div>		</li>
