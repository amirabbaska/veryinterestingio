<p>Are you serious? I'm 42 years old. I've seen it all. I've heard it all. </p>
<p>And you're telling me if I put garlic between my toes, after awhile I can taste it?</p>
<p>Geez Louise. We say &quot;mind blown&quot; WAY too easy on the internet. But I am sitting here staring at my laptop. </p>
<p>MIND. BLOWN. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not only does it work, but yes, can taste it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Garlic is antimicrobial and slightly acidic.  It can treat yeast infections by rebalancing vaginal Ph (vaginas are supposed to be acidic,  about a 4) and killing some of the candida overgrowth. </p>
<p>Using plain yoghurt can also treat a yeast infection because it contains probiotics that rebalance the natural flora. </p>
<p>My grandma used to joke about &quot;making a fish souvlaki&quot;,  because if your vagina ever smelt fishy she'd tell you to use garlic to reintroduce acid,  Greek yoghurt for probiotics,  and cucumber for soothing any irritated skin. That's basically the ingredients to tatziki,  hence a fish souvlaki. </p>
<p>I have chronic csndidiasis and the yoghurt trick is a life saver for me.  After my period I'll use yoghurt as a skin lotion on my vulva for a few days and it will prevent my usual post menstrual yeast infection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used garlic extract pills to get rid of a plantar wart on the bottom of my foot.</p>
<p>The pills were clear gelcaps with this garlic extract &quot;jelly&quot; inside, and I squeezed it into a piece of cotton and bandaged it to my foot and it went away in two days.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To try this out, if you put some cut up garlic in between your toes, you can taste it after a little while.</p>

<p>This also works with quinine to help with malaria. Quinine is really nasty and bitter so it's hard to swallow, which is one reason the British invented the and gin-and-tonic. </p>
<p>However, Muslims can't drink alcohol so they would cut the quinine bark and put it in their socks/shoes while building the Suez Canal.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>LI5 means friendly, simplified and layman-accessible explanations.

<p>From the sidebar. I think most top answers actually meet the rule requirements, and this approaches gratuitous levels of &quot;LI5&quot;.  Operative word is approaches - it has useful bits of info but the first 3 sentences are really dumbed down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate that rule so much. If you didn't want explanations for 5 year olds, don't make a sub for one.</p>
<p>A lot of times that rule makes the top voted response no clearer than the problem at hand. </p></div>		</li>
