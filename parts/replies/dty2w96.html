<p>minor toxins</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide is not a &quot;toxin.&quot;  While it can be dangerous at high levels, a <em>toxin</em> is poisonous even at low levels, like the venom of some snakes or certain heavy metals.  Carbon dioxide is a significant portion of the air we breathe every day.  If it were a toxin, we would all be dead.</p>

<p>Also, see the top entry in a Google search for &quot;define toxin.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;healthy living&quot; movement has informally classified a lot of the byproducts of life processes - feces, for example - as &quot;toxins,&quot; but this is a misuse of the term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toxins have their origin from biological processes. Carbon dioxide the substance is not inherently be a toxin, but in this process it stems from a biological process making it one. Waste and byproducts are still considered toxins, but shouldn't raise concern in small concentrations. Most animals can tolerate certain doses, and like allergies some are more affected than others. </p>
<p>The primary misconception made by trendy health movements is that any toxin is bad. It's okay and even healthy to have some toxins in the body. Though to a limit otherwise septic shock type situations can arise. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, but that is not the only requirement.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>No.  A toxin is something that interferes with biological processes.  The toxin itself is produced by the biological processes <em>of another creature</em>.  Your body does not produce things that are toxins <em>in your own body</em>.</p>
<p>There are things - again, like feces - that can have ill effects if they are suddenly relocated from one place to another, but again, that's not the same thing as a &quot;toxin.&quot;  Feces has bacteria in it, and those bacteria do bad things in the wrong environment.</p>
<p>But bacteria are living things that create an infection, not a simple substance that interferes with the biological processes in your cells like, say, HF.</p></div>		</li>
