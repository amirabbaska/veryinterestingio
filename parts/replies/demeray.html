			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer!  But if drinking water contains a low amount of disinfectant to keep germs from growing, how come if I leave a bucket of tap water just sitting around it will eventually get grimy and gross?</p></div>		</li>

<p>A bucket isn't sealed the way pipes are. The stuff that makes the water in the bucket grimy and gross isn't coming from the water, it's coming from the surroundings. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the chlorine commonly found in city drinking water evaporates off much faster than the water when left in an open container exposed to air, so after a day or two you're just left with regular water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree.  Another factor is that tap water has chlorine added to it, and that will eventually evaporate into the atmosphere. It can't evaporate out when it's in the pipe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We maintain a residual concentration of chlorine in the water supply of at least 0.3mg/l. When the water is exposed to sunlight and air this chlorine naturally dissipates over a short period of time. This is why some people who are sensitive to chlorine in the water they drink place an open container on the counter or in the fridge for a time before drinking it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, I've been meaning to ask someone, could you comment on the difference between chlorine in water supply vs chloramine? Our township recently switched over but doesn't seem to have figured out what the appropriate concentrations are and all the fish in our ornamental pond died. Our neighbors with ponds had similar issues. </p>
<p>Are there guidelines being created for chloramine? Are there reasons why a township would switch from one to the other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I have to perform a study. Instead of simply filling my Britta, I'll have to fill a nonfiltered jug too and taste them both after x time to see how much of the change is due to the filter and how much is due to the water sitting out!!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chlorine residual (the small amount of free chlorine that remains in drinking water to insure continued disinfection) dissipates over time and when said water comes into contact with organic contaminates. If water sits long enough, the chlorine residual will deplete and organic growth can begin to occur. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water operator here.  Another thing that keeps pipes clean (sometimes they really aren't) is that we flush water hydrants.  In efforts to scour the pipes of sediment and iron growth, we pull water through mains at velocities up to three feet per second.  </p>
<p>It also depends upon the source/s of water your system depends on.  Well water tends to be cleaner though it may be higher in iron, manganese, or calcium.  Surface water is generally filtered, but still has more stuff in it.</p>
<p>Also, water pipes have a bio-film in them that protects them and keeps metals from leaching from the pipes and into the water system.  Water with crazy ph needs to be treated to prevent the removal of this bio-film.  It was the removal of the bio-film from Flint's water system that caused the lead to leach into the water system.  Many water systems still have plumbing with lead in them, but that lead is protected from leaching into your drinking water.</p></div>		</li>
