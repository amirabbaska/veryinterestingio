<p>I thought that was &quot;parturition&quot;. Unless that's specifically referring to the onset per se?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned in this thread that is an intriguing facet of this question only just recently given some of the attention it deserves is the potential role of the microbiome:</p>
<p><a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2049-2618-2-18" target="_blank">The vaginal microbiota of pregnant women who subsequently have spontaneous preterm labor and delivery and those with a normal delivery at term</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4909356/" target="_blank">The placental microbiome is altered among subjects with spontaneous preterm birth with and without chorioamnionitis</a></p>
<p><a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1933719113488838" target="_blank">Diversity of the Vaginal Microbiome Correlates With Preterm Birth</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4245917/" target="_blank">Exploring Preterm Birth as a Polymicrobial Disease: An Overview of the Uterine Microbiome</a></p>
<p>This is connected to the work I do, so I'm always anxious to share.  As with most connections between health/disease and the human microbiome, it almost certainly does not tell the full story.  We've started to identify associations, not necessarily causal relationships.  The microbiome is likely either a directly relevant facet of the biology of pre-term birth or serves as an indicator of more directly relevant biological factors...or both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh! This is interesting stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, my stance on the preterm-birth situation is that it has no sole cause-- there's a lot of things that can prime it, and it's not going to be something treated simply. The more we understand, though...</p></div>		</li>
