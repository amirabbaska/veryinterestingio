			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds also stretch, you can find many videos of that on Reddit. </p>
<p>I’m fairly certain it’s a warm-blooded thing. Animals that can’t regulate their own body heat don’t have muscle tone the same way we do. </p>
<p>Animals generally don’t have biological urges that their biology isn’t capable of, so I doubt fish are living constantly with the urge to stretch muscles that aren’t there. </p>
<p>Also sharks would never need to stretch. Their muscles are always moving, as they have to swim constantly to be able to breath. </p>
<p>Invertebrates that don’t have muscles (or at least the kind we have) might stretch for locomotion, but that’s it the same type of stretching OP is talking about. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually not all sharks have to keep moving. Some can just pump water through their gills.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well most of them don't really have limbs capable of bracing against something and extending. They're basically strong spines with little bits sticking out they can twist around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can stretch my back simply by using my back muscles to bend my spine in certain ways. It's a bit more targeted than when I use my arms and a chair to brace myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like they can maneuver into stretch like postures. I've seen sharks bend and flex the spine in a  &quot;cat cow&quot; like form followed by an mouth gape / yawn. Also rub along the sandy / gravelly sea bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like stretching to me, thanks! It seems intuitive that yawning and stretching is a common traits among species with muscles.</p>
<p>I was curious, so I did a bit of digging. <a href="https://medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877(06)00060-0/fulltext" target="_blank">This research suggests that yawning and stretching are common to almost all vertebrates, and may be an evolutionary response to REM sleep with the purpose of re-oxygenating and invigorating the body</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost all the vertebrates yawn, testifying the phylogenetic old origins of this behavior. Correlatively speaking, yawning shows an ontogenical precociousness since it occurs as early as 12 weeks after conception and remains relatively unchanged throughout life.</p>
