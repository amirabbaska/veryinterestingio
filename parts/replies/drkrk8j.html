			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the common misconception is if its stainless steel, it wouldn't rust. It does, especially in a chlorine rich environment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TIL in 1985, 12 people were killed in Uster, Switzerland when the concrete roof over three public swimming pools collapsed &quot;like a lid&quot;, trapping 40-50 people inside.  The columns supporting the roof were made of stainless steel and failed after 13 years of chlorine corrosion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a argument with a buddy on that very subject.</p>
<p>We were talking about having to work massive amounts of OT and I told him about doing  22 hours a 9 hour break and then 18 hours when I worked at a sulfur pelletizing plant in my youth. </p>
<p>We had to replace the stainless steel liner in a liquid sulfur holding tank about every 6 months. And we had to do it as quick as we could because the refinery couldn't wait too long for us to get back online. It's amazing how corrosive that stuff is. But he kept saying bullshit stainless steel can't be corroded, no matter what I told him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so hard to explain to people. I'm a cook, and I never let water sit on my knives, since even a little rust = less fine of an edge. But dammit, even good chefs will slice a big fat tomato and walk away, leaving my knife covered in acidic 'mater guts. Gross </p></div>		</li>
