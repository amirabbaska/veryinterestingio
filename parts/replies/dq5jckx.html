			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your expert reply /u/poopsinurinals! But seriously, if you can't control your internal sphincters at all, then why can you sometimes pee on command like if you have to give a urine sample?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was that way until I got really sick in the Marine Corps for over a year before being medically retired. I had to poop literally every couple of hours. Well, I just got used to it. I couldn't hold it. It didn't matter who else was in the bathroom. In the office where I worked, everyone knew if I wasn't there, I was at lunch or in the bathroom. I could literally just walk out formations if I really had to go and everyone knew why. </p>
<p>Yes, I got lots of jokes. I got a mug that said &quot;Coffee makes me poop&quot; as well as other poop relates things. But those comments and gifts just made me even more relaxed about pooping so often .  Everyone knew. Nothing to hide. </p>
<p>Now I'm out and I'm a lot better. I carry Imodium with me everywhere. But the main thing is, I can poop anywhere there is a bathroom. I don't care at all. It's natural and I am super glad I learned this lesson, even through the hard way, because I never have to sit uncomfortably, holding my sphincter tight and waiting to get home. I just go. Liberation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every time you are peeing in a comfortable state, say a short phrase or word in your mind as you start. Mine was &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; (I have no idea why). Then when you want to pee in an uncomfortable state, just get ready to pee and in your mind say the phrase. Its like training to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this and I hate it so much. I have to distract myself  (reddit on the phone is my go-to) to have any chance of being able to pee, even if I have to go so badly that it hurts.</p>
<p>The weird part is that I don't feel any anxiety about it (my life is chock full of anxiety, so I'm well acquainted with the feeling), and it just suddenly started one day. What the shit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So usually, except for right after peeing, your bladder always has some liquid in it. The internal sphincters get activated once the bladder has filled to a certain point and then you get that “need to go” feeling. Now when it comes to peeing on command when you don’t necessarily have too... I’m not exactly sure! But I would assume it has something to do with you kind of “tricking” your brain into thinking you need to go so that it sends those signals down to the internal sphincters and makes them relax/open</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, it depends.</p>
<p>I find that if I don't feel the need but there's a logical need to go, depending on the situation I can just pee.</p>
<p>Urine samples don't work for me if I have to give them in the office because I can't handle the pressure of doing it on a time table, but if I'm on vacation or attending a concert, I can usually make myself pee before heading back on the road or before the show starts so I won't have to go before it's convenient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody can know for sure, but probably it has to do with the smell.</p>
<p>Defecating while you sleep means that you are lying unconscious with what essentially is a huge red flag signalling your position to your predators.</p>
<p>It's a very bad trait for survival. The first animal who did not shit in his bed had a huge advantage to the others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Defecating and urinating where you sleep is also a great way to give yourself a shit ton (pun wholly intended) of infections. It's the same reason we are usually disgusted by bodily discharge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about in the sleep, but some animals pee and poo wherever they go, e.g. mice, but other e.g. humans, rats, use latrines.  With rats and mice it always seem strange to me that they have such different &quot;methods&quot;.  There clearly must be an advantage to rats of their habits, and little disadvantage to mice, but I've no idea what it is.</p></div>		</li>
