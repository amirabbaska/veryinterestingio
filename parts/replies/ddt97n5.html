			<div class="markdown"><p>Aerodynamics changes in a lot of ways supersonic. There's a reason it is called the &quot;sound <em>barrier</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>A lot of pilots died pushing planes designed for subsonic speeds into supersonic. Shockwaves and new aerodynamic behavior, especially on only half of an object, can cause all sorts of problems like vibrations, stresses, fractures etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't believe the sound is an issue.  As someone who has sat next to a spun up two blade Cobra on the flight line and worked on CH-53's, I'll say that the 7 blades of the 53E are WAY louder than the two blade Cobra.  </p>
<p>I'd say the most likely reason that an air ambulance has four blades instead of two, has nothing to do with sound and everything to do with lifting capacity.</p>
<p>Air ambulances have to carry a ton of equipment and at AT LEAST four people at a time.  Probably couldn't do that reliably in a 2 blade helicopter.</p>
<p>&quot;Two blades takes less space in the hangar.&quot;  </p>
<p>Depends on the aircraft, most Navy/Marine helicopters fold so blade arc isn't an issue at all.   But in civilian aircraft, definitely could see that as an issue. </p></div>		</li>
