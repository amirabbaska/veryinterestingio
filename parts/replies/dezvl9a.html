<p>(1 minute) / (.28 milliseconds) = 214285.714</p>
<p>214285.714 x 1 rotation = 214285.714 rpm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;in order for a stable compact object to break apart due to rotational forces, you'd need to put rotational energy into the star; I don't know of any mechanism that does this.&quot;</p>
<p>So you've never heard of accretion??  Literally hundreds of pulsars in binary systems are actively accreting from their binary companions, which means they are spinning up.  </p>
<p>Also, pulsars can not be born with rotational periods less than something like ~30 ms.  All pulsars that you see with rotation periods less than that have been spun up, by matter falling onto their surface from their companion star.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond_pulsar" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond_pulsar</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but accretion will never produce a star to break apart, it'll just orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct; I misphrased this in my original comment. I meant I don't know of any mechanism that puts rotational energy into a compact object without an upper bound on the rotation rate. Accretion deposits angular momentum into the object through surface interactions, so the rotational speed of the compact object is necessarily limited by the orbital speeds immediately outside the surface. So the fastest a compact object can speed up to via accretion is to this equilibrium orbital speed, although typically, the object will reach its Chandrasekhar mass before this occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool. The second paragraph is a bit of a cop-out though. Just imagine a giant indestructible robot that spins the star, then what would the top rotational speed be?</p></div>		</li>
