			<div class="markdown"><p>You can just put both hands on the scale. The pushups are harder with your hands together, but the weight would be about the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I thought at first, but then you'd have your hands closer together, therefore increasing your angle and shifting your weight in an other way when compared to a normal wide stance</p>
<p>Ninja edit: just tested this out and the difference is either unexisting or negligible. Go for both hands on scale!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I weigh 171, bathroom scale reads 115.5 when I'm in the pushup position with my hands on it. 68% of my bodyweight.</p></div>		</li>
