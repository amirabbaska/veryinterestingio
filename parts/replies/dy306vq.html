			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be nice.  Unless you're required to change into scrubs at work because you work in the OR or something, nurses in the US go to and from work in their own scrubs.  And stop at the grocery store.  And sometimes even when they're required to change into scrubs at work, they take them home and launder them anyway.  </p></div>		</li>
