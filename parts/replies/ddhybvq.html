			<div class="markdown"><p>The f22 engine is a low bypass turbofan, designed for supersonic cruise. As such, it needs some sort of inlet to slow/control the speed at which air enters the intake because the airflow through the compressor must be subsonic. If you were designing for max efficiency, it would look more like a mig 21 with an inlet spike, and nothing like a commercial airliner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No argument there. I was just simplifying for the sake of getting the important point across, because of how OP phrased the question.</p>
<p>And while a supersonic aircraft does indeed need a diffusing inlet, the point remains valid: modern fighter inlets don't look the way they do so they can optimize aerodynamic performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a high-specific-thrust/low-bypass-ratio turbofan normally has a multi-stage fan, developing a relatively high pressure ratio and, thus, yielding a high (mixed or cold) exhaust velocity. The core airflow needs to be large enough to give sufficient core power to drive the fan. </p>
<p>Don't forget that a smaller core flow/higher bypass ratio cycle can be achieved by raising the (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason that commercial aircraft use large round inlets is because they are operating in transonic speed ranges, while stealth fighter jets operate in a supersonic speed range. The reason for the small ramp intake is to induce a series of oblique shock-waves that slow down the supersonic flow to subsonic speeds before the air gets to the turbine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember my design courses and supersonic fluids courses correctly (and I may not) the intake design is also different for supersonic flow as opposed to subsonic flows.  You're certainly more of an expert than me, but I thought that the angled intake was in part to minimize shockwaves disrupting airflow to the intake.  Perhaps I'm mistaken or misremembering...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a part of the design process, but the same goal can be achieved through other geometries as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shockwaves slow down the flow and compress it before it hits the fan.  There are often multiple bounces of a shock wave inside the inlet but it goes subsonic before it actually hits the fan</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The F-15 has a variable geometry ramp inlet to maximize pressure recovery through oblique shocks... at a huge cost of weight, complexity, and importantly, radar cross section. The F-22 likely accepts a normal shock in the inlet as a tradeoff between rcs and efficiency.  This is a similar inlet to F-16, 18, 35, and most western fighters.  Just make better engines to compensate and pay your local defense contractor handsomely. </p></div>		</li>
