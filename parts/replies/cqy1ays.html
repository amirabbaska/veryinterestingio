			<div class="markdown"><p>Your My Lai example in Vietnam also brings up another problem with war crimes: the U.S. never declared war in Vietnam. U.S. forces in Vietnam were there by authorization of Congress, but there was never a formal declaration of war. It was for this same reason that North Vietnam was able to keep U.S. citizens imprisoned there for so long, because they were not considered Prisoners of War, since there was technically no war. They were imprisoned on charges of trespassing in many cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The U.S. is actually employing this same technique in the War on Terror. Because the U.S. never formally declared war on a country, foreign fighters are referred to as &quot;enemy combatants&quot; rather than &quot;soldiers&quot; and torture is called &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques.&quot; I'm generally not too much of an Americopessimist, but I can't help but think that the decision-makers know that what they're doing is wrong and are hoping semantics will cover their asses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A declaration of war is not actually required for the application of the Geneva Conventions, what is required is <a href="https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/375-590005?OpenDocument" target="_blank">an armed conflict between two or more high contracting parties</a>. The [International Committee of the Red Cross] (<a href="https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&xp_treatySelected=375" target="_blank">https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&xp_treatySelected=375</a>) currently lists 196 parties to the conventions. For reference, the UN has 193 members.</p>
<p>In the case of the war on terror I believe the argument is that the enemy (terrorists) is not a party to the convention and therefore it would not apply to the enemy soldiers/combatants. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, these enemy combatants don't respect the Geneva conventions, like wearing clearly identifiable uniforms, or not harming civilians or launching rockets near hospitals exc.. Therefore there is no legal requirement for us to do the same. Technically terrorist combatants are like spies. Captured spies don't have the rights of POWs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boy, this field is so vast, one can hardly cover all nuances. Just a couple of annotations:</p>
<p>You pretty much sumed it up in the end yourself - only those in the position to be submitted to punishment can and will be punished. This is also in part due to a perceived &quot;just cause&quot; argument of the winning party, where anything potentially scandalous will be interpreted as military necessity. A direct consequence is that whistleblowers of obvious war crimes are prosecuted as defeatistic criminals &quot;aiding the enemy&quot; as opposed to upstanding citizens just doing the right thing. (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning" target="_blank">Bradley/Chelsea Manning</a> as <em>one</em> modern example)</p>
<p>If potential scandals do come to light, they will usually be outright denied or downplayed as criminal acts of individuals - even if those acts were/are a more or less obvious and coherent part of a waring party's official policy.</p>
<p>You can go back in history and look at the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire during WW I, or the mass raping of German civilians by Soviet soldier, or Chinese/Korean citizens by the Japanese at the end of WW II - incidents which even in present day textbooks of their respective countries are being outright denied.</p>
<p>But you don't even have to go that far back - basically any more or less recent military conflict by the US has not been deemed a war (which requires a declaration by Congress, which never happened after WW II). As a result, you can subcontract engagements on enemy soil without direct supervision and responsibilty of their outcome (e.g. Blackwater in Iraq), and treat enemy individuals as mere combatents without the same rights of protection as offical enemy soldiers/POWs (Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib) .</p>
<p>Similar to this: Russian soldiers fighting undercover in the Ukraine can by definition not commit any war crimes, because the official Russian standpoint is that there simply are no official Russian soldiers in the Ukraine. As a result they can kill Ukrainian POW without much consequence, other than the expectation that, if they were captured themselves, they can pretty much expect the same. Which is pretty much the reason for rules in war in the first place:</p>
<p>DO NOT DO WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE TO BE DONE UNTO YOURSELF. But without fear for consequence - oh well...</p>
<p>One last note: The dearmification of the GermanReich after WW I was NOT a direct result of the German military breaking statutes of the Hague Conventions (which was done on mass, by all parties involved), but simply an attempt by the French to weaken Germany sufficiently to restore pre-1870 central European balance. We all know how well that played out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All excellent additions, thank you. The notion of &quot;just cause&quot; is a very important one in regards to war, especially war crimes, and one that bothers me a lot. Although the global population is much more educated and well-informed than it used to be, there is still an implicit assumption that whoever is morally superior in a war will eventually be the victor, and this is obviously not true.</p>
<p>Concerning your last note: This is mostly true, it was definitely a French attempt to restore the European power balance that existed before the Bismarck. But I was under the impression that the demilitarization of Germany, much like the huge repayments that caused massive inflation in the country, were procedurally justified by claiming that Germany broke the rules of war by mobilizing first (or something like that--which, by the way, it didn't. Russia did, but because they were initially allied with the victors, then succumbed to a revolution and withdrew from the war entirely, there was never a chance they would be recognized as the antagonists). </p>
<p>But I digress. Your points in the middle really make me appreciate how relevant the rules (or lack thereof) of war are right now, which I'd wager many people would not immediately think to be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i feel this is better than the top rated answers. </p>
<p>&quot;rules&quot; changed during ww1. this is where we found out science has created tools of war that are beyond a better mouse trap. some are just inhumane, and too catastrophic to be used routinely. </p>
<p>if someone breaks the rules, they now have to face war crimes like said after the dust settles. what really is effective is if someone breaks the rules more of the countries that would have remained neutral join in defense to squash it. </p></div>		</li>
