			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for you in-depth explanation. As a side note, why did they use 2-phase system with 90 degrees offset, not 180? It would make resulting voltage 0, like with modern 3-phase system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do that and there are two phase systems which do do that, but then you end up reintroducing the pulsing issue. It's better than single phase, and you still get the benefit of same power with lower voltages, but a large part of the point is avoiding the pulsing issue  (things like induction motors, arc furnaces etc), so holding your nose and dealing with the higher current on the neutral was the preferable option most times. </p>
<p>Also back when two phase was a thing, we didn't really have the tools to easily analyze stuff like 2 phase three wire circuits, so two phase 4 wire set ups were common, which eliminates the higher current on the neutral return (although requires more wire)</p></div>		</li>
