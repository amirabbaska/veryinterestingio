			<div class="markdown"><p>They are going to garnish 25% of her income before taxes eventually.  Credit score in the low to mid 500s. But if she has paid a car loan recently, she may be able to get a car loan....for 12-15% interest.  Won't be able to get a home loan though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may mean income based repayment? That's a repayment plan where, if you qualify, you pay based on a set percentage of your wages. For some people, that amount may be zero. You have to recertify every year, so it's not that she's ignoring it, she's just paying less based on her salary. You remain in good standing on the loan, and can be eligible for loan forgiveness. If she's just ignoring it that's another thing, and makes no sense as the federal government loans have plenty of options to stay in good standing and keep payments reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens when the person who has so much debt doesn't have traditional wages to garnish? Like a Dr or a Lawyer for example would have potentially hundreds of thousands of $ in school debt, but can then go into private practice where they get paid directly by their clients. Aside from damaging their credit, do the federal or private loans have any other recourse besides garnishing wages?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No idea. I only know about traditional income.  But I wouldn't be surprised if they could do something to the practice.</p></div>		</li>
