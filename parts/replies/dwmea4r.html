			<div class="markdown"><p>There's other answers, so I'm really just asking rhetorically but when you say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scan row by row, and keep everything analog</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that people don't know what was scanned or how it was scanned. That's the whole point of the question. How do you transmit electronically without digital technology is the essence of the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Per wikipedia:</p>
<p>The actual figure of 525 lines was chosen as a consequence of the limitations of the vacuum-tube-based technologies of the day. In early TV systems, a master voltage-controlled oscillator was run at twice the horizontal line frequency, and this frequency was divided down by the number of lines used (in this case 525) to give the field frequency (60 Hz in this case). This frequency was then compared with the 60 Hz power-line frequency and any discrepancy corrected by adjusting the frequency of the master oscillator. For interlaced scanning, an odd number of lines per frame was required in order to make the vertical retrace distance identical for the odd and even fields, which meant the master oscillator frequency had to be divided down by an odd number. At the time, the only practical method of frequency division was the use of a chain of vacuum tube multivibrators, the overall division ratio being the mathematical product of the division ratios of the chain. Since all the factors of an odd number also have to be odd numbers, it follows that all the dividers in the chain also had to divide by odd numbers, and these had to be relatively small due to the problems of thermal drift with vacuum tube devices. The closest practical sequence to 500 that meets these criteria was 3×5×5×7=525. (For the same reason, 625-line PAL-B/G and SECAM uses 5×5×5×5, the old British 405-line system used 3×3×3×3×5, the French 819-line system used 3×3×7×13 etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's very little to block the signal between the moon and the earth, and NASA antennas are much bigger than the average consumer antenna. They may also have had a more powerful signal than what broadcasters use as there's nothing for the signal to interfere with on the moon.</p>
<p>Edit: the antennas can also be more efficient due to knowing which direction the signal needs to go and which direction it's coming from. </p></div>		</li>
