			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine 2, 3x3 grids of squares. You're holding one, and the other one is on the table. When you put the grid your holding on the grid on the table, chances are that they won't allign. You'll have to do some extra effort to allign them perfectly. </p>
<p>The grid on the table is the monitor, the grid you're holding is the camera's sensor. The chance that the thousands of little squares in your camera allign with the thousands of little squares on your monitor is incredibly small.</p>
<p>I hope I clarified it :), if not, I'll make an illustration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally people use JPEG as their default file format for uploaded screenshots, and JPEG files try to simplify the image to make things very small. Usually the compression from a fresh JPEG isn't noticeable to the human eye, but multiple JPEGs create bigger and bigger errors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a video on YouTube somewhere where the guy uploads, downloads, uploads, downloads, etc of a video. It doesn't take long for the video to go to hell when it is trying to compress an already compressed video. The compression patterns start appearing, and the audio, yikes.</p>
<p>Edit: Found it <a href="http://youtu.be/icruGcSsPp0" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/icruGcSsPp0</a></p>
<p>This is why you always work with uncompressed images, video, and audio when you can. I cringe whenever a client gives me a JPEG of a logo, or even a photograph taken with their smart phone.</p></div>		</li>
