<p>Adverse means unfavorable, contrary or hostile, and can never be applied to humans. You often hear it used in the term ‘adverse weather conditions’, a phrase which is best avoided in favor of ‘bad weather’.</p>
<p>Averse means unwilling or disinclined or loath and is always followed by the preposition ‘to’. It applies to a person and is used like this: ‘He was averse to discussing the conference’. Of course, it would be just as easy to say. ‘He didn’t want to discuss the conference’.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gillette sent me a razor and a birthday card on my 18th birthday.</p>
<p>Creepy that they knew when it was, but it made me smile.</p>
<p>I have bought their razors for the past 12 years.</p>
<p>It was literally a negligible cost to them that brought them years of profit.</p>
<p>I'm not that worried about what deodorant/razors I use.</p>
<p>I don't think too hard about that stuff typically.</p>
<p>Just one good interaction with the company may secure years of revenue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My adversaries can confirm that not only can it be applied to humans, but that it frequently is. (see also: <a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2013/article-gcj/section-9-113" target="_blank">adverse person</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I remember my dad being sent a Gilette fusion razor through the post and he was like &quot;The hell? These are being sold for £15 each!&quot; So he tried it for a couple of weeks then ended up dropping about £60 on the replacement sets of blades. </p>
<p>He told everyone about how surprised he was and how good they were and before he knew it everyone had them. Assuming they did that to lots of people because most of the people I know use that razor. From my experience it seems to have been a really effective campaign.</p>
<p>I imagine you'd need to be immensely confident in your product to risk it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, please! Just because he buys Old Spice® Pure Sport™ because Old Spice® Pure Sport™ is the best damn deodorant around doesn't make him a shill. Although I suppose now that I've mentioned Old Spice® Pure Sport™ you'll probably call me a shill now too. FYI I don't even use Old Spice® Pure Sport™ - not since I got new Old Spice® Pure Sport Ultimate™ at least. It keeps me dryer for longer and performing at my best, whether I'm slam dunking out on the court, or making major deals in the boardroom.</p></div>		</li>
