			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandmother suffered Alzheimer's &amp; never missed a meal. She loved doughnuts so we gave her as many as she wanted. (The doctors advised against this but we weren't concerned with heart disease/obesity at that point.) </p>
<p>She fell, hit her head, began remembering us one at a time. When she got to the end of the list of people to remember, she died. Nice parting gift. </p>
<p>Her favorite cherry tree bloomed that week (in January) and died when she did.</p></div>		</li>
