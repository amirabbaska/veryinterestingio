			<div class="markdown"><p>Because unscrambling eggs is a macro event. In theory if you tried like 10^999999999999 times you could unscramble eggs. So at a micro level there is no reason why you can't unscramble eggs, it's just at the macro level its very unlikely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about how physically hard it is to unbreak a window. First, you have to recollect all the energy lost to the environment (all sound, light, heat, etc) from bonds in the glass breaking and pieces falling. If you can do that, and put all the glass pieces back to were they were, and put the energy back into the bonds, the rest is trivial!</p>
<p>Basically, if you tracked everything that happened, you can theoretically do the opposite, it just isn't possible for us to actually do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is because the second law of thermodynamics. The relationship between the concept of entropy and the quantum level is still very theoretical but some physicists believe that the irreversible nature of nature you are referring to arises as a result of systems becoming more quantum entangled with their environments over time. Also, look up Maxwell's Demon.</p></div>		</li>
