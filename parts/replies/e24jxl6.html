			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue discussed in the above thread is whether the animal has multifocal eyes, and needs to operate in a variety of lighting conditions. Round pupils affect the focal distance of different colors, depending on the pupil diameter in different light levels. Slitted pupils can open or shut down the light input without affecting the focal distance</p></div>		</li>
