			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the Canadian definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Genetically Modified:</p>
<p>An organism, such as a plant, animal or bacterium, is considered genetically modified if its genetic material has been altered through any method, including conventional breeding. A &quot;GMO&quot; is a genetically modified organism.</p>
<p>Genetically Engineered:</p>
<p>An organism is considered genetically engineered if it was genetically modified using techniques that permit the direct transfer or removal of genes in that organism. Such techniques are also called recombinant DNA or rDNA techniques.</p>

<p>I would note that the Canadian Food and Inspection Agency views <a href="https://www.realagriculture.com/2018/04/cfia-now-says-non-gmo-project-verified-doesnt-mean-non-gmo/" target="_blank">the non-GMO label as meaningless.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Canadian definition delineates 'GMO' which is a mostly meaningless term coined by media from 'GE' which is the scientific term.</p>
<p>'Modified' means anything.
'Engineered' means to design, create and construct.</p>
<p>However, in discourse about biotec foods they are generally used interchangeably. This causes confusion because people then equate intentionally cross pollinated with lab inserted transgenes.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Any method, so that includes genetic drift, ambient radiation and sexual reproduction? Meaning every organism since life has genetic material?</p>
<p>Even if they would add the caveat 'through human intervention' it'd still cover every crop and domesticated animal since the dawn of agriculture and husbandry. </p>
<p>Edit: according to the Canadian definition, I'm a GMO :D</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anything that's farmed is not natural, <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fruits-vegetables-looked-before-domestication" target="_blank">its a genetically modified.</a>  That's the laymen definition that's used in Canada.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We'll get a label put on you so the anti-GMO cannibals leave ya alone.</p>
<p>That anti-GMO craze just makes me shake my head.  The arguments against GMOs are just so anti-science that I can't help but compare it to the anti-vaxer movement.  As long as all the genetics involved are from edible organisms in the first place, there shouldn't be any problem.  It's if they somehow turn something like DEET into genetic material and combine it with tomatoes that we'd have an actual concern.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the US, I always see non-gmo labels on things for which no GMOs even exist. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I suppose one can actually look that up, since 501cs are required to make expenses and payouts public. </p>
<p>If you want that label, you have to pay them for it. Completely private and separate from any government bureau. </p>
<p>Oh yeah, they also whip up people into a frenzy of concern, and ask for direct donations, so that's over and above their fees for their labels. <a href="https://www.nongmoproject.org/donate/" target="_blank">https://www.nongmoproject.org/donate/</a></p>

<p>GMOs are an amazing, oftentimes life-saving technology, and people should embrace them as such. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All biological drugs (antibodies for example, many used in cancer treatment) are made using recombinant organisms (like what you mentioned as well as things like human genes in hampster cells or even plant or insect cells). I've never heard anyone protesting these (is that a thing?). Generally I think people get freaked out by &quot;genetically modified&quot; food, but not drugs made in this way. Maybe because you only get the drugs when you're sick? Maybe because they don't really understand drug production, but &quot;jellyfish genes in my corn&quot; is easier to get upset about? Could be the at least understandable concern about potential environmental impact (vs growing drugs in bioreactors)? Beats me, but I am genuinely curious.</p></div>		</li>
