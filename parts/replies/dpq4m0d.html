			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another style of commercial washer other than the 2 styles most of us are familiar with - the passthrough being the most common, and an under counter style (think home style but faster).</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.cookstore.ca/lamber-conveyer-dishwasher-m115ek.html?mkwid=sUwltgaAK&amp;pcrid=91570706593&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA_5_QBRC9ARIsADVww17uhW8l3iXZCFfrx6jmmqniOalUcnxI7-8iu3HYaWTO88jqY7nkTOIaAqafEALw_wcB" target="_blank">conveyor style</a> washer that uses a heater to push the temperature of the rinse water to near the boiling point.  It's a chemical free way to sanitize dishes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dishwashers in restaurants use a chemical rinse. Generally chlorine and a water hardening agent to make dishes dry fast. Because they use a chlorinated rinse to sanitize, water temperature isn't important. Although the degreasing chemical(a dangerously caustic liquid) in the wash stage works best at at least 110°.  You dishwasher at home sanitizes dishes with hot water or not at all. It has its own heating element.  And also it uses less water. This is why it takes much longer.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the same element that heats during the drying stage heats the water for the sanitize stage</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your machine. Most all have some kind of heater if they have a sanitizing cycle. The heating capacity does vary however. </p>
<p>Many EU models don’t have large heating elements AFAIK (like BOSCH and Electrolux).so they don’t do well at heating cold tap water.  The plus side to this, it relies on your hot water heater and since there’s no element in the tub plastics can be washed on the bottom. The downside is you need rinse aid to dry. </p>
<p>Most of the other brands (sold in US) have large heating elements at the bottom of the tub which is used to heat the water and dry the dishes. </p>
<p>With my Bosch - we run the sink hot water until it’s hot to help speed up the heating and reduce the work the dishwasher must do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither washing machines nor dishwashers are connected to the hot water in the EU. They always heat cold water so the heating elements are appropriate. Connecting appliances to hot water is a US thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never been happier with a dishwasher than with our Bosch.  I love that it has no heating element.  I love that it is ridiculously quiet.  If you don't listen very carefully, you can't even tell it is running.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone I've ever owned uses the cold water line. Hot water tanks aren't supposed to be sanitizing hot anyway, they only heat water to between 100-110 degrees-ish anyway, otherwise you'd have a lot of people getting scalded.</p></div>		</li>
