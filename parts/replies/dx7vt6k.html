			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel the same way, but I've experienced a few tv's that seem to flicker black frames during play, which is the weirdest thing.  It would make me cautious about buying a used TV and not being able to test it.</p>
<p>I've yet to own one that does that, but my parents own a high end Samsung TV that looks atrocious, almost as if game mode was a complete afterthought. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Introducing flicker is a measure to reduce motion blur. It is not so much that they introduce black frames and more a matter of switching off the backlight while the display loads a new image, so the pixels only light up momentarily and do not smear across your retina while your eyes are moving across the screen to follow a moving object. Of course, since common TV refresh rates are too slow for flicker to be imperceptible, the utility is questionable, and different people react to it differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was it really a high end one? My parents have a mediocre Samsung TV and the image quality is just awful. All the extra settings were tuned trying to compensate for the crap display in the TV, but game mode bypassed it all and looks flat and terrible. The other settings didn't make it better, just... bolder. But then my Samsung is a pretty decent model and game mode is gorgeous.</p>
<p>Foe the crappy TVs, it's the equivalent of turning up a shitty stereo and thinking it sounds good just because it's loud.</p>
<p>If it really was a decent TV, they might be doing some built-in calibration stuff to suit a specific style of panel that gets disabled in game mode?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point.  I know they paid upwards for $3500 for it, but price isn't ways a measure of quality.  I'm assuming it couldn't have been bad, but I know it wasn't cheap and it's only a few years old.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot to mention sharpness.  It seems to me that every TV has a sharpness setting which will, if you don't turn it all the way down to zero, will add horrid ringing to all the contrasty boundaries in the image.  Sure, that makes images jump out in the showroom but it's not what I want at home.  Please just give us the pixels the content creators intended.</p>
<p>The exception to this is extra frames.  I <em>like</em> the soap opera effect and 24&#8239;fps is <em>not</em> enough.  Movies up-sampled to 60&#8239;fps look more realistic to me, though the glitches where the interpolated frames get it wrong are sometimes annoying.  They should start releasing up-sampled movies at 60&#8239;fps which could be much higher in quality than the up-sampling a TV can do in a fraction of a second.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly but want to say that on some TV's if you set this to zero it starts to go back around into processed fuckery. I get the best picture from my current TV by setting it to 20/100 instead of 0/100.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. TVs generally make things look worse when they add processing to the image. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get to watch some of the finest minds in the biz set to work on film/video and absolutely transform it into something truly beautiful. These guys make serious money as masters of their craft. They sit down in expensive suites, on top of the line hardware, driving $20k computers with $40k dashboards and focus for hours; tweaking values, pushing colors, building emotion, creating art. Every minute decision is devoted to the goal of not just making every pixel look as good as possible, but making it all work as one complete whole.</p>
<p>....then your fuckin' TV goes &quot;pssh, hold my beer. I can do this WAY better.&quot;</p>
<p>It's ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it's not even only TVs that do this.  I just found that my cheap-and-nasty BluRay/DVD player has all the same contrast/brightness/sharpness crap that my TV has.  I have to go and turn all that processing off in two places.</p></div>		</li>
