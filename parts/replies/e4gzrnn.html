			<div class="markdown"><p>So what happens to the uv rays. Do they just pass through a dead body?</p>
<p>What is it that makes us absorb them when alive? Do our cells actively &quot;grab&quot; the photons or is there a passive activity?</p>
<p>I always thought absorption was density related. Must be wrong though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you die your cells do not immediately die, but shortly afterwards as they cannot replenish nutrients from your blood.  This is why organ donation is possible, but must be done quickly.</p>
<p>So if a person is left out in the sun right after they die, then their skin would produce some (read: very little) melanin. How much depends on an enormous variety of factors but it's highly unlikely that enough melanin would be produced before cell death that it would create a tanning effect on the deceased.</p>
<p>UV rays are still absorbed by the body even after somebody dies. The energy from these rays cooks the cells they come into contact with like they normally do while we are alive. While technically a sunburn, we wouldn't see the normal bright red swelling that we associate with sunburns because there's no blood flow in the deceased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UV rays are absorbed by the cells still, just like any other matter would.  They just don't react to it, at least not helpfully (they will be somewhat damaged).</p>
<p>And it's not density related, it's color related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Absorption (and thus color) is concentration dependent... so it may be appropriate to refer to it as melanin density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our bodies, like most things with mass, would still block and absorb the UV rays. Even clouds are able to provide just a bit of protection from UV rays. What's relevant in this case is that melanocytes in the body are dead, thus they cannot secrete melanin in response to detecting UV rays.</p></div>		</li>
