			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the term &quot;object&quot; belongs in the realm of psychology, linguistics, or perhaps computer-vision, but certainly not physics. It's a useful abstraction that allows us to talk about huge collections of atoms in a meaningful way and it makes newtonian physics a lot easier, but it isn't based on physical properties in a consistent and meaningful way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same idea, but gas clouds are much more localized, yet can still huge – are they an object? </p>
<p>What I haven't seen mentioned is that it seems as though density plays a role – speaking only theoretically, massive objects can be <em>very</em> massive without collapsing into into a black hole if they're large enough that their density never allows gravity to be strong enough to create a singularity, correct? Or am I completely off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My take on that is if the gas cloud really is so isolated from everything that it is a singular object, it will still have some gravity effects and eventually condense into a star of some sort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the key factor is going to be density. But for any given density, there will be some volume which causes the object to collapse into a black hole. </p>
<p>An object of uniform density increases in mass proportionally to the cube of its radius, and the Schwartzchild radius is proportionate to the mass. There is eventually some radius where the mass catches up, even if the density is very small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, maybe then, that mass, or well, radius^3, <em>is</em> actually the maximum size (if one were to take the limit as density -&gt; 0)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Density is the only thing that causes somethng to collapse into a black hole (i.e. a singularity). Mass doesn't really have anything to do with it, things with super high density just happen to typically have a super high mass (because usually we are talking about the final stages of big stars).</p>
<p>You can take a few grams of matter and compress it until it forms a black hole, or you can have entire galaxies that are super massive but so spread out that they stay stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could perhaps argue that an assemblage of galaxies is part of the same &quot;unit&quot; if they are gravitationally bound to each other, ie, if they are not moving at escape velocity relative to each other.</p>
<p>This actually does provide a fuzzy sort of &quot;maximum size limit&quot; thanks to the continuing expansion of space due to the big bang. It's possible for galaxies to be far enough apart that the space between them is expanding faster than their mutual gravity is pulling them toward each other, and thus they will eventually fall away from each other beyond their observable horizons.</p>
<p>This maximum size is dependent on how much mass the cluster has, though, so it's not really a hard and fast number.</p></div>		</li>
