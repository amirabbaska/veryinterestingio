			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! We are very excited about this discovery as well. Our data contained a secondary signal at a longer period but our campaign didn't last long enough to confirm it. We will probably have to run another campaign to check that one out. As regards the name of the planet we have discovered, it will probably remain &quot;Proxima b&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To complete the type of names that astronomers like, such as &quot;Proxima b&quot; or &quot;HD189733b&quot;, the International Astronomical Union launched in 2014 a naming contest for a bunch of exoplanets: <a href="http://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1404/" target="_blank">http://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1404/</a>.
It is likely that they will repeat the experience in the future and that Proxima b will be among the planets to baptise. So it's good that some of you already have names in mind!</p></div>		</li>
