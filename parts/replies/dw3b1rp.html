			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the balloon is that while the expanding surface is a good approximation, it’s still only 2D.  The balloon still gives the impression that all the galaxies are hurtling away from some central point in the volume, which is not the case with the universe.</p>
<p>A slightly better analogy I’ve heard is raisins suspended in raisin bread dough, as it cooks and expands.  In this case the whole thing is expanding in every direction and every raisin gets simultaneously further from every other raisin in all three dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always understood that there is no space that it's expanding in to, rather space is being made in nothingness. It reminds me of when people try to comprehend being blind. We always assume you will see black/darkness, when in actuality there is <em>nothing</em> to be seen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a small modification, the answer is kind of there.</p>
<p>Imagine that elastic band is infinitely long.  And it is still being stretched. Continually.</p>
<p>To the ants, their entire universe - everything that every was, has, and can be - is on that elastic band.  There is <em>nothing</em> outside of it to them.  There are no scientific experiments they can perform in their elastic band universe that will give them information about the human (with infinitely long arms) stretching the elastic band.</p>
<p>So what is the infinitely long band stretching into?  Itself.  Infinty multiplied by 2 is still infinity.  In fact, as far as infinities go, those 2 infinities are the exact same size.</p>
<p>&quot;Expansion&quot; is a weird word because it means &quot;the act of becoming larger&quot;. And large sounds like you can compare it's size from before and after. One being smaller than the other.  But that's not what's happening.  The better way to describe it in terms of physics is &quot;the universe is becoming less dense&quot;. Things are moving farther apart.  There is more space between them than there was in the past.</p>
<p>Don't think of the universe as something you can be outside, looking in on, watching it expand into anything. You are part of the universe. <em>Everything</em> is part of the universe.  If there were <em>something</em> the universe was expanding into, then that <em>something</em> is a part of <em>everything</em>, so that <em>something</em> is also part of the universe. Thats what people mean when they say the universe is expanding into itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct. It doesn't. It's just an analogy to replace the elastic band because that analogy only visualizes two points instead of the 3d space which we live in where as the balloon thing you can have three points and see that the three points get more spread out for A&lt;-&gt;B, B&lt;-&gt;C, A&lt;-&gt;C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really helpful analogy, thank you. Am I understanding it correctly if I say we may never see/travel beyond our observable universe because of the expansion rate unless we come up w/ FTL travel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically yes. </p>
<p>Another interesting effect of this expansion is that our observable universe is shrinking. Eventually nothing will be able to interact with anything else because everything will be outside the cosmic horizon for everything else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t this is only true for “anything” given accelerating expansion? (Something I don’t think had been mentioned) My understanding is that under the current rate of expansion, local forces are dominant enough to keep things together. (So while distant galaxies are getting further from one another, their local radii are not impacted)</p></div>		</li>
