			<div class="markdown"><p>Hardy har har. The joke about British food being bad holds as much truth as the bad teeth meme. </p>
<p>Our food is very tasty and homely. Just because we don't serve food in tiny portions with artsy drizzle we get looked down on. </p>
<p>French cooking is basically the same basics of meat and veg, meat in sauce, sliced potatoe in fat...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that but I think British cooking has become so engrained into western food people take it for granted. They took over the world looking for tea and spices so like cookies with cinnamon and ginger in them, sausages with clove and mace...fucking pepper. Western food has no idea how much of it came from Britain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom's British and I love British food. It's just hearty and simple, that's why it gets shit on. It's working man food, not the fancy nose in the air food of French. You've got fish and potatoes? Fish &amp; Chips. Beef, veg, potatoes? Sheppard's Pie. Meat and dough? Pie. I'll take a bangers &amp; mash over a duck l'orange any day of the week.</p></div>		</li>
