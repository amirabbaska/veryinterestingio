			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere in the beginning of the book &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, the author uses an analogy that painted a wonderfully accurate picture of anxiety.  It's like constantly knowing you are being followed and stalked by a monster.  You can never actually fully SEE the monster, but you know he's there...  you sort of catch it out of the corner of your eye every once and awhile, so you're constantly looking over your shoulder, trying to run and hide from it.</p>
<p>EDIT:  a word</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relevant HOL quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get a better idea try this: focus on these words, and whatever you do don't let your eyes wander past the perimeter of this page. Now imagine just beyond your peripheral vision, maybe behind you, maybe to the side of you, maybe even in front of you, but right where you can't see it, something is quietly closing in on you, so quiet in fact you can only hear it as silence. Find those pockets without sound. That's where it is. Right at this moment. But don't look. Keep your eyes here. Now take a deep breath. Go ahead, take an even deeper one. Only this time as you exhale try to imagine how fast it will happen, how hard it's gonna hit you, how many times it will stab your jugular with its teeth or are they nails?, don't worry, that particular detail doesn't matter, because before you have time to process that you should be moving, you should be running, you should at the very least be flinging up your arms-you sure as hell should be getting rid of this book-you won't have time to even scream.</p>
<p>Don't look.</p>
<p>I didn't.</p>
<p>Of course I looked.</p>
<p>I looked so fucking fast I should of ended up wearing one of those neck braces for whiplash.</p>

<p>Such a good book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem I have with anxiety attacks is that if I think about how awful they are, it's entirely possible I can induce one.  I had to do breathing exercises just to type this.  So I would modify the monster tale to say that the monster views your thoughts about him as an invitation to attack... and you know about this, so you try not to think about the monster, but telling yourself not to think about an object is still a form of reflecting on said object.  </p>
<p>Even the slightest thought can send me into a whirlwind pulling negativity toward me until I feel like I need to escape... but escape from what?  There's nothing harassing me, but me.  How does one escape from their self?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stop fighting it. Allow yourself to think about the anxiety/panic and remind yourself if it happens, it's okay. Your life won't end, it won't last forever, it'll pass. </p>
<p>I had/have similar anxiety/panic attacks as well as clinical OCD and psychophysiological insomnia (which is not being able to fall asleep because your worrying too much about not being able to fall asleep)... </p>
<p>The OCD is mostly in remission and I rarely get panic attacks but when I do, I hold my breath. I don't care where I am, who I'm with or how important the situation is that I'm in... I hold my breath for as long as I can. And then exhale. Do it again. And again. Until I'm no longer hyperventilating. </p>
<p>We induce the physical symptoms and signs of panic by over-breathing so we're getting too much oxygen and by taking deep breaths over and over, no matter how much your body fighting you do take rapid breaths or get up to escape, you must hold you breath which will resolve the overwhelming sensations of escape/fear/terror. It's a skill you develop and honestly, it's still always hard. It never gets easier except that I have repeated memories now of it being successful even with the worst panic moments so I have the confidence that works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm basically the same way. If I just think about anxiety or depression I can induce anxiety or depression. And it feels like every time I suddenly go &quot;wow, gosh, I haven't felt bad in a long time&quot; suddenly it comes rushing back.</p>
<p>Anxiety is a seriously strange thing, and has had a tremendous impact on my daily life since I first experienced it two years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much this, I'm in a dead end job and don't care about moving out of it because of my anxiety I don't like speaking to others and work alone other than a couple of people that I speak to within the office. Hate being asked to change my routine so every day is pretty much the same, don't drive and I'm 24 have started lessons but even they are hard to do without panicking about them even tho I'm fine once I get in the car and get the lesson done.</p>
<p>Anything outside a daily routine is extremely hard to do. I have had medication that has helped but never helps for the long term so no longer bother with it.</p></div>		</li>
