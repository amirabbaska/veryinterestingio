<p>I buy both rigid aluminum and aluminum foil as a part of my job. Rigid aluminum is much thicker and can tolerate more impurities. They use tons and tons of UBC (used beverage cans) mixed with ingot to make rigid aluminum (depending on the alloy). Edit: they do this in the States and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The foil I buy is converter foil, which is very thin. In fact, the thinnest gauges are simply not made in the US, because of the difficulty involved. Right now, there is no choice but to buy overseas. Converter foil has to be made from ingot, not UBC. This foil gets laminated (glued) to paper, film, and/or other materials and as such, cannot be recycled. There is not capacity or quality needed to source more than a small fraction of the foil my company needs domestically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah probably.  The used beverage cans come in with their inks on and all that burns off and you're left with just the silver color.</p>
<p>It would just take SO MUCH converter foil to remake the foil I can't imagine it would be worth it.  Especially since you would have to use it to make something 10-20 times thicker than it was, since you can't use recycled material for thinner foil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  And lots of other flexible packaging applications.  Foil is a great barrier and as such is used in LOTS of packaging.  Fast food wrappers, liners for cans, label stock...the list goes on and on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's unfortunately one of the dirty secrets of metal recycling. It's often difficult to melt something like a car and reuse the metal to make a new car. Once the various alloys have been made, the metals can't be easily melted into their raw components.</p>
<p>So a lot of recycled metals get down cycled instead of recycled</p></div>		</li>
