			<div class="markdown"><p>Cysts are so grim.</p>
<p>I had one come up behind my ear and it was there for months. A fairly hard and huge ball of shit just sat behind my ear. It wasn't painful or anything so I wasn't too concerned.</p>
<p>Eventually I thought fuck it and bathed it in some hot water for 20 minutes, sterilized a pin and gently cut the top before giving it a squeeze over the sink.</p>
<p>Fuck me, the explosion was palpable. Blood and pus all over the mirror, the wall, the sink. Everywhere. It actually made a fizzing noise as it came out. It was glorious.</p>
<p>I more recently had another one come up behind the other ear which was definitely infected. It came up super-fast, hurt like fuck and one side of my face was red hot. Plus a lymph node in my neck was all swollen. Didn't fuck around with that one and got some antibiotics to clear it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will definitely try cleaning more thoroughly. Problem is I play with my earlobes when I’m nervous/anxious (all the time) so that probably doesn’t help much. </p></div>		</li>
