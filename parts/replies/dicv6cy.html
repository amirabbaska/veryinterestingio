			<div class="markdown"><p>I did an &quot;accidental hack&quot; like this years ago; in 2005 I was setting up something in PHP that let people quickly generate HTML layouts and store the result on an SQL server.  I was also brand new at PHP.  There was no account verification or typing password twice, you did the layout by drag and drop &amp; put in a username and password to lock the page so you could edit it later.  I was very early in development &amp; put it out for people to test as proof of concept, and as I was going through the data later I realized that there was an extremely high likelihood that the user names &amp; passwords (which I didn't bother to encrypt since it was so early in development &amp; I didn't know what I was doing) would probably work on other sites.  Because I was providing a professional looking webpage with a user name &amp; password, and most people don't have or use multiple passwords or unique password per site, something as innocuous as this is a great way to farm passwords.</p></div>		</li>
