			<div class="markdown"><p>I like how you try to diminish their worth with tables and salt of all things. Tables. Salt. Really? This was a time of oral tradition, there was no reason for table. Bread is hand held, why not walk around and socialize when you eat? Or eat alone, wherever you want, away from a table? Salt isn't a necessity in itself either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ergot contains Lysergamines, the substance class which Lysergic Acid is synthesized from. It is toxic and DOES NOT replicate the effects of LSD in any truly meaningful way. In fact, there are theories that stories of werewolves were inspired by reports of ergot poisoning: people becoming so sick and delirious they no longer acted with human manners. </p>
<p>Not saying you're wrong though: I compare it to the effects of Amanita mushrooms and Psilocybin mushrooms. The former is toxic and causes a delirious state while the latter is perfectly safe, and invokes a clear-headed psychedelic state. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a theory, there's nothing that proves it.</p>
<p>The general idea is that Plato took part in the Eleusinian Mysteries, an ancient greek religious practice, where the initiation included a ritual drink called the kykeon. Albert Hoffman, the inventor of LSD, among other individuals argue that kykeon was composed of barley infected with ergot fungus, which contains an alkaloid analogous to LSD. If the ergot was in sufficient quantity and prepared, it could produce psychoactive symptoms in consumers. Supporting evidence includes evidence that ergot grew in a field where Plato and his colleagues were believed to gather their barley from.</p>
<p>It's impossible to know if they tripped out or not, but it's likely they did, given that it only takes one dude to figure it out before they can reproduce results and trip at every ritual. Of course, there's the chance that they never experienced psychoactive drugs, but that's just difficult to do, people always find a way to trip out. </p>
<p>Example: my russian friend would go into the woods and eat ants to trip out when he was kid. As soon as he figured out what it was that made him feel like that, he told his friends and they all did it too, and bam. Everyone's (not literally) eating ants now (in that town)</p>
