			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Tesla recently had this problem one of their cars. The design of your car is such that when opening any and even all windows, the aerodynamics of your car still create buffeting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this in my 2010 Ram crew cab.  I get a horrid shuttering/pulsating problem.  Bad enough to shake the entire truck and make the noise.  It only doesn't happen with conditions with no wind (which is **extremely rare where I'm at) or the wind is straight on.  At least 2 of the windows have to be down at least 3 inches.  I've tried staggering the windows to kill the effect but it doesn't help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the european honda civic is prone to this as well. It's a very aerodynamic car, and a hatchback, which I think contributes.</p></div>		</li>
