			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a pretty reasonable assumption for a standing jump - the amount of force your muscles can exert isn't dependent on gravity.</p>
<p>For something like a running jump, where you're storing energy in tendons and ligaments and then releasing it at the same time as you jump, it's possible that it wouldn't be the same velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but if the force your muscles exert is the same and the counteracting force of gravity during acceleration is lowered, isn't it reasonable to think you'd end up with a higher velocity post-acceleration?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that you would definitely be able to attain a higher launch velocity at lower gravity. Say you have a mass of 70 kg and are able to leg press with a force of 1400 N. On earth while you jump you would have a roughly 700 N force pulling you down and a 1400 N force pushing you up, netting a 700 N upward force causing you to accelerate upwards at 10m/s^2 while pressing off. On mars you would only have a 210 N force pulling you down but your muscles can still max out at 1400 N so you have a net 1190 N upward force causing you to accelerate at 17m/s^2 during your launch. If you were to coil for 1 m in your jump then on earth it would take you .447s to jump and would attain a launch velocity of 4.47 m/s compared to mars where it would only take you .343 seconds to jump and you would attain a launch velocity of 5.83 m/s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are non-linearities. Consider increasing gravity: rather than being able to jump ever smaller amounts, eventually your muscles will not be able to lift you up from the pre-jump posture in which your knees are slightly bent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is simpler with conservation of energy. Since initial velocity is assumed to be constant, 1/2mv^2 is constant. Let h me the height of the jump on Earth and h' be the height of the jump on a planet with gravitational acceleration a*g.</p>
<pre><code>mgh = 1/2mv^2 = magh'
h = ah'
h' = h/a</code></pre></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This 100%</p>
<p>You have to assume someone can't jump high enough to change the gravitational force though. Any distance change between the masses decreases exponentially but can usually assume it's negligible.</p></div>		</li>
