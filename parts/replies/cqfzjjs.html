			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this has been quite informative.</p>
<p>Can I ask - is it possible, and if so how easy is it, to change a CMOS battery? I am pretty sure mine in my laptop is fried - my clock can no longer sync to time correctly and as such I can't use google/youtube/search engines in general, log in to reddit (have to use my phone) or make purchases because my laptop thinks my network is &quot;insecure&quot; owing to the date and time being so out of whack.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you can change em, theyre the flat disc batteries used in watches, open your laptop, look at what kind of battery it is, then buy a replacement, and swap it out. </p>
<p>You should be able to set the clock on the OS level even w/ a dead CMOS battery (or set it to autoupdate via a timeserver) so that you can get around the SSL certificate issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most (not all) newer laptops use different types of batteries than the button type used in desktops. The easiest way to find out which your laptop needs and how to replace it is to Google &quot;laptop brand model number CMOS battery replacement&quot;. There are lots of YouTube videos showing how to do it. The difficulty depends on the laptop. Some are pretty easy, requiring just the removal of the memory cover. Others are more extensive, but still totally do-able by just about anyone. Just be patient, take you time and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>Also, most CMOS batteries are available on eBay and are pretty inexpensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the meantime, you could just set the date and time manually. There should be something in &quot;settings&quot; or &quot;Control panel&quot; for that.</p></div>		</li>
