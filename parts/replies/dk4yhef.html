<p>&quot;The “use” or “role” of an organism in nature is often poorly understood, and the perspective is often anthropomorphic, warned Lorenzo Prendini, associate curator of invertebrate zoology at the American Museum of Natural History. That said, Dr. Prendini offered some points of view on how deer ticks interact with other organisms, especially in population control.</p>
<p>Ticks are seldom a significant source of nutrition, Dr. Prendini said. Mites or nematodes and perhaps fungi might feed on them, he said, and they would form part of the diet of birds, though probably an insignificant one in the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important, ticks are agents of disease, Dr. Prendini said. They feed on the blood of the deer, and in the process transmit disease-causing micro-organisms called spirochetes. The ticks, as the primary hosts of the spirochetes, are an essential stage in their life cycle, and without them the spirochetes could not reach their secondary hosts, the deer.</p>
<p>“Diseases like these weed out sick or infirm individuals in the host population” — the deer, Dr. Prendini said. “Is that a good thing? Maybe.”</p>
<p>Taken with other factors, like predation, “it might keep host populations within the carrying capacity of the land,” he said, possibly by reducing overgrazing and other forms of destruction to vegetation.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
