			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. To add, linguists know that languages fit into certain patterns based on, for example, the order of nouns and verbs in a sentence, or whether the adjective goes before or after the noun. By tracing languages through history, they can work out the patterns of the past based on the languages' modern descendants.</p>
<p>They can even make good guesses about pronunciation using historical records (sometimes people actually wrote, &quot;it's pronounced by doing this with your mouth&quot;) and some clever clues (like the meter or rhyme scheme of old poetry).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Languages are still considered kind of a continuum.<br />
There's no bright line between a dialect and a language.<br />
Swedish is closer to Danish than, say Geordie English is to African American Vernacular English (eEbonics).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about that though is that, as I understand it, Hieroglyphics are not so much based on noun/verb in the way we think of most written languages today (I could be wrong tho) so that was one reason it was so hard to decipher.</p>
<p>But in terms of unknown languages, here's a pretty basic example from Hebrew: Here's the first part of a Hebrew worship song (both transliterated and translated into English):</p>
<pre><code>Ein kelohenu, ein kadonenu,
ein kemalkenu, ein kemoshi'enu.
Mi chelohenu, mi chadonenu,
mi chemalkenu, mi chemoshi'enu.
Node lelohenu, node ladonenu,
node lemalkenu, node lemoshi'enu,
Baruch Elohenu, baruch Adonenu,
baruch Malkenu, baruch Moshi'enu.
Atah hu Elohenu, atah hu Adonenu,
atah hu Malkenu,
atah hu Moshi'enu.

There is none like our God, There is none like our Lord,
There is none like our King, There is none like our Savior.
Who is like our God? Who is like our Lord?
Who is like our King? Who is like our Savior?
Let us thank our God, Let us thank our Lord,
Let us thank our King, Let us thank our Savior.
Blessed be our God, Blessed be our Lord,
Blessed be our King, Blessed be our Savior.
You are our God, You are our Lord,
You are our King,
You are our Savior.</code></pre>
<p>I think almost everyone here could probably piece together the obvious translations for pretty much every word. It opens with &quot;Ein [something]&quot; four times and the English is &quot;there is none [something]&quot; so it's logical to conclude that Ein = there is none. You just extrapolate from things like that.</p>
<p>This is the key benefit to having the Rosetta Stone - Hieroglyphics and two two other languages that were known - the other two let us confirm that they said the same thing as each other (thus the Hieroglyphics probably did too) and also allowed us to apply principles like the foregoing to try to identify what words the symbols may have represented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my favorite videos of all time is a couple of guys taking about not just doing Shakespeare in old English, but with his accent. It creates all sorts of baudy puns that just aren't there otherwise. Their example was a line from Henry V about his ships coming in to port, but when said with his accent also implied his sailors... coming in to port. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly but this illustrates how it can happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 19:24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hebrew word for camel and rope are 1 very similar looking letter apart. The passage still gets its point across while being obviously a bad translation or typo. That mistranslation has been accepted and reprinted millions of times for thousands of years. There are almost certainly identical errors in translated dead languages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just know of one, which doesn't 100% fit: Virgin Mary. </p>
<p>Martin Luther translated &quot;young woman&quot; from Hebrew not into &quot;junge Frau&quot;, but into &quot;Jungfrau&quot;, which is how you say virgin in German. That means the Bible never actually claimed that Mary was a virgin.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is accurate (as I'm definitely no Bible historian), but it is what one of my religion teachers taught us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How was the ability to read it all lost, I wonder?  If you look at ancient Egyptian monuments, they're <em>covered</em> in the stuff.  It's <em>everywhere.</em>  And if I'm reading my history right, Egypt has been continuously occupied/settled for most of recorded history.  It's not like it <em>was</em> settled then we went away for a couple thousand years and rediscovered it.  It's always been there!  If you think about it, humans had to go, in a couple generations, from everybody or the majority of people being able to read/interpret it, to <em>nobody</em> being able to read/interpret it.  And we forget how vital Egypt was to the north African/Mediterranean trade for literally <em>all</em> of history.  </p>
<p>Like, aren't there still people who can read Inca/Aztec and its' been passed down from generation to generation?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Egypt came under Persian, then Greek, then Roman rule, each of which use phonetic alphabets in writing. These alphabets were probably politically pressured into use, and even if they weren't they were easier for paper/papyrus writing, so they slowly dropped out of use over generations. It's not too different from immigrants who lose their native tongue over a few generations. </p>
<p>Edit: Another important thing to consider is that in early civilizations literacy was usually very low. Rulers, politicians and priests we're the only ones who could be expected to read and write, so completely eliminating and replacing a writing system was much &quot;simpler.&quot; It's not like you needed to convert an entire population, just a very small subset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ancient Egypt had an alphabet that we refer to as &quot;hieratic&quot; used for functional documents and correspondence by the priests/government that evolved into &quot;demotic&quot; used by everyone. Hieratic was linguistically the same as Hieroglyphic, but with writable characters instead of pictograms. Hieratic and demotic scripts were still in use during the ptolmeic and Roman periods, and were even used intermittently until the Islamic period. During the Islamic period, anything pagan was destroyed or ignored. This is when the great pyramid's casing stones were taken for building, and the Sphinx was mutilated.</p></div>		</li>
