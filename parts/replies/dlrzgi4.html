			<div class="markdown"><p>In relation to your curiosity, I find this to be fun and relevant information.  Exercising is a form of injury infliction,  when you exercise you essentially create micro tears and muscle breakdown.  Your body then uses calories on top of your basal metabolic rate to facilitate the muscle damage repair.  Not only do you repair this muscle but it grows more robust to prevent that same injury from occurring again from the same amount of work output.  Even your bones will grow thicker and more robust in response to the torque applied to the structures.  (Best prevention and reversal for osteoporosis is weight lifting anything even a couple pounds heavier than what your body is used to). All this burns calories due to self inflicted micro injuries. </p>
<p>Edit: Yeah,  I like biology not grammar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muscle growth (I don't know about bone) is a form of microinjury, but weight loss of the average fat molecule (C55H104O6) is really just combining it with 78O2 and exhaling/pissing 55CO2 and 52H2O out.  And no, I saw it on a Ted video. </p></div>		</li>

<p>is the hard limit the amount of stuff you can physically get in there or the body's ability to process it once it's inside? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the condition, but a lot of times surgeries requires patients to be NPO (nothing by mouth) and then after surgeries MDs usually like to advance diet from clear liquids, full liquids, low fiber, etc. These advancing diets tend to be low in calories (think jello, soups). That in combination of having to stop the feeds for procedures and test, and volume limitation (can only concentrate so much). That said, there are some emerging research on whether it's good to feed patients on critical condition or not, so I find that interesting. Source: am dietitian </p>
<p>EDIT: I guess I answered this question for patients who can eat (usually not in ICU who are tube feed dependent). For tube-fed patients, yes, stopping feeds is the major factor in limited nutrition intake. </p>
<p>EDIT2 clarification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good info. For patients with a secure airway in the icu (breathing tube), I don't think there's reason to stop feeds for surgery, unless the surgery involves the GI system. They can't aspirate, which is the main reason for npo guidelines. We try to start feeds early as possible in the icu, if they are hemodynamically stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah more of a volume limitation, but a icu dietician/nutrionist would have a better answer. Part of the problem is stopping feeds for frequent surgery and dressing changes under sedation (which we try not to stop feeds for).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speech &amp; swallowing therapist here. I work with adults who have feeding tubes. There are two ways feeding tubes work. First is a continuous drip into the stomach, controlled at a certain rate (volume/hour usually 50-80 cc/hr). The second is called &quot;bolus&quot; feeds, where a set volume is put in all at once (e.g., 400 mL 4x/day).</p>
<p>In either scenario there is a volume limit. A stomach can only hold so much based on your body size. </p>
<p>The other, less obvious issue is that even if you jack up the rate or volume of feeding a person receives per day, it doesn't correlate directly to them gaining weight.</p>
<p>Usually, if someone sick enough to need a feeding tube, there are systemic things going on: cancer, dementia, ALS, Parkinsons... How I usually explain it to my patients and their families is that the person is sick and part of the disease means they can't abosrb nutrition like a healthy person does. Even if we keep putting food in them, their body isn't absorbing it.</p>
<p>So long answer to your short question... the answer is both. there is a limit to the stuff that physically get into a body. And there is often a limit to what is being absorbed due to the person's medical condition. I hope this makes sense and feel free to ask if you have any other questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, all the above. Malnutrition can lead to infections, progression of disease and poorly healing wounds.</p>
