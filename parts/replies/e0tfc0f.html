			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know what you’re referencing with “they”, but an animal like a Tardigrade can do this indefinitely (forever as far as we know.)! Which is why they have been called ‘biological immortals’ when a properly hydrated specimen has a lifespan of only a few months.</p>
<p>Edit: Biological immortals are truly fascinating. Some species of jellyfish actually revert back to sexual immaturity and go through sexual development again and again. Meaning, however unlikely, some jellyfish could be over 100,000,000 years old and may have lived through the mass extinction event that killed the non-avian dinosaurs.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not actually likely, seeing as how the dinosaur extinction event was 65 million years ago. </p></div>		</li>
