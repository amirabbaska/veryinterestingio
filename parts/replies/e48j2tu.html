<blockquote>
<p>How do they get the source files on their pcs so they can crack them ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is why people are answering how to reverse engineer the game to crack it. Because the cracker <em>doesn't</em> &quot;get the source files on their pc&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

I read &quot;...get said games to crack?&quot; as &quot;How do you make the game security break?&quot; rather than what I now understand as &quot;How do you get the games in order to crack them?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to be fair, the &quot;how do you crack a game&quot; answer is far more interesting than &quot;where do you get the game to crack it&quot;. seems like common sense that someone would just buy it, steal it, or manage to have an in with someone somewhere who could procure it for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in the 90s magazines got pre release copies. thats a good place to start. also working at the disc manufacturer always was pretty great because you were faster than the guys over at the game magazines. and some companies were founded by ex crackers who use scene releases as advertising. also the scene trades a lot. one guy has an iso and gets download slots and traffic ...first on BBS, later ftp. you cant steal a firstrelease at gamestop. and the release points is what its all about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the question is worded pretty poorly.</p>
<p>It could be read as &quot;How do you crack a game&quot; (how do you get it to crack), rather than &quot;Where do you obtain a game before you crack it?&quot; (how do you get it <em>before</em> you crack it) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Very confusing.</p>
<p>And the answer to the actual question is pretty simple - if it's an already released game, buy it. If it's a pre-release - steal it. And they almost never get the source code, just the binary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Textfiles is awesome, but it really lacks _really_ old information. I'd love to find something from the takedown of the Super Pirates of Minneapolis, supposedly the first major pirate bust in the US (in like 1980). I remember the kids/20 somethings that got busted were recruited into the FBI, but they weren't all that competent, as the Midwest Pirate's Guild basically formed from their ashes and operated at least into the late 1980s right under their noses (I got out of the scene mid-1980s, but I had friends in it). I helped establish connections between the National Distributor's Club and the Pacific Coast Pirate's Guild (friends in the Midwest, relatives in California). AFAIK, the MPG never got taken down, but I remember a member called Incognito got busted by the Secret Service (because by then it was considered a financial crime, so SS jurisdiction) and I'm pretty sure his story was on text files. Apple Bandit operated a multi-line BBS for years called the Safehouse pretty much under the noses of the FBI. The FBI guy that came to my school demonstrated a program I cracked when I was 12 or 13 and I though for sure I was busted, but he profiled the cracker as 18-25 and I almost burst out laughing.</p>
<p>As for how we got games, most often one of us bought it (or got as a birthday/Christmas gift), but occasionally we'd get a leak. I remember getting a trade show copy of a game marked &quot;incomplete&quot; but it was the full game with a simple disable and had no copy protection, so it made cracking the real game a breeze (not 100% sure, soooo long ago, I think it was Stellar 7 or a port of it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My best suggestion is to start up with reading about Razor 1911 and Branch out. They're seen as still the oldest active warez and cracking group, and have been around long enough for the explosion of internet piracy.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, prior to the WWW you had Usenet groups where files were being swapped and passed around. Personally, I came into the &quot;scene&quot; late 90s once CD-rips and cracking were a big deal. There was of course, P2P applications like Napster and WinMX where music was being widely distributed, but by that point the main hubs were IRC and FTP hosts for everything else.</p>
<p>Essentially, you would hang out in IRC channels long enough to be approached to see if you were useful in a way. That might mean having access to a fast connection like a T1 or T3. Keep in mind, at that time 56k was still dominant so downloading could take literally days and you were a God if you had access to a university or Enterprise network. Others might go purchase games from the store and do 1:1 rips to pass onto the group. Some might steal CD-keys.</p>
<p>There's were thousands of &quot;Warez&quot; and &quot;crack&quot; groups and you could try your hand at their public channels to get a private invite. It felt very wild wild West, and very exciting. I was a kid at this point, but I also had a very fast Internet connection (being one of the first broadband adopters). I also had a big library of games that I ripped and uploaded for a few groups, some on the day of released,, and one group being Razor 1911 (although I couldn't actually be sure at the time if they were real so... Take it for what you will).</p>
<p>At some point, I started running my own 24/7 FTP server where invited users could upload w/e they wanted and in return I had access to their repo. Like BT, you had up/dl ratios to maintain or risk being slowed down. You also started seeing a huge rise in crack websites who would host CD-keys and patches (Astalavista is a nice starting point).</p>
<p>I was young (and stupid) at the time and received my fair share of copyright threats. I also thought I was &quot;way deeper&quot; in the shit than I really ever was. These groups operate with a very small core number and maintain secrecy. There's also fascinating components of groups like crack-music and ASCII art.</p>
<p>I fell out of gaming after high school and shut down a custom PC store that I owned and ran. I love Spotify, but god there is something appealing about waiting 3 hours to get that one Eminem hit.</p></div>		</li>
