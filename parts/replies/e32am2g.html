			<div class="markdown"><p>Honda had a problem with this with the mid-90s Civics and Accords. Too many of them shared a key pattern, and the keys didn't use microchips. My mom's '97 Civic was stolen (edit: in late 2000) by someone who would go around trying their key on every Civic and Accord they saw. A month or two later, the police ended up finding more than a dozen cars abandoned under a freeway overpass. They were all in perfect working condition and there was no sign of forced entry. The only bits missing were the airbags and I think some of the catalytic converters. (It was explained to me that airbags were deployed with explosive charges, hence selling the explosives on the black market or something, but I dunno how correct that is.)</p>
<p>I ended up inheriting the car when I got older. One night, I walked to my car in the parking lot at my university and tried to unlock it. The key wasn't turning easily, so I jiggled it a bit and it worked fine — figured I'd have to get it looked at. As I got in I looked and realized that the car I was getting into was a manual (mine was automatic) and had a faculty parking tag dangling from the mirror (I was a student)! My car was another row over in the same parking lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Airbags would just get stolen because they're expensive and they have to be replaced after a lot of different types of crashes.</p>
<p>Catalytic converters are stolen because they contain platinum which is very valuable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My last car was a 1996 Honda Civic, one day I'd been out for a run around our city's central park and had parked on the main road lining the park. I got back to my car and went to unlock it and felt that the key wasn't going in or turning as freely as usual, which I thought was weird but anyway it worked and I hopped in aaaaand realised it wasn't my car. It was the same model in the same colour, but from the stuff inside it (and on closer look at the exterior) clearly not mine, just parked a few spots away from where mine was.</p>
<p>I avoided the temptation to start it up and park it facing in the other direction to mess with them... Just locked it back up and headed home in my own car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha I know what you mean! Part of me wanted to mess with the faculty member's car just for fun, but then I realized that if <em>I</em> were on the receiving end of that prank, I'd be pretty freaked out, so I didn't do anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a white '96 Sentra that was stolen out of the apartment parking lot. The police woke me up in the morning to tell me they found my car (wait, what?), and when walking out to ride with them to it, I spotted my car parked where I'd expect to find it and told them, &quot;Wait, my car's here....&quot; Nope, wrong car, turned out that white Sentra was stolen from across town.</p>
<p>How did they catch the guys? They drove my car a few miles into town and were caught trying to break into ANOTHER white Sentra.</p>
<p>I didn't have work until 2pm, if the idiots just kept my car, they would have been most of the way out of the state before I figured out what happened.</p>
<p>Anyway, cops said they were using a &quot;jiggle key,&quot; where you take a key, grind it down slightly, then with a little finesse, you can use it in most cars of the same model. I'm glad cars have started moving to chips and laser cut keys.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Source: I own a 97 Miata. My friend with an 01 Civic was able to unlock my Miata when I accidentally locked my keys in just by wiggling and gently turning the lock cylinder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha that's crazy!</p>
<p>I actually ended up having the same Civic stolen from me (and totaled from interior damage because the thieves were incompetent idiots). Turns out they just used a flat-headed screwdriver to unlock and start it. So that was disconcerting.</p>
<p>Luckily I didn't have anything valuable in my car except a charger for my phone. Still was a bummer, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had something similar. One winter I went to start my 97 Sentra and warm it while I brushed snow off of it. Unlocked the door, got in, and was suddenly very confused. I’d accidentally unlocked my roommate’s car (an old Kia or Saturn). It did not instill a lot of confidence in car keys in me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its more common than you think.  My dad and 2 of my aunts had Pontiac Vibes (aka Toyota Matrix) .  You could use one of the aunt's keys in my dad's and vice versa.  We also had a couple Buick vehicles that could use the same key.</p>
<p>In both cases you couldn't start the car because the keys were chipped, but they'd absolutely let you into the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not strictly true as many car manufacturers have the process locked down so you either A: have to have 2 working keys already, or B:Have to have their scan tool with their encryption codes. Some scan tool manufacturers have cracked some car companies' systems but certainly not all and it changes pretty much every model year because selling that shit to mechanics or making it so you can only get new keys for $100.00 at a dealer is very lucrative for them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it takes 30 to 45 min for a car to do a &quot;handshake&quot; with a key transponder for the car to accept is as one of its own. You would need to know exactly the correct combination of events to make it happen though. I know a lot of old toyotas need a sequence of IGN on and off 20 times, door open and close 20 times, lights on and off 20 times and bridge certain terminals on the data connector for the key registration process to begin. Hard to do in a car park with people watching you. </p></div>		</li>
