			<div class="markdown"><p>The same way an estimated 200,000+ others did: by picking the place with the best chance of clear skies.</p>
<p>NASA has predicted that the teensy little town of Madras, OR has the best chance of having clear skies that day. The town is only something like 10,000 people, I have heard estimates of how many people are going to be there from about 20,000 to 500,000.</p>
<p>My group booked our hotel the moment the reservation system became capable of recording it, sometime last year. Your chance of finding a hotel room anywhere within about 100 miles of Madras are pretty close to zero now.</p>
<p>I visited the place last August around eclipse time to scout it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah. That's why I'm hoping to rent an RV for a few days. Ideally I'd be able to view it at Grand Teton national park, but as you mentioned the weather might be rough. I thought maybe you were planning a spot near Kansas, etc. Isn't that where the totality will last the longest? I may be mistaken. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm gonna be viewing it from Hopkinsville, KY. Within 0.1 seconds of the longest duration, &amp; its not usually rainy or cloudy in the South in August.....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much does the temperature change in those couple hours? Is that alone enough for animals to behave differently, or is that just in response to how dark it gets? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It entirely depends on the local conditions, but can be a good 10-20 degrees F.</p>
<p>It's probably <em>far</em> more the light than the temperature that causes the animal behavior. Fish assume that the dimming light means it's sunset, when bugs come out, so they start jumping more.</p>
<p>Also, the light doesn't just dim, it gets...weird. That's the best I can describe it. It isn't like sunset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's like there's a cloud in front of the Sun. We had a partial solar eclipse in 2013 (?) and although it was a completely cloudless sky, it had the feeling of an overcast day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About right in the middle between nighttime and daytime temperatures, think about a real cloudy day vs a sunny one because you don't get complete darkness for that long.</p>
<p>The animals behave differently not because of how dark it gets but because to them the sun is actually &quot;setting&quot; (getting darker as it approaches totality) and certain animals behave differently at dusk/night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a response to being in shade. The earth's temp is mostly controlled by ocean temps, and those take moths to heat and cool. This is why we have seasonal lag---the sun is closest to earth (in USA) on June 20, but the hottest day of the year is not for two months later because the ocean is still warming. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just to be a stickler the sun is closest to the earth in January. Think it was the 4th this year. Mich closer than June 20th.</p></div>		</li>
