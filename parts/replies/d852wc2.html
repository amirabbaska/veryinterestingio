			<p>Sure but its misleading as I feel the language implies that rainbows are unique to earth because of the water requirement which is probably not true. The post then goes on to talk about Titan as an example which is a moon.</p>		</li>

			<p>Right on, that's fair play. I don't think the OP wanted his phrasing to exclude moons or other celestial bodies from his question. I just also think the excerpt you quoted was an accurate opening addressing the initial &quot;planets&quot; question. Honestly, it's just the semantics that caught my attention, and I feel silly for even responding. Your post was good.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Sure but its misleading...<br><br>Depends on how OP intended the question to be interpreted. It does ask for planets specifically. Not knowing anything about OP, that might be an oversight or OP has no interest in rainbows on moons for whatever reason (finding a good setting for a scene in a scifi story or RPG campaign, for example).</p>		</li>

			<p>This is indeed the same effect that produces 'sun dogs' in winter - high altitude ice crystals refract sunlight creating a circle approximately 22 degrees from the sun. Because the different wavelengths have slightly different refraction angles (like prisms), you get a rainbow effect.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dogs" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dogs</a><br><br>I live and work in the arctic and get to see these all the time.

			<p>You would have to have round ice particles, which would be weird. I am sure there are some natural processes that produce them, but I don't think they dominate in those environments. I would love to be told otherwise, though.</p>		</li>

			<p>Rainbows are formed by a collective of small prism which act as a larger one. Also see the comments about a &quot;sun dog&quot; someone made earlier, which is just a rainbow formed by atmospheric ice crystals.</p>		</li>

			<p>I wouldn't be surprised if the rapid boiling caused by a cryovolcano ejecting into near-vacuum would turn the ejected water droplet into a mostly amorphous blob that's roughly spherical.</p>		</li>

			<p>I would be surprised if violent boiling simultaneous with freezing let to any regular shape, let alone round.<br><br>It might be that irregular shape ice would become more round as they sublimated, but the surface would also become more opaque as impurities would concentrate there, meaning less chance of consistent refraction.</p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't stay liquid for long. Space is too cold and have too low pressure, so it will boil and freeze at the same time until only frozen water and water vapor remains. The frozen water will sublimate into vapor.</p>		</li>

			<p>Those are geysers that are without liquid. The particles are likely opaque, so it would more likely be a reflection of light than a refraction. I'm not sure how it would turn out exactly, but I don't think it would have the same colour splitting effect that water droplets do.</p>		</li>

			<p>Water vapor is like steam, not liquid water. If there is insufficient atmospheric pressure, water can only exist as a solid or a gas. In the case of Enceladus, there is effectively zero atmosphere, meaning it's a nearly perfect vacuum. As such, any liquid water that is ejected from the geysers will be both freezing and boiling at the same time - so they will rapidly turn into ice crystals and gaseous water (vapor). This does not imply liquid water at all.<br><br>I have a vacuum chamber at home where I can pull pretty high vacuum. I use it as a party trick - put a glass of luke warm water in and watch it boil when you turn on the pump. The water in the glass loses heat as it boils, and eventually so much as boiled off (and so much heat lost) that the liquid water remaining in the glass freezes.<br><br>Here's a youtube video (not by me) demonstrating this phenomenon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rUYyLzGcjY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rUYyLzGcjY</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Well sometimes you see &quot;rainbows&quot; (usually just small rainbow pattern, no sky rainbows) in your home for example when the sunlight hits a piece of glass with te right shape in the right way.   <br>Or oil spills from cars on the road can also make rainbow patterns.   <br>So if a planet has any kind of refracting material dropping out of the sky a rainbow should be there.     <br>Didn't it rain diamond on Titan or something? I bet you there would be rainbows there.</p>		</li>
