			<p>Right on, that's fair play. I don't think the OP wanted his phrasing to exclude moons or other celestial bodies from his question. I just also think the excerpt you quoted was an accurate opening addressing the initial &quot;planets&quot; question. Honestly, it's just the semantics that caught my attention, and I feel silly for even responding. Your post was good.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Sure but its misleading...<br><br>Depends on how OP intended the question to be interpreted. It does ask for planets specifically. Not knowing anything about OP, that might be an oversight or OP has no interest in rainbows on moons for whatever reason (finding a good setting for a scene in a scifi story or RPG campaign, for example).</p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't stay liquid for long. Space is too cold and have too low pressure, so it will boil and freeze at the same time until only frozen water and water vapor remains. The frozen water will sublimate into vapor.</p>		</li>

			<p>Those are geysers that are without liquid. The particles are likely opaque, so it would more likely be a reflection of light than a refraction. I'm not sure how it would turn out exactly, but I don't think it would have the same colour splitting effect that water droplets do.</p>		</li>

			<p>Water vapor is like steam, not liquid water. If there is insufficient atmospheric pressure, water can only exist as a solid or a gas. In the case of Enceladus, there is effectively zero atmosphere, meaning it's a nearly perfect vacuum. As such, any liquid water that is ejected from the geysers will be both freezing and boiling at the same time - so they will rapidly turn into ice crystals and gaseous water (vapor). This does not imply liquid water at all.<br><br>I have a vacuum chamber at home where I can pull pretty high vacuum. I use it as a party trick - put a glass of luke warm water in and watch it boil when you turn on the pump. The water in the glass loses heat as it boils, and eventually so much as boiled off (and so much heat lost) that the liquid water remaining in the glass freezes.<br><br>Here's a youtube video (not by me) demonstrating this phenomenon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rUYyLzGcjY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rUYyLzGcjY</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Well sometimes you see &quot;rainbows&quot; (usually just small rainbow pattern, no sky rainbows) in your home for example when the sunlight hits a piece of glass with te right shape in the right way.   <br>Or oil spills from cars on the road can also make rainbow patterns.   <br>So if a planet has any kind of refracting material dropping out of the sky a rainbow should be there.     <br>Didn't it rain diamond on Titan or something?

			<p>To follow up on &quot;if the colors would be the same&quot; portion of the question, the colors of the rainbow we see are because they are the colors we <em>can</em> see.
