<p>Currently, there is no other planet known to have liquid water on its surface or in sufficient quantities in the atmosphere to make rain.</p>

<p>This isn't true is it? I thought Europa and Enceladus had evidence of suspended atmospheric water no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but its misleading as I feel the language implies that rainbows are unique to earth because of the water requirement which is probably not true. The post then goes on to talk about Titan as an example which is a moon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Seems to me these would be sufficient to create a rainbow with sufficient light </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He did say &quot;in sufficient quantities in the atmosphere&quot; as well. While it is true, europa has water in its 'atmosphere', it is nearly a total vacuum. So, ImEnglishNotBritish was right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well sometimes you see &quot;rainbows&quot; (usually just small rainbow pattern, no sky rainbows) in your home for example when the sunlight hits a piece of glass with te right shape in the right way.<br />
Or oil spills from cars on the road can also make rainbow patterns.<br />
So if a planet has any kind of refracting material dropping out of the sky a rainbow should be there.<br />
Didn't it rain diamond on Titan or something? I bet you there would be rainbows there.</p></div>		</li>
