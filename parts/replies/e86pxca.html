			<div class="markdown"><p>How can nuclear decay provide life giving energy if it’s also radioactive? Do these creatures and plants become immune to it and also plants living that far down how do they go throw photosynthesis without sunlight ? I know nuclear anything has a life but say it’s not fully decayed yet? Edit: this is a curious question because I don’t know anything about ecosystems without sunlight </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all nuclear decay is as intense as others.  Also, nuclear decay can occur and provide heat energy from energy transfers and transformations, while not directly emitting nuclear decay particles to a system. </p>
<p>For example, the geothermal energy is likely kept going by nuclear decay reactions at the earths core. Just because nuclear decay is generating energy for the planet doesn’t mean that the same reactions more negative particles are actually reaching the surface. </p>
<p>I could consider a situation in which a formation of nuclear decaying particles provide heat energy to a local system, however many of the alpha, beta, and gamma particles are blocked by the existing rock between the local system and the energy origin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there many lake or fresh water cave dwelling species that exist this way? I wasn't really aware of any that had yet been discovered. Though the methane species you mentioned were discovered at the bottom of the Marianas Trench just a few decades ago. Always in salt water to my knowledge. </p>
<p>What I find very interesting which is anot to OP's question is when life really doesn't exist. In the Yukatan Peninsula, there are vast underground fresh water cave systems that have really only just started being mapped. Because of the limestone around them they are often completely isolated from each other through heavy filtration. Only relatively pure water is flowing from one to the next, no biological matter or nutrients, and they quickly get absolutely pitch dark. In these environments there is absolutely no life. You are surrounded by extremely biologically diverse rainforest, and the sea and other lakes and rivers sometimes only meters away can be teaming with aquatic life but in the absence of sun and decomposing matter there is nothing. The water is often completely potable and sterile. Again also interesting is how quickly this can change. Separated by only a few meters of rock can be a separate cave system in part of the same river system that happens to have an opening (called Cenotes) that can have leaves or fruit falling in, and suddenly it's teaming with fish. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a chemist, not a biologist, so I'd have to let one step in to and answer you. I do know that there is a class of species living deep in caves which are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_troglobites" target="_blank">troglobites</a>.</p></div>		</li>

Sounds very, very unlikely to me. You find microbial chemoautotrophs pretty much anywhere, and microbes are very much alive, as far as I remember. Sorry, sarcasm.
If you intented to say there is no organims to be found outside the domains of archea and bacteria, alright, but that's not clear from your comment at all.
My biologist heart is aching ^^</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Energy originally from the Sun can be stored as chemical energy in molecule such as glucose (especially molecules rich in Hydrogens where the potential energy of the electrons is high) and harvested through oxidation. </p></div>		</li>
