<p>You could also try the &quot;hard reset through nature&quot;. Basically, this means you go camping for a week to fall back into a natural sleep cycle. The downside to this method is that it's hard to find a week to spare and the pattern derived from it might not be accomodated to your job. I would try the first method.</p></div>		</li>
