			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly how it is done. The USDA publishes NDL values for this purpose. It is always allowed for food products. Except say, infant formula produced for sale in the US.</p>
<p>Also, panels have a margin of allowable error, so there really is limited reason to have exact lab results in my experience.</p></div>		</li>
