			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally an answer that doesn't ignore the sleep bit. The first part is a bit different though. Your body needs a drop in your core temperature of a couple of degrees to fall asleep. Apart from that you need sleep drive (be tired) and melatonine (a hormone produced when you don't see blue light). </p>
<p>The latter one is the reason you don't fall asleep during the day in a colder environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add a few things:</p>
<p>The drop in body temperature is sensed by neurons adjacent to the SCN (suprachiasmic nucleus), which is the primary 'clock' for your body. Melatonin would normally begin to be secreted around dusk, a few hours before bedtime, but blue (and green, apparently) light suppresses it, even in tiny amounts (like 10 lux). Sleep drive is presumably the same thing as sleep pressure (it's relieved/removed during sleep and begins accumulating during wakefulness). Melatonin levels, body temp drop, and sleep pressure all contribute to falling asleep.</p></div>		</li>
