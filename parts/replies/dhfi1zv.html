			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, misalignment of planets is likely due to planet-planet scattering (aka, near collisions) or, more speculatively, a passing star that tilted the disk. The tilted disk idea is harder, but if you find a system with multiple planets orbiting in the same misaligned plane, this is probably the reason. Most misaligned planets (hot Jupiters) are probably from planet-planet scattering.</p></div>		</li>
