			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a degree in Jazz guitar before my astrophysics undergrad and PhD. Until now I've kept them separated, research by day, playing in the band RVNNERS (formerly Tiny Danza) with Andrew by night, but when I saw the pattern of resonances in TRAPPIST-1, it looked like music to me. I was working on a presentation on TRAPPIST-1 for grade school students that I wanted to include it in but when I contacted Dan, I realized we had something a little bigger on our hands :)  </p></div>		</li>
