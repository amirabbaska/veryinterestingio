			<div class="markdown"><p>Boeing actually deployed this technique on a bunch of their communications satellites and it came back to bite them in the rear. Basically they designed the solar wings such that they had semi-cylindrical lenses running over them that would concentrate the sunlight onto the junctions, thus increasing the efficiency of the array. </p>
<p>Initially it worked quite well, but they ran into two problems. The first, as you mentioned, was the increased temperature of the semiconductor. It caused premature wear on the cells, causing them to degrade more quickly than anticipated. The second issue was that the lenses themselves were not totally UV stable, and began to fog up in orbit, further reducing the power output.</p>
<p>The overall result was a significant reduction in the power budget for the satellites, thus forcing their operators to shut down parts of the payload to stay within the power budget.</p>
<p>The three satellites I know of that suffered from this was Anik F1, and the initial pair of satellites for XM Radio. In the case of Anik F1, Telesat was forced to build and launch a replacement (Anik F1R). F1R took over duties for North America, and the original F1 was reduced to just serving South/Central America (With both birds in the same slot). For XM Radio, they changed the solar arrays on their ground-spare satellite (Named Rhythm), and launched it. The two original birds (Rock and Roll) were then moved into a single slot, with each taking half the load.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow would these inefficiencies not show up in ground-based testing? Or did they somehow skip over this type of testing in order to hit their launch date? Seems like a major financial risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thermal testing of solar panels is complicated and often not done. You need huge vacuum chambers to deploy them and they are often not able to support their own weight when deployed. Moreover you need complicated heating rigs that simulates solar flux better than the heat lamp usually used in thermal vacuum tests. </p>
<p>As for the the UV degradation I don't know in this particular case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from what /u/electric_ionland said, it was a slow degradation of performance. Unless they had exposed a sample of the array to relevant conditions for a long period of time, they wouldn't likely have noticed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One strategy I've seen is to use a big (and fairly inexpensive per area) lens or mirror to focus a lot of sunlight onto a tiny (and expensive per area) section of ultra-high-efficiency multi-junction solar cell. It's mandatory in any discussion of solar cells that someone pulls out <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chart.png" target="_blank">this chart</a>, and you can see that the absolute highest efficiencies are all coming from concentrator cells. However, this is still more in the realm of &quot;crazy laboratory tricks&quot; than anything commercialized. </p>
<p>They also generally have pretty serious cooling systems, because they really, really need them. Probably part of the reason why they're not so popular outside of the lab yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How high can these go in temperature? If it went high enough, maybe you could use the cooling to generate steam and run a turbine, like a combined solar-steam power plant? Sort of like the power plant in Nevada, but focusing the sunlight on high temp PV cells. We probably need way more advanced semiconductor technology though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why are the cells with concentrators more effective than those without in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/PVeff%28rev170117%29.png" target="_blank">this solar cell efficiency figure</a>? Based on your explanation I would expect the opposite.</p></div>		</li>
