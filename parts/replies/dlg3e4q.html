			<div class="markdown"><p>No, at least not an ICBM: </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile" target="_blank">&quot;A ballistic missile is only guided during relatively brief periods of flight , and most of its trajectory is unpowered and governed by gravity and air resistance if in the atmosphere. This contrasts to a cruise missile, which is aerodynamically guided in powered flight.&quot;</a></p></div>		</li>

I guess it would depend on distance so need two times numbers.  from my house and to nearest distance that i won't die cause fall out  -to- around the world and nearest distance I won't kill my self.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How do countries know when a missile has been launched by another country?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally it's infrared detection by satellite. ICBMs generate a TON of heat when they launch, and satellites (usually very high up in geosynchronous orbit) use highly sensitive infrared sensors to (hopefully) detect the massive heat bloom associated with a missile launch. Radar is not relied on as a primary detection method, at least by countries with a satellite network, simply because, as you said, radar can't cover everywhere.</p></div>		</li>
