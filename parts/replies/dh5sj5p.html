<p>Its pretty democratic and spreads out in all directions. Now imagine if you stack three of them together lets label them (abc). So charge b shoots out some field lines to the left, to the right, and straight ahead. So do a and c.
The field lines to the right from a kind of cancel out the field lines to the left from b. In the same way the field lines to the left from c cancel out the field lines to the right from b. </p>
<p>After doing all these cancellations, we have some field point directly up, at the centre, but the bits of field from a and c that point AWAY from b have not been cancelled. So they kind of ``bend out&quot; </p>
<p>Now consider: </p>
<p>a b c </p>
<p>d e f</p>
<p>You get the same pattern but flipped, and you can kind of connect the dots to get the picture you are asking about. </p></div>		</li>
