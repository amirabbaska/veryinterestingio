			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of energy imparted into the projectile can be calculated <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/crossbow-physics.910575/" target="_blank">by integrating the force through the length</a> of the launch, that is the distance during which the bolt or arrow is in contact with the string after being released.</p>
<p>A small, high-pound crossbow might not perform better than a large, medium-pound longbow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also important to note: the elastic force will decrease through the length of the launch, based on position at that time. So you are taking a double integral in the end, just to get launch speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure you would just need a function describing the force throughout the length of the shot with respect to position and then do a single integral with respect to position. It's a 1 dimensional problem </p>
<p>Edit: getting that equation for force is a little tricky tho</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, any advances in material science can be applied to both systems.</p>
<p>The aerodynamic part of the comparison is still the same: arrows are generally longer than bolts (for handheld crossbows, in the medieval siege-crossbow sense you can go pretty crazy).</p>
<p>The speed/force argument doesn't change either: A bow depends on the arm &amp; upper body strength of the user, while cocking a crossbow string can employ full body strength or various mechanical aids.</p>
<p>I'd argue the power difference can in fact be even greater, as both the arms as well as the cocking mechanism of the crossbow can benefit from modern material science.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes and no i would think, because you could apply the same advances to a crossbow; i.e. compound crossbow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it's kinda like a paper airplane vs a throwing dart.  The strength of the person throwing doesn't matter as much with the airplane, but a stronger person throwing a dart will make it go faster.</p></div>		</li>
