			<div class="markdown"><p>Long ago, contests were run via television and things. </p>
<p>I guess Tenn had a state law that said &quot;no contest for us, thanks..&quot; </p>
<p>So, whenever a contest was announced they'd say SORRY TENNESEE!! .. then it became a running gag to say that whenever you announced anything. Of course, this was probably 30 years ago.. so.. I'm old. </p></div>		</li>
