			<div class="markdown"><p>There's  a very under-rated book called 'Songwriting Secrets of the Beatles ' by Dominic Pedler that spends almost 800 pages analyzing in details all the chords and melodies and musical techniques that The Beatles use. It's a fantastic read.</p>
<p>And the author goes off on a tangent for one chapter to investigate exactly what that opening chord of 'A Hard Day's Night' is. His conclusion is that is contains 4 elements:</p>
<p>1. Paul McCartney playing D on his Hofner Bass.</p>
<p>2. John Lennon playing an Fadd^^9 on his Gibson acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>3. George Harrison playing an Fadd^^9 on his Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar</p>
<p>4. George Martin paying D-G-D on a Steinway grand piano.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one option the author gives. He goes into a long complex debate, pointing out that there really is no right answer,  before settling tentatively on G11/D.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic thrust of your comment is correct (the reason it sounds unique is that it is made up of notes that you don't expect, and that no one had ever combined in precisely that way).</p>
<p>However - according to this, the F wasn't played on the piano.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beatlesbible.com/features/hard-days-night-chord/" target="_blank">https://www.beatlesbible.com/features/hard-days-night-chord/</a> </p>
<p>The only Fs I am aware of were on the guitars. But it is still &quot;close enough&quot; to call it basically an Fadd9.</p></div>		</li>
