			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this. I've also thought about pre-big bang universe being a mega dense collection of everything. Everyone wants to know how something was created from nothing but the existence of nothing is just as difficult to explain. I think nothing was just a collection of everything, which, if you took a step back to look at, might appear to be nothing anyway. </p>
<p>I like to think something caused this ball of nothing/everything to explode in 2 (maybe more) directions or universes, which if recombined, would reconstitute back into the everything ball. We are just in one universe with our &quot;second piece of the puzzle universe&quot; playing out somewhere else.</p></div>		</li>
