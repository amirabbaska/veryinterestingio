			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're using a laser, why does the sail need to be so large? Sure it has to compensate for the minute spread of the laser, but over short (on a cosmic scale) distances, surely that wouldn't be so much? I think it's only the true <em>solar</em> sails that need to be unreasonably large</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are basically correct. A Gaussian-model laser beam will have a hyperbolic profile, the asymptotic divergence of which depends primarily on the ratio of the beam wavelength to the focal waist diameter. For a beam with a large waist (on the order of meters) and a &lt;1um wavelength, the divergence angle will be quite low.</p></div>		</li>

Rip. I misunderstood the initial question. The intensity is inverse square not the spread</p></div>		</li>

<p>Both of those power sources are much too massive to take with you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to mention incompatible with the solar sail if they are attached together. Any force the laser generates towards the solar sail also pushes the laser backwards. If you ditch the sail and just point the laser behind you, <em>then</em> it might be worthwhile.</p></div>		</li>
