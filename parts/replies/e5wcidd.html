			<div class="markdown"><p>No dinosaur is &quot;more closely related&quot; to reptiles than others - that would imply they descended from more than one common ancestor; it's like saying your brother is more closely related to your cousin than your sister. All dinosaurs are as close to reptiles as however close their shared common ancestor was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was rewatching walking with dinosaurs a few months back, and they suggested that sauropods did it from behind with the Male on top - like most quadrupedal animals today. I think they suggested that females had reinforced hip and spine bones to help them support the males weight. Also that it didn’t last very long. Though this was a TV show made nearly 20 years ago (which took an amount of artistic license) so the scientific consensus may well have changed since then.</p>
<p>Edit: here’s the link to the clip (<a href="https://youtu.be/-mv_v4ltSrY" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/-mv_v4ltSrY</a>). Again this is a 20 year old show, but it positioned itself as a natural history documentary programme.</p></div>		</li>
