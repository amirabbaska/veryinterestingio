			<div class="markdown"><p>They likely have a filtration system that is advanced enough to handle the additional amounts of salt in their diet that comes from those incidents where salt water is directly consumed. How much more they can handle is unknown.</p>
<p>I assume that if we had the exact same system they had, we'd be unable to get enough salt in our diet so that's why we can't drink salt water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a good point there that terrestrial animals lose lots of water through respiration, perspiration, etc. whereas you would not expect marine organisms to lose nearly as much and therefore to need nearly as much replenishment. </p>
<p>While water is the solvent that everything runs on, it's not like it &quot;goes bad&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't require any additional intake unless you're growing, though. If you don't account for the losses, an 80 kg human would only need to drink 80 liters of water in their lifetime to ensure that they have enough water to act as a solvent. That's clearly not even remotely close to the actual number, meaning that the overwhelming majority of water we drink is just to replace water we lost.</p>
<p>It then follows that if maritime mammals have significantly lower losses then they'll need to drink much less, as the water in their cells is only a very small part of the equation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you mean to say, one of the ways in which humans lose water is through sweat. Water is also used to dissolve and evacuate toxic materials, such as lactic acid that builds up inside muscles during anaerobic metabolic processes.<br />
All mammals are concerned with heat regulation. We are warm blooded and try to maintain an optimal internal temperature. Yes, marine mammals face more extreme cold than extreme heat, and are therefore, more obviously adapted insulation. But that is not to say that is the main method of temp regulation or that they do not have methods for cooling their bodies down.<br />
Marine mammals actually open and close circulation to the surface of their bodies to let off or retain heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess the followup is how do they <em>not</em> drink seawater?   I could see with seals since they have more closed mouths but what about dolphins or whales. Do they have sophisticated esophaguses (esophagi?)   That can pass the fish while rejecting water? Even baleen whales which can sieve out most water must still ingest hundreds of gallons of salt water when feeding. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's most probable that they simply have a much more advanced filtration system than we do that is capable of handling far more salt water than we can. I assume if we had the exact same filtration system then we would actually have a far harder time absorbing the appropriate amounts of salt since we don't live in salt water.</p></div>		</li>
