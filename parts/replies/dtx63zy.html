			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughly speaking, is this how something like a space station or satellite dumps surplus heat? Radiators dumping black body radiation into the &quot;vacuum&quot; of space?</p>
<p>It's a strangely non-intuitive thought for me, imagining that the ISS cools itself off by sending out heat to (or at least in the direction of) distant stars and planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also why keeping things cool in space is REALLY hard even though the temp outside is 3K.  Hot things do indeed emit IR, but not terribly quickly, and when the only way to get rid of it is through radiation (as opposed to conduction and convection AND radiation on Earth) it takes huge radiators and careful management of things that generate heat.  Long story short, astronauts have to make sure to turn out the lights when they leave the room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. So this probably means LEDs are a must-have technology for space vessels, since older lighting technologies produce so much more heat. I wonder if that's another technology we've all forgotten came out of NASA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. Most spacecraft will have large surface area radiators with high emissivity paint to help dump extra heat into &quot;dark&quot; regions of space. Additionally, for most spacecraft, overheating is a much more significant problem than getting too cold. </p></div>		</li>
