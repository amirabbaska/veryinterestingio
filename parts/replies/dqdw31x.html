			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Magnesium when exposed to air reacts, and a layer of MgO is formed on the surface. This inhibits the spontaneous reaction of Mg with water. </p>
<p>The chloride ion in the table salt reacts with the MgO on the surface of the solid magnesium to form MgOHCl, which basically eats away the MgO layer on the magnesium surface. This enables the underlying magnesium metal to react with the water. </p>
<p>The iron additive is thought to facilitate the reaction between magnesium metal and water.</p>
<p>The boiling point of water is not significantly increased by small amounts of salt. It takes almost 30 g of salt (29.2 g) per kg of water to raise the boiling point of water by just 0.5 degrees C.</p></div>		</li>
