			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition, slow animations are easier to spot errors in than fast animations. Who cares if the hand is a few centimeters off when climbing the back of a dragon in a fight, but it's very noticable if your character start to kiss the nose of an NPC.</p>
<p>Another issue is player model customization. When the player can change how their character looks, things won't be where the animation expects them to be anymore. Once more, look at a kiss. THe animation lines up perfectly. Now, some player makes a character 20 cm shorter. It's very hard to compensate for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your explanation highlights a key difference between animations and normal motions - that animations are basically pre-recorded and normal motion uses feedback to continually adjust things.  E.g. if you reach for a glass of water, and it's 1 inch further than it was yesterday, you see that and change your motion.  </p>
<p>I wonder if, in the future, there will be on-the-fly generated animations that do this kind of processing.  Maybe only used for random 1-off animations like the ones described here (and not for every sword swing).  </p></div>		</li>
