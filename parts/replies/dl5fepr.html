			<div class="markdown"><p>In the little that i've read about movie production, the movie is often not shot in anything even close to the order that it appears on the screen.  Part of this is because the director / editor might change things in post-production, but a lot of it is just the logistics of getting the shots.  If the star needs to be in a location 3 times in the movie, they just shoot all 3 scenes regardless of when the scenes appear in the movie timeline.</p>
<p>So, if it turns out that doing a tattoo or other thing is time consuming or difficult, they just re-arrange the shooting schedule to get all those together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. I mean think of the logistics required to film a movie in order where, for instance, the film is punctuated by flashbacks in which a character has a beard or is bald etc. In reality, you film all the &quot;beard&quot; parts or all the &quot;bald&quot; parts at once and then film the other parts after the actor has gotten rid of the beard or grown their hair.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Adrien Brody lost a lot of weight to look emaciated for the movie The Pianist and then gained the weight while filming. In the movie he starts out healthy and looks starved at the end. They filmed all the scenes in reverse order as he gained the weight to give the effect of him losing the weight</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do it once, film all of the scenes that contain shots of it, and then stop worrying about it.</p>

<p>This is probably a large part of it. Rarely are movies filmed in scene sequence (if ever). When you have limited time and money, this is a large key to getting everything you need within those constraints.</p></div>		</li>
