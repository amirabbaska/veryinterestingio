			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this will be buried deep in your inbox but I hope you read it anyway. My father passed away just before thanksgiving. It's hard on me, but I never cry or show weakness. I can't afford to. I've got a wife and mother to look after, and they take up all of my time. I'm not complaining, I love them both and I'm just trying to make things work. But your post just made me want to crawl back into bed and cry. My dad knew weather inside and out. He would tell you when it was going to rain better than the weatherman. He knew clouds and wind and rain and the whole nine yards. He would rant about the weather sometimes like it was his greatest passion. All you said was true, and I heard my father doling it out and explaining it to me all over again. Thank you. Thank you. I know you never could have expected this, but thank you for letting me grieve. Thank you for letting me hear him again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason the ice risk is reduced is because colder air cannot carry much moisture. It's water vapour freezing in and on your aircraft (Some aircraft engines can be subject to icing internally for which they carry a heater that you turn on at set times) that is the danger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Cold air is far denser than warmer air, thus much less room to carry water vapor. </p>
<p>This is why tundras are really cold deserts. They are so cold that weather systems that would produce precipitation dry out as they pass over the areas and those systems can't form over those areas either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this similar to how humid places often have more snowfall even in the cold? I'm thinking like New York and Japan - bloody humid in summer and then still humid but in a weird way in the winter...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Airline pilot here; you are a wrong regarding the clouds. EDIT: missed a part of your post on mobile, was triggered by the opening part of your post. You're not wrong. Regard this as further explanation and proof:</p>
<p>Clouds affect the radiation balance and thus the temperature in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>During the day when the sun shines, clouds keep radiation from the sun out by reflecting it back to space (as clouds are white, they are pretty effective at it). During night clouds would act as a 'blanket' by keeping the long wave radiation that the earth emits partly below it by bouncing it back to earth. This is why clear nights are colder than cloudy nights.</p>
<p>Don't have to time to go in greater detail now, but attached images from my meteo book that speak mostly for itself.</p>
<p>Happy landings!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How am I wrong? You've just repeated exactly what my post says except I dumbed it down a bit?</p>
<p>I quote (My emphasis):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>During the day, if cloud forms it actually prevents the majority of the sunlight from reaching earth and thus absorbs or radiates the heat back into space at the cloud level.</strong> The heat never makes it to earth and the effect of this is the day feels cooler. However during the day, cloud itself does very little to insulate the earth's heat because that's basically where clouds are coming from as a I described above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At night though it's a different story. As the part of earth you're on moves out of the sun's rays and starts to cool, the heat that was absorbed by the planet radiates back out to space. <strong>With no cloud coverage, this process happens very quickly and the night becomes quite cold.</strong></p>
<p>However if there are clouds, they absorb some of this radiation and slow the process down and the night feels warmer because it's taking longer for the absorbed heat to be released back to space.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting diagrams, but the meaning of the numbers is a little confusing. I'm assuming the numbers are (signed) percentages, with each figure scaled from the amount of shortwave radiation incident with Earth from space (which is -100%). I.e. they are unitless. Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, it's the amount of total energy in terms of percentages being blocked, absorbed or reflected. As each day the amount of energy is different (distance from sun varies and the inclination of the earth) it would be to hard to put an actual amount on it, is my guess.</p></div>		</li>
