			<div class="markdown"><p>Good signal on your end doesn't mean good signal on the tower's end and signal strength doesn't tell you anything about congestion</p>
<p>If you have good signal but the tower you're connected to is trying to service 50,000 phones at the same time then while you're not seeing the noise of the other phones the tower is so it is losing some of your packets</p>
<p>You can also have good signal from a congested tower.  The signal strength tells you the antenna is close, but if the tower is trying to service 50,000 people at the same time then everyone gets a very tiny timeslice to get data through.  Even if you can get super duper 50 Mbps speeds, you only get 1/50,000th of a second to get those speeds in as the tower can only really service one phone at a time so that gives you just 20 kbps effectively.</p>
<p>A congested tower switches to 3G because it has less overhead than 4G.  In your tiny time slice you want as much to be dedicated to the data as possible, if it takes 5 microseconds to deal with the packet header on 4G but only 2 on 3G then it loses a lot less time to overhead on 3G, but if its flipping between tons and tons of phones even that tiny overhead per message adds up quickly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Simply put: More connected UEs = Lower throughput. </p>
<p>Another fun thing to know as well, if you are near more than one tower or more specific, cells/carriers, it will add the speed together (Carrier aggregation). My colleague managed to squeeze out over 300mbit on 4G once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd definitely say that it depends on the carrier. I know that Sprint 3g is completely useless, I've read people complaining about it but saw it first hand on a friend's phone.  We were in a couple places where his Sprint phone and my TMobile phone fell back to 3g his stopped transmitting data, mine still worked fine, I was getting 4mbps and was able to hotspot so he could use his phone.  When I had Verizon it kinda worked, you could at least refresh pages and transmit emails.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3g may only now be allocated to voice.  On Verizon this makes sense since they can only serve data and voice at the same time using either 3g voice + LTE data or full VoLTE+ LTE data.  Since the 3G is CDMA it cant carry data+voice.  GSM networks dont have that issue so a GSM 3G signal may still service data.</p>

<p>Actually Verizon's system does allow for simultaneous voice and data over 3g only - it's called SVDO.</p>
<p>The problem is there were no handsets that supported it by the time 4G came out. And the only two that did were 4G phones - the Thunderbolt (the first Verizon 4G phone) and its successor, the Rezound. I had both and lived in an area that was only serviced by 3G and at the time I had data and voice at the same time. It was like magic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This depends on operators, rather than country. Some prefers some names and ask manufacturers display in particular name on phones. iOS, for example, uses carrier profile to display in particular network's particular preferences.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a mod of /r/Carriers, I support this answer. I'd TL;DR it differently though:</p>
<p>Carriers have a finite amount of radio spectrum to use for service; LTE is better so they budget more of it for that instead and 3g performance sucks. </p>
<p>Other thoughts: T-Mobile US used to have a metropolitan 3g (&quot;4g&quot;) network with a theoretical max speed of 42mbps and delivered real-world speeds comparable to, or better than, the LTE networks of the day. And then there's Sprint who can roll out ~700-1000 mbps LTE service as soon as there's a cell modem that can handle 6x-or-more carrier aggregation. </p>
<hr />
<p>ITT: I encourage a lot of y'all to keep an eye on /r/carriers to learn more about how they work, I'm seeing some very wacky, very inaccurate info here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more accurate. The network connecting the 3G network together is called backhaul. The backhaul network has very little data capacity and I think it isn't scaled up to modern data usage.</p>
<p>I have also wondered this. Back in 2005, I regularly received 1.5 to 2.0 mbps.... now 3G is close to 100 kbps at best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm only really familiar with T-Mobile in this regard so the following only pertains to them: &gt;99% of towers, even if they only have 3G enabled, were 'modernized' with faster backhaul (copper -&gt; fiber optic and/or faster microwave transceivers or fiber thereto) so that bottleneck was largely eliminated.</p>
<p>Because radio frequency spectrum usable for commercial cellular service is finite and licenses are worth a lot of money, carriers that were using 20 MHz for 3G and 10 MHz for 2G want to remove as much spectrum from those older technologies as possible to be &quot;re-farmed&quot; for use on LTE. In the case of &quot;CDMA&quot; carriers, such as Sprint and Verizon, it doesn't make much sense to keep their 3G services well supplied with valuable spectrum since their EV-DO 3G technology doesn't support voice traffic and LTE is waaaaay faster and handles waay more simultaneous connections. </p>
<p>All-in-all, it doesn't make sense to invest much in 3G technologies (all you weebs buying chinese branded phones that don't support US LTE bands and US VoLTE are shooting yourselves in the foot since 3g support is dying) when LTE is significantly superior in almost every way. 3G service is going to continue to suffer and eventually go away entirely but that's a good thing since the network will be faster and your bill will decrease or (more likely) you'll have more data to use per pricing tier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These answers are the most correct, with a few caveats. But they still get my upgoats.</p>
<p>The 3G and 4G/LTE are normally on different frequencies, and each of those frequencies have their own spectrum. So in this specific case, its most likely not the radio spectrum that is the bottleneck. More likely its the small amount of bandwidth they allocate from their internet connection/backhaul on the ground. Most of it will be allocated to 4G.</p>
<p>It is also possible that 3G might not allocate bandwidth at all on some carriers since it is a fallback and its possible to make calls and send texts without it. It's purely up to the carrier's settings in this case.</p>
<p>Most likely OP is seeing a combination of these factors or has Netflix set to HD streaming. Cellular phones and streaming are much more data hungry than older versions were and 7.2 Mbit isn't enough anymore.</p>
<p>Also on the 4G bit, This goes back to when ATT fucked up by calling HSDPA+ &quot;4G&quot;, so they could be the first ones with it. Once they had it, all the other carriers had to jump on the same boat. In actuality its 3.5G and this forced the 4G alliance to start being more formal with the LTE name when it was adopted. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Unless you're talking about sharing guard bands to make the most of the allotted spectrum, I'm afraid this is only true of the newer bands- 12/17, 13, the added parts of 66, 71 (from the top of my head) and all of the ones currently implemented in any meaningful way max out at 10 x 10 MHz (with the potential exception of however much WCS AT&amp;T had rolled out in whatever markets they've employed their thin holdings). For your more established bands, 2/25, 4, 5/26, these absolutely can and do employ legacy technologies that are refarmed regularly- all of the major carriers have been refarming their 2/3G holdings for LTE in recent years, even Sprint since their PCS b25 signals generally propagate better than b41.</p>
<p>Yes, you can't have two technologies occupying the same frequencies because they'd interfere with each other. As for their using different bands altogether... MOST of those 'old' bands' spectrum is currently employed with LTE rather than legacy technologies, there's no reason for them not to.
Sufficient backhaul is an issue for some towers but that's a very small minority of towers.</p>

<p>Are you talking about a microwave backhaul or some such IoT/business use application? Otherwise I can't make sense of what you're saying here. Buying fiber backhaul in the busiest markets is generally not a major issue in 2017.</p></div>		</li>
