			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess you could ask how we ground anything on the planet earth, because when you think about it, the earth is just a big ball of rock floating in the vacuum of space and all the electricity we use doesn't actually have anywhere to go at the end of the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another problem for another day. Solar energy will eventually become electrical energy, which will eventually find home in grounded Earth. Earth will store all this potential electric energy and become a giant taser hurtling through time and space frying any and all things that come close, like my ex girlfriend, Jessica. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. This can actually be a big issue when you localized area that is higher potential than the surrounding area. </p>

<p>It's a reason, if a live conductor comes crashing down on your car and you can't stay inside, you jump out (without touching the car and ground at the same time), then you have to shuffle, or bunny hop away.  Because where you are standing might be a different potential than the area you about to step in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My car grounds itself when I get out and close the door. A massive electric shock always greets me once I touch it. That's the car grounding itself (literally) using my body as the conductor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Winter was hell for me. Any time I left my car I'd ritualistically touch my knuckle to the door panel only to get the shit shocked out of me. It was all the car knew and it was all that I knew.</p>
<p>I later learned that if I ground to the vehicle first then step my foot out, then no pain. I've seen monkeys learn faster/more efficiently than me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cars ground themselves using the negative terminal of the battery attached to the chassis and then to grounding straps. That is why you can have so many different grounds in a car using only a bolt and contact with a unpainted part of the car, it all returns to the negative battery terminal which is the mother of all ground.</p></div>		</li>
