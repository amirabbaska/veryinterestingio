			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the french inability to say the letter 'H'? even the aspirated 'H' commonly used, and the inability to pronounce 'TH' as well, surely that must have a psysiological difference for there to be such a crazy and obvious gap.</p>
<p>No hate against frenchies, that's just the language, other than swedish I'm best at butchering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just because French doesn't use those sounds so they're not used to them. Any French speaker can learn to produce those sounds with enough practice. It's no different from English speakers having trouble with the sounds in French.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that the vocal folds don't play a big role in speech. They are used to control pitch, which is important in all languages. They are also used in the production of glottal and glottalic consonants, and they control vowel phonation as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont say they do not important at all. But the role is not just as big as to be language-related.</p>
<p>Still most vowels are formed by position of tongue (height, backnes), lips (roundness) and velum (nasalization). This covers all the vowel space found in all the langages.  </p>
<p>It is tonal languages where pitch is involved to characterize a phoneme.</p></div>		</li>
