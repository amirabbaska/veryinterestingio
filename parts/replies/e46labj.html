			<div class="markdown"><p>Surprisingly, you can grow a lot of edible but not psychedelic mushrooms in your home, including Oysters, Lions Mane, even Chicken of the Woods. Lions Mane is particularly good for drying and has been shown to improve cognition, particularly in patients with dementia. </p></div>		</li>

<p>No, the jury is decided on this one. Cold shocks are counterproductive for cube growth. He's having success despite the cold shocks, not because of them. If this were still a debated topic I'd agree with you and say keep doing what works, but it's not. Very outdated information.</p></div>		</li>
