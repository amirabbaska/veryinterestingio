			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why they're afraid of them but tarp is short for tarpoline, which is a sheet of canvas or plastic coated fabric to keep things in the dry. Also horses are terrified of umbrellas. So I guess they are scared of anything that's used to temporarily shed water.</p></div>		</li>
