			<div class="markdown"><p>No, atomic decay is a quantum effect so it is 'purely random' and cannot be determined at a fundamental level. Some effects, like flipping a coin, are 'chaotic random' in that the event itself is a random 50/50 but you theoretically could predict the coin flip with sufficient data (you knew the coin's weight, the wind in the room, initial velocity, etc.).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case, no: it's not that we don't know the answer, it's that we do know that we can't know the answer.</p>
<p>At least, that's how it was explained to me. But I'm a statistician, not a nuclear physicist, so take it with a grain of salt.</p></div>		</li>
