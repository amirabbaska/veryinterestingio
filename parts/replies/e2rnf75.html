			<div class="markdown"><p>You sound convincing but this is actually debated in the scientific literature.</p>
<p>1) On the longer run, not eating will deplete you of your energy resources.</p>
<p>2) The metabolic pathways engaged in digestion are active in cells of the digestive system, such as enterocytes, not immune cells such as neutrophilles.<br />
3) Loss of appetite is universal, not just for food-borne infections.</p>
<p>4) Anorexia is accompanied by a slew of other symptoms, activated by the same biological pathways, such as fatigue and muscle pain.  </p>
<p>An alternative suggestion is the Eyam Hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is plenty in literature and the evolutionary advantage is debated because natural selectors are not clear cut and include many confounding variables. Many divergent selectors can cause a single adaptation. </p>
<p>The Eyam Hypothesis?! Not saying that it doesn't contribute a little to the genetic fitness of SAA, but the group dynamics of sickness behaviour is hardly a selector on non social animals that can't even move closer to relatives such as sea anenomes which exhibit sickness asscociated anorexia like the rest of us. SAA is more acient than even locomotion.</p>
<p>The thermic effect of food digestion is well documented and averages out to 5-10% of calorie expenditure. That is a huge amount of calories for situations in which the body doesn't allow for one walking around the room or even moving in bed. It is completely obvious that this is a selector. Again, there is no &quot;long run&quot; if the organism dies of infection tomorrow. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#In_ecology:_modeling_population_growth" target="_blank">Infections exhibit exponential growth</a> where just a 10% alteration in early stages of pathogen replication have MASSIVE consequences in later stages. Early game is prioritized over late game in immune function strategy.</p>
<p>Also, there are way more metabolic pathways associated with food consumption than just those in the digestive system! There is plenty of literature on how fasting upregulates autophagy which is needed to eliminating diseased tissue. The mechanism of action of autophagy upregulatuon during a fasted state include decreased serum amino acid concentration among other things.</p>
<p>There isn't just one reason in play here. Evolution compounds disparate factors to produce a single adaptation. <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2016/8071539/" target="_blank">This paper</a> explains those factors well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't you know if you can answer this, but out of curiosity, does your body convert dead pathogens into usable energy? In situations where external caloric energy is restricted (e.g., sickness), it seems like the body would take whatever it could get. </p></div>		</li>
