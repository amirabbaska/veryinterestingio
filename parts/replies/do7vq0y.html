			<div class="markdown"><p>well that's not correct your stomach definitely doesn't absorb 100% of alcohol, a lot will get through into your GI due to normal digestion. it's not like your stomach get locked down as soon as any alcohol enters it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all the bacteria in your gut will be in direct contact with ethanol, it's not like you are directly flushing your intenstines with pure alcohol. Heavy drinking obviously has a significant effect on your gut flora, but it's not a 100% purge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question!  Endospores are basically small, dormant, heavily protected copies of the bacteria that reside within the confines of the cell wall, alongside the bacteria itself.  Alcohol will absolutely kill the main bacterial cell but the endospore will often survive.  Under the right conditions the endospore can grow into another active bacterium.  </p>
<p>A common bug spread in hospitals, C.difficile, is known for having this mechanism.  That’s why hospital staff are told to specifically wash their hands after contact with patients suspected to have this; the alcohol won’t reliably kill the endospores.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This name amuses me greatly. Like they found a bacteria species that causes problems so they just named it &quot;difficult&quot; as its scientific name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was combing through comments specifically hoping someone would bring up C.diff and this point. My other favorite c. diff tid bit is that, while most infections typically require hundreds if not thousands of individual bacterium c. diff  only requires something like six. Or so I was taught.</p>
<p>Wash your hands folks. If this isn't enough motivation, I employee you to see/smell a c.diff stool sample. That should do it. </p></div>		</li>

However, even this is subject to the biomechanical and biochemical properties of ethanol which destroy membranes, halt glycolysis and stop cell growth.</p></div>		</li>
