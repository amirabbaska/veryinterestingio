			<div class="markdown"><p>The OP is really two questions and everyone seems to be focusing on one:  </p>
<p>1) Why is the <em>north</em> (really not europe specifically) less biodiverse  </p>
<p>2) Why are hot-climate animals often venomous/poisonous</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About the fact that there are so few venomous animals in the north is mainly (what I believe without fact checking) that most venomus animals are reptiles and insects. Both of them or not warm blooded which makes months of winters with freezing temperature very difficult for those species to survive. </p>
<p>The food supply is also limited and less dense the colder it gets which also means less time must be spent waiting for pray and more time is required for moving, searching and hunting which is not optimal for spiders and snakes who usually becomes pray themselves by birds when they are on the move no longer hiding. </p></div>		</li>
