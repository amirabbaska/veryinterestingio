			<div class="markdown"><p>If you really want your mind blown, look for something with a “pressure balancing” valve, so that when someone flushes the toilet, you don’t get scalded by the drop in cold water pressure.</p>
<p>You can even go higher end and get something with a “thermostatic valve”, which will balance the flow to keep the same set temperature even as your water heater begins to run out of hot water and supplies cooler water to the input at the same pressure so you don’t have to keep changing it as your shower gets cooler and cooler over time (until you run out of enough hot water to even maintain the flow).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Brilliant!  Except the gradually decreasing temperature is how I know when to get out of the shower...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this. What you're wishing for is pretty standard in Europe, but as I recently discovered that it's not at all common in the UK for example. I have the exact same system as T3a_hunt3r, not in Germany but very close. Systems with one knob are only still found in old bathrooms over here. Mine actually has a temperature scalle on the right knob. Had in on 36 Celsius since I moved in. </p></div>		</li>
