			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fascinating question and I suspect all the hedge fund quants are looking at this right now. There is a non-trivial chance that humans will be living in some kind of air-conditioned bubble cities by the end of the century, or perhaps underground, because the wet bulb temperatures will be too high for us to be able to cool off by sweating. (I swear this is already true where I grew up in St. Louis.) There is no doubt in my mind that in that future--or most others--energy remains the main resource contested. Energy makes everything else possible, whether me typing out this answer and flinging it to you across the interweb or growing the food in the sandwich I ate for lunch. </p>
<p>As for what we might not expect, maybe folks in the far future will be fighting over our trash dumps? We waste a lot of perfectly good stuff, from rare earths and other precious metals to all the energy embedded in those plastics...</p></div>		</li>
