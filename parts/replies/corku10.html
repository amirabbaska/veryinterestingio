			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something I definitely don't understand: If the magnitude is proportional to a positive power of distance, then wouldn't it increase to infinity as distance increases? Clearly the universe isn't a crush of matter due to the strong force, so there must be a term which decreases with distance and dominates the equation after a certain point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, what happens is that as you pull two quarks away from each other, energy builds up in the gluon field.  Eventually, this energy is enough to pop out a new quark pair out of the vacuum, and you get two hadrons instead of two quarks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OH I see, now that we have two hadrons, the pair is neutral and doesn't attract other quarks. That's an interesting way for the universe to work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you're yanking apart a red and anti-red quark, a new anti-red quark would pop into existence next to the red, and a new red would pop into existence next to the anti-red?</p>
<p>If you tried to pull a red away from a green and blue pair, would you get a new anti-red quark attached to the red, and a new red attached to the green and blue pair?</p>
<p>This is really cool stuff. I wish someone had explained it in these terms back in college physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, no. Hang on. I'm imagining a universe in which all matter is color neutral, but there is a pair of extra quarks far far away from one another, red and anti-red for the sake of argument. The force between them would be enormous. Are you saying, a pair of quarks would pop out of the vacuum next to each of the lonely quarks, creating two new hadrons? I'm not sure I can square that with conservation of energy. What am I missing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because most particles in the universe that you are talking about are color neutral, and as such, left unaffected by the strong force. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because the force-carrier particle has mass and self-interaction.</p>
<p>We feel electromagnetism at great distance because photons are massless; however the self-interaction especially of the gluons means that the strength of force being exerted by one nucleus never makes it so far as to be able to pull on something from another nucleus; their mass means that they can decay to more quarks instead of making it intact to the other nucleus.</p>
<p>Weak force is somewhat similar - it is only felt at distances comparable to a nucleus because the W,Z bosons decay before they get any further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! That was a really clear and understandable treatment, accessible to a lay person who understands basic concepts and identifying where the extra complexity lies. It was precisely the sort of explanation I was hoping for.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The gluon, however, has color, which means it is also affected by its own force.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had never heard of this. So this particle interacts with itself? Or with others of it's kind? Can someone give a more detailed explanation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, two quarks will interact by having a gluon change their color. This is way easier with pictures, but bear with me.</p>
<p>Say a red quark and a blue quark are interacting. They will do so by exchanging colors: a gluon will take the &quot;redness&quot; and give it to the blue quark, and give the &quot;blueness&quot; to the red quark. Now, this needs to be done at the same time, so one of these exchanges is going to have to happen (bear with me) <strong>backwards in time</strong>: the gluon takes red while giving blue, and <strong>then</strong> takes blue while giving red (here taking blue happens after giving blue). Now a particle going backwards in time is just its anti-particle, so the gluon will either have to carry red and anti-blue, or blue and anti-red, depending on which quark gets its color changed first. That, however, means the gluon is not white.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could have two red quarks interact with each other. In that scenario, the gluon would carry red and anti-red, and would be white. So mostly it depends on the interaction. Did I mention there's no way to differentiate colors?</p>
<p>Note that here I'm explaining why gluons see strong force, but not how they do it.</p>
<p>Edit: Clarification and spelling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, would the gluons that mediate a red-quark red-quark interaction not be affected by other gluons (since it is red-antired=white), but the gluons that mediate a red-blue interaction WOULD be affected by other gluons (since it is red-antiblue=nonwhite)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive me if this is foolish, but I am deeply confused by the time traveling gluon. During the period that it's traveling backwards are there effectively two gluons, one traveling forward and one traveling back? Wouldn't this result in more energy being in the system during that period, as you'd have the energy of the gluon as well as its time-reversed counterpart? Or does the gluon somehow reverse causality/history by rewriting what it was doing during that period? That doesn't seem possible: even in the weirdness of quantum mechanics, you can't erase a cause and still have an effect, right, there are always causes for actions, even if they're stochastic in nature? And if it's able to move backwards in time, wouldn't that mean that the interaction wouldn't be simultaneous, since the gluon would arrive at the original quark before it would have reached the second quark? Or is the explanation something simpler, like &quot;we know that property X has to be maintained and if you reverse the time dimension in the equations governing the gluon's behavior it has the quality of maintaining that property, therefore the gluon must be simultaneously transferring color backwards and forwards in time&quot;? And is there somewhere I could go to see the equations that govern this/get an explanation of how they represent the behavior that you're describing? Sorry to badger you with questions, but I find the whole matter fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gluon has color so one gluon can decay in two gluons, or two gluons annihilate imto one gluon. So a colored particle emots colored gluons around itself which then explode in number. So if you are close to the charge you see white and if you try and gey further you see color and run back to the white</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can, you can hypothetically create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glueball" target="_blank">glueballs</a>, basically particles only made from gluons. Also, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-jet_event" target="_blank">three jets events</a> from quark-antiquark production indicate the existence of gluons, two jets from each quark/antiquark and the third jet from a gluon.</p></div>		</li>
