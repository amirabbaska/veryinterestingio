<p>The first mention I know of this is this quote by Michael Crichton:</p>
<p>“Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect is as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the &quot;wet streets cause rain&quot; stories. Paper's full of them.
In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.”</p>
<p>Crichton later said  Murray Gell-Mann didn't really postulate the effect, but he used his name because it was prestigious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Further, both Reuters and AP are largely defined by their desire to be as objective as possible, sticking only to facts. They're never perfect at it, being fallible organizations run by fallible humans, but you often need in-depth reporting by people with an opinion and experience, and who can contextualize a situation in another country for a domestic audience who may not fully appreciate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nearly every news source tries to &quot;contextualize&quot; their content by adding their own opinions and agendas to everything. I for one think it's great that there's still people out there trying to be objective. The world needs more of that, not less.</p>
<p>Let people read the objective facts, and form opinions on their own. People don't need to be lead to the &quot;correct&quot; opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You failed to understand the point made in the part you quoted. I know as an objective fact that there were riots in Thailand in 2013, and unrest in Tibet in 2008. I know these facts because these were the facts reported by Reuters at the time of these events. Context is not opinion. As an outsider of these events, I lack context. Since I don't speak Thai or Mandarin, native people living there can't provide me the context (Nor could the Chinese provide it anyhow, seeing as the story was censored there at the time). If an investigative journalist were to have been there to ask questions and report on the situation, I would understand better than I do, even if the reporter in question has liberal or conservative opinions. Objective facts are nothing more than abstract bundles of sense-data when lacking context. Phenomenalism is dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, Thailand is a much better example than even the Palestinian and Israeli situation, since most people in the US or UK at least have an opinion on Israel and Palestine, and our willingness to change that opinion is often very, very small.  Our opinions on who has legitimate grievances in Thailand and who is just &quot;working the system&quot; to maintain their existing power are, for most people, made by the reportage we read, since so few of us have any context whatsoever as to what's happening over there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they do. You've read research papers, yes? They read like Armenian tv installation instructions much of the time. What does it mean? You need an expert that can break down the expert speak into something a non expert can understand. Politics cannot be just a stream of content, you need someone to co contextualize it. Even throwing information at someone isn't objective. You have to leave something out or focus on something. That's having a bias. And it's good a lot of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a noble idea, but in reporting news, there are often less &quot;objective&quot; facts than you think, particularly when you're discussing human-caused tragedies and violence.  The very choice of words you use is often subjective.</p>
<p>In a war situation, if you describe something as a &quot;war&quot;, you legitimize the grievances of both sides.  If you call a group &quot;rebels&quot;, you're legitimizing the authority of the other side.  If you call a gunman a &quot;shooter&quot; or &quot;an accused shooter&quot;, that changes the context subtly.  For a concrete example, think about Israel and the Palestinian situation - the very words you use to describe various groups helps shape readers' opinions as to who the legitimate powers are, who has legitimate grievances, and what the legitimate venues for disagreement itself are.</p>
<p>How you write a story - even by organizations respected as the AP and Reuters are - helps shape that story.  This idea that the media colours stories consistently one way is usually a fantasy of partisan politics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many news outlets don't just source their international news from AP and Reuters, they source as much news as they can from any source they can get. CGP Grey, someone best known for funny, brief explanatory YouTube videos, noted something I found very true in my own experience: the closer you are to a particular subject of interest, the more you notice that news reportage on it is incredibly wrong. This isn't limited to areas where one has a subjective opinion, such as politics, where if one is an extreme partisan for one major US party, everything someone of the other party says is automatically &quot;wrong&quot; or at least suspect. This includes just basic day-to-day science, technology, human interest, current events, and gossip stories. The basic facts are often wrong, the conclusions are often not sufficiently supported by the evidence, and they simply don't match what an &quot;insider&quot; to a particular field would agree properly describes the truth, even about non-controversial issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CGP Grey wan't the first to notice it. Michael Crichton called it the &quot;Gell-Mann Effect&quot;, and talked about it in his speech &quot;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061020012137/http://www.crichton-official.com/speeches/speeches_quote03.html" target="_blank">Why Specualte</a>&quot;. You may like the whole speech, but the money quote:</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree - this wasn't new to CGP Grey, he's just the person who got me thinking about it most recently.  My own interactions with the press have echoed both Crichton's and Grey's observations, both as the subject of a piece, and as someone offering in-depth correction of an existing piece which had nothing to do with me.  The correction was particularly eye-opening, as it had to do with basic misunderstanding of terminology, and resulted in a claim that was tens of thousands of times off.  By the time the author was done accepting my input (and others), it was only off by ten - in the other direction - and still missed all the subtleties of reality.  In the end, the &quot;corrected&quot; piece was, arguably, just as wrong as the original.</p></div>		</li>
