			<p>Yup.  It works in other bases.<br><br>If the base is B, the difference between the number and it's &quot;reverse&quot; is always divisible by (B-1).<br><br>You can always &quot;decompose&quot; or break apart a number minus its reverse into a sum of numbers minus their reverses where every single one is an integer multiple of B^n - 1 for some n.<br><br>Then we simply note this:<br><br>(B^n - 1) % (B-1) = 0<br><br>why?<br><br>(B^n - 1) = (B - 1)(B^(n-1) + B^(n-2) ... B^2 + B + 1)<br><br>For example...<br><br>2030 - 0302 = 2030 - 302  <br>  =   (2000 - 2) + (30 - 300)  <br>   =   2(B^3 - 1) + 3(-B)(B^1 - 1)  <br><br></p>		</li>
