			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree with you, I also think there could be a difference between people who were raised bilingual and those that learnt a second language later in life.</p>
<p>I definitely can think in two different languages, and generally switch after speaking a language with someone for a period of time, although not always. I am not a completely different person of course but there are subtle differences in how outgoing/serious I am for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bilingual here. Learnt my second language properly at 13, but could always read, write and have basic vocabulary conversation.</p>
<p>Anyway, while I was new to the second language, I had a friend who would say that I was two different people when I spoke in s.l and English. Recently she mentioned that there's no difference anymore.</p>
<p>I use both languages everyday. Often switching mid sentence because most people I am around are bilingual too. I think by not differentiating too much I have married the languages.</p></div>		</li>
