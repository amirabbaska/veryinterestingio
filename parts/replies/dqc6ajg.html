			<div class="markdown"><p>It has more to do with water pressure than temperature.  My house gets its water from a well.  This well has a pump that pressurizes a tank.  That tank provides the water pressure for the house.   As water is used pressure in the tank drops and is repressurized by my well pump.  </p>
<p>Every time my well pump turns on the shower faucet stops “singing.”  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not very sure about &quot;singing&quot;. There is definitely a &quot;whistling&quot; type sound in our shower. I can easily hear when the water is suddenly going to get very hot or very cold. People tell me I'm crazy for it, but the few who've had me in the bathroom while they shower (in various buildings, not necessarily this one) so I can say &quot;Step back or you're gonna freeze&quot; know differently.</p></div>		</li>
