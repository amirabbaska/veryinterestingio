			<div class="markdown"><p>This ability is currently the actual limiter on satellite lifespan. We are now sufficiently good at satellite design that the average satellite could probably have another 5-10 years of service life if it weren't for running out of fuel for station keeping and eventual deorbiting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geostationary satellites do need to be precise. From the user's viewpoint, they are generally maintained to within 0.075 degree of their published look angle. The geosynchronous orbit is 265000 km in circumference, so that means that they need to be within about 55 km of their nominal position. They use their thrusters for periodic correction of their orbit. </p>
<p>When they run low on fuel, they are sometimes allowed to drift N-S while maintaining E-W position because it uses less fuel. The movement can be 5 degrees, so a satellite dish with a motorized tracking controller is needed to use these semi-stationary satellites. The cost of using these satellites is lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I please go a little further with Opie's question and ask: how do all the different satellite companies organize which orbit their's will be in? I presume there are many different countries each with their own agendas and needs, so how do they coordinate the different orbits? Are there space rules countries have to follow? Is there some global regulatory board that must approve the proposed orbit before the satellite can be launched so different satellites' orbits don't conflict with each other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a good answer but I can point you in the right direction. A buddy of mine works for a company AGI. They apparently have Defense Department contracts to keep track of all the satellites up there. They have a public facing site: I think it's called <a href="http://apps.agi.com/SatelliteViewer/" target="_blank">Spacebook.</a></p>
<p>I use it in high school astronomy class to show kids just how many are up there. Also, they get a lick out of seeing the geostationary ring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are governing rocket bodies that you have to apply to and get permission from etc in each country. But if youre worried about them crashing don't be. There's thousands up there already and an absurd amount of space.  In fact that's one of the bigger challenges,  sending people to iss or rendezvous with other crafts up there as if everything doesn't go perfectly to plan. Eg you burn to long or short or late etc. You can easily be miles away from your target</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The satellites have a set orbit so we know where they will be at any time. </p>
<p>Control stations in the ground monitor the satellites to ensure they stay in their orbit.</p>
<p>The satellites constantly broadcast a signal containing their exact location and exact time of the signal. GPS receivers listen for this signal and computer their distance from the satellite using the time it took the signal to reach them and speed that the signal travels. </p>
<p>In order to calculate your position in the earth your receiver needs signals from 4 different gps satellites at once, it can then calculate it's position using geometry. The 24 GPS satellites orbit in a way so there are pretty much always at least 4 overhead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some questions about the clock inside the receiver. I understand the satellites have atomic clocks, but most receivers just have regular clocks. I assume some sort of digital 1970 UNIX time thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How do you accurately calculate the travel time, when your watch is inaccurate? When 1 millisecond is 300 kilometers, how can I trust my watch? I understand they use 3-4 satellites at minimum, but still the overlapping circles should be quite large?</p>
</li>
<li>I suppose a GPS receiver must calibrate its clock somehow. Otherwise it would be very inaccurate after 1 year of use. How do they calibrate to sufficient accuracy? In particular GPS receivers without internet access? I suppose they use the same satellites. But they can't just use the time in the broadcast signal, because then the signal travel time would be 0, and my position would be on top of that satellite. Do they use some sort of average?</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought I knew how GPS worked, but as always, there are complicating nuances.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>We know where they're <em>supposed</em> to be, but this thread is about how precise these orbits actually are. At a given point in time, how far off is our calculation of where the satellite is versus its actual location? And how much of an impact does it have on the accuracy of your triangulated position on Earth?</p></div>		</li>
