			<div class="markdown"><p>Since this fits with the topic at hand, I have to point out that quote is not proven to have come from Mark Twain. </p>
<p>Although it may be paraphrased from some of his writing.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be a virtue, but only when that faith is well-deserved. If you give faith to anyone you are either being dumb, or genuinely too kindhearted to be human. If you give your faith only to those you trust, it becomes loyalty, and that's a virtue. (Imo anyway)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to define the word &quot;faith.&quot; What people often mean, and the things I'd love to see eradicated are &quot;believing things without evidence&quot; and &quot;pretending to know things you don't know.&quot; Things like trust, loyalty, etc are positive traits, when applied correctly of course.  </p></div>		</li>
