<p>This is a great question and one that we get frequently. Fortunately, graduating astronomy majors regularly have one of the lowest rates of unemployment according to several studies (<a href="http://www.studentsreview.com/unemployment_by_major.php3?sort=Rate" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/04/news/economy/jobs-lowest-unemployment/" target="_blank">2</a>)! Before we get into the jobs we all get into we should address why astronomy degrees are so sought after in the job market. </p>
<p>An undergraduate degree in astronomy will give you training in problem solving, research skills, coding, data management, statistics, and how to work independently or with a team. This says to an potential employer that you could be given any problem and you would be able to figure out how to solve it, whether that means assembling a team to research the issue or coding a solution on your own. </p>
<p>Since you will leave college with a wide array of skills in coding, research, and data you will be well suited for a number of jobs in business, software development, marketing, engineering, and of course academia. </p>
<p>In the context of the job market an undergraduate degree in astronomy or astrophysics will give you the similar training to a physics degree and often can be substituted when applying for graduate positions (if you go to college that only has a physics degree you can go into astronomy as a graduate student). The American Institute of Physics looks at employment in the field each year, here is a link to their most recent analysis of students <a href="https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/statistics/employment/bach1yrafterdeg-p-14.1.pdf" target="_blank">one year after their physics bachelors degree.</a> </p>
<p>A PhD in astronomy will give you more training to work independently, develop your computer skills, and hone your research ability. This makes you a prime candidate for research positions in academia or at NASA. You will have the option to become a university professor as well, though these jobs are very competitive. </p>
