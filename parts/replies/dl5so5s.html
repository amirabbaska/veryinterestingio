<p>With a soap opera or something else that has to be filmed quickly and/or on a budget, they set up two cameras and do the whole scene in one take. This means that the lighting has to be set up in a more bland way to accommodate two cameras at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is also true of sitcoms but they don't have the same &quot;cheap&quot; feel.</p>
<p>Part of it is definitely the frame rate. Soaps are shot at a higher frame rate whereas sitcoms are shot at the lower frame rate. That lower rate has a certain look to it we associate with movies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imo it's not only the frame rate (which is irrelevant in the UK as everything here is 25fps) but that soaps are often filmed interlaced rather than progressive scan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's interlaced, it's Fields rather than frames.  UK is 50i or 25p
Interlaced captures motion smoother because of the higher field rate.</p>
<p>This smoother motion looks less &quot;cinematic&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lower frame rate should be &quot;cheaper&quot;, no?  I feel like the higher frame rate shots look more vivid and bright- almost TOO much. But I feel like these higher frame rate shots are almost all indoors on closed sets. </p>
<p>What does a high frame rate look like outside?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sitcoms absolutely have that cheap feel. The truth is frame rate is just a tradition at this point. There’s no such thing as a “cinematic frame rate. Having everything blurred to hell doesn’t make something feel cinematic it just makes you sick. 24 FPS was chosen because it was the absolute minimum frame rate needed to make films not look like slideshows, which meant projectors and cameras could be cheaper and easier to build. There’s nothing special about it. Even the whole motion blur argument is bunk, our eyes apply motion blur to anything that moves, there’s no need to do it artificially. The only reason people think 24 FPS looks good is because that’s what they’ve been told looks good. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not inventing my experience. Sitcoms look distinctly different from soaps and live TV.  <em>To me</em> soaps look cheap and sitcoms do not. There is no question that the way the video is captured for a typical sitcom is different than a typical soap. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not really true of sitcoms though. A sitcom has 13 to 20 or so episodes a year. A soap opera has pretty much as many weekdays as there are in a year. The shooting schedule on a soap opera us MUCH tighter/faster than a sitcom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referring specifically to the multi-camera / single setup aspect of the process. Yes there are some single camera sitcoms, most are multi-camera setups shot on only a few sets that have their fourth wall open and a more or less static lighting look. </p></div>		</li>
