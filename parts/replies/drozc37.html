<p>Elit: But the reason materials fail in a brittle fashion in colder temperatures is because it’s more convenient to break bonds than it is to create more disorder in the system. </p>

<p>This. Other answers don’t directly address the underlying kinetics responsible for the brittle behavior. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By &quot;convenient,&quot; though, do you mean it a) requires less energy or b) happens faster and relieves stress on the material more quickly or c) both?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both.  But it’s more A than B since materials try to occupy the lowest energy possible. Think about how much work it is to find a book in an organized library compared to a mountain of books. </p>
<p>B is kinda more complicated since no pretext is given. The rate of the load plays a role depending on the material, and there’s also creep to consider so there’s a lot that could go on depending on the material. </p>
<p>But in general, it’s about what requires the least amount of energy for pretty much anything. </p></div>		</li>
