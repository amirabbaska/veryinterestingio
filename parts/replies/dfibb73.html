			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well written response.</p>
<p>As someone who is intermediate at most with C/C++, I think another aspect is thinking ahead in your plan of attack. </p>
<p>Such as with your tea making example: Are the dishes clean? Did Jack ever return my favorite mug? Has the electricity bill been paid?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just an extreme novice, but I often find myself writing programs without thinking far enough ahead. It's definitely a skill you develop over time.</p></div>		</li>
