			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this great version of monopoly called 'anti-monopoly'. It's basically regular monopoly however the players decide at the start of the game whether they are monopolists or concurrents (don't know the English word for it). Both player types have their benefits. For example: a monopolist can only build when he has all the streets of a city. A concurrent can build with only one street in possession but yields a lower income from it. It gives a nice extra dimension to the game of monopoly and gives a better understanding of real world dynamics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be a state, but it can also not be a state.</p>
<p>For example, the factory could be controlled by all the workers that work in it, but not by the workers of the factory next door.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That just sounds like a cooperative company in a capitalist system.  I suppose the difference would be that in your example the state would  actively prevent any non-cooperative companies from existing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're talking about the communist case? Well preventing private ownership wouldn't be a thing that any authoritative body has to do, in theory - everything is abundant, so you don't actually gain anything by saying &quot;well this fabricator is <em>mine</em> and you can't use it!&quot;. Everyone will just shrug, and think you're a weirdo.</p></div>		</li>
