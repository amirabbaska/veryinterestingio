			<div class="markdown"><p>In 2065, half of the original Pu^238 will still exist and be generating half the original heat energy.  Due to loss in efficiency in the heat-&gt; electrical conversion at lower temps, as well as degradation of the thermocouples, the electrical  power will have declined more quickly, Soon (&lt;10-15 years), there will be insufficient power for critical systems, and communication will cease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't expect them to last more than a few more years (early 2020s), because the thermocouples are degrading. Not surprisingly, thermocouples have improved since these were built and Curiosity should last longer (at least in terms of power).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is a complete article on TEG (Thermoelectric Generators..) As a side note, that by applying electricity to similar setups you turn the unit into a heat pump using the Peltier Effect.</p>
<p>Most of your portable cooler refrigerators that plug into a cigarette lighter use these Peltier devices to cool what is in the cooler and you can also change them to heat also. The only complicated part of the RTG is the fact it uses plutonium not a complicated or expensive part if not used with Plutonium.:)</p></div>		</li>
