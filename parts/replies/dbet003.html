			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any idea why addicts have a drug or choice?  Like why is every alcoholic not also a raging coke fiend, etc... ?  Why can an alcoholic smoke a cigarette and not pick up the pack for weeks or months, but if they have a sip of scotch it turns in to a 3-day bender?</p>
<p>My guess is that that certain substances create addiction pathways differently, but I really have no idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question. I don't know the answer, but I can tell you a bit of what I know. </p>
<p>Different drugs have different ways of messing with our brain. Drugs generally target receptors, enzymes, or another protein involved in some part with transmission of signals from one neuron to the next. There are many many different classes of receptors. For example, alcohol targets the GABA receptor. GABA receptors are generally &quot;inhibitory&quot; in that when the receptor binds to their &quot;signal&quot; they cause their neuron to be less likely to &quot;fire&quot; a message to the next neuron. This is why alcohol is classified as a &quot;depressant&quot; not because it makes people sad as we colloqually think the term depressed means, but rather that it just dampens activity of the brain aka &quot;depresses&quot; it. Throughout your brain different areas have different densities of gaba receptors. In addition, as individuals with genetic variation to some degree the proteins in our body are different(because the proteins made by the cells are encoded within our dna) and thus since receptors are proteins produced by our cells our receptors can also be different. So you could consider that perhaps different individuals have different receptors some of which for some reason sync really well with a certain drug and through the way that their neural networks are lined up their experience of a drug is more pleasurable than another individuals experience of the same drug. I think a good example of this is marijuana. You can find stories of loads of people who have bad experiences. It makes them anxious or paranoid and they don't like it. You could chalk it up to a bad environment when they smoked or a bad strain of drug but I personally believe they are essentially just wired a bit differently and generally their experience of the drug will not be as pleasurable as it is for others. I also happen to know an individual personally who claims to experience absolutely no physical change in response to opiate painkillers. They don't get a reduction in pain or any pleasureable feeling whatsoever. Opiates also target the GABA receptor class but, to put it simply, they target a specific piece/part of the GABA receptor known as the &quot;Mew&quot; subunit. So for him, his gaba receptor for some reason does not bind opiates if you believe his firsthand account(I do). </p>
<p>To add to this, drugs can induce more long term changes to genetic expression in the brain. For example, there is a protein called &quot;Stathmin&quot; that is involved with cellular &quot;cytoskeletal structure&quot; aka the actual physical structure and shape of the cell. Cells are highly dynamic structures. They divide. Multiply. Change shape. Add receptors. Remove receptors. Synthesize chemicals. They are autonomous brilliantly elegant little machines. &quot;Stathmin&quot; is somehow involved with changing the shape and structure of the cell. Most importantly, its expression(aka level/amount in the cell) changes in response to cocaine use. You can probably extrapolate that this would mean that cocaine literally can change the expression of stathmin and thus the shape of some cells, thus their function and relationship to other neurons(considering each neuron can be attached to thousands of other neurons) and thus effect overall neural networks or pathways in the brain. </p>
<p>You are on the right track in your thinking. Once you research a bit you begin to realize how staggering the number of potential variables really is in biochemical/genetic research on addiction. Your question is really good, I am sorry I can't do a good job providing a real answer. If my professor were to do an ama this would be an excellent question to ask.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a recovering addict whose drug of choice is opiates, I would like to add that for me, nothing ever really triggered that rewards center in my brain like opiates did. Alcohol makes me sick, pot makes me paranoid and slow, coke, crack, or meth make me jittery, etc. But pain pills make me feel sooooo good. Just as you may not like coffee because it makes you jittery or tastes bad, others love it. It all depends on what type of high you are looking for/enjoy, and then your brain kicks in and says, &quot;Hey, I liked this! Do it again! Again! Again! Okay, now I need it to feel normal.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something I am fascinated by as well, because I have had two different experiences with two gabanergic chemicals: alcohol and benzos. Alcohol I can somewhat moderate, but benzodiazepines create that void with which I cannot stop redosing. I know they both act slightly different on the receptor, but they are nearly identical in the effects they bring on and the affect they cause.</p>
<p>I think what happened for me was I didn't really drink much because of the toxic effects of alcohol, and meanwhile I poured in the benzos because they are non-toxic. This rewired my brain. I can moderate with alcohol presently, but eventually I will do the same thing as I did with benzos--rewiring myself to the point of no return. This is why I don't drink either in my personal recovery.</p>
<p>I think that people's drugs of choice are shaped by many factors, but toxicity should be taken heavily into account. I never was able to build a cocaine habit, not because I didn't like the high but because I couldn't stand the other adverse reactions. Same with other stimulants. My favorite was IV narcotics, but I know others that could never get past the nausea it brought on.</p>
<p>People have their favorites. And many addicts can use another chemical in moderation, for a time. Ultimately, the problem is that the slightest positive hedonic effect will eventually cause permanent habituation, in that no matter how long you go without the chemical, once you go back to it you will be pushed by your most base instincts to redose to the same degree you did before cessation. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this be why some people prefer uppers instead of downers and vice versa? </p>
<p>In my personal experience, I have always preferred downers. I have a super addictive personality, so I know for a fact that because I like downers so much if I were to ever try heroin I would be hooked from the first dose. It's actually a terrifying thing that I know about myself because I don't know if I could stop myself if someone were to present me with the option.</p>
<p>Thanks for your in-depth responses by the way, I always like learning more about addiction seeing as it affects me very strongly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking from experience, some people like vanilla, some people like chocolate. It's really just your taste and what you're looking for. I'm not really interested in uppers cuz I don't need to be hyped for anything, but I love just being to chill, relax, and watch time fly by.
I'm not against using uppers but they have their time and place. I can't screw around with opiates but I don't mind doing coke if I'm at a party or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would love an AMA! Poly drug addict here, in recovery for some drugs, still using others. I want to get clean and become a counselor or specialist who helps those with addiction problems because I understand it first hand. But first I must be drug free...sigh. I would be very interested in the AMA though, as a scientist (B.S. in Chemistry) and an addict!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kudos for finishing a college degree. A BS in chemistry is no joke. Well done. If I get enough interest in an ama and get my professor on board I will be sure to make sure you and everyone else interested is aware when it will be taking place. </p></div>		</li>

Do you know what role other predepositions like ADHD play in all this? (ADHD -people being know for having addictive personalities)
I would suspect it has to do with the problem in dopamine transfer etc. since you say neuronpeptide operates on a level above that of dopamine.. is this a possible explanation? Or would it have more to do with their lack in executive function? Or something intirely different?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have ADHD my friend, I have spent the past 5 years of my life (I'm 22 in a couple months) dealing with multiple addiction problems. The biggest problems for me are Adderall and cocaine. Don't get me wrong I love most drugs (MDMA, LSD, Cannabis, Mushrooms, Alcohol, etc.) Pretty much anything I can get my hands on aside from opiates I don't know if it's because I don't feel the effects (I've been told my opiate receptors are just numb (by other users not doctors) but whether there right or wrong I never have any desire to do them and when I tried them I never got &quot;high&quot; just a little sleepy. However the uppers as I mentioned earlier such as Adderall and cocaine, I crave! I mean i fucking hate that I like them but I can't seem to stop myself when they are around. In relation to your question I wanted to say that I think since those with ADHD are fed amphetamines at such a young age we are predispositions to love the feeling of uppers because we were taught as children that, that was what &quot;normal&quot; felt like. I'm not trying to blame the pills I took as a kid for my decisions now but i definitely believe that it plays into what my drugs of choice are now. </p></div>		</li>
