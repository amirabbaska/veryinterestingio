			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your condolences. I wish it hadn’t lasted as long as it did (the last few days were painful to see) but more or less I agree that it is a more peaceful way to go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering about the &quot;old age&quot; thing. I always just assume it some kind of cancer that people just don't know about. What is the cause of the old age death? Cells getting tired and not functioning anymore? Thx.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I’ve read in text books and the way the hospice nurses explained it to me is basically what you said. Everything is just too old to work. I’m no expert and I’m sure that “too old to work” is putting it in the most simple terms but that’s how I understand it. I’m sure someone here or elsewhere would be able to tell you what happens in better detail.</p>
<p>Oh and as far as the cancer thing goes for all I know she could have had it. The last few years of her life she didn’t leave her home expect for last year when her bowels started to not function properly due to a blockage in her colon. But even then they didn’t do much because of her age. They just prescribed medication to help her “go” and left it at that, saying that any surgery at her age would be dangerous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You won’t find a proper death certificate that stated ‘old age’ as a cause. Then again, when it is clear that this is the case - as opposed to trauma or a murder, a definite cause is not searched. </p>
<p>There are always several imbalances, conditions or diseases that exhaust the capability of the body to counteract them. When it does, we shut down. Cancer itself is also never a cause of death, it’s a cause of the cause. </p>
<p>We could keep the lights on a bit longer (think of an underpowered charger that only maintains the power steady) but the things needed are expensive, traumatizing and imply risks of their own. It’s also a murky area from an ethical viewpoint.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense to me. I also never knew thought about cancer not being a cause of death but that also makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, no one dies of “old age”, it’s always something. Old age makes certain illnesses more likely, that’s all. At that age those illnesses usually come on slower, and gentler at first, but persevere. So maybe her kidneys started failing, and she finally faded from that, or something similar. </p></div>		</li>
