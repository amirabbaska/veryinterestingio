			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever seen those pictures of a super moon next to a building and go &quot;How the hell did they get the moon to be that big?&quot; The photographer used a lens that has some insane zoom to get that close up of the moon as it crests the horizon. </p>
<p>The same gear was likely used with some extra, high precision stabilization gear so that they can make adjustments without the shot going wild. The closer you zoom into something the easier it is for even the slightest movements to look like the camera is getting tackled to the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anyone is confused, this joke is based on the fact that in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, players could shoot the moon with a sniper rifle, which altered the size of the moon. There were about 4 different sizes I think?</p></div>		</li>
