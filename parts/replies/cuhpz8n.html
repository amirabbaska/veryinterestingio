			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense. Also, by &quot;sour&quot; do you mean &quot;stale&quot;? Because you said &quot;stale&quot; earlier and I honestly don't know that I've ever identified that taste in milk. I probably just haven't noticed it. We usually keep our milk around until it gets sour.</p>
<p>Edit: Which usually takes ~2 weeks, not like several weeks on end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, after 4-5 days, even under refrigeration the milk would be separated into water and protein content and it will taste sour like an acid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UHT milk pouches are shelf/room temperature stable for 12+ months and remain ok with hot/cold temperatures, and don't really start to deteriorate until exposed to oxygen.</p>
<p>OP is talking about regular milk in a pouch. Maybe pasteurised. Pasteurised milk in a pouch is still commonly available across the western world due and popular to reduced packaging wastage. If your family is going to consume a litre or two of milk each day anyway, why pay for extra packaging when you can just pour a pouch of milk into some other container (one that gets emptied and cleaned every day or two)</p>
<p>In western countries, aside from the actual pasteurisation process, milk is chilled all the way from cow to store. That doesn't really happen in India.</p>
<p>That said, in countries I've lived outside the U.S. milk was generally &quot;a little off&quot; after a week. In the U.S., I can usually get milk that is good for two weeks as long as it remains refrigerated. I'm not sure if it spent more time in the supply chain in other countries, but not having to worry about using milk so quickly was definitely something I noticed during my first year in the states.</p></div>		</li>
