			<p>I disagree 100%. I was a youth who spent his 20's under the effects of Reaganomics. It was much easier to buy a car, go to college, or buy a house because of that man. <br><br>Did you read the link you provided?<br><br><br>&quot;The unemployment rate rose from 7% in 1980 to 10.8% in 1982, then declined to 5.4% in 1988&quot;<br><br>&quot;President Reagan’s eight years in office saw per capita GDP grow another 23.4% to $35,097.83.&quot;<br><br>&quot;During the period 1980–1988, the percentage of the total population below the poverty level ranged from a low of 13.0% in 1980 and 1988 to a high of 15.2% in 1983, yet dropped 1.2% during his administration and dropped 3.3% from their high in 1983 to their low in 1988.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The misery index, defined as the inflation rate added to the unemployment rate, shrunk from 19.33 when he began his administration to 9.72 when he left, the greatest improvement record for a President since Harry S. Truman left office.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency.&quot;<br><br>&quot;..Reagan's tax cuts, combined with an emphasis on federal monetary policy, deregulation, and expansion of free trade created a sustained economic expansion creating America's greatest sustained wave of prosperity ever.&quot;<br><br>&quot;the American economy grew by more than a third in size, producing a $15 trillion increase in American wealth. Consumer and investor confidence soared. Cutting federal income taxes, cutting the U.S. government spending budget, cutting useless programs, scaling down the government work force, maintaining low interest rates, and keeping a watchful inflation hedge on the monetary supply was Ronald Reagan's formula for a successful economic turnaround.&quot;<br><br>Could you fucking imagine if our unemployment rate was only 5.4%? If our poverty rate was below 15%? If our family income had grown by $4,000 the last 8 years?<br><br>During the Clinton 90's when everyone had a great job Democrats and Republicans alike praised Reagan. When people became polarized during the Bush years we saw Progressives (which is a Democrat gone bad) attack Reagan policies. Now you can find youngsters spouting ignorance about Reagan like a blithering idiot who only repeats what some fucking neckbeard told them.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ok, it might have been great for you at the time, but what about now? The OP was asking about nowadays. Trickle down economics aka Reaganomics does not work! Why is there such a massive gap in wealth? <br><br>Why can't we support a family of 4 or 5, buy a car, a house, and send off our kids to college without worrying if we are going to have enough for the water and power bill? It's because Reagan believed that if the wealth and power stays up top, it will slowly trickle down and everyone below will live happy lives. Bullshit!<br><br>We are the job creators because a strong economy is based on a strong middle class and without college education, jobs, and other opportunities, we can't afford to do all the stuff OP mentions.</p>		</li>

			<p>Because his policies started it all. Every president after him that has done nothing to improve our situation is just as guilty.</p>		</li>
