			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked in one of these labs, parafilm is different than skin but in the handling of the parafilm to set feeders the lab tech handles the membrane enough to cover it with the surface molecules that would normally be found on skin. Combined with the heating and it's an economically efficient substitute</p></div>		</li>

<p>I work as a research assistant and I routinely bloodfeed mosquitoes as part of my job. If you heat blood to roughly 37 C and then provide a membrane through which the mosquitoes can feed on it, they will definitely (and often enthusiastically) go for it. </p>

<p>Exactly.  Blood feeding behavior is largely driven by thermal cues--it can be enhanced by olfactory cues for sure, but heat is a huge driver. You can even put a beaker of warm water nearby and the mosquitoes will start probing for blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for asking! Our group works primarily with arboviruses... mostly flaviviruses like WNV, Zika, dengue, etc. It's a large-ish lab and there are a lot of different projects going on, but we specialize in mosquito vector competence and viral population genetics studies. </p></div>		</li>
