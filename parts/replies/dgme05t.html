			<div class="markdown"><p>The article mentions the secret service carrying out various background checks. Does anyone know what happens if someone 'fails' such a background check? Does the Secret Service have the lawful power to, for example, force a teacher to be fired or another pupil to be expelled from the school the President's children attend? Would they make that happen anyway even if it was unlawful?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am sure they have powers to enforce existing laws, but I doubt they can force someone to resign without a legal precedent. More likely, they do background checks for their own risk assessment. If there is a person with a questionable background, they can easily put that person under surveillance or put themselves on high alert when that person is around. You can address the problem &quot;behind the curtains&quot; without escalating it overtly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former President Bush was at a meeting at my mothers office, and the day before the secret service told a couple people not to come to work the next day. But that was just 1 day, I'm not sure what would happen to a teacher who would presumably be around the presidents kids every day. </p></div>		</li>
