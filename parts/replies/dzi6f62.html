			<div class="markdown"><p>For comparison, the deepest ocean trench is 11km down and the tallest peak is 8.85km up.</p>
<p>So ~20km from top to absolute bottom on the continental plates.</p>
<p>That's 0.3% of the Earth's radius.  The usual comparison is the 0.44% tolerance in billiard ball manufacturing - to scale Earth is literally smoother than a cue ball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of related to u/Lithium 's comment, Michael Stevens from Vsauce made a video on this topic a while ago, referencing almost the same facts at one point. He manages to make the dichotomy between deviation from roundness, and bumps and divots, though.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxhxL1LzKww" target="_blank">Here's a link.</a> He doesn't talk about the flatness of the earth until just before halfway, but the whole video is an interesting watch if you have the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually not quite true, the 0.44% tolerance is in how spherical a ball is. In terms of divots and bumps the tolerance is much less than earth's mountains and trenches.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This does not actually present evidence though, just points out the fallacy. What is the smoothness of a billiard ball vs that of the shrunk-down Earth? There are comparisons out there with sandpaper but none actually provide estimates of the surface roughness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't be that smooth. You would essentially feel bumps that were only a few .001&quot; high or low. Would be slight cracks at the bottom of dips where deep the trenches are and and little tiny pimples for the highest mountain peaks. The surface finish however would however be pretty smooth to the touch I suppose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the way earth's orbit is already quite imbalanced because of the Moon, that's because what orbits the sun is the center of mass of the Earth-Moon system. Compared to that an uneven distribution of mass on the Earth's surface is nothing. </p>
<p>As Conciese_Pirate says this doesn't affect the orbit on average, but every 28 days (the moon period) the Earth has been 4641km closer and further to the sun than it should. Anyway compared with the average distance between the Earth and the Sun that's still nothing, just a very small perturbation.</p></div>		</li>
