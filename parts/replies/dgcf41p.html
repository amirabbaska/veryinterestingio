<p>Why do pairings cancel out the magnetic field? All electrons have a magnetic moment (this is what gives rise to the magnetic field), it's orientation is dependent upon the particles' spin (either up or down). Due to the PEP, electrons in a filled shell will always pair up (one up and one down) and their magnetic moments will cancel. </p>

<p>It is unfortunately one of those seemingly simple questions that are tremendously difficult to answer. Perhaps one has to give up on accuracy for the sake of simplicity. But I thought the pure chromium is in fact a spin density wave (SDW) metal rather than an insulating antiferromagnet. In this case, I suspect that the origin of SDW in chromium has more to do with the Fermi surface geometry (or broadly, electronic structure) of chromium in its paramagnetic state than the local exchange interactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, this isn't really my area and I didn't know how to explain that so I went for the easiest one :-P.</p>
<p>Do you know of any good intermediate books on this subject? Finding things that are too simplistic and too hard is easy but the sweet-spot of 'early graduate overview' is very rare.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think the standard solid state physics texts like Kittel / Aschcroft-Mermin covers the basics. I personally find the book by Robert M. White is quite decent.</p>
<p>But I agree that there aren't many good intermediate level books on magnetism. I guess it has to do with the fact that magnetism is a very broad field and many things are not well understood. Almost every question can be answered with multiple levels of sophistication, and because of that, one can easily fall into a rabbit hole. For instance, while I was looking up the references for chromium magnetism, I found two long review articles published in the 80s. Apparently people are still publishing papers on it as of 2016.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bismuth has the opposite property that gives rise to ferromagnetism, called diamagnetism.  Solid bismuth has no unpaired electrons in its electronic structure, so it repels magnetic fields instead of being attracted to them like iron would be.  This means that if you had a large disc of bismuth, a strong magnet would float on top of it through the repulsion it experiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fe2+ can be both. In the presence of a cubic crystal field, it may be in the so-called &quot;high spin state&quot;, which carries spin quantum number S=2; or &quot;low spin state&quot;, which carries no spin and hence no magnetism. Which of the two cases happens depends on lots of details. Sometimes, as you heat up a material, you will find a transition from a &quot;low spin state&quot; to &quot;high spin state&quot;; in other words, the material becomes magnetic as you heat it up! Similar phenomenon happens to Co3+, too (and more well known, actually).</p>
<p>The most dramatic display of this phenomenon is in a certain molecular magnet with Fe2+. In its ground state, the molecule is <del>non magnetic</del> magnetic. But you can shine a laser on it and excite the molecule and turn the molecule <del>magnetic</del> non magnetic. The <del>magnetic</del> non-magnetic state of the molecule may survive up to a week.</p></div>		</li>
