			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so strange when i was a kid probably 13,14. I kept hearing my stepdad talk about becoming an sovereign citizen. He and a bunch of his friends constantly signed official letters to the governor general of canada asking for his/her permission to become a sovereign citizen. I didnt actually thinm it was possible or a real thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You were correct.</p>
<p>Being stateless is not the same as what many people seeking sovereign citizen status think they'll achieve. Many people who claim sovereign citizen status think they will become immune to US laws or state laws or both. This belief is often coupled with conspiracy theories surrounding the jurisdiction of Federal courts and/or the validity of the US Constitution (they have an argument, albeit a purely academic one, on the validity of the Constitution; but even that academic argument is countered by other academic arguments).</p>
<p>Sovereign citizenry, as conceived by these claimants, does not exist. Being within the territory of a state means you are subject to its laws (even diplomatic immunity is a legal doctrine/policy of the territory; ditto for the rules deciding when courts will apply laws written for other jurisdictions). You cannot escape taxation or legal duties by a declaration of sovereignty; the Constitution is the law of the land; the fringes on flags do not dictate anything about the court's jurisdiction. Being stateless in the US just means the courts will treat you like an immigrant.</p>
<p>Note that several citizens have made large group claims to sovereignty separate from the US govt. These persons were all either shot or scared off or forced to sign surrender agreements (Nat Turner's lot, South Carolina's nullification efforts, the Civil War, etc.). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My question is, if you're living in a very &quot;immigrant strict&quot; country (e.g. <em>Germany</em>) being stateless, and authorities catch you, what will they do? Deport you? Where to?</p></div>		</li>

<p>What I meant was 'a very closed country'. A country where it's hard to obtain permit to access, and almost impossible to obtain citizenship to.</p></div>		</li>
