			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah! Also in his explanation, if he adds the milk early then he pulls out the teabag really early too - so the tea will have a lot less steep time. So much less tea and cooked milk- these cups are gonna taste totally different</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's something that is completely missing from scientific discussions about food. Cooking, while based in science, depends largely on the technique. So while you may be able to describe a thermodynamic system of hot water, cold milk, and open air with mathematical models, the end result is going to be completely different when you are talking about cooking. Chemical A into Chemical B at Temperature C might not matter in a laboratory, but it certainly does in a kitchen. </p></div>		</li>
