			<div class="markdown"><p>I've not been diagnosed with a circadian rhythm disorder,but I've been completely incapable of sleeping on a 24 hour clock my entire life. Even as a baby my mother couldn't put me to sleep unless I had been up 18-24 hours before hand.</p>
<p>I have traced a pattern where I am up between at least 22 hours every day and at max I am up 38 unless my actually diagnosed disorder(bipolar type-1) throws things completely out of whack. In which case,I have been up 60+ hours before. It feels to me as if my body can't sleep unless it is completely exhausted both mentally and physically. That's anecdotal on my part,but it truly does feel that way.</p>
<p>I usually can compensate for my large wake periods by sleeping roughly half the time I was up(24 hours awake is 12 hour sleep,38/19,48/24) but if I happen to wake up,I can't get back to sleep until I become exhausted again.</p>
<p>I have tried sleeping aids via over the counter or prescription,nothing has worked. I don't want to be this way,staying up like this is not fun and I do not want to be in such a chaotic cycle like this.  It has caused a lot of damage to my social/work life. I miss so many opportunities to go to events with friends or attain good positions for work because I know I can't keep a schedule. I've tried my entire(22y/o) life to seek professional help and even had a sleep study done. No one i've spoken to knows why I can't fall asleep in a timely manner,so I've come to the personal conclusion that the severity of my bipolar has caused secondary issues to pop up,like a circadian rhythm disorder.</p>
<p>I don't know if thats the actual answer and I don't really care if i'm wrong or right,all I want is to know why i'm like this and to be given a proper solution so I can sleep and wake and interact with my world like a normal human being again.</p>
<p>I don't know if you're a specialist in this sort of thing,but i'm just grasping at straws and hoping you have an answer for all this.</p>
<p>Apologies for the terribly long message and for involving you with my issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair there is no solid proof that you can die of sleep deprivation, it’s speculation. No human has been able to stay up to the point of death and even with the animals we have successfully “killed” with sleep deprivation there is no consensus on the actual cause of death. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this once. Stayed up for 3 days and then crashed for 20 hours straight. Can't say I recommend it.</p>
<p>Technically I lived and went back to normal eventually, but I didn't know where I was or what year I was in when I first woke up. Also screwed with me getting back on a regular sleep schedule afterwards. Definitely an unpleasant experience overall. I've never done that since and I definitely wouldn't do it regularly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right you are. For all the answers we seem to have, there's never a shortage of questions. We have observed and have fair hypotheses for some of the changes that occur during a sleep state.</p>
<p>My view of sleep is that it's essentially an altered state of metabolism and physiology, separate and unique from that of the woken state. We have yet to unlock all the mysteries of the woken physiology. I believe we're a long way off from mapping unconscious physiology in a meaningful way.</p></div>		</li>
