<p>legs, torso, neck, head size...  more minute than that even, lower and upper legs, stomach cavity, chest cavity... could probably find genes even more minute and specific.</p>
<p>Thus we don't really even have tall and short, we have a LOT of variation within those.</p>
<p>Example- my grandfather was 2 inches taller than me if we sat side by side.  Standing up, I was 5 inches taller.   He had short legs compared to the rest of his body size.  This is all affected by the factors you mention, just thought it worth pointing out that even the variables you mentioned can vary by body part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean if you wanna get real technical, each gene only codes for one protein that serves one purpose or makes up part of one tissue, so there aren't even genes for &quot;upper leg&quot; or &quot;lower leg&quot; but ones for, say, skeletal muscular proteins or signalling proteins that can affect things like this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you want to get real real technical, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3664468/" target="_blank">most genes</a> in the human genome <strong>do</strong> encode more than one protein due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing" target="_blank">alternative splicing</a> (and most proteins serve many &quot;purposes&quot; and have many binding partners). Other, more specialized mechanisms of generating protein diversity from individual genes exist too, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_hypermutation" target="_blank">somatic hypermutation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V(D\)J_recombination" target="_blank">V(D)J recombination</a> in the immune system, though these occur in and are specific to individual cells.</p>
<p>And while there of course aren't <em>genes for</em> &quot;upper leg&quot; or &quot;lower leg&quot;, essentially the same highly-conserved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeotic_gene" target="_blank">homeotic genes</a> are used by all multicellular organisms to say &quot;build the leg here&quot;. What determines when and where these homeotic master switches are turned on to pattern a development space? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphogen" target="_blank">Morphogen</a> gradients!</p>
<p>Biology is cool (and complicated).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But of course, if we wanted to get REALLY technical, each gene only codes for an RNA which may or may not get translated into a protein. </p>
<p>And there are genes (HOX clusters) which organise the arrangement of limbs, so you could argue there are genes for different limbs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but with a significant amount of uncertainty. Since genes work to some degree in a stochastic manner, each gene as an uncertainty (error bar) associated with its effect. With hundreds of genes, the uncertainty adds up to quite a substantial number.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are studies showing that an infant's height increase depends on one parent, but their weight increase depends on the other. And these neat ideas you brought up don't even take into account factors like diet and sunshine for vitamin D activation. It's a fascinating field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clinically, we use the formula: mother's height + father's height (+5 inches for boys) OR (-5 inches for girls) / 2 to estimate adult height. There are even specific growth curves and estimates for individuals with different genetic disorders (e.g. Achondroplasia). Currently, we look at data for typical growth and not genes to estimate height.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How accurate is that really tho ? In my family i'm the only short guy (5'5), I don't have any genetic disorder and I had good nutrition as a kid. My dad is 5'10, mom is 5'6 I think, brother 6+. that formula sure didn't work out for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, you could just as easily make a curve that involves the mothers total number of hair on skin and fathers total number of hair on skin and relate to the individuals <strong>height</strong>. There is no particular reason to use the parents height. Anything even vaguely correlated to body size would work.</p>
<p>Such a phenomenological curve is often useful but almost never explanatory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good way to illustrate this is the environmental effect from food and nutrition is the difference between the people in North Korea versus South Korea.
The North Koreans are on average 6 inches shorter than the south Koreans, even though they are the same demographic and genepool.</p></div>		</li>
