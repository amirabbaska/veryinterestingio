			<div class="markdown"><p>Decent answer but a few minor corrections:</p>
<p>Large elliptical galaxies are thought to all have central black holes. Dwarf elliptical galaxies, of which the &quot;dwarf&quot; part should be the focus, may not. There's been evidence of no stellar cores in some cases of large elliptical galaxies (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/a2261-bcg.html" target="_blank">example</a>) but that's not definitive that there's not a smaller supermassive black hole.</p>
<p>Also, galaxies were known well before the 1950s. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy\)" target="_blank">Great Debate</a> occurred in the 1920s, which is a time when figuring out what galaxies were was underway. But expansion of the Universe and the size was then determined in the early 1920s by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble" target="_blank">Hubble</a>. EDIT: late 1920s, Lemaitre and then Hubble.</p>
<p>I don't think this is wrong but more of a semantic point for others: I would argue black holes were not controversial 20 years ago. We knew mass had to exist in very compact regions which provide strong evidence for them being black holes. True observational tests were not possible until relatively recently, such as with stars around Sgr A* (again, not definitive, but pretty strong evidence), and of course LIGO's detections.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>The OP question is an excellent one.</p>
<p>But it creates two more questions: First &quot;What is a galaxy?&quot;</p>
<p>Second: &quot;Do galaxies always have black holes?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Over time, those questions become more unclear. As an example of the first, there are hypothetical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_galaxy" target="_blank">dark galaxies</a> but observed almost dark galaxies which have few stars but lots of hydrogen gas. There's also a bit of evidence for galaxies with more dark matter than normal (baryonic) matter, which means by extension there could be &quot;dark galaxies&quot; that are primarily dark matter. That's an observationally difficult problem but these are all things being worked on right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the study of primordial black holes is also interesting since we do not know their mass spectrum. So it may be that all galaxies contain billions of little black holes. But we don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was reading about Sag A* in the 1990s in books that were published in the 70s.  Not much knowledge was known let alone understood then but it was fascinating to me.  I'm lucky to be around to see some of this information unfold now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might find this interesting then. You can actually see some animations of the data <a href="http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/movies/gc_orbits_animfull.gif" target="_blank">here</a>. Tracing out the orbits allows us to say via our knowledge of gravity that the mass of some central object must be incredibly large, about 4 million times the mass of the Sun, and in a very small volume. The only thing we can think of with that volume or smaller is a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't find a technical meaning for this, so I'm gonna assume it's just a really great galaxy, everyone loves it, etc.?</p></div>		</li>
