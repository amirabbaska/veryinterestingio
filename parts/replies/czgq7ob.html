<p>it is natural that we &quot;correct&quot; in the direction of the global standard of living, which, outside of first world developed countries, is much lower than our own.</p>

<p>Except that is not what is happening at all. See <a href="http://useconomy.about.com/od/GDP-by-Year/a/US-GDP-History.htm" target="_blank">this page</a> for data from the BEA, annotated by year with events around the period you are describing. </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nUvO-2EsE5GciOIsqruatoBizUcqgqj4-ElgkITcVGk/pubhtml" target="_blank">Here</a> is a sheet that I put together with the above data in a chart, which shows that GDP increased steadily since 1946, has been fairly consistent over the past 70 years, and rose the most in 1980.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-g7kHIC9o_X0/UMFc-HE71UI/AAAAAAAAG-8/cNBUkwY0eWU/s1600/a0-us-individuals-real-median-income-with-recessions-1947-2010.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is a chart of the median salary in the US from roughly the same period. You can see that it is increasing, but not at the rate that the GDP per capita is increasing. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/historical/fig2.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a chart of educational attainment in the above 25 population from roughly the same time period. You can see that the number of people with college educations went from 4.6 to 32%, a 7-fold increase. The number of people lacking a high school education dropped from 75.9% to 11.7%, a 7-fold reduction. </p>
<p>If what you were saying were true, we would see a spike in GDP per capita due to the domination of the world economy by the US during years following WW2, leading into what would look like a flattening out of the GDP per capita as the world recovered. In fact, the peak improvement in GDP per capita was in 1983, nearly 40 years after WW2 ended.</p>
<p>Instead we see that on average, every year, GDP per capita increases, yet the median wage stays the same, <em>despite</em> drastic increases in the education level required to participate in society. People are frankly doing more work for about the same money. </p>
<p>Now, regardless of your political affiliation, the above charts show <strong>very clearly</strong> that you can't claim that the US experienced a boon post WW2 that has run its course. If anything, the country experienced a boon after WW2 that is still clearly paying dividends, and so, it doesn't make sense to blame &quot;global equalization&quot; as a cause of individual wage stagnation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came in to bring up that first point you made. The time when a family could have a middle class lifestyle on a single income was a short time that was very different from anything before or after. Contrary to popular belief, women weren't only housewives for thousands of years before putting their foot down in the 70's. Prior to the post-WWII boom, a guy would've had to be pretty wealthy for his wife not to work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, before WW2 the norm was working father, stay at home mom. Only 28% of working age females were in the labor force in 1940. In 1945 it was 37% despite the very high demand for labor during the war. Standards of living was cruddy by our standards but it was clearly possible for the vast majority of families to survive without the mother earning money. You would probably have to go back to the 19th century when agriculture dominated the economy to get double income households as the norm (i.e. farm wives would also work on the farm and thus increase the farm's income). </p></div>		</li>

&quot;In 2010, Germany produced more than 5.5 million automobiles; the U.S produced 2.7 million. At the same time, the average auto worker in Germany made $67.14 per hour in salary in benefits; the average one in the U.S. made $33.77 per hour.
