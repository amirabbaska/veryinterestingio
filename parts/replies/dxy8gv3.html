			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I'm a toothpaste <em>engineer</em> and what we do is construct multi chambered tubes that are somehow still easy and cheap to manufacture overseas, and we meticulously inject each color, or 'flavor' as we call them in the industry (pretentious sniff), into each chamber. The design is then rigorously tested to ensure dogs, kids, and husbands cannot break open the chambers during normal handling and use. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.&quot; /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The best part is when someone else repeats what they said in another similar thread or in some cases even further down in the same thread as if it was fact  eventually you see the same misinformation pop up over and over from people taking a wrong answer and repeating it with no effort to check if it was even correct in the first place.  So much BS gets spread around Reddit like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. I flatten the toothpaste tube from the bottom up as I use it (to get as much out of the tube as possible) and have never felt any indentations or ridges within the tube indicating smaller tubes. Common sense then dictates they screw the cap on and inject the striped toothpaste right into the large end of the tube, then seal it. </p></div>		</li>
