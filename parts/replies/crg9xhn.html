<p>You are assuming there is a solid functional reason for their existence. This point of view is contrary to evolutionary theory, which is basically: your body makes use of what it has for development. There is no functional need to feel temperature with your teeth as the lips and tongue are by far the superior sensors. </p>
<p>The answer to &quot;why&quot; is more likely that arteries, nerves and veins tend to be present in the body as a bundle (the neurovascular bundle). The 'developmental tool' your body has to get blood-supply in to tissue, such as teeth, generally leads to the branching of a nerve as well. Although this is impossile to prove at this point, I would suggest that the presence of the nerve is just a secondary consequence to the addition of the vascular tissue to the tooth, which is useful for some boring reason I won't go in to.</p>
<p>TLDR: I can't ELI5 this one.</p>
<p>ps. pressure-sensation is from the ligament around the tooth and not its internal nerve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. People just don't seem to get the hang of this evolution thing. Nature doesn't have a point or an aim. It just does what it does and goes with what survives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hardly believe in any sort of deity or creative force, but it's hard to <em>not</em> think &quot;purpose&quot; sometimes with biology.  I know there's no purpose, not even &quot;survival&quot; or &quot;survive long enough to reproduce&quot;.  I know it's all just one big jury-rig.  I know natural selection is the reason why we have to cornucopia of organisms that we do.</p>
<p>But goddammit, sometimes it really really looks like there's a purpose to things.  Teeth, for example.  They have no purpose, they just are.  But they're so good at what they do that it's hard not to think that their function is their purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but that process is refining. Inefficiencies are eliminated from the gene pool. Retrospectively,  it would look like things have functions and purposes ... because if they didn't you likely wouldn't have survived. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dentist here also. The nerve/blood vessels /cells inside the tooth can repair the teeth from the INSIDE, call secodary dentin, in order to wall off a potential cavity. it also senses hot/cold. dentin is the softer shock absorber on the inside of the teeth it is full of tubules that can sense outside temperature also. Teeth without dentin quickly crumbles like fragile glass. Dentin is vital to tooth function and inoder to maintain dentin, you need blood and cells to maintain it. The nerves inside the tooth help to sense hot,cold, food composition, and vibration,inconjustion with the Periodontal ligament.these sensories can trigger  reaction, such increased saliva, increaes in enzyme in saliva, and early warning system to the rest of the digestive system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I love when someone clarifies the stupid  &quot;why wouldn't evolution just make it so this happens&quot; questions.  </p>
<p>For all the pro evolution rhetoric, there are still so Many people that just don't get it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the OP has edited the question with a follow up goal directed evolutionary question...ugh..</p></div>		</li>

<p>In addition, nerves allow us to sense when there is infection of the tooth such as the case of cavities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice try, /u/GermTheory</p>
<p>We all know that toothaches are due to an imbalance of the four humors. Teach the controversy! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also cavities are seldom found in teeth from prehistoric skulls, even though these people had much worse dental hygiene. It is our modern diet high on carb and sugar that creates a microbiome in our mouth supportive of tooth decay. See e.g. <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/02/the-real-source-of-cavities-and-gum-disease.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>So being immortalized from the pain of rotten teeth was likely a marginal selection pressure working against the benefits nerves in teeth brought.</p></div>		</li>
