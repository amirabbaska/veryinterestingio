			<div class="markdown"><p>From your post it seems that prevention is the preferred method of addressing this issue. But you also mentioned that enamel is mostly inorganic and can be remineralized, although not at a rate sufficient to prevent decay in the mouth.</p>
<p>Why haven't we found a durable substance which binds to enamel? Hell, even if we couldn't control the crystal structure and it grows asymmetrically we could always grind it into appropriate shape, </p>
<p>Also: How long after clinical detachment can a tooth be successfully reattached?</p>
<p>-<em>Edit</em>- According to some posters, the durable substance that binds to enamel can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NovaMin" target="_blank">Novamin Brand toothpaste.</a> It claims to remineralize tooth enamel with the same material (Hydroxylapatite) it's originally made from. But as an American I want better results faster. Anyone know why it's difficult to find a suitable material to replace enamel? Or why we can't induce faster growth of Hydroxylapatite?</p>

<p>This is exactly what a filling is.  The dentist grinds away the damaged tooth surface, puts on a durable substance which binds to the fresh tooth surface, and then the material &quot;crystallizes&quot;.  After it crystallizes, the dentist grinds the durable substance down to the appropriate shape.  What is this durable substance, you might ask?  Usually a composite resin.  While an amalgam filling won't actually bind to the tooth, there is enough mechanical compaction to seal the filling.</p>
<p>If your question is actually &quot;why can't we regrow the tooth with remineralization?&quot;, then the answer to that question is probably that we don't have nanomachines to control the process/environment at a molecular level.  When your tooth first forms, your tooth is covered in special cells called ameloblasts, which build the enamel from the outside in at a cellular level.  On top of this, your teeth are in a sterile environment while this happens, so we don't have to worry about fighting off bacteria working against us or the surface being damaged/destroyed by the mechanical action of biting.  Once enough enamel forms, the enamel blocks the ameloblasts from their source of food, and they die.  Once the ameloblasts die, no more enamel may be produced for the remainder of your life.  Eventually the tooth erupts from the gum and becomes exposed to the environment and slowly wears away.  This is why enamel is the hardest substance in your body - it has to be as strong as possible in order to last as long as possible.  Your saliva contains calcium which will remineralize the surface of enamel, but if part of the surface is actually destroyed then the enamel is gone for good.</p>
<p>The most we can do to &quot;regrow&quot; your tooth is to douse the tooth in a supersaturated solution of minerals, and hope those minerals will deposit on your teeth.  As mentioned above, our saliva already does this, but <a href="http://dentalcare.com/en-US/dental-education/continuing-education/ce94/ce94.aspx?ModuleName=coursecontent&amp;PartID=5&amp;SectionID=-1" target="_blank">fluoride enhances this process</a>.  Since we don't have an army of cells controlling the process, to make sure that the enamel grows in the right way, the crystals grow randomly.  If the crystals grow big enough, you get dental calculus.  Dental calculus will actually kill the bacteria that it grows on, but since it was grown randomly, it has a rough surface which is ideal for additional bacteria to grow and thrive on.  The rough surface is difficult to brush, and has all sorts of nooks and crannies for bacteria to hide in.  On top of this, the crystals are also full of all sorts of nasty gunk from the dead cells and bacteria (since our mouths are not a sterile environment).  This is why dentists remove calculus, it does more harm than good.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what kinds of eating habits are more likely to lead to a PH of 3.5 or lower? Specifically I like sweets (ice cream, chocolate, candy etc) I want to be able to enjoy them in the way least harmful to my teeth. Does having a larger amount make me more likely to get to PH 3.5, or are sweets just likely to get me there anyway? </p>
<p>In other words is it better (for my teeth) to have a smaller amount more often or a larger amount more often?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Stephan Curve illustrates what happens to pH when you eat something. Link: <a href="http://media.dentalcare.com/images/en-US/education/ce371/fig06.jpg" target="_blank">http://media.dentalcare.com/images/en-US/education/ce371/fig06.jpg</a></p>
<p>When you eat something there is an immediate drop in pH. After a number of minutes of clearing the food the saliva and all the protective measures eventually bring the pH back to normal. Understand though that the stephan curve would have been made assuming one bite I would imagine. They got this from measuring the pH of the mouth after eating a sugar cube or whatever. When we are eating meals we take longer eating and we also sometimes get food stuck in our teeth. These factors haven't been considered. Eating something sugary or acidic will make the first part of the curve a bit more extreme which will require longer time to recover. This means longer time in the 'danger zone'. </p>
<p>This happens whenever you eat something. Very very important to know is what is defined as an eating event. Eating one potato chip verse eating the bag in the same time both counts as an event. Someone who just eats breakfast, lunch and dinner has three events, three times where we see a drop in pH and demineralisation event occurring. Slowly going through a bag of chips throughout an afternoon while studying would equate to many of these events. This prolongs the amount of time where teeth are present in conditions where teeth demineralisation can occur. </p>
<p>So what can you do? Avoid snacking. Eat in as few events as possible. Breakfast, lunch and tea. Maybe afternoon tea. It depends on who you are but make it a couple of events not dozens by slowly munching on something. Another thing to do for your sweet tooth (I love my chocolate so I am in your boat here), is don't snack sweets. You can eat these things if you must if you group it with a main meal. Straight after dinner for example. It is better than snacking it.  </p>
<p>Another important aspect is when you are eating. When you sleep you do not produce saliva. Your teeth are all alone at night haha. So knowing that it is understandable why it isn't a good idea to eat right before going to bed. </p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More often is definitely more harmful. It keeps the pH lower for a longer time. It is suggested that it takes about 30 min to get your pH back to normal after a meal, so eating a little bit (or sipping on a soda all day) can be really harmful.</p></div>		</li>
