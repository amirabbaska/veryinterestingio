			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, yes. If the planet were in intergalactic space, the station was precisely in the center of the perfectly regular torus, which was in perfect vacuum, and their relative movement was exactly zero. Practically, no. Any tiny variance would result in the station moving from the center, and then perturbations would increase. This system is an unstable equilibrium like the L1, L2, and L3 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point#Lagrange_points" target="_blank">Lagrange Points</a> and would require station-keeping thrusters.</p></div>		</li>
