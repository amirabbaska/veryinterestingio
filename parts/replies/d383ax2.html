			<div class="markdown"><p>I know. I hate how the mods remove stuff that has already been asked. Many of us (readers) are new to the sub and will miss out on those questions unless they're asked again. I feel like the rule should be if it's not asked within the last 6 months, the mods shouldn't delete the thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top answer doesn't describe the radiation heat index which is really why a Galaxy is visible and the flag isn't. If that flag had the energy of a star (even as small as it is) we'd then be able to see it. And, if each color of the flag emitted a different level of heat we'd be able to see that it is an American flag. Without any level of thermal energy (except the glimpse of the sun reflecting off of it) the flag is thus invisible with a telescope... </p></div>		</li>
