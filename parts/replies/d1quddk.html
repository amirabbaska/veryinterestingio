			<div class="markdown"><p>Irrelevant; you have to setup the ability for your own server to handle <em>at least the response</em> of the captcha service otherwise it's 100% useless for submitting responses back to your own server therefore you can access captcha events and information in your own web application and pass it around however you like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could use a script that tracks mouse movement, the scrolling of the page, timing of mouse clicks and key presses, browsing history... If it detects something weird (e.g. the mouse cursor jumped instantly to the checkbox without moving), it shows an additional normal captcha (jumbled words or something similar).</p>
<p>Edited in a &quot;could&quot; because I couldn't find actual sources, only speculation and google's own broad description.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's your source? That's extremely easy to fake.  I'm pretty sure Recaptcha use the extensive information Google collected of the user to determine if it's a robot or a human. I know that when I'm in incognito I have to still fill a captcha to prove that I'm a human, if it was doing what you told it wouldn't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, Google uses mouse movements to determine if you are a human or a robot. If your mouse movements aren't humanlike (or you're doing a lot of captchas over a short period of time), it'll do a second check which asks you to identify a few images from a group that match what it is describing (i.e. &quot;Select the images that contain a train&quot;) to further verify you are a human.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Usually the entire page is just a mashup of 3rd party widgests.</p>
<p>Submit form - 3rd party widget 1</p>
<p>Captcha - 3rd party widget 2</p>
<p>Complete button - 3rd party widget 3</p>
<p>3 requires #1 and #2 to be complete before it would fire.</p>
<p>I could hack together a way to merge the 3 but then the vendors that provided the various bits would refuse to support me, and replacing the captcha widget with a better one would be a paid... so I don't. Sometimes you have to balance the ease of use of that 1 extra click with how supportable the end product would end up being.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting point. I didn’t view it from the ‚mashup‘ perspective. True, a lot of sites today are created this way and in many ways not worse or better than any other. </p>
<p>My aspect was more old-school. I preferably would also have my script create the images and process the response. </p>
<p>But if I can help preserve mankind’s knowledge I will do it of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is, if you plug in different either vendor or community maintained widgets... and then you leave the company or are on vacation, anyone can come in and fix it should they need to. Write your own customer stuff? Good luck finding anyone that understands it. It's all about ease of support. </p></div>		</li>
