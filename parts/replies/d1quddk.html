			<p>He probably wouldn't style it. It would just be there and the POST form would submit once the CAPTCHA is completed, however, I personally wouldn't do this because of the confusion that not having a form button would cause.</p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly. This is dangerously confusing since a captcha is (historically and in an interface design sense) not a submit button. You would have to change the text to specify that clicking the captcha will submit the form, which we already established isn't likely.</p>		</li>

			<p>This doesn't solve the problem, and would just confuse the user more. If I found a form without a submit button, I would either assume it autosaves (which would never happen on a form that requires a captcha, like for registration or comment box) or that it's broken and not worth my time. Any instructions to the user about the feature (i.e., &quot;Complete the form and click the Captcha to submit&quot;) would require more time and reasoning than just a simple and relatable submit button at the end. And it still doesn't solve users who think that after finishing the captcha, they'll get a chance to review their form before clicking a submit button that might magically appear as well.<br><br>Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of originality, and don't break status quo on common and familiar structures without having a more intuitive replacement. Besides, there's a nice pathological response to the feeling of completeness when hitting &quot;Submit&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don’t think so. The captcha, from the captcha providers p.o.v just provides the captcha image and receives the captcha text. Maybe an identifier for the website it was embedded in. There is no sensible data involved and the response from their server needs to be only binary. There is hardly any need for ‚tight security‘ regarding their styling.<br><br>Also the captcha providers are interested in their captcha being used to translate books or whatever. The site owner is interested in having no robots on his site and the captcha provider helps him to achieve that. There is no need nor interest on either side to compromise security or hinder their customers to modify the layout.<br><br>In this whole process, anything bad that could happen would happen on the site owners form itself and not within the captcha widget wether or not its default style rules are overwritten.<br><br>I do currently not work with captchas but a lot with third-party widgets, weather reports, sport results and live streams and such. All of those services provide more or less extensive APIs to alter many aspects about the widgets, especially, if not exclusively, the styling. Usually I don’t bother and just overwrite the default styles with our companies the fast&amp;ugly way.<br><br>Of course there could be implementations of captcha widgets that are strict in this regard because they display their own banners. As I said, next time I’ll give it a try. But I would rather use some dedicated SDK or API instead of iFrames. In that case I can do what I want anyways.</p>		</li>

			<p>I’ll either have my own submit float over the button in the iFrame or overwrite their submit buttons style declarations with my own, using the dreaded !important statement. So when the user clicks on the (only) submit button there is on the form, in fact he triggers the captcha.<br><br>The captcha form sends the input to the captcha server. The captcha server gives some form of response, maybe as a simple http header (200 means ‚ok‘) maybe JSON etc... wether the input was correct or not in order for me to further process or block the form. <br><br>So I check for the response of the captcha server and if it is satisfactory, I trigger the further processing of my form, most likely completing the validation, basic sanitizing and sending the data.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>As I said, it depends on what you use and I preferably would run the captcha software on my own server anyways or use a provided widget that renders out the captcha within my own DOM like the most popular captcha widget, reCaptcha does. <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display</a>. <br><br>I couldn’t even quickly find a captcha that relies on iFrames, so this discussion is kind of pointless and tiring.<br><br>But still OPs question is a good one and integrating a captcha more seamlessly without an extra submit button is definitely worth considering and it can be achieved with reasonable effort unless you are stuck with some obscure solution.<br><br>But I am wasting my time here anyways.

			<p>Irrelevant; you have to setup the ability for your own server to handle <em>at least the response</em> of the captcha service otherwise it's 100% useless for submitting responses back to your own server therefore you can access captcha events and information in your own web application and pass it around however you like.</p>		</li>

			<p>It could use a script that tracks mouse movement, the scrolling of the page, timing of mouse clicks and key presses, browsing history...

			<p>Basically, Google uses mouse movements to determine if you are a human or a robot. If your mouse movements aren't humanlike (or you're doing a lot of captchas over a short period of time), it'll do a second check which asks you to identify a few images from a group that match what it is describing (i.e. &quot;Select the images that contain a train&quot;) to further verify you are a human.</p>		</li>

At work we are somewhat restricted to how many and which third-party providers we use for various reasons.
