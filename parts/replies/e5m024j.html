<p>訁 was reduced to 讠.</p>

<p>That’s just the cursive form of 言. <a href="http://123.206.224.64/%E9%AB%98%E6%B8%85a/%E6%99%8B/%E6%99%8Ba%E7%8E%8B%E7%BE%B2%E4%B9%8Ba%E8%A1%8C%E4%B9%A6a%E6%99%AE%E8%A7%89%E5%9B%BD%E5%B8%88%E7%A2%91a940_11916.jpg" target="_blank">Example</a> from the Jin Dynasty (266-420 CE).</p>
<p>And an <a href="http://123.206.224.64/%E9%AB%98%E6%B8%85a/%E6%99%8B/%E6%99%8Ba%E7%8E%8B%E7%BE%B2%E4%B9%8Ba%E8%8D%89%E4%B9%A6a%E9%98%94%E5%88%AB%E5%B8%96a11_1926.jpg" target="_blank">example</a> of 樂 in its cursive form again from the Jin dynasty.</p>
<p>Edit: Forgot to include an example of <a href="http://119.29.99.55/%E9%AB%98%E6%B8%85a/%E6%99%8B/%E6%99%8Ba%E7%8E%8B%E7%BE%B2%E4%B9%8Ba%E8%A1%8C%E4%B9%A6a%E5%9B%9B%E7%BA%B8%E9%A3%9E%E7%99%BD%E5%B8%96a7_4112.jpg" target="_blank">学</a>, which most definitely originated in China, not Japan (again from the Jin dynasty, predating the large Han migration/cultural exchange to Japan which occurred a good 200+ years after this dynasty fell).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I adjusted my explanation to take away the impression that the PRC was inspired by shinjitai when coming up with 学.</p>
<p>As for the cursive examples, that's interesting to find the origin of the simplifications. In the end, though, those cursive forms must've been most of the inspiration for which radicals to simplify and which to not. Whether originally cursive or not, simplified radicals such as those compose the majority of simplifications that carried over into handwriting and print.</p></div>		</li>
