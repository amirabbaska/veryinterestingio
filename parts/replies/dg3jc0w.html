<p>why do some moles grow hair</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>When a bunch of the cells that gives our skin color (or melanocytes) end up in the same place, they form hyper-pigmented patches of skin that we call moles. Because of all this pigment, any hair that grows out of a mole can be darker and coarserâ€”and even grow faster than the rest of your body hair.</em></p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Skin tags are very common small, soft skin growths. Skin tags are harmless but can be annoying. Skin tags tend to occur on the eyelids, neck, armpits, groin folds, and under breasts.</em></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but your scalp will have the color and texture of a mole. You'd be called mole face, which is funny because 'mole' in Spanish is a delicious mole-coloured dish. </p>
