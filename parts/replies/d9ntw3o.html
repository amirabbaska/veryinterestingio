			<div class="markdown"><p>A large swath of land which makes up the rolling plains in Nebraska and Kansas used to be sand dunes around 1,000 years ago, but has periodically been a desert of sand dunes throughout geological history.</p>
<p>The current path of global warming sets it up to repeat or be worse than the condition it was in 1,000 years ago as active sand dunes, since that was 1.8C warmer than the larger historic average.</p>

<p>This is a permanent change in human terms.  It takes hundreds to thousands of years for non-negligible amounts of soil to form.  Also, if people are still using the land, soil won't be coming back.  It will continue to erode far faster than it forms.</p></div>		</li>
