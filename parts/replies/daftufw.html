			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same way, but it also leaves me wanting to be lazy for the rest of the day. So I have to leave that extra long sleep periods for &quot;fuck all the world&quot; Saturdays or long weekends where I designate a day to be &quot;fuck all the world&quot;.</p>
<p>Those are the best days... the days when you're not dressed beyond slippers, PJs a comfy robe; and holding a cup of very mildly Irish coffee because you're not going anywhere today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you break it up into two sleep periods it's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep#Biphasic_sleep" target="_blank">biphasic sleep</a>.</p>
<p>More than that and it's called polyphasic sleep.  Biphasic sleep appears to be a genuinely viable alternative sleep pattern for humans, but breaking sleep up further I think might cause other problems that outweigh the benefits of attempting to squeeze out low-quality sleep, however I don't know much about this personally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I'm polyphasic. I wake up so many times </p>
<p>Now this is very anecdotal, but I have yet met an other person who disagrees. Quite frankly it sucks. I don't feel rested or restored. In fact I feel worse then I would if I just stayed up for two days straight. (I get giddy and silly when I've stayed up past the 24 hour mark.) </p>
<p>Those rare nights when I actually sleep like other people do? It feels so amazing. </p>
<p>The only benefit I can see personally is that I dream often. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a friend who accidentally developed this sleep cycle. He'd stay up late playing games, have to get up early for school with only ~3 hours of sleep, and then around 3pm he'd come home and crash, sleeping until about 6pm. After doing this a while he seemed genuinely chipper and awake in the mornings, much more so than I was at least </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like that's the more natural way to sleep, when you aren't exposed to artifical light. But even with artificial light, my sleep sometimes naturally leans to biphasic. It's a little annoying, because it's 1 hour I'd rather just be sleeping.</p></div>		</li>
