			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question!  You'd have to ask an ophtho that question.  Ophthos??  But I imagine this is some combination of the intricacy of the eye itself and the surgical prowess required in this field (it is a five year minimum residency AFTER med school).</p>
<p>I know it is much more competitive to get into the program and definitely far more vast than a tooth relative to detail.  Perhaps as a branch of medicine it is too narrow a field to justify its own program like dentistry and surgery as a practice is based on the tenets of medicine - so its background in meds make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ophthalmology is its own specialty that requires at least 3 years of residency  training after medical school. It used to be combined with Otolaryngology or ENT (ear, nose, throat) and was EENT (add eyes), but it was split due to how complicated the eye/ophthalmology is and how complicated the ENT part was getting as well. After residency, you can do a fellowship to specialize in certain areas of ophtho such as the cornea. </p>
<p>Dentists go to dental school after undergrad, which is 4 years. They also have residencies but it is not required, such as orthodontist and oral maxillofacial surgery.  If you do not do residency, you can start practicing right after graduation from dental school. </p>
<p>On another hand, an optometrist does not go to medical school. Optometry school is separate and honestly i do not know much about their training, sorry</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife is an optometrist.  The path is very similar to dentistry.  4 years of post bachelors where they concentrate on the eye and head. Optional 2 years of residency after that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Canada, the practice of ophthalmology requires a five year residency after medical school. In total, a minimum of 9 years of training are required, compared to 4 years to practice dentistry. These are two very different fields.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, 3rd year optometry student, my girlfriend is in dentistry. The first two years of training we had the same classes as the MD, Dentists, and ourselves (MD were separated just for a larger class size). During the first 2 years we did have a lot of courses in our respective fields but there was definitely a lot of overlap in training (anatomy, pharmacology, applied science, etc). Now in my 3rd year we are completely diverged and in a few months I'll be off to my hospital rotations and she'll be in the dental clinic. Even though the initials after our names will be different I can say that anyone called &quot;Doctor&quot; who performs procedures, Rx's medications, and is responsible for the health of their patients truly are doctors in every sense of the word. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Optho isn't just the eye. It's a lot of neuro, too, since the eyes are directly connected to the brain.</p>
<p>I'm assuming you mean ophthalmologist (a physician) and not an optometrist (a doctor of optometry).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of ways that systemic and peripheral neuromuscular disorders can affect the eye, too. Diabetes can cause cataracts, glaucoma, and retinopathy. Some muscle disorders and things like myasthenia gravis can affect the muscles in and around the eye. Behcet's disease and other vascular disorders can affect the eyes and other organs simultaneously. Autoimmune disorders and some infectious diseases can cause inflammation in the eye, which may be the first problem noticed by some patients. Etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good statement and reply.  But, as your wife is an ER doctor, then you must know that good dental health leads to better overall health (especially heart related health).  While I can see the education difference (which is basically true in EVERY field that has multiple specialties, see IT), it's still keeping people healthy.  </p>
<p>So, to the question as to why dental insurance is separate from health insurance, you don't provide any reasoning.  I would ask you, as a Dentist married to an ER Doctor, what are your thoughts on dental insurance being combined with general medical insurance?</p>
<p>(Full disclosure: I think all healthcare should be a basic human right, paid by taxes)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>here's a question for you or any other dentist:</p>
<p>I know LOTS of doctors who do &quot;pro bono&quot; work when a patient doesn't have insurance, or gives a deep discount on sort of a &quot;sliding scale.&quot;</p>
<p>I know a lot of dentists, but I don't know a single one who does pro bono for poor patients without insurance.  I know some who will discount certain professions and some who will do dental work for free when they go on international humanitarian work.  But none who volunteer at some sort of &quot;clinic for underpriviledged&quot;.  I'm not even aware of such a clinic in our area.</p>
<p>So why aren't dentists as willing as doctors to help people in a financial crisis?  From what I understand, dentists do better these days than MD's, and work far less hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience, much of the pro-bono stuff that dentists do patients aren't usually aware of. For example, there are different codes for say a root canal. There will be one for a typical straightforward one, another if the anatomy is difficult (say the canal curves sharply) or if the access is difficult (patient can't open wide enough for you to get files in there). These codes will have different fees associated with them. The dentists I work with and myself will commonly use the cheaper codes even when the case is difficult for patients without good coverage or no coverage. Other times we will adjust certain codes to $0 even though we did the procedures (some examples are pulp capping during a filling, certain diagnostic tests, adjusting a denture so it still fits after a filling or crown etc.) Sometimes we will replace failing crowns for just the lab bill.</p>
<p>Just yesterday we held our annual &quot;Santa dentist&quot; event where we bring in patients of the office in need of treatment who don't have the means to pay for it but are really trying to turn things around and care for their oral health and provided them with free treatment. We did as much of their treatment plans as possible in the allotted time.</p>
<p>So there is a fair amount of pro-bono work in dentistry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I could aid to give you gold I sure as hell would. Your Santa program is amazing and you're too be commended for offering this to less fortunate patients! Would be spectacular if other dentists picked up on your idea and ran with it at least one day each year.</p>
<p>On another note, in really surprised by hire much overhead dentists have. This is an informative thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many dentists who look after their patients in a &quot;pro bono&quot; manner - you just may not be aware since we don't trumpet this to other patients.  We often give deep discounts to those in need as well - sometimes it just depends on the circumstances of the individual.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is that dentistry isn't always just doing the work for free; it's that the cost is significantly high to treat someone - so it's not just that you are doing free work, you are LITERALLY paying to treat the patient.</p>
<p>For example, in Ontario, those on social assistance get &quot;benefits&quot; but they pay only 25-40% of our fees.  Our overhead can be up to 80% of cost - hence the expense of dentistry.</p>
<p>Instruments, products, materials, machines, disposable suctions, barriers, staff to assist, staff to sterilize, power, water, someone to book your appointment, confirm your appointment, sterilize the tools, deal with the insurance company, collect payments by mail, keep the books, even for a 20 minute appointment is a significant cost.  </p>
<p>Hence the challenge to provide more deep discounting as a norm.</p></div>		</li>
