			<p>What actually lets the website know that a bot pressed the box though and why can't you just make the bot work around the detection method?</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm surprised nobody answered this properly for you, those checkboxes detect cursor movement and then compare it to human cursor movement and robot cursor movement, it is possible to intentionally fail them, but very difficult to accidentally. Something about the way robots move the cursor is identifiable, that is how they can tell. If they can't determine, they will use a different captcha method such as the images. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;What actually lets the website know that a bot pressed the box though<br><br>Cookies. Google whitelists based on behavior. For example: <a href="http://demo.codeforgeek.com/google-captcha/" target="_blank">try opening this</a> and pressing the check box. Now try it in incognito mode. There are certain tells google uses to see if you're a bot. There are ways around it (clickjacking, OCR tools, paying developing nation's people, etc).</p>		</li>

			<p>Some information is passed from page to page when you enter a form. The information about whether you passed the captcha or not is included in this.</p>		</li>
