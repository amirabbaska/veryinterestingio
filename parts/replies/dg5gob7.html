			<div class="markdown"><p>Not poking, i'm just being factual and not picking sides. I actually studied mythology in college and this was the center of some debate. People HATE to consider their stories as myths because they believe their stories to be TRUE.
So the Christians think they are right and everyone else's holy books are essentially misguided myths. Same could be said of Jews, Muslims, Jains, etc.</p>
<p>Its ALL mythology if you consider the definition of mythology - &quot;a collection of myths, especially one belonging to a particular religious or cultural tradition.&quot;</p>
<p>Okay so what are 'myths' then?</p>
<p>&quot;a traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining some natural or social phenomenon, and typically involving supernatural beings or events.&quot;</p>
<p>So is the Bible a myth? Well it is a collection of traditional stories. It does concern itself with early history of the Jewish culture but most importantly it contains the Creation myth in Genesis which explains the natural phenomena of how everything came to be. And it most certainly has supernatural beings and events - talking snakes, burning bushes that talk, great floods, dividing of seas, divine plagues, raising the dead- they are everywhere!</p>
<p>So is it a myth by definition? absolutely. So are the rest of those holy books. It doesn't make them less important, its just what they are.</p>
<p>People can be mad but that doesn't make the arguement less true. Downvote away.</p></div>		</li>
