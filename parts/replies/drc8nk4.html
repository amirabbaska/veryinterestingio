			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think about it, it kind of makes sense that they'd be attached: if they were free-floating, they'd run the risk of detaching from blood vessels every time they shifted. There's muscles in there too to facilitate peristalsis, which require further blood vessels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Detached from the mesentary? At that point you've got worse problems than just getting the bowel back, given that is their blood supply as well, and any process that detaches the bowels from the mesentary is going to be causing far more extensive damage than just that?</p>
<p>But if the question is just how to out then bowels back if they come out but are otherwise still attached, not really a concern. The ascending (right) and descending (left) large bowel/colon are fairly well tethered to the sidewalls. So you just have to worry about the small bowel, which is already tethered at wither end. You need to make sure it's not twisted on itself, but otherwise it will just follow the mesentary. And remember, the small bowel has essentially a tubular muscle running it's length, so it will shift around constantly with peristalsis already.</p></div>		</li>
