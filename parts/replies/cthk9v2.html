			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from Germany, England and maybe France, most of Europe has really shitty shopping options.  Electronics are overpriced mostly everywhere, and based on people's wages it's almost prohibitively expensive to buy something like a flatscreen TV.  </p>
<p>Example: I lived in Canada and bought a 42&quot; Samsung on sale for about $500.  I was just in Poland and saw people buying a newer model of Samsung for 2000 zl.  So you do your exchange rate of 2.88 (according to Google) and it comes to almost $700 Canadian.  So you think, hey, that's not so bad.  Until you factor in that 2000 zl is actually a common monthly wage in this country, even in large cities like Warsaw.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes but nowadays you have the option of buying online in other EU countries. For example, I buy all my car-related stuff in Germany because it's cheaper, while when I need parts for my old motorbike I hit up the Italian eBay or Amazon. </p>
<p>Electronics are way more expensive than in the U.S., and that's something you have to learn to live with unfortunately. Apart from that I never feel that my options are too limited. </p></div>		</li>

Retailers are in trouble and have tried to remedy the situation by starting their own online stores but they are generally awful in terms of execution, range of products and prices compared to the competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't really compare eastern European countries with western/northern Europe though. In Denmark, it's a bit of a cliche that the first thing a young adult buys when moving out is a flatscreen tv. Yes electronics are more expensive than in the US, but wages are also considerably higher in e.g. Denmark/Sweden/Norway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why Australians get the idea that shopping there isn't good.  Sure, it isn't as good as the US, and for certain things if you go to Asia you can get more selection and better deals, but a lot of the world is a lot worse off.</p>
<p>In Europe, not only are prices high because of various taxes, there are also all kinds of barriers.  Sure, the UK and France may be part of the same European market, but they use different power plugs.  That means that anything electronic has a UK SKU and a France SKU.  Then when it comes to things with keyboards, there's a UK keyboard and a France keyboard (and a German one, and so on).</p>
<p>There are German-specific models of TVs, and not just because of the plugs, but to meet German laws / regulations.</p>
<p>When it comes to food, at least you get good Spanish oranges in London pretty easily, but it isn't as easy as growing them within the same country as you can do in Australia.</p>
<p>Then there are the various laws about when your shops can be open.  In the US it's pretty much a free-for-all.  In Australia there are some restrictions, but you have plenty of places open late on some weekdays and and on Sundays.  In Switzerland, you're lucky to find much of anything open late on a weekday, and on Sundays the only things permitted to be open are restaurants, gas stations, and things within a train station.</p>
<p>Yes, Australians get unexpectedly screwed on some things (video game prices for example), but overall it's better off than most of the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a note, the extent to which 'Janteloven' is an actual phenomenon in Scandinavia is very questionable. Although it's a concept we sometimes refer to, partly to make fun of ourselves or make questionable political points, I wouldn't take it too seriously.</p></div>		</li>
