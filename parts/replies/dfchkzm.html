			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. Bleach is a solution of sodium hypochlorite, which dissociates in solution into sodium and hypochlorite ions. Hypochlorite is a strong oxidizer, which is why it is so good at &quot;bleaching&quot; things. </p>
<p>When ammonia is mixed with bleach, a number of byproducts are produced. Namely chlorine gas, chloramine, and hydrazine. All of which are very toxic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A warning for pet owners who may use bleach to clean up those occasional messes.  Urine will turn to ammonia.  I don't know how long it was there but I was cleaning the basement floor to prep it for painting and I came across a small puddle left by our rescued pug who was have a tough time with house training.  I proceeded to mop it up with the bleach water I was using.  It immediately reacted and with in a minute the entire house was filled with the noxious fumes created.  Luckily it was a warm day and we were able to open all the windows and doors to ventilate it out.  It was an hour before we could tolerate going back in and the residual odor took several days to finally dissipate. I clean with bleach all the time and never had this happen before.  So be very careful when cleaning up after pets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fresh urine and bleach makes chloramine gas, which is bad. As urine (urea) breaks down it does form some ammonia. </p>
<p>It really depends on how much of each and how long the urine has sat there.  </p>
<p>Empty toilet, you're not really going to notice anything. </p>
<p>Peeing directly into a toilet full of bleach, you'll see some fizzing and notice the smell. </p>
<p>Use household bleach to strip a wood porch that some cat/dog has pissed on for the past 5 years (buying foreclosures is fun, BTW)? Yeah, its going to be really noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if the urine has had time to sit and turn to ammonia then YES!  I have had this happen and the result is noxious and immediate and quite impressive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually when you pee in a swimming pool it is possible to create cyanogen chloride.  The concentrations are quite low so it it isn't dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a great example and isn't even extreme to bring up. I work in infection control, and have visited far too many hospitals where the cleaning staff will use a quaternary ammonium disinfectant and then rinse with bleach water. It's terrifying to know this stuff happens. Proper training when dealing with chemicals is so important, even cleaning products, but too many places care about cost over safety.</p></div>		</li>
