			<div class="markdown"><p>What about with regard to pollution? I can't speak much for the Japanese but it seems like in Korea the primary purpose of the mask is to prevent inhalation of (i'm not sure what exactly)- vehicle exhaust, dust particles? Do the masks have any efficacy in this case?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.</p>
<p>N95 rated masks will protect you from PM2.5 and PM10 particles pollution, but people in Asia use surgical masks which are pretty useless for that (they try to catch the things getting out, not getting in. Preventing dust to get in requires a mask fitting well to the face).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lived in Korea. There are specific masks you need to buy (cloth, more durable ones) that are treated specifically for dust/ pollution for the Spring Yellow Dust season. They are marketed as Yellow Dust masks- not sure what they do to help, but I felt they did. Surgical masks are usually used for when you're sick and don't want to get others sick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. I lived in Seoul and during the yellow dust season, people sell and buy N95 masks in pharmacies and convenience stores. They're far cheaper over there than in the US. The surgical masks are usually only worn by people who are sick so they don't cough all over people (because no one covers their damn mouths when they cough over there).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. In my last job we had things called face-fit appointments. A trained fitter would measure you and a mask would be ordered for you. They're so well-fitted that under OSHA guidelines you can't even have facial hair as it will mess with the seal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this one. I live in the Philippines currently (American Expat). I am in the Manila (National Capital Region), where the pollution content is very high.  Here, diesel fumes are strong, because there is a large amount of public transportation, most of which use diesel as fuel. </p>
<p>Here you see many people using the masks as a way of protecting themselves from the exhaust.  You'll see a majority of people also carrying handkerchiefs here to put over their mouth and nose when they are near something spewing fumes.  I've done it myself when needed.  I've never worn a mask, but I have considered it. It does seem effective to cut the larger particles of the fumes, although it would not be effective on actual gases like COx or CO2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Bangalore, and we have really lax pollution control here as well. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/J69dUU2.jpg" target="_blank">Here's how my mask looks</a> after a week of usage.</p>
<p>My usage is 10km of daily commute by bicycle, so I will be inhaling more deeply than most. </p>
<p>Ninja edit: I feel I'd rather wear the mask than not. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Particulate Material. From the sources you mention and many others. <a href="https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.particle" target="_blank">PM-10</a> and <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/air/pmq_a.htm" target="_blank">PM-2.5</a> are the ones we test / have masks for. The number refers to the diameter of the object in microns. So, obviously they come in other sizes, but we tend to just group things into 10 - 2.5μm, and &lt;2.5μm .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A respirator or a gas mask is constructed to protect the person who wears it, not people around. There is always a <a href="http://www.tntrade.cz/3m-9322-respirator-rouska-comfort-plus-ffp2-s-s-vydechovym-ventilkem_ies237325.jpg" target="_blank">valve</a> that let air breathed out not to go through the filter. A respirator would protect a user for longer time than a simple mask, because it doesn't become damp quickly. However it would not prevent spreading infection.</p>
<p>So it would be rational to wear a respirator in the time of     epidemic spreading an infection especially in public transport or rooms where many people are together. But it would be protection of people who wear it, not others.</p>
<p>Once I tried to wear in public a simple respirator with a valve. It was really a very crazy experience. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It protects the person who wears it, not surroundings. The exhaled air goes out through a valve to surpass the filter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about the effect from not touching the nose or mouth? This is a common mode of infection as our hands become contaminated and then we, like the idiots we are, stick our fingers in our nose, mouth and any other available orifice.</p>
<p>Stopping us from doing this via a mask would surely lower the rates of infection of mask wearers?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was actually a study which shed light exactly on this factor which also got front-page: the masks are not for preventing small airborne particles to get out, but from your hands to get to your nose and mouth &quot;and&quot; it helps keeping hands and mouth moistured and not dry out from the cold air.</p>
<p>Viruses and bacteria require some level of dryness to grab on and multiply, with masks the mouth and nose keep on working normal.</p></div>		</li>
