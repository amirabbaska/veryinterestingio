			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes a company will alter the chemical structure or composition slightly of a drug. This allows them to get around patents of others. But the changes usually don't effect the viability of the drug action. The most subtle one I found recently advertised was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levocetirizine" target="_blank">Xyzal</a>. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry\)" target="_blank">chiral variant</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetirizine" target="_blank">Zertec</a>. The only difference between the two is one molecule is folded one way and one is folded the other way. Otherwise they are the same molecule. Same carbons, hydrogens, nitrogens, oxygens all bonded in the same structure. But for purposes of patents, not the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I am wrong, but don't medicines have to get approved to be sold and advertised for every specific condition they want to claim?</p>
<p>So if they have done so, how would it be false advertising to advertise it twice for different conditions? Even if something can relieve multiple symptoms at once, it could make sense to have it advertised twice. You might not go to the same place in the pharmacy to find cold medication as you do for migraine relief, so if it was only advertised as migrain relief (also with cold relief), you wouldn't find it.</p>
<p>The specific issue in your link appears to be:</p>
<p>1) Charging a price premium for different advertising boxes.</p>
<p>2) The box did not state all of the conditions that it would be valid for. It seems fine to have a headline &quot;Migraine relief&quot;, but finer print should say &quot;all pain&quot; or whatever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was misleading because each box claimed that the product 'targeted' different kinds of pain, which the product doesn't do. Since it works on all the different types of pain it was being marketed to it should be sold as a single product with the different forms of pain that it works on listed. I get your point about products that work for different symptoms it might be good to have them in different parts of the pharmacy, but in the case of nuerofen, and in fact all the products Ive seen use this marketing strategy (it seems to be very common for cold products in the UK), each of the products are side by side in the pharmacy, not in different sections.</p></div>		</li>
