<blockquote>
<p>Don't receive the proper amount of oxygen your body needs, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is complete and utter bullshit. You breathe, you get the oxygen you need. Time awake has absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and blood flow begins to thin out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I don't even know what it is supposed to mean but this is crap too. Viscosity or Blood Pressure, I'm really not sure which one you are really referring to, are not affected by oxygenation of the blood.</p>
<p>ELI5 is supposed to be simple explanations by people who know what they are talking about, not speculation by people who failed high school science.</p></div>		</li>
