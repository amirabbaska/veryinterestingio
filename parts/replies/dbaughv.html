			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this for OP /u/Chronic_Apathy1, from a higher level academic standard many of the core products you use today are still not seen as 'that great' in terms of design and engineering and that is &quot;fine&quot; because of the economics of the product. Some are for reasons because of how the market is held in deadlock (looking at you certain medical devices) and others because at the end of the day people aren't going to pay much more for the highest quality of design devices, not everyone can afford BMWs and top end stoves.</p>
<p>Some of the most interesting side lectures I have had where from professors who have worked in the industry having their crack at major products and all their faults. And this is important, because if you THINK your shit is &quot;all that&quot; then it is harder to get into the mindset of being critical on the faults of your product and might miss something that is actually serious and life threatening.</p>
<p>I.E These are not test saying &quot;design a mid-range car to drive smoothly on a nice summer day&quot;, these are test saying &quot;design an entry level car (in a few hours) that can drive on 2 inches of ice, in a sandstorm, in the blazing sun&quot;. Sure much of it won't be seen in consumer or even higher end professional use but it is key to know how to test that and find the faults and know how to move on.</p></div>		</li>
