			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and that leads to my point--you know exactly what I mean when I ask this question. Why is one side of the line hilarious, while the other is sickening? It's like complete opposite sides of the same coin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not hurt, then it's just endearing and humiliating. We laugh when embarrassing things happen to other people. So you should just  look more into the psychology of humiliation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Laughter is always used as social opinion. Both cases are things we benefit from avoiding. Sometimes we're laughing at something else we want to insult.  </p>
<p>Like a daredevil motorcyclist claiming he's &quot;invincible&quot; shortly before breaking a leg performing a physically near-impossible stunt. We might chuckle at their overconfidence (but not their pain), as a means of opinion about society, and how we should responsibly spend out time, even if their jump was cool (and worth it)..    </p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that 14yo is not &quot;sick&quot; if they laugh at death in a cartoon, as they would be trained to think of pain in cartoon as non-lethal learning experiences of imaginary story-characters.  </p>
<p>People that laugh at genuine, easily avoidable misfortune.. are generally just immature or have been hurt themselves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only a select few would laugh if they saw me get run over and splattered to bloody pieces. Yeah, yeah, a 14 year old would laugh if they saw that in a cartoon. But if you actually saw that in the flesh, it'd fuck you up.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A gore-obsessed subreddit or similar online forum isn't a sample of the normal population. That's more like a concentration of the weirdos.</p>
<p>Plus, morbid curiosity isn't the same as <em>laughing</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah the good ol' days of the wild west internet. Those were simpler times.</p>

<p>Laughing as a reaction to the uncomfortable is natural.</p></div>		</li>
