<p>A ball bearing made of wood? Am I understanding that correctly?</p>
<p>EDIT - apparently!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For the same reason it was widely used in water-lubricated shaft bearings for ships and hydro-electric power plants,[5] and in the stern-tube bearings of ship propellers [6] until the 1960s saw the introduction of sealed white metal bearings. According to the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association website, the shaft bearings on the WWII submarine USS Pampanito (SS-383) were made of this wood.[7] The aft main shaft strut bearings for USS Nautilus (SSN-571), the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, were composed of this wood. Also, the bearings in the original 1920s turbines of the Conowingo hydroelectric plant on the lower Susquehanna River were made from lignum vitae. The shaft bearings on the horizontal turbines at the Pointe du Bois generating station in Manitoba are made from lignum vitae. Other hydroelectric plant turbine bearings, many of them still in service, were fabricated with lignum vitae and are too numerous to list here.[8]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bearings don't necessarily have rolling elements- bushings etc are types of plain bearings.  I've seen wood roller bearings but it's a much better material for plain bearings.  Plain bearings can handle higher contact pressure but only at lower speeds.</p>
<p>Lignum vitae and plain bearings are often used in conjunction with stuffing boxes as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They’re not ball bearings, just plain bearings, more specifically a bushing.</p>
<p>For a while you could buy the wood from old hydroelectric plants. It came with all the paperwork to prove it was legit too. Not sure if that’s necessary anymore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Naturally he made roller bearings out of Lignum vitae.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you tour the 123 year old <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=501" target="_blank">power house in Folsom California</a>, now a State Park, they told us the bearings in the generators were made of wood. First time I heard about wood being used industrially as shaft bearings. This was a hydroelectric plant and so water would be around. If only having to deal with leaks.</p>
<p>Edit: Bit of trivia about this place. Its right near Folsom Prison. Shades of Johnny Cash!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of lignum vitae, I saw a YouTube video of a Japanese man making a kitchen knife out of it. Took a bunch of sanding and sharpening to get it right but they did it. More of an art piece than a practical one, but still kind of neat nonetheless. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKH63_r0OCA" target="_blank">Here is the video in question</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Ive seen it mentioned a dozen times since last year when I figured out my boats rails are all made of lignum vitae.</p>
