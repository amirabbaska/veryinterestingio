			<div class="markdown"><p>It's gotten worse since the internet.  Bots can buy up much more tickets for one outfit, instead of having to have bodies wait in lines to get way less, in terms of number of tickets, than bots would get you for running a script.  (Some people have been pointing out that the ticket companies themselves are also increasing the scarcity artificially by not realeasing very many, if any, tickets.  (something like 7% of the tickets for a recent Justin Beaver concert were ever made available to the public.) If true, it seems that the ticket companies basically endorse scalping.)</p></div>		</li>
