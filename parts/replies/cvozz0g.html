			<div class="markdown"><p>The TPP agreement was just signed off today after a long week of negotiations in Atlanta. The 12 countries that signed the agreement will now have to review it and vote on passing it into law by their respective parliaments or houses of government as part of the ratification process (this will happen over the next few months). The full text of the agreement still has not been made public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a major trade deal between 12 countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and others.</p>
<p>Among other things, it relaxes restrictions and tariffs on imports/exports between these countries for certain industries.</p>
<p>Some concerns people have relate to the chapters covering pharmaceuticals and copyright enforcement. </p>
<p>At this point, the full text of the agreement hasn't been released to the public (the agreement was negotiated in secret), so we don't know exactly what the agreement covers...</p>
<p>Having said that, leaks suggest that certain pharmaceuticals going forward may receive longer patent protections or exclusivity periods, meaning that it will be longer before other drug companies can manufacturer generic versions of the drug (ultimately keeping drug prices higher for longer periods, at least in some countries).</p>
<p>Leaks also suggest that the agreement may force some countries to extend the copyright term (e.g. from the author's life + 50 years to + 70 years), and the agreement may force countries to pass new legislation aimed to further penalize copyright infringement (e.g. unauthorized downloading/sharing of files) and make it illegal for people to circumvent digital locks (aka 'DRM') to copy media (e.g. ebooks, music, videos, films, apps, games, etc.) even potentially for personal (non-commercial) reasons and for purposes of fair use.</p>
<p>We won't know the full story until the text of the agreement is released though, so at this point it's just a lot of speculation going around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the problem -- the only details we have are thanks to leaks. The full text isn't available yet, so aside from potentially stricter copyright laws, we know next to nothing about the agreement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A trade agreement much like NAFTA or many of the other trade agreements we've signed onto in the past.</p>
<p>The exact details of the agreement aren't really know though as many details are still secret.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So they signed an agreement without reviewing it first? I guess that's politics for you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ministers representing each country that signed the agreement have read and negotiated the agreement over many years, so they are intimately familiar with all the details and they have briefed their respective heads of state (e.g. Presidents / Prime Ministers) with those details and involved the heads of state in the negotiation process.</p>
<p>Eventually the full text of the agreement will be published and then the various parliaments and houses of government from each country will start voting on its ratification. That's when politicians get to read the contents of the agreement and decide whether or not to actually sign it into law. Without ratification, the agreement has no legal force, so it's almost as if the agreement was never signed by that country.</p></div>		</li>
