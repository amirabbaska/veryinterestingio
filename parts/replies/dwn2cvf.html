<p>First, nothing holds its value. If you need new computers, buy 'em whenever (mostly), but items that hold value (like renovations, new vehicles etc) definitely end up on the balance sheet to be depreciated over time. </p>
<p>Now, if you piss away the money, you've spent 100% instead of paying 30% in taxes. </p>
<p>If you pay a bonus, you pay income tax. How that plays out will depend on your local tax code. In Canada, it mostly works out the same in the end. </p>
<p>If you buy a new machine, you can write off something like 20% per year for a few years, so you still pay taxes on it. Same for inventory and many other things. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>First, there's plenty of assets a business can own that can hold value or even increase such as commercial real estate or even share in other companies. These end up on the balance sheet but are not taxed against corporate income tax which is done against the net profit of the company. Through this method the value of the company overall (which factors in its assets) can increase without taxes being paid. </p>
<p>Most businesses exist to provide profit for the shareholders/owner this is where the bonus situation comes into play. If I am the owner and also the CEO I can choose to bonus myself out the money, this way I avoid paying corporate taxes and pay personal instead. However if I were to distribute the money to myself as the owner I pay corporate taxes plus capital gains taxes before the money gets to me. In some situations it evens out but in others it's vastly better to bonus out the money.(depending on what tax bracket you are in, if you are in the 50% or lower you are better off doing this)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here you are conflating writing off depreciation of the value of the machine vs. Writing off the expense to purchase the machine. </p>
<p>The entire purchase price is completely written off as a business expense. THEN the company writes off 20% of the value of the depreciating asset as a &quot;loss&quot; for a period of several years. </p></div>		</li>
