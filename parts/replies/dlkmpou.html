			<div class="markdown"><p>Well how about this. I once had a dream that some mad scientist swapped the mind of a spider into my brother and set it loose in this maze i was stuck in. The way it was struggling to charge at/attack me and the terrifying confusion in its eyes and the way it was trying to look at me is something I will never forget</p></div>		</li>
