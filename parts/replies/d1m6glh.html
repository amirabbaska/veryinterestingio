			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add that this property of not &quot;having a pattern&quot; can be formalized in the form of Kolmogorov complexity. The Kolmogorov complexity of a sequence of numbers is the size of the smallest computer program (for some given programing language) that could output the sequence. A sequence like 01-02-03-04-05-06, could for example be written in Haskell like [1..6] while 5-23-84-11-12 can't be written shorter than [5,23,84,11,12], as such we can see that 01-02-03-04-05-06 holds less complexity/entropy/information than 5-23-84-11-12.</p></div>		</li>
