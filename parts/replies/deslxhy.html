			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't. The reason why you expel to little urine after retaining the urination for a long period of time is because the bladder sort of loses its elasticity. So, you keep the urine in the bladder for a long time. The bladder expands more than usually... (The urinary bladder wall is made of muscles and they can stretch. But if they stretch too much they need some time to gain their initial elasticity...). After peeing you expel some of the urine contained in the bladder but since the bladder has lost some of its elasticity it isn't able to expel all the urine, or it is able to expel only a small part. After some minutes the bladder recuperates part of the elasticity and you feel another urinary impulse.  Why does this happen? Becuase by regaining the normal elasticity the bladder sort of contracts and the pressure receptors in its wall tell your CNS that you need to pee, again. This time, in most cases, you are able to expel all the urine since the bladder has recuperated all the normal elasticity after the excessive expansion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes so much sense to me! If I forget to make a point of using the bathroom before I leave work at the end of the day I'm totally fine the whole commute home, but the minute my front door is in sight I have to pee SO BADLY it hurts </p>
<p>Edit- a word.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As soon as I arrive at my house I need to pee. It's interesting to know why when at any other time I can wait until my bladder is full, but why I urgently need to pee when I arrive home when I pee for about 2 seconds after feeling like my bladder will explode. </p>
<p>Oddly enough, this is the only home I've had where I feel a sudden, unavoidable urge to pee when I get home even if I did 5 minutes previously. So I suppose I find my current home relaxing. That's nice to know even if I have to wait uncomfortably for my garage door to open.</p></div>		</li>
