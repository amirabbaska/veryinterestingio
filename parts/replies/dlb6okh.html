			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up and live on a small island that used to have water supply issues in the summer where the reservoir would run very low. We used to be very water conscious, no running taps whilst brushing teeth or making deep baths. We never used sea water to flush toilets here because of maintenance costs. About a decade ago a politician actually did something good and increased rainwater catchment area by a few percent and now we pretty much never run low at the reservoir. When I was a growing up we'd have shortages every couple of years with hosepipe and carwashing bans. My kid's have not seen this happen since catchment was increased.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had water problems forever in my area up until we started building de-sal plants in the late 70s. We still have yearly bans of hose and car washing. Only professional car washes that maintain water recycle rates of 90% or higher may continue operating. In the late 90s during a severe drought, they actually even banned those. </p>
<p>Wettest summer in 10 years right now, and we have hose and car wash bans abound. </p>
<p>WAIIITTTT... I (maybe) just had a sudden clarity clarence moment.</p>
<p>They ban these services not because of water shortages during these times, but to allow the aquifer to replenish for the winter! HOLY SHIT.</p>
<p>But I've heard it takes years for water to get down there, so that can't be right......</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I'm from we've had restrictions on watering your lawn at certain times of day because the sun evaporates the water too quickly and it ends up wasted instead of in the roots, so you end up watering it more often.</p>
<p>I wonder if the same idea applies to car-washing with a hose in the summer. A bunch of water evaporates before you get to scrubbing so you end up using more water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live the lakes are typically lower in the wet season as most of the moisture that feeds them is ice/snow locked on the mountains over winter.  </p>
<p>But we have restrictions in the summer sometimes to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rebuild added a reverse osmosis desalinizer. It wasn't very big, but it produced enough potable water to compensate for the lack of rainwater in the dry season. Great improvement!</p></div>		</li>

<p>maintenance was a big issue.</p>

<p>Former Navy Hull Tech here: One of the jobs of my division was head maintenance. The toilets were not to bad but the urinal traps were a bonafide horror. Once a year they would completely block with a calcium and salt combination that had to be mechanically removed.</p></div>		</li>
