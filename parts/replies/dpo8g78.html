			<div class="markdown"><p>Its based on the objects elasticity, its elastic region, plastic region, break point etc. look at a rubber band for example, its kind of the reverse of a rubber ball. Instead of compressing a rubber ball we’re stressing or stretching a rubber band. Eventually at some point the rubber band will break if stressed enough, but its elastic region is so large it will take significant for e to do that. When a force is applied to hit, i.e. stretching it, if it hasn’t broken, basically that energy has to go somewhere once the force is no longer applied it will return back to its original shape. The reverse happens with a rubber ball. Upon compression as long as the rubber ball is still in its elastic region it will return back to its original form. Now you may ask, but i can stretch something and sometimes it wont return back to its original shape, it just stays the shape it was stretched too, lets say for example silly putty. You have stretched or stressed this object past its elastic region and into its plastic region. If you stretched it past that region and it breaks thats its break point. So if you were to plot these regions for a rubber band and silly putty, the rubber band would have a large elastic region, minimal plastic region with a breakpoint really far out. The silly putty would have a small elastic region on comparison and a rater large plastic region with a break point within that region.</p>
<p>So basically, objects with a large elastic region a minimal to almost nonexistent plastic region and a break point really far out on the plotted graph are bouncier, objects with minimal elastic region and large plastic or very low breakpoints are less bouncy.</p>
<p>I hope i explained this well enough. </p></div>		</li>
