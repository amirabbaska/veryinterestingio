			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a fender-bender once. I thought afterwards that the actual impact wasn't stored in my head, like I can remember directly before it, then I was looking around with spilled coffee, with no memory of it spilling, and a few other details that were unrecoverable. It made me feel weird thinking that my thoughts weren't infallible, and my brain had to accurately write down the past for it to be my current reality. Like perception can be messed with, because its the body(hopefully accurately)storing the past</p></div>		</li>
