			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats are susceptible to contagious respiratory illnesses--not quite the flu (the cause is not an influenza virus), but with similar symptoms. We adopted two cats from a shelter, and both came down with it a couple of days after we got them: our vet said they had probably already been infected at the shelter, and that's apparently common. They got well and then the cat we already had came down with it too. Poor things: it was hard to see and hear them coughing and sneezing. We knew from our own bouts of flu all too well how they were feeling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cats can also contract a strain of the Coronavirus that often will give them flu-like symptoms. Runny nose, sneezing, respiratory infection, etc. Most cats get over it, but some, usually kittens under a year old, can't stop the spread of the infection, and will die from it. Cause of death is usually respiratory or heart failure from acute peritonitis when the infection spreads to their body wall linings. Basically, their body cavity fills with fluid which causes heart failure, liver failure, and eventually respiratory failure. It's called Feline Infectious Peritonitis, and it's fatal 100% of the time. I had a beautiful little kitten who died from it...he made it almost to his first birthday. It's completely devastating to watch...his health declined so sharply over a period of two or three weeks, I could hardly believe it. I took him in because I thought he had a bit of a respiratory infection, and they basically just very coldly and flatly told me he'd be dead in a month and I should just put him down now. So crazy that a tiny, usually harmless virus can cause such destruction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had that happen to us. Vet advised us to wait a year or so before getting another car so that the virus would degrade/die off in the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would be very very surprised, given the differences between plant and animal cells. Viruses have to highjack cellular machinery to go on replicating, and this highjacking requires an intricate set of molecular machinery. A virus able to highjack both animal and plant cells would be as impressive as a thief who could hotwire your car OR a battleship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer to that question is still in doubt. From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&quot;Researchers from the University of the Mediterranean in Marseille, France have found tenuous evidence that suggest a virus common to peppers, the Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV) may have moved on to infect humans. This is a very rare and highly unlikely event as, to enter a cell and replicate, a virus must &quot;bind to a receptor on its surface, and a plant virus would be highly unlikely to recognize a receptor on a human cell. One possibility is that the virus does not infect human cells directly. Instead, the naked viral RNA may alter the function of the cells through a mechanism similar to RNA interference, in which the presence of certain RNA sequences can turn genes on and off,&quot; according to Virologist Robert Garry from the Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana&quot;.</p>
