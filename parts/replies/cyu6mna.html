			<div class="markdown"><p>My ignorance keeps my mind from understanding this.  How could the same light travel at two different speeds?  How can the ship going 0.999c experience the light going 1c and at the same time other folks not going 0.999c also experience the light at 1c?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird time-dilation. The faster you go, the slower time moves for you. Since you are moving very fast, everything else has more &quot;time&quot; to move; so light will keep moving at the same speed regardless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it that in your reference frame time seems &quot;normal&quot; but you witness any other reference frame as having slowed clocks? That is, time only moves slower for a person inside a speeding ship as observed by a person outside the ship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate to say this, but that's just relativity. Light does weird things, and the fact that light will appear to travel at the same speed to all observers is why we even have special theory of relativity. It's the one thing you just need to accept. There are many experiments confirming this though, so feel free to question me and find out yourself :)!</p>
<p>To elaborate even more, it's not that &quot;the same light travels at two different speeds.&quot; The light travels at the same speed, it's just everything else that gets messed up. For example, I made another comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/40gzo6/if_two_ships_travel_at_higher_then_05c_away_from/cyu77mr" target="_blank">here</a>. Skip to &quot;Time is dilated too&quot; and read about my problem with that moon gif. </p>
<p>Relativity is weird. The important thing to remember is space and time are related and aren't exactly constant. We think of time (and space too) as a sort of given. One second is one second, right? No! Not in relativity. Hell, one meter isn't even one meter if you're moving fast enough -__-.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have been reading around this post and I have questions for you that might help me understand this.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have two clocks synchronized really far apart?</p>
<p>Say you have two stop watches on you, and you want them both to be keeping the same time, but you want to move one a light year away.</p>
<p>So you start them both, keep one stationary and move the other one to your spot 1 light year away. How do you do this?</p>
<p>If you move the watch at light speed, no time will pass for the watch during travel, but the other watch will have a year pass. Now your watches are a year apart, that's no good.</p>
<p>So we can move it really slowly? It is still moving, and it will do so continuously for a very long time until it gets to its spot. Millions of years could pass, the watches would start off perfectly synchronized, but eventually the movement would cause the traveling watch to keep slower time? It might not be much, but the one that traveled will be <em>some</em> amount slower than the stationary one.</p>
<p>So the question here is about reference frames. Wouldn't both reference frames be centered around the stationary watch? If we look at it from the perspective of the moving watch, and call that stationary. It is going to be slower than the stationary watch, we can't say &quot;from our reference frame the stationary watch appeared to move away from us.&quot; It will be a year faster than us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt that anyone can truly say they understand it, given that we don't ever directly experience anything like it; if we're running and throw a ball, the ball moves at the speed we threw it (v_ball) plus the speed we're running at (v_you) to give it a final velocity of v_ball + v_you (I didn't take the time to figure out subscripts).  Light just doesn't work that way.  I guess that's the perk of being the known universe's speed limit.</p>
<p>Edit: /u/Ramast has a pretty nice explanation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/40gzo6/if_two_ships_travel_at_higher_then_05c_away_from/cyuf960" target="_blank">below me</a>.  To add to his statement, it may be helpful to think of space-time as a Cartesian plane, where we say space (all the physical dimensions we experience) is the x-axis, time is the y-axis, and we are constantly moving at the speed of light through the plane, just at some angle (0째&lt;theta&lt;90째) from the x-axis.  Since we are moving extremely slowly (relative to light) through space, nearly all of our speed is through time (theta is nearly equal to 90 째).  Since light is moving at the speed of light (obviously), it doesn't move through time (theta=0째).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think its very simple to explain if you accept one basic fact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The faster something goes the slower time will pass for that thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ time also goes slower because of gravity but lets keep it simple for now ]</p>
<p>Now based on that fact time for people in an ordinary rocket that we launch from earth goes slower than rest of us. This is a proved fact and was measured by atomic clock but since our rockets are veeeery slow compared to light, time slow down is also verry slow (a tiny fraction of a second)</p>
<p>In the same way if you put super accurate watch in a ball that you throw away, time will pass teeny tiny bit slower inside the ball but I don't think we have watch accurate enough to measure such small change in time.</p>
<p>Ok now we that out of the way next we wonder, why there is speed limit and why its constant?
As we agreed the faster you go the slower time will be for you compared to everyone else. Eventually as you keep gaining speed time will totally freeze. At that point it will take infinite number of years for your watch to move even one second in the future.</p>
<p>You can not go faster than that because you are frozen. that speed where you will get frozen is what we call &quot;light speed&quot;</p>
<p>So far so good? now lets say you are at light speed and you tried to throw ball at 5 meters per hour. You can't actually because you are frozen,  it will take you infinite amount to time to lift your finger let alone throw a ball.</p>
<p>What if you are very close to speed of light but not just there yet? then time will be extremely slow for you, it will take you - from our perspective on earth - thousands of years for the ball to be actually thrown and its speed will be something like 0.0000000001 meter per hour and so maximum speed for that ball will not exceed light speed as well.</p>
<p>Now how can light be constant regardless of spaceship speed is no longer hard to understand. if you travel at half speed of light then time will be 50% slower for you and so you will still see light going at same speed and so on.
This last bit [ traveling at half speed = 50% time slow down ] is not entirely accurate and I am sure someone can correct it for me but I am just trying to explain in simple way </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not entirely accurate. The ball wouldnt be moving at exavtly v_ball+v_you its just that the difference is so small that its negligible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(relativistic) velocities do not add linearly, i.e. 0.5c + 0.5c != 1c.</p>

<p>Does this happen at all velocities (to some degree), or is there a specific point at which this effect happens? If the former, at what velocity do we take the effect into consideration?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Does this happen at all velocities</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely! It happens at small velocities, but the effect is super small. So there's this thing called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor" target="_blank">Lorentz factor</a>. It's the factor by which time dilates, length contracts, etc. Mathematically, it's why we have the &quot;Twin Paradox.&quot; But anyway, this factor is proportional to v/c, or the velocity you (or the reference frame) is traveling at. So we can reasonably say that even at 10% the speed of light, our Lorentz factor is only 1.005. Closer to 1 means more Newtonian where 1 second=1 second in all reference frames, and 10 mph + 20 mph = 30 mph. So a factor of 1.005 we can see is only a 0.5% change. It's enough to notice (i.e. a meter stick traveling at 10% the speed of light we appear to actually be 0.995 meters), but we need to approach REALLY high speeds to see radical changes.</p>
<p>The velocity addition formula has a term similar to this Lorentz scalar. It takes the same form in the sense that you divide over goes something like (v/c)^2. Please take a glance at the Lorentz factor wiki article! </p></div>		</li>
