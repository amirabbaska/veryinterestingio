			<div class="markdown"><p>So I totally get the &quot;none of them&quot; part, that's easy to comprehend. And your explanation makes sense. And of course, everyone alive today has to have at least 1 common ancestor. But that doesn't guarantee that any one person alive today will be that common ancestor at any point in the future, does it?</p>
<p>I'm imagining a scenario (an unlikely one) in which in every generation, my descendants only have 1 child. So in every generation, I am only ancestor to one person. Am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not a mathematical certainty. As OP says, a reality is conceivable where this is not true. For example, suppose today, we give everyone in the world either a red or a blue dot. And further decree that reds shall mate only with reds, blues only with blues, and you pass your color on to your children.</p>
<p>In the case that neither line dies out, neither of the situations in the statement will ever be true.</p>
<p>Of course we could say that the statement is trivially true because it's virtually guaranteed that there will be a time when there are no living humans at all, making the second clause true at that time.</p>
<p>The &quot;mathematical certainty&quot; does apply if you assume that breeding happens sufficiently randomly to eventually eliminate such structure as the colors example. I'm not saying that isn't a reasonable assumption to make about the human race. But equally, if we're going to use the word &quot;mathematical&quot; we have to be precise about stating our assumptions.</p></div>		</li>
