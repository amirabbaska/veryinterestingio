			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a huge deal in aircraft, since the combination of altitude and unavailability to oxygen can cause pilots to turn a perfectly good aircraft into a huge lawn dart pretty quickly. On fighter jets (and anything else where the pilot flys with a mask) the pilot can adjust the concentration. Usually it's just a toggle switch between 'normal' and 'max concentration' but if he/she were to feel those hypoxic symptoms (fingers tingling, dazed and confused, cloudy thoughts, the other pilot slurring speech because they probably won't notice themselves doing it, etc.) the transition to a higher concentration of oxygen needs to happen immediately to get out of hypoxia and regain control of the aircraft. </p>
<p>Most aircraft now don't use liquid bottled oxygen anymore, but rather have an On Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS). That means they can produce an infinitely long supply of oxygen at the level of output that the system is designed to produce. The problem with that is you have a machine that's separating oxygen from outside air for the whole flight, which isn't an issue until that extra amount of moving parts start to fail. The backup is a little oxygen tank, something to get the pilots down to below like 10,000 feet or so and the outside air will have enough oxygen to supply their brains so the aircraft can make it on the ground safely. If the pilots aren't trained to effectively spot those hypoxic symptoms, they slowly daze off and end up on the evening news when they land in grandma's front yard. </p>
<p>Tl;dr- oxygen good, CO2 bad </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall an issue with the F-22 where pilots would get hypoxia over and over. Mechanics would tear apart the air system to try and figure out what was going on. For some reason the intake filter would be filled with impurities that seeped into the cockpit overtime. It was almost a huge issue until they found the root cause, which was two-fold. One of which was the assembly in the cockpit. There was a mechanical issue that affected the O2 supply.</p>
<p>Another part of it was that they'd turn the airplanes on in hangars with the doors shut to preheat them. Flyboys didn't like the cold too much, but it had a similar affect to turning a car on with the garage door shut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, it was so creepy how they couldn't even put their mask back on. The Smarter Every Day guy says &quot;I don't want to die&quot; and just smiles vacantly while they're telling him to put his mask on. It was really unnerving. I definitely have a new respect for those oxygen masks on airplanes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slow onset hypoxia is really scary stuff. It is why recognizing the symptoms early is so important, because you really won't realize it's happening, and not everyone will feel the same symptoms. In an altitude chamber training exercise I felt slightly nauseous, dizzy and flushed, but did not feel any tingling sensations or euphoria, which are also common symptoms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inert gas asphyxiation is a terrifyingly <em>peaceful</em> way to die.</p>
<p>It's because of how our bodies regulate breathing. It's controlled by dissolved carbon dioxide concentration in the blood, not oxygen. So if you're in an environment where the carbon dioxide is still being removed normally but no oxygen is being delivered, you won't feel anything until the hypoxia starts to set in, and at that point, you may not be capable of helping yourself.</p></div>		</li>
