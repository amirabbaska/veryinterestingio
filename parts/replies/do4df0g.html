The main effect of cranberry bog management is alterations in water movement through the lands. Because water is needed for winterizing the crops and harvesting the crops, it is diverted to the bogs and away from other lands.<br />
Yes there are fragmentation effects as well.<br />
You don't see as much of the chemical effects like with other crops.</p></div>		</li>
