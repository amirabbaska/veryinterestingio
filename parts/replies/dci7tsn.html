It's been fantastic, and seems to keep frustration levels down as they could communicate clearly with us while very young. My 5 year old also have a fantastic vocabulary and converses with adults with ease.</p>
<p>I used to push this on any new parents, and only some saw limited success. It was pointed out to me that this wasn't a silver bullet, and maybe my children benefited from our overall involvement, our intelligence, and their own natural aptitude.</p>
<p>I still think sign language and talking to children like you would an adult are good things, but it doesn't seem to work for all children.  I'd say your niece is bright to begin with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of mine started speaking long clear sentences with all the components very early (comparison - a baby group I was in), but without the cadences of normal speech.  They came later.</p>
<p>The other one spoke the cadences first without the sentences in English and also learned to balance a 2-wheel bike just before he turned two under his own steam.</p>
<p>They both are bright and awesome and both are good at some stuff and less good at other stuff.  One was a born reader, the other was a natural athlete. They are how they are.  It seems to me that nature has quite a lot more influence than nurture.</p>
<p>I think it doesn't matter two hoots to their vocabulary whether you use baby talk or not to your baby - if the way you talk focuses and engages your baby, then that's the win.  If your family as a matter of course has a wide conversational vocabulary then they'll absorb that over time - engaging them with baby talk when they're little doesn't make a difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My seven year old is the same. People always marvel at his vocabulary, in his word choice and his correct usage. He also frequently asks what words mean and then later uses them correctly in context. He's been doing it since three. It's amazing what happens when you treat them like humans instead of a separate creature. </p></div>		</li>
