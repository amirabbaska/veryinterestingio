			<div class="markdown"><p>To a certain approximation, crystalline glass absolutely exists. We know it as <a href="https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1f9k7HpXXXXa6aXXXq6xXFXXXL/001718-Large-Clear-Lemurian-Seed-Quartz-Natural-Point-Cluster-Crystal-Rough-Healing.jpg" target="_blank">quartz</a>. It just makes really terrible windows and is a lot harder to work with than amorphous glass. </p>
<p>Have you ever heard of sapphire watch faces? It’s a similar premise (Al2O3 vs SiO2) except it uses the crystalline form instead of the amorphous stuff. Unfortunately, that order of size is about as big as we can make crystal windows; you’re not gonna find a house or an office building with sapphire or quartz windows because it’s just not technically feasible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to this, pure quartz glass can be heated red hot and submerged into water and generally will not even crack, much less shatter.</p>
<p>The real key to this is the coefficient of expansion, most glass expands and contracts a huge amount as it heats and cools, creating massive stress in a situation like submerging in water since the surface cools faster than the interior. </p>
<p>Quartz has an incredibly small COE, something like 1.6, compared to over 100 for most forms of glass.</p>
<p>The downside is that quartz is quite brittle, and it requires incredible heat to work. The torch I use for glasswork will barely get quartz hot enough to slightly work it, you usually need to go up to a hydrogen/oxygen flame. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason crystallinity doesnt matter much here is be because it doesnt really enhance the right properties enough. The post above didnt really emphasize how important the difference in thermal conductivity and thermal expansion are when it comes to thermal shock. </p>
<p>Think about how when something is hot it expands and when it is cold it shrinks. This is called thermal expansion, and by extension we can think about how the size of something is dependent on its temperature. </p>
<p>Next we need to think about the fact that when something wants to be ten inches long but is stuck to something that is 8 inches long, effectively what we are doing is putting enough compression on the object to force it from 10 inches to 8. This is the internal stresses referenced above. </p>
<p>So when i have an object that doesnt conduct heat very quickly, the surface gets cold but not the core. This makes it so the outer layer wants to shrink but the inner layer still has its heat and wants to be big. The outer layer is effectively being stretched to the size the inner layer is. </p>
<p>Here is where ductility and toughness come into play. I can bend metal pretty far, but not glass. Since the outer layer is effectively being stretched this lack of flexibility causes the glass to shatter. </p>
<p>Crystilinity increases thermal conductivity but not enough to account for the low ductility and toughness of the material</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In regards to bending metal, while you can bend it quite far, repeated bending in the same spot will cause it to break. Would the same effect apply to heating and rapidly cooling? If I did it enough times would it weaken the metal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not quite correct. Things will shatter from thermal shock if they're more brittle, which is true, but glass being amorphous is not the cause of its brittleness (or not the main cause).</p>
<p>Quartz, the ordered crystalline form of glass is still brittle, and may also shatter from thermal stress. As will ice, rocks, porcelain, etc.</p>
<p>What the things above have in common is that they're ceramics. Ceramics tend to be hard, much harder than metals, but one unfortunate corollary is that the harder a material is, the more brittle it is as well (in general), and the easier it is to shatter. The reason ceramics are like this is the type of atomic bond that holds them together, which tend to be very strong compared to the electron-soup bonding of metals.</p>
<p>Metals just tend to be much tougher than ceramics because their atomic structures allow for yielding (or material deformation) to occur ahead of a crack tip. This yielding absorbs energy and can stop cracks from propagating.</p>
<p>The harder bonds in a ceramic don't allow this material deformation to occur (note how it's possible to permanently bend a kink in a length of steel wire, but impossible to do the same to a glass fibre). Therefore cracks, once started, can propagate through the material almost unimpeded.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is possible to make metals so brittle that they will indeed shatter like glass under thermal shock (or other impact loads). There are many ways of making metals hard and brittle though, making them amorphous instead of crystalline is just one of them.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While most of your description is good, quartz wasn't the best choice of material. I used to do quartz blowing, and you can actually take it from well above the glass transition temperature straight into running water and it won't crack. This is because it's coefficient of thermal expansion is really low. No CTE, no thermal stresses. </p>
<p>Other than that, pretty good explanation. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They sure can. Amorphous metals tend to be quite more brittle than crystalline metals. As a result they can shatter under a high enough stress <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwo-dKY_Ih0" target="_blank">as shown in this clip</a>. In this case the stress was generated by compressing the chunk of metal but you can also cause such materials to crack or shatter through a thermal stress as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way you make an amorphous metal in the first place is through rapid quenching. It's very unusual for them to break due to thermal stresses. There are techniques to both heat and cool BMGs in the millions of degrees a second. </p>
