<p>If by &quot;a little&quot; you mean over 1000km further, because Toronto is at the same latitude as Nice in France, which is on the Mediterranean and has a warm climate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;a little&quot; isn't exactly a specific term and when put into any scale can mean anything.
The reason why the Mediterranean is a lot warmer has a different reason all together: winds in south Europe tend to come from the south west and bring warm yet relatively humid Sahara air towards europe. (the golf stream is not responsible for their climate) At the alps the air is forced to climb and cool which is why northern of the alps Europe is wayy cooler than south of 'em.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Berlin doesn't get hit with tropical air or even the tail-end of tropical storms the way Toronto does. It also doesn't get hit with the notorious Colorado lows. The absence of mountains on most of North America makes its climate radically different from what Europe gets, if only because Europe is further north. </p></div>		</li>
