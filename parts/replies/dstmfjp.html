			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a great article making the rounds about 15 years ago about trying to set the magnesium case of a NeXT (Steve Jobs' between-Apple company) workstation on fire. They eventually got it to burn, but it took some doing. And that was a case, with relatively thin sheets. A solid block of magnesium would be pretty hard to ignite.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unintentionally sure. If you wanted to though it's pretty easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>70s and earlier Volkswagen bugs had this issue. Fuel line would crack a leak near the carb. Fire would ensue and if it wasn't put out quick enough then your magnesium transaxle case/engine block?/headers? Would catch on fire and couldn't be put out and would melt the bug into the ground</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big exception: the Curtiss-Wright R-3350 aircraft engine, designed for the B-29 bomber, had a magnesium crankcase. In its initial incarnation it had one exhaust manifold in front for the front cylinders, and another in back, which was nice for maintenance -- but not for cooling. Incoming air first hit a manifold that didn't care how hot it was -- nearly red-hot -- and had picked up several hundred degrees before getting to the cylinders, which needed it <em>badly</em>. The result was so many crankcase fires that Curtiss-Wright ultimately shot down more B-29's than the Japanese did.<br />
The manifolding was eventually moved to the back, and that engine went on to power the final generation of piston airliners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a place that machined magnesium wheels for racing motorcycles. The oldest guy there told stories of using kerosene as a cooling / lubricant for the lathe operations.</p>
<p>Kind of makes sense. Cools great, is a petroleum product. Evaporates easily and keeps the magnesium from oxidizing.</p>
