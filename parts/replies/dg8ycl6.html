			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent, well-written answer.  Would you mind defining &quot;Liberalism&quot; in this context a bit more clearly, reflecting how it's meant in the original writing?  I think it'd be helpful, given its common pejorative use in the USA and it's other, more recent historical definition within the term &quot;Liberal democracy&quot; and liberal values (Free speech, freedom of the press etc).  I may be wrong but I don't think Trotsky was anti-free speech, for instance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In nearly all socialist circles, &quot;liberalism&quot; refers to &quot;classical liberalism&quot; the idea of maximum freedom. Classical liberals are actually closest to modern libertarians, considered by modern socialists to be just as big if not bigger a threat than fascists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try googling liberalism and international relations. It's been a while since I took classes on it but it has a very different meaning in this context than it does in politics.</p></div>		</li>
