			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking yes, but that is highly geography and culture specific.</p>
<p>Also consider that coming out of winter into spring may be a bigger difference in availability then from spring to summer. Summer may have the greatest food supply, but if you've been inside all winter eating canned sardines, some fresh spring vegetables are going to taste amazing.</p>
<p>Also consider a pregnancy is 9 months. If conception is in early spring then the second trimester where the baby needs tons of calories and sunlight coincides with summer. A 2 week old fetus needs far less and so conception during late summer doesn't really help the baby or mother all that much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about this today. I thought that early pregnancy might have been favored in the Summer months for hunting/gathering/building/farming while in the winter months, when workload is low, it makes sense to be heavily pregnant/give birth. This may be due to during the winter months, there would be less work to do meaning plenty more people also on hand to help/nurture the mother/child.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc all tend to be &quot;eating&quot; holidays as well to knock down food stores and, seemingly, to prime the body for winter with enough calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of research into how our micro Biome effects us. And it seems to becoming more apparent that our bacterial partners in life have a far greater effect on our biology than we ever realised. The hygiene hypothosis seems to be a real thing with strong hygiene associated with asthma and associated 'modern' diseases. But not only that but there seems to be growing evidence that our biological partners can also effect our moods in quite substantial ways. </p></div>		</li>
