<p>They're <em>against</em> a bill that repeals/alters the ACA?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Koch Brothers argue that it's basically Obamacare 2.0, and they want a full repeal. At least, that's my understanding of their position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Koch brothers get a lot of hate on reddit and elsewhere because a lot of people see them as being very conservative, however they are actually famously <em>libertarian</em> and so they are against this for similar reasons to Rand Paul, but also (in this case) the house freedom caucus. They don't agree with the HFC on everything though--they don't think government should meddle in things like gay marriage, marijuana, etc. </p>
<p>But because libertarianism is far more similar to Republican views, they tend to back republicans because their biggest interest is small government--clearly the antithesis of how Democrats view government. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They said if you vote yes, they will support your opponent in a primary.  They're not saying they'll give any Congressman any money...only saying they'll spend money out the ass to get you fired.  </p>
<p>So it is a little closer to extortion than bribery.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or...you know...the democratic process. If you don't like your congressman you can donate to his opponent or work to get them (the opponent) elected. Some people don't have free time but they do have free money they can donate to influence their governance. It's no worse when they do it that it is when you do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So to sort of answer OPs question, this sort of shit should absolutely be illegal. It's still corporations owning politicians in ever sense. It'll only get worse once Trump gets his SCOTUS pick installed, and Citizens United will just be the beginning of it.  </p>
<p>Lol, &quot;citizens united.&quot; I'm surprised they didn't name it the &quot;Honest, loving, equality for all&quot; act, despite it being a piece of shit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why? Is supporting a candidate, and going against one that does something that you don't like, wrong? Don't we all do that by calling our politicians, writing op eds, putting advertisements up on our lawn, talking about it on the internet. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Corporations are just groups of people. Which is allowed in the Bill of Rights. Why should they not be able to advocate for their political wants? Unions do it in far shadier ways, where is the hate there? </p>
<p>Corporations like planned parenthood, the ACLU, NAACP all do this too. Should we not allow them to do this anymore? It's not a strawman. The CU case was explicitly about a non-profit making a documentary against a politician. If you get rid CU, then you effectively shutter the political speech of every civil rights group, every leftist movement. Gay marriage would have never been a thing. Marijuana legalization movements gone. Abortions rights, no group to advocate for that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bit of a nitpick here, but 'Citizen's United' is not the name of an act. It is a Supreme Court ruling, and therefore is given the name of the plaintiffs, in this case Citizen's United, a non profit corporation, and the FEC. Hence the name <em>Citizen's United v. FEC</em>, commonly abbreviated to just <em>Citizen's United</em>. This was not some stupid political spin name chosen by politicians, like the bullshit that is the American Healthcare Act, because this was not a piece of legislation.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court did not legislate, they simply looked at the facts, and judged that there was in fact a solid reasoning for why parts of the BCRA and other laws related to electoral finance violated the first amendment. This particular case was brought about by a corporation which wished to advertise a political film critical of Hillary Clinton close to the 2008 election. Why should the government be able to step in and not allow a private corporation to air what it wants? Who decides what is considered too close to the election, or too politically charged to be aired? Many could consider this kind of regulation to be the slippery slope that the first amendment is meant to protect against.</p>
<p>If you have a problem with this ruling, then you have a problem with the unchecked protection of the first amendment. There is a solid argument to be made for why having the first amendment with no exceptions is a bad thing, but that is a different debate entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny how depositing sums of 10k+ get IRS notifications, but if you regularly deposit, say, 9k you'll get busted for &quot;structuring&quot;.</p>
<p>Doing that - and nothing else - is enough to get you prosecuted, and is nowhere near as sketchy as this bullshit. Yes, I get it's all technically legal, and &quot;if congress doesn't like it they can make laws&quot;. But for fuck's sake, we're watching our democracy just crumble away and expecting the people wielding the jackhammers to save us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand this argument and the most recent election proves money doesn't matter (that much).  The person who spent the least money in the primaries and the general election won.  If money was all that mattered, Jeb Bush would have been the Republican nominee.</p></div>		</li>
