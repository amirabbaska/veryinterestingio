<p>Does Mars warm up when you get 1.5 km under the surface, much the same way that I understand Earth to?</p>

<p>This is a sub-glacial lake, not subterranean (sub-Martian?). That means that this lake (if it exists, this is a preliminary study with incomplete data) will be very, very cold. I have only had time to skim <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/07/24/science.aar7268.full" target="_blank">the full paper</a>, but it seems as if the data fits well with a very salty, dusty lake, with a temperature of 205K (-68C, -90F). An abundance of perchlorate compounds in the water would be enough to lower its freezing point as low as 198K (-75C, -103F), which allows it to remain liquid, even under an ice cap made of <em>solid water ice</em> <del>CO2 ice (the freezing point of CO2 is 195K under atmospheric pressure, but the ice may be much warmer down there due to the pressure of 1.5km of ice above it)</del>.</p>
<p>(edit: I read the paper some more, and apparently this area is a cap of water ice, with only a thin, seasonal layer of CO2 ice)</p>
<p>As I said, a lot of this data is pretty speculative and preliminary, and this is going to require a lot of follow-up work to either confirm or deny a lot of the above properties.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Subterranean. It's under the terrain. Terra and terra are two different things, like Earth and earth.</p>
<p>If confused, use &quot;subsurface&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;Subsurface&quot; is a problematic word in itself: It's literally &quot;under above the appearance&quot; if you pick it apart and look at etymology. Words; can't live with them...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All rocky planets should be hotter as you go down deeper. On Earth our hot core is the result of a few things that are mostly related to the formation of our planet, as such it makes sense the same happens on other planets. </p>
<p>Planets are basically formed by smashing a bunch of stuff together over a very long period of time. With every smash there is a transfer of energy from kinetic to heat energy contributing to the overall temperature levels of the planet. Heat is lost though the transfer of heat. In the centre of an object it goes to another point near by that it probably also near the centre. On the outside of the object heat can be lost to it's surroundings (which would be space) which is why the outside is cooler and the centre of planets stays warmer for longer.</p>
<p>Dense minerals will also tend to sink down and it just so happens that some of the more dense elements are also highly radioactive and will release energy that will warm up the surrounding areas. Which helps keep the centre of planets hot. The movement of materials within the molten areas of a planet will also produce some friction which will contribute to the temperatures. </p>
<p>Mars will have all of this good stuff going on as well providing it has some molten stuff going on beneath the core. Which it a pretty safe bet to make. I've seen figures suggesting that the core of Mars is about 15000 K (currently thought to be molten) which is about 4 times colder than Earth's current predicted core temperature. Which makes sense as Mars' surface area to volume ratio is much higher and is also less dense. I haven't seen any efforts to accurately figure out what the temp increase would be per every KM down, but there might be something.</p>
<p>We should know a lot more about the internal makeup of Mars shortly as Insight is due to land on mars in less than 150 days.</p>
<p>E: Do I need to correct something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does insolation contribute much to the temperature of Mars? I imagine that since the atmosphere is thinner (and therefore closer to vacuum) than Earth that the atmosphere acts more like a thermal insulator, trapping more of the incoming solar radiation.</p>
<p>Does this somehow just balance out to a net zero energy in = energy out? Do we have much of an understanding of the processes involved, and a way to test/observe these processes in action?</p>
<p>Sorry for a question somewhat tangential to your answer, you seem knowledgeable in this area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the most knowledgeable person in the world, and I come from a more geological background and have a soft spot for Mars. So if someone more familiar with the topic sees this they might be able to better answer the question. </p>
<p>From my understanding insolation has a pretty big effect Mars' surface temperature. I think the relatively smaller atmosphere results in a few interesting differences between Mars and Earth. Being so thin allows heat to be lost through radiation as there isn't much to keep it trapped, this also allows a lot of radiation to pass through the atmosphere in comparison to Earth. So temperatures can change very rapidly by huge amounts as the surface temperature is much more reliant on the relative position of the sun. Midday might give you 20 degrees Celsius but at night in the exact same spot it could be -70. Which I don't think is too far off some of the more extreme temperature ranges we see in certain places on Earth. the difference being Mars' range is covers a few hours, while I think Earth's record holder is somewhere in Russia and would cover many many years. Earth is relatively good at storing the sun's energy and releasing it over time through vegetation, the oceans, and the atmosphere. Mars' atmosphere is more rich in carbon dioxide than earth and would be a better insulator than Earth's if there density and thickness were closer aligned, but without that thickness its a case of easy come easy go. </p>
<p>Again from what I understand is that everything we think we know about Mars' heat flow is based off what we have figured out from what we've learnt on Earth. People have then taken the little we know or have estimated about various aspects of Mars and plugged in numbers into various mathematical models and give the results the benefit of the doubt if they seem to line up with different estimates, theories, or data from probes. The theoretical models should all be the same but Mars is also a different planet with it's own place in the universe. Massive dust storms that last weeks, greater vulnerability to solar winds, distance to the sun, large gas releases, and the poles seem to greatly influence on the atmosphere. There's a lot to learn about the specifics and I'm sure someday we will find something we struggle to explain for a while, but for know I think we have a good grasp on the generalities of Mars' external temperature and atmosphere. </p>
<p>I probably got something wrong so don't take my word for Gospel but I'm hoping that provided some insight. </p></div>		</li>
