<p>First, get a basketball, and give it a good underhand huck like you were bowling with it. The basketball obviously is designed to have a surface that provides friction, and it's likely the court you're doing this on provides a measure of friction too. As soon as it contacts the surface, it begins spinning.</p>
<p>Now, go bowling. The bowling ball itself is meant to not have a whole lot of friction, and the lanes are well oiled. Since there is low friction, you'll notice that for a while as the ball travels down the lane, it will appear to be gliding across rather than rolling across the lane surface (provided you gave it a good straight throw without applying spin). As it gets further down the lane, it begins to get a noticeable spin in the direction the ball is traveling.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is because bowling lanes are not oiled at the end. They're 60 feet long and only the first 38 feet is oiled. The ball will slide down the oil without rolling significantly, then will quickly start to roll when it hits the dry part of the lane. This is crucial to the game, as a good bowler will spin the ball to the left or right as they release it but throw it slightly in the other direction, then the ball will turn in the direction it was spun when it reaches the dry part of the lane, ideally hitting the pins at the right angle to get a strike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ex PBA (Professional Bowlers Association) member here. Both of the above comments are misleading. Bowling lanes are oiled in numerous different &quot;patterns&quot;. They aren't always dry at the end either, as when there has been a lot of use on them, the oil gets carried down the lane, possibly all the way to the pin deck where the pins are. And bowling balls ARE designed with varying degrees of friction on purpose. You want a &quot;smoother&quot; ball for a &quot;dryer&quot; lane condition, and a ball with more friction for a freshly oiled condition. The latter balls can be thought of as having a surface composition that will do something like a &quot;rain&quot; tire vs a &quot;slick&quot; tire on a wet road surface. It will allow the ball to track through the heavier oil condition while dispersing the oil somewhat (like a rain tire disperses the water through the treads) to get better traction in the oil. The above 2 reasons are why competitive bowlers will usually own 3 or 4 different balls of varying surface compositions for various lanes oiling patterns and amounts of oil on them. When I was competing in PBA events I took a minimum of SIX different balls with me. Many other competitors had as many as twelve. And during the course of an 8 game session, it wasn't uncommon to end up using 4 or more of those balls as the lane conditions changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, some custom balls have an uneven weight distribution which also helps with the curve at the end. </p>
<p>Here's a fun fact about the oil. Over time during a tourney, the continuous repetitions of the balls rolling down the lane slowly redistributes the oil. So as time passes the bowlers have to start making slight adjustments to their style, to account for this. What this means is that left handed bowlers have a small advantage, because the left side of the lane is getting less traffic, which means that the oil gets displaced at a slower rate, so they don't have to adjust their form as much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, how do you get the bowling ball to stop gliding? Nobody ever taught me how to bowl, and just doing the things other people did back when I was younger I could tell I was doing it wrong when the ball just seemed to slide the entire length without rolling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the ball will glide across the surface of the oil. this cannot be prevented. if you impart spin on the  ball, you will see the ball rotating, but it will continue to glide in the direction that you released the ball. the rotation will only come into play once the ball reaches the dry end of the lane, where friction takes over and the ball will begin to roll. once the ball rolls, it will attempt to right itself, and this action is what causes the ball to hook. House bowling balls are often not only symmetrical, but have center of mass in the center of the ball, so they are designed not to hook much at all, even if you put rotation on the ball. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But for a sphere of uniform density and non-zero radius, /u/cadnoob's condition is satisfied. The contact with the slope is not directly below the centre of mass. Resolving the normal force in to horizontal and vertical components gives a vertical force offset from the centre of mass, which then seems to give a torque on the ball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this assume a ball that is radially symmetric with regard to mass, or does it not matter? Let's say the ball was significantly denser on one half. Would it spin in that case, or not?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The object with an unsymmetrical center of mass will experience rotation. If we imagine a sphere that is significantly denser on the right hand side falling down a slope going to the left, we can imagine a massless metal bar with a pivot point at the center of mass and its opposite end at the contact point of the object (just remember, this end of the bar will always remain at the contact point). Gravity is acting on the bar's pivot point so it will not come into play. The normal force, however, will push against our imaginary bar causing the object to rotate. It will continue to rotate until the normal force is pushing parallel against the bar. <a href="http://imgur.com/GOA7P2P" target="_blank">Diagram</a></p>
<p>The object in this instance will actually oscillate back and forth because at the moment where the normal force is parallel to our imaginary bar, there is no net torque. However we actually have angular momentum that will cause the object to rotate past this point. The angular momentum will eventually lessen as the normal force again begins to pull on our imaginary bar, now in the opposite direction that the object is rotating. It will be a constant tug of war against the angular kinetic energy and the potential energy as the center of mass swings back and forth. This will continue into infinity if there is no friction in the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But doesn't this imply that a ball of uniform mass would also experience rotation over a long-enough timeline?</p>
<p>I suppose I'm just playing with imaginary setups, but let's say that the setup was a theoretically infinitely long hill, looping around a planet of arbitrary size.</p>
<p>The &quot;sides&quot; (&quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot;) of the sphere would experience microscopic differences in gravity due to their differing distance from the center of the mass (somewhere in the center of the planet).</p>
<p>Wouldn't this cause the ball to eventually spin?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, gravity acts on all points of mass, and if the mass is sufficiently distributed, you experience gravity gradients.</p></div>		</li>
