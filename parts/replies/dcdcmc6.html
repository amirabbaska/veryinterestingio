			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine an example with no foo &amp; bars, but instead some convenient naming. Say you're looking for &quot;how to add a delay feature in ruby&quot; </p>
<p>You could read somewhere that it's just</p>
<pre><code>delay.start
sleep(5)
delay.end</code></pre>
<p>Some may get confused -- why am I getting errors with this code, such as &quot;delay is not defined&quot;? </p>
<p>But if someone rewrites it to</p>
<pre><code>foo.start
sleep(5)
foo.end</code></pre>
<p>You suddenly see that &quot;sleep&quot; is doing all the work and foo is just there to show where should be the code before the delay and where should be the code after the delay. That's why we use foo and bar. </p></div>		</li>
