			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only partially true. Decay heat of a reactor is usually something around 7% of operational heat right after shut down. So a non-insignificant amount of heat gets generated by decay</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, but that 7% heat is not economically feasible for a power plant. So yes, there is heat there that isn't being used, but it does not make sense to operate a 1000MW facility at 70MW. In that sense, it is not &quot;usable.&quot; A mundane analogy is that of a campfire. There is still plenty of chemical energy in the burnt charcoals leftover after burning wood. However, if the goal is a roaring fire, those coals are not &quot;usable.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand the critical mass increases as the activity drops. Couldn't the used rods just be used in a reactor that is designed to run at larger critical mass? Or are rods considered waste when the critical mass is practically infinity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, critical mass increases as activity drops. Whether used rods could be used depends on reactor design. There are a few families of heavy actinides: fissile, fissionable, and fertile. Fissile are the isotopes that readily fission with thermal (low energy) neutrons. Fissionable are the isotopes that fission when impacted by fast (high energy) or thermal neutrons; fissile implies fissionable, but fissionable does not imply fissile. Fertile are isotopes that absorb neutrons and then become fissile. Fissile isotopes are the fuel, they are what keeps the chain reaction going. If your fuel rods are extremely depleted in fissile isotopes, the critical mass will probably be infinite (meaning chain reaction is impossible). There are some next-generation reactor designs that &quot;recycle&quot; depleted fuel rods by placing them into high-flux reactors which will then cause the fertile isotopes in the depleted rods to absorb neutrons, producing fissile isotopes: more fuel.</p>
<p>So yes, in theory, the depleted rods could be used in another reactor, but it is not so simple as throwing more less-radioactive fuel into a bigger container. The fuel cycles of the two reactors must be carefully designed to work with each other. To my knowledge, no such reactor pairing exists other than on-paper reactor designs.</p>
<p>Little disclaimer: I'm a doctoral student in nuclear engineering, and my field of focus is nuclear security. I understand the basics of reactors and fuel cycles at the graduate level, but the more advanced topics of fuel recycling are outside my comfort zone so I didn't get into too much detail.</p></div>		</li>
