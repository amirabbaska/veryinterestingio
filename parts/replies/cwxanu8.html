			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are winners and losers in the debate of min wage hikes, just because in your example 2 people lose, and 1 person slightly wins doesn't mean this is how it works in the world. It's all about whether the gains of the winners offset the unemployment and higher costs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you accept the premise that a is going to lose his job whilst b gets a slight raise, then its more than likely going to have a net negative effect. Marginal increases in disposable income are met with proportionaly lower rates of expenditure. In contrast, when the min wage is not raised and a keeps his job, low income individuals will tend to spend a greater proportion of their income (food, clothing, shelter etc). This gap is exhacerbated by the multiplier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make it sound like the minimum wage causes costs to rise.  Costs go up anyway.  The federal minimum wage has been stagnant since 2007, but a dollar today is still worth less than it was than.  Everything is more expensive than it was in 2007.  The least you can do is keep the minimum wage rising so that it doesn't become less valuable over time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>however the dynamics of the situation do dictate that (if everything is a zero sum game) person b's raise will be worth proportionally more than they were making before, even if you do normalize for increased costs of living.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Price goes up too. And some people will now feel that they can afford pricier alternatives. Wages won't have much effect on market share </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other things that people have been pointing out, another thing that you missed is that the job market is not static.  Teenagers are entering the job market every day - how in the hell is someone who is 15 years old going to be able to get a job at $15/hour?  My first job was bagging groceries - no way in hell the employer could have afforded to pay me $15/hr to do that. The minimum wage acts as a barrier to entry to the job market for young people.  Once you have the minimum wage job, you can work your way up from there.  Raising the minimum wage makes this much, much more difficult. </p></div>		</li>
