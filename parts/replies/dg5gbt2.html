			<div class="markdown"><p>I think if you dropped a sheet of diamond of an equivalent size to a sheet of alinium, it would make a bigger sound.</p>
<p>Having said that, maybe because the aluminium is wobblier it would do a sort of drum effect where it wobbled and made subsequent air shakiness. I think overall the sheet of aluminium would make more <em>total</em> noise but the diamond would make more <em>initial</em> noise.</p>
<p>Alas, I don't have a sheet of aluminium to do a comparative test with at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true. It's better if it has a <em>little</em> give to it, so it can vibrate. A diamond is so rigid it won't even vibrate. But something like metal will, yknow? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well weight is how hard gravity pushes on something, so if it weighs more or has more mass it will go down harder (Force = Mass x Acceleration). That mean more force which will have to escape into the air making more vibrations making it louder as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of energy, you're converting gravitational potential into sound (maybe a little deformation and heat in the case of the tin lid). Heavier things have more gravitational potential (m<em>g</em>h is proportional to mass with constant gravity and height). Additionally, the easier deformation of paper means what little energy it has is transmitted to sound over a longer time period because it's first absorbed in deforming the paper then released as the paper sheet settles to the (literally) ground state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newton's second law states:
F=ma (Force equals mass times acceleration). </p>
<p>a is constant (for our purposes) on earth at 9.8m/s/s</p>
<p>Therefore as m (weight) increases so to will F (force). </p>
<p>If an impact occurs at greater force, there will be more energy that needs to be dissipated, and hence more sound energy (noise) produced. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean think about it, drop a stack of 500 pages of paper and it's gonna make a much louder noise than 1 piece of paper. </p></div>		</li>
