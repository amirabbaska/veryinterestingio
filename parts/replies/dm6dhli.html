			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gone hunting with friends (more just &quot;walking through the forest on a nice day&quot; since it was more of a recon than a hunt) and as a noob I thought the camo was a bit ridiculous - until my friend (who goes hunting more regularly) ran ahead about 5 metres - and I lost sight of him. I could hear him, and found him again easily enough (looking for bright orange), but it's amazing what camo can do to break up the shape of a human and trick you into thinking it's just more branches/bushes moving ahead of you. Plus, if you're moving at the same time, it's even harder to spot someone camouflaged because you're effectively looking for a mish mash of browns and greys in amongst a mish mash of browns and greys.</p>
<p>What <em>does</em> seem pointless is going all out on camo gear and then taking no precautions to obscure/mask your scent, or minimise noise - our intentions were more to check out a new area of the forest for markings or tracks than catch anything, but we really had no chance of seeing any actual game anyway, since we were too smelly and too loud moving around to really have a chance of catching dinner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was hunting with my dad as a kid, around 11 or so, he made me wear this big puffy orange jacket that looked like the michelin man and trump had a baby. We got out into the woods around 4am and sat in silence for hours. Around 11 or so we broke out lunch and were talking, my father was asking if I wanted his other poptart, but froze mid-sentence and told me not to move. As we were joking and eating a doe had snuck up on us along the trail below and was just staring at me. She was casually eating and would look up and stare at me between nibbles. My father then perched his .50 cal rifle on my shoulder and used me as a stand. Then I was deaf for about 20 minutes, because black-powder muzzle loaders are loud as fuck, especially when fired next to your head. So for all the sneaking into the woods and his camo and us being quiet for hours, we ended up getting a deer while being loud and moving around and her just staring at me like, &quot;wtf?! is that thing?&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people underestimate camouflage because those who have never been out in the field or forest among people wearing it have only seen camo in well lit urban areas and in places where the camo obviously wouldn't work. Even looking at a picture of someone in camo in the woods, it's very easy to see them because they are the subject of the picture and are framed as such. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to spend a lot of time in the woods with my dog on long hikes, we'd go out for most of the day and we've come across too many deer to count, and we weren't silent in the least and I was always wearing some form of old spice deodorant, deer aren't as smart, alert, or elusive as most people believe them to be. Most of the time they would notice us probably a good 40 feet away but we always saw them before or at the same time they noticed us, and we've even snuck up on them a few times by complete accident. hell I've had two deer literally jump over my head because they were running down the same trail as us and we nearly collided by accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cohen found that deer see blue colors best and red colors the worst. Deer can also see greens, yellows and UV light, but they can't differentiate color shades to that extent that humans can.</p>
<p>What this means to a hunter is that you should avoid wearing anything blue. You should also avoid wearing camouflage with a lot of white, because white reflects all colors, including blue. And because deer can't perceive color shades very well, a hunter wearing camouflage containing many subtle shades of green and/or brown looks just like one big blob to deer. Instead, wear camouflage that breaks up your outline and move as little as possible to avoid being busted.</p>
<p>That's from outdoorlife.com, so basically orange is a color that's very bright and visible to us but not to them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good camouflage doesn't rely on color to hide you.  What it does is break up your silhouette, making you look less like a human and more like something... not human.  It basically confuses the brain since your brain overly relies on &quot;filling the gaps&quot; of what you see, instead of actually &quot;rendering&quot; what your eyes see.  Camo interferes with that function, which as far as we can tell is also present in most animals.</p>
<p>That said, all camo only works in certain environments and about 90% of hunters use it improperly.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard a long time ago that even a plaid pattern could be used as camouflage from game animals because the checking pattern breaks up your silhouette.  Is this true?  It was told to me by my high school French teacher like 15 years ago and I hadn't thought about it until just now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would wear camo while playing paintball with friends in the woods behind my parents house and it wasn't even good camo, just some odds and ends fatigues picked up at an army navy surplus. I was still practically invisible to my friends until they were within 7-8 ft. Camo is amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that is an incredibly incorrect and misleading answer. deer can see color, but are believed to be mostly red-green color blind.</p>
<p>so a bright orange outfit will end up looking neutral grey. </p>
<p>although the most important thing to remember is that deer do not have the natural UV filters that humans do which allows them to see UV light. which means your camo clothing will always have a distinct glow that deer CAN see.</p>
<p>it will be slightly harder to spot you, but don't ever believe you're anywhere near 100% hidden</p></div>		</li>

Are a lot of people hunting while intoxicated or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people wear Carhartt brand clothing or similar while in the woods. That clothing is about the same color as a deer. You can also add that a branch moving from a person can look an awful lot like a deer antler. It's foolish of a person to go in the woods during deer season like that, but not everyone is a hunter and knows when deer season is.</p>
<p>Also, hunters actually carry antlers and calls to trick deer to coming to them. Sometimes it tricks people.</p>
<p>There are a ton of variables that could be used as an excuse, but ultimately the shooter should be making 100% sure of what they are shooting at.</p></div>		</li>
