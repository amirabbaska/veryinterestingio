			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I was crying the night before I posted this because I missed a Tom Segura show that I have had tickers to for over a month! I know some people probably think its a dumb thing to cry over, but He's my favorite comedian, and it would have been my first time ever going to any stand up show.<br />
Not to mention I'm a new mom and was so looking forward to this date night out. I still can't believe it :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being disappointed and sad about missing out on something that you've been looking forward to for a long time is'nt wierd at all. I'd say it's perfectly normal and quite relatable for most people. </p></div>		</li>
