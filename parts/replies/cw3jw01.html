			<div class="markdown"><p>The largest thing holding back upgrades to the scrubbers at FirstEnergy plants is NIMBY. I can't speak for the rest of the industry, but they've been trying to upgrade systems for decades and they aren't allowed to. When I worked there 7 years ago (air cleaning systems group, engineering) we had an investigation done, and it was estimated energy costs would be reduced by 50-75% if they were allowed to upgrade current plants and rebuild old ones. The one I worked at was scheduled to be torn down and rebuilt around 1980, but is still their largest coal plant today because of uninformed protestors interfering. It's pretty much like anti-vaccers in the sense of how they've managed to confuse significant portions of the country so that they fight against everyone's best interest.</p></div>		</li>
