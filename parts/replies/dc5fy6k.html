			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh wow. I see. So some people can do it while others can't. This whole time I thought I was just bad at explaining it. I just get funny looks. I tried looking up what this is called but what am I suppose to looking up? Noise I hear when I move my inner mouth in a funny way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. It's a great little tube, without it we wouldn't be able to go diving as we'd be unable to equalise the pressure in our ears as we descend.</p>
<p>You can use it by holding your nose with your thumb and forefinger and very gently breathing out through your nose, you'll feel your ear drums expand.  </p></div>		</li>
