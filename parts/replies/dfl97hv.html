			<div class="markdown"><p>And that they were scavengers in general, not crazy killing machines like we think. If they fell over they wouldn't have been able to get up so running and chasing things seems out of the question. But a big ole dead herbivore would work fine. But who knows, that's just some shit I saw years ago on a channel that now plays shows about truck drivers or something</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no paleontologist, but I've had an interest in it since I was a kid. From what I understand, most of the herbivores that would've been suitable prey items for ole' Rexy probably weren't especially quick creatures themselves. Even if they could outrun a tyrannosaurus, it would've been able to track them without any problem. If you've ever seen a wolf run down an elk on rough terrain, that's what I'm envisioning. The wolf isn't fast enough to outright catch the elk on such ground, but wolves have far better stamina. Hence, it's able to stay close enough to eventually run the deer down to exhaustion. Even if the wolf loses the elk, it can still track it with its nose. I imagine Rexy may have employed a similar tactic. Alternatively, I've heard a theory that tyrannosaurs (and other large therapods) lived or at least hunted in groups. The idea is that the bulkier adults would lay in wait, while the quicker adolescents would chase prey into the ambush. We may never know how Tyrannosaurus got its meal, but I'm certain that it, just like almost any other carnivore, was some combination of a predator and a scavenger depending on the circumstances. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They now believe that the T-Rex was NOT a scavenger and actually hunted live prey. This is due to a recent discovery of another dinosaur fossil with imbedded T-Rex teeth that had healed.</p></div>		</li>
