			<div class="markdown"><p>Velocity is speed in a constant direction. Acceleration is change in velocity. Since any given point on the spinning wheel  is moving in an arc, not  a constant direction it's experiencing an acceleration. Force is defined as mass time acceleration. Since each point on the spinning wheel has both mass and acceleration there is a resulting force which acts on the wheel. The best explanation I could find is <a href="http://www.gyroscopes.org/behaviour.asp" target="_blank">here</a>. If your applied maths or physics isn't great you'll have to take a certain amount of all this on faith.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The troubling part about this is that gravity would quickly pull the disc down if all the momentum were in the same direction rather than angular.  If all the mass were travelling at the angular speed of the disk, it would still quickly fall.  So why is angular momentum stronger?</p>
<p>I think the fact that the disk is constantly spinning the mass around is crucial to understanding it.  So when gravity accelerates the falling side, that mass quickly spins to the other side and is used to pick the disk back up.  I think that is right but can't convince myself of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the reason the gyroscope spins around the finger explains the rest, the side that spins down gets a boost, pulling the gyroscope faster that direction, making it spin around the finger.</p>
