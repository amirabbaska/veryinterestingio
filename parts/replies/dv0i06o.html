			<div class="markdown"><p>I think dieing young still explains the difference though.</p>
<p>If I die cause I starved to death but also had stage 3 cancer, my cause of death is still starvation.  Cancer takes a while to kill, and probably slower than pathogens or failure to maintain homeostasis. </p></div>		</li>
