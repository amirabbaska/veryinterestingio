			<div class="markdown"><p>When the ball spins, the way the air moves around the ball is very predictable and regular (if you want jargon, that's laminar flow) since the effect of the spin curving the ball dominated everything. When it doesn't spin, the small random effects of irregularities in the ball (especially around the seams) dominate, making air move around the ball randomly (called turbulent flow), which in turn pushes the ball around erratically.</p>
<p>It's pretty much exactly the same with soccer and baseball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are difficult to throw consistently enough to find a balance between throwing strikes and the crazy knuckles that drop off and are often swung over. Pitchers who rely solely on the knuckleball have a high risk, high reward because if they make a mistake it is often going to be hit out of the park and very few knuckleball pitchers have a second or third pitch with the quality to beat good hitters; therefore, they have very little to fall back on if they are not throwing the ball well that particular day. </p>
<p>TL;DR It's difficult to do consistently enough to be more successful than traditional pitchers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most people can’t get nearly enough movement on the ball. It’s ridiculously difficult to learn how to throw one consistently. Also, if you don’t throw it right you’ll give the batter a nice 70 mph meatball over the plate with no movement</p></div>		</li>

<p>it is actually more pronounced in a baseball because of the ridges created by the stitching. modern soccer balls don't have protrusions and some new ones have tiny bumps to help with the aerodynamics</p>
<p>source: did a project on that for an aerodynamics course</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your descriptions of laminar and turbulent flow here are misleading. If you want a smooth predictable pathway for your ball through the air you want the immediate surface layer to be turbulent - this reduces the amount the amount of drag caused by air breaking away from the back of the object. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same principle for soccer and baseball. If the ball isn't spinning and reaches a certain minimum velocity, it creates what's called <a href="https://www.insidescience.org/news/unraveling-secrets-knuckleball" target="_blank">drag crisis</a>, where the wake behind the ball and the drag force on the ball decrease sharply. That decrease in the wake creates sideways forces on the ball, which make it curve. The exact change to the wake is unpredictable, which is why knuckleballs are so erratic. The effect is bigger the closer the ball is to a perfect sphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lack of spin leads to greater turbulence on the back side. Turbulence is essentially random and chaotic changes in airflow and thus pressure. These random changes in pressure cause the ball to move erratically.</p>
<p>This is why guns with rifled barrels are much more accurate than non-rifled.</p></div>		</li>
