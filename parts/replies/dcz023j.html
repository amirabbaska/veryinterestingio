			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the fact that tv cable doesn't need to be 2-way.<br />
Internet does. And for every packet of streamed video, your computer has to acknowledge it (and if it doesn't happen by the time the buffer of transferred packets has been used up, then it has to pause the video to wait for more packets).<br />
If tv cable missed a packet (or whatever they use), the picture scrambles for a bit, then resumes after the lost packets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issues you mentioned are some of the reasons real live feeds use UDP (no acknowledgements) instead of TCP. But a lot of 'live' streaming is actually delayed and buffered by ~10+ seconds and uses TCP, e.g. twitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good post, but it ignores things like AT&amp;T Uverse where your TV signal comes over the same phone line as your internet service, and is basically just coming from the internet. Uverse set top boxes just connect to your home network (even if they're connected to coax cable - the Uverse router has an IP-over-coax thing in it).</p>
<p>In this case, there are a couple of things that happen.</p>
<p>Say you're paying AT&amp;T for 18 mbps internet. AT&amp;T maintains a connection to your router that's, say, 90 mbps, and they can use the full bandwidth for Uverse TV signals, but they limit you to the 18 mbps you pay for when you're doing general internet stuff.</p>
<p>Also, on the home network side, Uverse routers and the switches they install when the routers don't have enough ports have a system in place that gives Uverse TV signals higher priority through your home network than your general internet traffic (it's called IGMPv3). I wouldn't be surprised if they do something similar on the infrastructure level as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Upvotes for both tagged and Dave on this.  Question for you guys, are there any basics for those of us with streaming problems that we can do to improve our streaming experience?  I'm thinking things like, &quot;Would connecting my TV directly to the cable modem or router make it faster?&quot;  and &quot;If I'm casting from my chromebook to my Samsung tv through an HDMI cable, how come some channels on my comcast xfinity cast more smoothly than others? (like, BeinSports in english casts a million times more smoothly than BeinSports Espanol, they are two different channels with different programming, but both from Comcast...)</p>
<p>thanks in advance!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Connecting with as few hops as possible (ethernet cable straight to your router/model) removes as much potential for a problem, but likely won't change the bandwidth unless any of the boxes between the cables, or the cables themselves are of low quality (and they'd have to be really low quality these days)</p>
<p>The reason certain channels are worse than others are, is either because each of the channels has its own distributed supply server network, or because one of the channels that has been deemed less worth the bandwidth for its viewership (similar to NetNeutrality, within a company scale), likely because it doesn't pay as much per viewer.<br />
It can be neither of those though, as you're talking a very complicated system to supply thousands of people with a channel individually tailored to them (even watching live they're sending several different versions to account for different qualities and delays), so it can just be bad luck or bad code, such that a refresh of the browser page, clearing of the cookies or a restart of the streaming device can fix it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A wired connection is always going to be better. If it's possible to wire something directly to your router/gateway, I would recommend it. That said, nothing beats the convenience of WiFi, and you can't get around having many devices on your WiFi network. In my own (admittedly anecdotal) experience as a professional and a user, making sure you've got as many things on Wireless AC as possible will help. It seems much more robust out to the fringes of its range, and as it's also only on the 5ghz band, it is much less susceptible to the interference prevalent in the 2.4ghz band. </p></div>		</li>
