			<div class="markdown"><p>OK but consider this. </p>
<p>If I were to wear a weighted vest around all day, by the end of the day I'd be stronger for having done so. That gained strength would be due to the added resistance throughout my day from the weight added. </p>
<p>BUT, if I were to added that weighted vest prior to doing my workouts, it would make them all harder, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but they have more mass than you. It's not just how strong your muscles are but also how much you have.</p>
<p>So let's do some math.</p>
<p>You're 150 with 8-10% body fat if you're <del>reasonably fit</del> in amazing shape. So 150 - 15 = 135 lbs of muscle not including bones and organs because that makes the math easier.</p>
<p>This other guy is 250 with let's say 30% body fat that's 250 - 75 = 175 lbs of muscle not including bones and organs because that's easier.</p>
<p>So this guy who is out of shape still has about 30% more muscle than you.</p>

<p>Would bench press be harder with a weighted vest?  Not really.  1 arm curls? Again not really. </p>
<p>Would pull-ups?  God yes. Do you picture out of shape fat people doing more pull-ups than out of shape thin people?  I don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strength is (almost solely) determined by muscle size, i.e. the cross section of the muscle. When people are larger, this means more fat but usually means larger muscles as well. The translation to strength is almost direct. This is why it's hard to get (much) stronger without gaining mass. Sure you receive strength increases from nerve adaptions and muscle fiber changes when you lift, but the real strength gains come from size gains.</p>
<p>This explains why larger people who've never trained are usually stronger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but the explanation is only part of the story.</p>
<p>People who are fat, by definition, have had more of a caloric surplus than a deficit. To simplify massively a number of processes (many of which are not well understood) the body is simply more willing to invest resources in increasing muscle mass when there's a caloric surplus. Combine that with the extra resistance a heavier person undergoes in daily activities, you need to be very sedentary along with overeating to not grow muscle.</p>
<p>Just to touch on it, one of those factors is that adipose tissue is not dead weight, it's involved (obviously) in energy regulation and (less obviously) hormone regulation. Somebody with excess fat has, by definition, spare energy, meaning the body &quot;doesn't mind&quot; spending some incoming nutrition on building muscle. Another part is the relation insulin has to both muscle growth and fat storage (as a kind of indicator, insulin, aka 'slin, is a very common part of the stack of injections used in exogenous-chemical aided body building).</p>
<p>This last is more speculative, but we know there's a genetic component to being overweight (in the form of appetite and satiety responses). The modern diet and lifestyle is making obesity more common than ever, but prior to the industrial age, there were obviously plenty of counterexamples, but genetic synergies meant that on average,having the DNA correlated to being overweight meant you probably also had the DNA to have a bigger, heavier frame.</p></div>		</li>
