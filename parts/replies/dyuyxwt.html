			<div class="markdown"><p>And then what, you need more? I don't see why one would, but here,</p>
<p>CIA agents from the previously unmentioned Canadian Arctic Time Travel Beuro arrived on the scene, and, upon their visual inspection of the debris, or total lack thereof, they activated their alert device that, after a reasonable length countdown, alerts all dimensions of time and space of the severity and high-interest / danger of this point in the greater continuum, or, it flags it as boring, something a lot less like a fissure broken in the fabric of reality, surrounding this, scattered pieces of of a refrigerator exploded with such velocities as to mmm, reshape in detail and form, every exposed face of the planet, and something more like, just some sounds of well-insulated ice suddenly being heat by hot gasses <em>yawn</em>, sorry about that.</p>
<p>The agents asked the aliens from the other, other Earth to step out of the way of Elvis, Zombie Mariah Carrey, mmm, so that the Spice Girls could close the dimension that may or may have had open, or at least to shut up about it, already.</p>
<p>And then the agent whose body was so long, he had to stand in australia, so that his short neck-arms could reach the button in the U.S. backyard, pressed the button. Before the countdown began, the man was suddenly standing there beside the other agents, and before he stepped into the police car, he handed me a note. The note said he could explain how he just did that, after the satisfying conclusion of the result of the countdown, itself, really quite satisfying.</p>
<p>And then, after an appropriate amount of suspense, the countdown began.</p>
<p>10...  9... 8... 7... and then someone thought they heard another fridge sound, possibly ice melting? 6... 5... 4... well, I hope this clears it of up for you.</p></div>		</li>
