			<div class="markdown"><p>From the Hawaii Tourism Authority:</p>
<p>&quot;Many believe that lava is the kinolau, or physical embodiment, of volcano goddess Pele. Therefore, poking lava with sticks or throwing/placing things in or above the lava flow to watch them burn is considered not only culturally disrespectful, but it is also against federal law.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
