			<div class="markdown"><p>The specific benefit of fluoride is that it makes your teeth more resistant to cavities. I have a fluoride overdose, just enough that my teeth are mildly discoloured but extremely cavity resistant. If I'd had even higher dosages, my teeth would have become soft apparently (googling to verify this is difficult since everything comes up with acute fluoride overdose).</p>
<p>Interestingly, there was some objection in the 90s where I live over water fluoridation because of this. It doesn't seem to have gained traction though, and obviously the benefits of fluoridation are well worth the occasional issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My 2 kids (4 &amp; 2 years old) already have signs of too much fluoride (tooth discoloration, pitting) from the amount they put in the water here. Apparently, it's a common problem in this area and the dentist instructed to cut way back on the fluoride we use at home. I cut out mouthwash and use a fluoride-free paste once a day. He said if we don't, my kids will be teenagers with brown teeth. </p>
<p>I'm against fluoride water. I think at this point, toothpaste is cheap, easily accessible and most parents are aware of the importance of brushing their kids teeth. But mostly, you should be able to choose if you want to drink fluoride or not. We'll be getting a filter so our drinking water won't contain as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you have as much of an issue with it if your local water management wasn't being stupid?</p>
<p>It's well managed here, we don't have any problems like that at all. My fluoride overdose was thought to come from me swallowing toothpaste as a kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Swallowing toothpaste most likely, we also had fluoridated water but it wasn't common in our area so the amounts were properly controlled. Fluoride overdose was diagnosed via dentist due to the unique discolouration pattern it produces (yellowy brown discolourations with white spots).</p>
<p>I'm really lucky though, only my molars have the discolouration. So I have essentially impervious to cavity teeth with no visible discolouration. Still need to take care of my gums.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium Laurel Sulfate tends to cause canker sores more than fluoride I believe. It did for me anyway. I originally wrote off the SLS/canker sore link as paranoid hippie nonsense but it's true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always had problems with canker sores as well. Switching to Sensodyne, which doesn't contain SLS, has pretty much eliminated them. I still get one occasionally if I've been really stressed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SLS free toothpaste (still with fluoride) and alcohol-free mouthwash mixed with hydrogen peroxide have done the trick for me. My ulcers tend to appear after I eat anything acidic, but if I rinse my mouth out with the mouthwash right after eating that generally stops them before they develop. </p></div>		</li>
