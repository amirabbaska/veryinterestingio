			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like a statistical correlation. Kind of like how if you know how long a blue whale is, you can guess it’s weight because you’ve measured the length and weight of thousands of other blue whales and have noticed a correlation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that in this case, wouldn't it be more like we know all of this data about blue whales, so we're trying to apply it to a previously-unknown species we just found, and hoping that it scales roughly the same?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but how strong of a correlation?  Are the odds of them being right 10% or 99.9%?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read the abstract and if I understand it correctly, they were able to infer things with better accuracy by taking note of the frequency of the aurora generated radio signals as well as determine the period of rotation by tracking the eclipsing of those signals as the planet rotates. Apparently different masses and heat profiles generate different frequency radio waves. </p>
<p>It's just mad clever to me how they figured that was a potential way to get measurements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know:</p>
<ul>
<li>how big it is  </li>
<li>how old it is  </li>
<li>what it's made of</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you have observed many objects with those same properties (essentially the same objects, but with varying sizes, orbiting stars). Because those are orbiting stars, you know their mass, which allows you to interpolate this object's mass. </p>
<p>It's not completely precise, but it is accurate.</p></div>		</li>
