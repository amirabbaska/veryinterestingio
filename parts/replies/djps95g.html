			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently made a drastic change to my diet and eating 90% veggies now.  I am amazed at how my movements have changed.  They doubled in frequency, the size increased, there is virtually nothing to wipe, there is less odor, and it just slides out in 30 seconds as one continuous piece.  So bizarre for me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not even sure if I should be proud of knowing this or just sort of quietly look around hoping no one thinks I have a weird fetish! I don't, but I wikiwalked the other day about why gum gives you diarrhea in large quantities. I'm quitting smoking and a friend mentioned not to chew 'too much gum'. Turns out I learned a lot about pooping in the process, haha.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hey good luck with quitting. I stopped over four years ago, feels great. Whatever your method, remember what made you want to stop. People quit for varying reasons and they're all good. You can (and will!) do it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds legitimate, but i have a question.</p>
<p>I'm eating as high a fiber diet as possible. Drink only water and tea(about 3 liters a day) and i still have to wipe about 6/10times before it's clean.</p>
<p>I only eat whole wheat of anything (pasta, bread, rice(you know the rice with the shell still over it idk how you call it in english))</p>
<p>Eat lots of raw nuts, fruit and vegetables</p>
<p>Keep my carb intake as low as possible</p>
<p>I almost never eat sugar, snacks and junkfood aswell</p>
<p>Do you have any idea what could be the cause?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry this took so long!</p>
<p>That said, I'd really suggest you assess your stool <em>quality</em> in this scenario. Are you dealing with really hard, lumpy stools (too little moisture in it, or too much of something else), or really soft mushy stools(too MUCH moisture in it)? Are they a good color ('warm brown' as opposed to pale, or very dark)? </p>
<p>How much tea vs water are you drinking? Recent studies have found that a theophylline compound in tea might contribute to constipation or bowel movement issues. Also remember that many teas contain caffeine and it is not recommended you consume more than 300mg of caffeine in a day. Caffeine can also have an impact on digestion. If you're drinking 2 liters of tea, and one liter of water, this could cause issues (particularly if it's a 'strong' tea with lots of caffeine and theophylline). </p>
<p>The theophylline compound causes the body to extract MORE water than necessary from the bowels during digestion. This can lead to hard or lumpier stools. Caffeine is a stimulant that forces the bowels to move waste faster, and diuretic (you pass more water), and large quantities can cause the bowels to not extract enough water, leading to softer, mushier stools. </p>
<p>An adult human male, under 50, should consume 38g of fiber. An adult human female under 50 should consume 25g of fiber. Over 50, these numbers are 30g for males, and 21g for females. There are no definitive studies that I can find on the exact ratio, but most recommend 1/4th of your fiber be soluble. </p>
<p>1 cup of vegetarian baked beans, for example, contains 12 grams of fiber, but only 4.8 grams of that is soluble. You'd need (if you're a male) to eat 6-8 cups of those beans to get the correct amount of fiber. (And given the sugars often in baked beans, that's a lot of sugar!)</p>
<p>It might interest you to note that just because there is 'fiber' in a food, does not mean it's soluble to your body. Not all fiber is created equally. There is soluble, and insoluble fiber. Lots of raw (and cooked) vegetables have insoluble fiber. These include, but are not necessarily limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Greens (spinach, lettuce, kale, mesclun, collards, arugula, watercress, etc.)</li>
<li>Whole peas, snow peas, snap peas, pea pods</li>
<li>Green beans</li>
<li>Kernel corn</li>
<li>Bell peppers</li>
<li>Eggplant</li>
<li>Celery</li>
<li>Onions, shallots, leeks, scallions, garlic</li>
<li>Cabbage, bok choy, Brussels sprouts</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Cauliflower</li>
</ul>
<p>A chart of vegetables with their total fiber content, and breakdown between soluble and insoluble can be found <a href="https://www.prebiotin.com/prebiotin-academy/fiber-content-of-foods/" target="_blank">here</a>! It lists raw for some vegetables, and cooked as well, so that's helpful. </p>
<p>Try to remember that all fruits, and a lot of vegetables, contain <strong><em>sugar</em></strong>. If you're eating a lot of fruit and a lot of sweeter vegetables, this could, coupled with high water/tea intake, contribute. The sugars will typically aggravate the bowels, causing them to release electrolytes and water into the stools, softening them and making them harder to clean up.</p>
<p>On a more severe note, stool quality and the like can be influenced by internal problems. There are issues like fecal incontinence which can be a weakened anus, and this can result in 'messy' wiping (or other problems). A friend who has Irritable Bowel Syndrome (and a friend with crohns) both suffer 'irregular' stool quality at times. </p>
<p><strong><em>I am not a doctor and can not give advice. If your stool quality and wiping situation are concerning to you, there are walk-in clinics one can go to (or a doctor if you have one). If you're healthy, happy, and the only problem is that you're wiping more than you'd like, it's probably safe to play with your diet.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Try cooking more vegetables and eating more proteins like fish and meat. Cut back on the tea, and try juices in addition to the waters. This is what I would do if I wasn't concerned, but mildly bothered by my stool quality, and the quality was not worrisome, just an annoyance.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>As per a poster below, that is total fiber, not soluble fiber. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My tea water ratio is about 1 liter of tea to 2 liters of water, but i do make <em>really</em> strong tea. Because tea makes me feel real good, i sometimes use up to 4 teabags a cup, let it sit for 10minutes and then squeeze them out. Now this is not black tea, mostly herbal and sometimes green.</p>
<p>I also drink strong black coffee every day (double/triple espresso)</p>
<p>I think my problem lies there. Thanks a lot!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>A male human should eat 30-38 grams of soluble fiber a day.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's ~30 g <strong>total</strong> fiber per day. That would be an insane amount of soluble fiber since it's more scarce. Guidelines recommend 25% (~8 g) of the fiber be soluble (thus 75%, 22 g insoluble). </p>
<p>My impression is that fiber in general keeps everything moving, while it's the soluble fiber that makes your stool behave properly (preventing wipes). Psyllium husk is the best source for soluble fiber since it's not bundled with a substantial amount of calories like beans, oatmeal, apples, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is something /u/Altyrmadiken sort of hinted at, and I'll bring it to the forefront: it's about the balance of insoluble and soluble fiber. Not too many foods have soluble fiber, and you probably aren't eating enough of 'em. A couple foods result in good BMs: apples &amp; oatmeal - both have a good amount of soluble fiber, but they come with a ton of carbs, which you may want to avoid. With that in mind, the ultimate is <strong>psyllium husk</strong>. It's awesome since it is a near-zero-calorie source of fiber that's properly balanced to make your stool a great consistency.  </p>
<p>More detail: ever since I needed to cure some weird IBS issues, I have taken psyllium husk daily and most BMs are followed by one clean wipe. Aim for at least 5 g of husk fiber per day, ramp up to 10 g if you like. Stay hydrated since it tends to soak up water. The easiest fix is to take <a href="http://amzn.com/B0013OW2KS" target="_blank">capsules</a>, though you'll need to take at least a half dozen of them. You can also blend the <a href="http://amzn.com/B000N7DP6G" target="_blank">actual husks</a> into a smoothie as an ingredient. Psyllium husk is also the active ingredient in Metamucil, which is expensive and has a bunch of sugar or sweetener in it. I've never used that product, but I imagine it's convenient. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a good link <a href="https://www.prebiotin.com/prebiotin-academy/fiber-content-of-foods/" target="_blank">here</a> for a list of foods with their soluble and insoluble fiber amounts. It's listed in one of my higher posts, but it's hidden at the bottom almost. </p>
<p>While I'm usually opposed to the whole 'take a pill' for things you can do yourself, fiber is one of those ones that's just so convenient. I second psyllium husk, as both my parents take it for their own reasons, and it works quite well. </p></div>		</li>
