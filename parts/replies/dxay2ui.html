			<div class="markdown"><p>I also remember hearing somewhere that even though there’s great genetic diversity, there’s one clan in particular that continually produces world record breaking runners. So not so sure it’s the diversity, more like there’s a gene pool in Africa that produces insanely fast runners with great stamina. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That one tribe would be genetically diverse from all of the other people on the continent of Africa. It would be localised instead of random people across all of Africa being the worlds fastest runners. For example the countries with the worlds smallest and tallest people are right beside each other. They mean genetically diverse as a continent but there would be pockets of genetic traits on one side of the continent you wouldn't find on the other.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m trying to figure out which countries you’re referring to and coming up empty. </p>
<p>All the rankings I’m seeing have only European countries in the top 10 tallest and only Asian and South American countries in the shortest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jumping off top comment since I don't see this in the thread:</p>
<p>We went over some of the why in university - but it was essentially there was a genetic trait for extremely low foot weight (think long, thin low bone density feet) in certain areas, which is a small advantage every step in energy loss, but multiplied over the course of tens of thousands of strides was a huge efficiency boost. Watched a whole doc on it which is maybe on youtube. </p></div>		</li>
