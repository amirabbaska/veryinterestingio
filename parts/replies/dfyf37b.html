			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, from my experience, most large European cities have super efficient public transportation systems. This means that most people don't need to own a car due to the fact that they probably live within comfortable walking distance of a train/metro/tram station. Once they get to the closest stop to their destination, they hop off and walk the remaining distance.  I tend to walk 5-10 miles a day on average when I'm in Prague for work. </p>
<p>Meanwhile when I'm back in California I drive two minutes to the pub I hang out at because I'm a lazy fuckin yankee. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, European cities are much more friendly for public transport.  I remember dropping a ton of weight on a trip to the UK just because of how much walking we were doing everyday (at least 15 miles).  It was a great time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they like to call us fat, but their own rates are skyrocketing too.</p>
<p>In the UK the percentage of obese <strong>males</strong> is only like 2% less than in the States.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: forgot about brexit /s. Changed Euros to Brits.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the main difference, however, is <em>how big</em> some people get here in the US. I mean, a BMI of 30.5 is obese in either country. But those 450 pound guys count just the same as a 220 pounder.</p></div>		</li>
