			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not diabetic but used to show symptoms resulting from a sugar crash. I used to drink a litre of orange juice a day (I thought that was healthy), ate chocolate every day and pizza several times per week. My energy was always conking out on me and I'd feel weak and shake. Then I'd drink some Lucozade or eat a Mars bar. After that if I didn't eat proper food within an hour or so when it wore off I'd be a wreck and bad tempered one at that.</p>
<p>I can see how it's possible to completely screw up your systems and develop diabetes trying to fuel your body that way.</p>
<p>More than 10 years ago, in my late 20s, I mostly gave up sugar. I don't mean I never have anything that has sugar in it but I switched to water instead of juice, nuts instead of Mars bars, home made pizza using wholemeal pitta as a base and fresh ingredients with strong English Cheddar so I need way less and other healthier foods.</p>
<p>I have no trouble with my blood sugar levels and related energy since. Too much regularly consumed refined sugar is wrecking people's normal functioning.</p>
<p>I can now go hungry occasionally without any crash. I don't do it on purpose ever but if circumstances make it difficult to eat properly I don't go to shit.</p>
<p>*TL:DR Give up sugary things</p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't help that when I lie down in bed, I feel like the room gets 20 degrees warmer and falling asleep is near impossible. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Alcohol turns into sugar inside you. People who are horrid alcoholics are not only malnourished and lacking basic vitamins/nutrients, but their blood sugar is almost always way off.</p>
<p>Back in my heavy drinking days I would fall asleep at my desk at work all the time even though I wasn't <em>drunk</em>. It was just the crash...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems like no one really answered your question well. As a type 1 diabetic, I know my thing or two. When ever you eat carbohydrates, your body breaks down the polysaccharides into their monosaccharides, typically glucose. This glucose gets deposited in your blood stream. In a human with a functioning pancreas, the hormone insulin is secreted into the blood to take the sugar away to be used as energy or energy storage. With a non-diabetic person, there typically isn't too high of a blood sugar spike since your pancreas produces insulin as soon as it starts to break down the food. However, it can be a large enough temporary increase to make you feel groggy and experience high blood sugar symptoms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my father died it was sudden and due to a horrible accident.  In short there was no preparation, as where a long illness might give you time to process some of the grief.  When the news was delivered at the hospital I started uncontrollably heaving.  It was like I simply wasn't in control of that part of my body.  Not a feeling I would wish on anyone honestly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has seen someone suffer in a hospice bed for 6 months before finally kicking it, sudden is definitely better.</p>
<p>Edit-</p>
<p>Apparently people are triggered and think I'm dismissing some guy's experience.</p>
<p>I have experienced both - watching someone wither away into nothing for 6-12 months is excruciating. They're in constant physical and emotional pain and you cannot help them. You can only visit them everyday while you watch their skin sag, their eyes sink, and they slowly lose the ability to recognize you. And you cannot cry in front of them because they're the ones dying and not you. And the whole time you cannot bring yourself to start the mourning process because your loved one hasn't actually died yet and it feels extremely fucked up to start the letting go process before the sick person has actually let go.</p>
<p>OTOH, my FIL died of a heart attack on vacation. It was fucked up and traumatizing to deal with. But it was quicker.</p>
<p>The mourning process is the same, and it takes about the same amount of time. But when dealing with a slow and painful decline, the feeling of helplessness is dragged out and you never quite forget the trauma of watching someone who you used to view as strong suddenly become weak and smelly.  </p>
<p>You don't always get a nice Hollywood story of a slow decline where you can still talk to your loved one. Sometimes it's an accident that leaves them to die a slow and painful death in a hospital bed. </p>
<p>With a sudden death, your memory of them isn't tarnished by the smell of shit and death. </p>
<p>So to all those people who want to assume that I have no experience - fuck you. Maybe you think it's better because you don't visit them and change their diapers and give them sponge baths because the hospice workers can't be bothered to help a senior citizen avoid bed sores. A long drawn out death is a bigger burden on the living, if the living relatives feel a personal responsibility to care for their own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's not pretend like there aren't equally serious and different drawbacks to both. That's just not a very fair statement to make.</p>
<p><strong>With sudden loss:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You spend the rest of your life feeling like they/you were cheated. Especially if they're not elderly. You think every day about what might have been. No goodbyes, no acceptance. The funeral is <em>much</em> more difficult with a sudden passing, I find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You spend your life potentially unable to deal with the thing that caused their death properly. Car accident? Driving just got way more real and scary for a while. Suicide? Anyone else in your life gets a little wierd and you get scared about them doing it too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wife? Husband? Have kids? Now their life changes. Maybe financially, maybe just the family dynamic. A lot of people aren't prepared for/expecting to die, and neither are their families. Instead of &quot;getting affairs in order&quot;, the family is left in the wake of dealing with the beaurocratic and administrative hurdles of death <em>without</em> that person they may have relied on. Every call to the cable company, every benefit claim is torture.</p>
</li>
<li>on the bright side (and I think this is what you're getting at), their death was probably/hopefully relatively quick and painless, and  one had to care for them. also, you may escape with renewed purpose, better understanding the fleeting nature of life.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With a hospice/LTI death:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They're usually in constant pain, misery and humiliation. It's horrible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's hard to admit, but they're often a burden and stressor for you and your family. They're also possibly a point if contention for everyone involved regarding care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by the end, people in hospice care are often begging for or terrified of death.</p>
</li>
<li>On the bright side, you get some time to cope and adjust. You get to say goodbye, to treat a person how they've always deserved and are better for knowing what that feels like. Hopefully they were older, and you can say &quot;but look at the life they lived!&quot;. Want to hear that favorite story again? You probably have time.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not as simple as you make it out to be. I've had both, and they're both hard in their own way. It's more about your relationship and what their death means to you than the means of their passing, sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also witnessed a long drawn out deaths with a couple different grandparents.  Saying it's better for a quick death is naive if you haven't gone through it.  Neither is good but there is no such thing as a quick and simple death from my experience. For the record my dad fell off a ladder and landed on a steel fence post a little over a month ago.  I say that for context, not sympathy. </p>
<p>I have, in attempts to put a positive spin on the situation, told myself that he would rather have gone quickly and not ended up in a hospice situation but he was in his mid 60's and in pretty good health.  It's conceivable he would have lived another twenty years before that happened.  Also, while it might seem like a clean way to go the impact of a death like this being heaped on you all at once is a bear on the survivors.  My fathers death, as are many quick deaths, are a violent scene that likely happen at home and where a family member is likely to be around.  His death might have been quick but the inescapable presence of the place he died in the house you grew up in and your mother still lives is brutal.  Where you will likely never go back to the hospice center.</p>
<p>My parent's were very prepared when it came to finances, accountants, lawyers, etc but even then it is an unbelievable amount of work much of which has to be done right away.  Even the most prepared family is still left with a ton of decisions that were thrust upon them with absolutely no warning. There is no time to prepare your next steps.   Have a family business? What do these files mean, who are the contacts for this project, who needs to get paid, who owes us money.  Was that person getting a pension that you depended on?  Will I still have health insurance, what are my survivors benefits, how will I pay the bills this month when I'm waiting for the check because they need to see a death certificate I won't get for two weeks.  You have to make a decision on many things hours after your family member died and don't even know where to start because you didn't think they were going to die that day.</p>
<p>The absurdity of a death like his is also much harder to fathom for everyone involved.  You can wrap your head around another health related quicker death like a heart attack or aneurysm.  Same with a longer painful death like cancer.  That's how many of us anticipate we might go.  There is no preparing for this.  For the rest of your life you have to explain to people the stupid way that your dad, husband, family member died.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That'd depend. If the father in question was still a healthy 60 year old, an accidental death is absolutely horrible. I've been in a similar experience as you, and its not a good time at all. Sudden is better, but completely unexpected is a terrible shock. </p></div>		</li>
