			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Long time, I know, but I just want to point out one thing: how hard a surface is and how water loving it is are not related in any simple sense. There are hard surfaces that repel water strongly, which is to say that a bit of water spilled on them will be shape like a sphere in order to minimize contact with the surface (incidentally called &quot;hydrophobic&quot; surfaces). There are surfaces that water likes to be on, too---you guessed it, &quot;hydrophylic&quot; surfaces---which may be hard, and on which water will spread out into a sheet, flat everywhere but at the very edges.   </p>
<p>The situation is complex in the sense that an exact calculation of this interaction from first principles is impossible, but models and approximations of the true quantum mechanical picture I'm sure do a nice job to high accuracy. That being said, it's easier to measure! You drop some water onto a surface and look at the angle formed between the bulk of the water and the surface. This tells you about the balance of forces and the &quot;surface energies,&quot; i.e. a number that determines whether liquids smear onto surfaces or not. Qualitatively you can see if it tends towards a sphere or a flat sheet. Finally, surface energies are not unique to water on glass, or whatever, but exist at all interfaces for all materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Water is a polar molecule, and sticks to other polar molecules. Plastic is non-polar, generally. Glass is polar. You pour water out of a glass container, odds are much higher it'll stick. You pour it out of a plastic container, it'll probably flow out just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An extra tip is to make sure there is no liquid already running down the side of the glass! Once there is a path of liquid for the contents to follow it is much more likely to have dribbles from the side. I have tiny refill glasses to use at work and once I've made a spill it gets even messier. If I wipe the side of the glass off there is less of an opportunity for the liquid to hold onto the glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the missing other half... Water also really likes itself and will cling together.  Liquid on the side of the pouring container will have a pulling effect on the stream if the shape of the edge allows this.  This part is the source when the first pour is flawless and the second is a mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A tip for that is hold something vertical against the pour point on the side of the container, above where you want it to pour. Straight down is the path of least resistance as opposed to following the angled edge of the container. Micro capillary bonding or, surface tension will choose the vertical surface over the angled surface. </p>
<p>You can witness Chefs do this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related but slightly different....</p>
<p>You know how sometimes you pour from <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ae/e1/17/aee117c49849f0a8df6ee3aa5719f930--uht-milk-tetra.jpg" target="_blank">these style of cartons</a>, and if they're still quite full then they kind of &quot;glug&quot; and then you end up spilling it everywhere.</p>
<p>That's because you're pouring from the wrong side. You probably naturally want to pour towards the side that is <em>closest</em> to the lid, but you should actually pour towards the side that is <em>furthest away</em>.</p>
<p>A physicist explained to me this will reduce spillage because it reduces the amount of glugging that goes on due to....science...</p>
<p>EDIT: I thought I'd have a go at the science. From what I understood this was because it's easier for air to leave the hole if most of the liquid is coming from 'under' the lid and rising up over the spout; rather than for the liquid to come crashing down from above the spout in order to exit, which traps air and creates glugging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or for something like a poorly designed teapot, dab a tiny bit of oil or butter just under the spout. It will break the surface tension and the tea will pour fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why there are better and worse designs for pouring cups. Normal drinking ups will act up quite often and make a mess, but a measuring cup has a tapered spout - this funnels the water, increases the speed of the water relative to the lip, and results in less mess. Then there are great designs like the double-spout soy-sauce containers at Asian restaurants.</p>
<p>Of course, the effectiveness of these designs also depends upon the viscosity of the liquid inside, so syrup or pancake batter will cause a headache more often than plain water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual ELI5:</p>
<p>Whatever the water is in, you need a high enough angle for the water to actually fall and not run along the side of the container it is in.</p></div>		</li>
