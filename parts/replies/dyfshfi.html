			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like it would make sense to allow juries to submit questions in writing.</p>
<p>So if there is a long deliberation and a juror is thinking &quot;If this, then I lean <em>this</em> way.  But if <em>not</em> then I lean <em>that</em> way.&quot;  Then they could submit a question, both prosecution would have an opportunity to reply and the replies are arbitrated by the judge behind closed doors.  Then the responses are presented to the jurors in the deliberation room.</p>
<p>Then the jurors would get their questions answered and nothing would be outside of the legal scope of the trial. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some judges do allow jurors to submit questions to ask witnesses. In my experience, a good 75% of the questions submitted cannot be asked or answered. I hate when judges allow it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would you not like the judge to allow it?  If a juror feels like they have unanswered questions that are critical to their decision, wouldn't you want them to make the most informed decision? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The things is, it could be considered tampering with the jury. If jurors ask lawyers questions individually then those lawyers may easily be able to spread their bias or motives and can alter the jurors ideas of the trial or defendant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the jury 99% of the time doesn't have the legal knowledge to ask questions that wouldn't cause problems. Even if a juror has a legal background of some sort, it probably isn't directly related to the type of law being considered (or they would have been excused during the selection process).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking that the questions would not be asked directly.  They would submit the question in writing, then the prosecution and defense have an opportunity to answer and the judge reviews the answers with both of them to discuss what is permitted.  Then the final answer is returned to the jurors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. I was in a murder trial jury last year. All of the evidence was related to two suspects, but only one was on trial. During the trial we were told that nothing about the other suspect was going to be mentioned by anyone other than witness testimony, and we were only there to determine guilt or innocence for the one suspect.</p>
<p>After the trial I looked up the news stories online, and discovered that the other guy wasn't there because he'd ended up barricaded in a place with the police outside for hours, and killed himself rather than be arrested, where our suspect surrendered peacefully when he was caught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. We found him guilty. It kind of sucked as it wasn't a completely clear open-and-shut case of &quot;Yep, he did it&quot; because the other guy was involved. But legally, him just being there with the other guy meant he was guilty of the same crimes that the other guy would have been, so there you go.</p></div>		</li>
