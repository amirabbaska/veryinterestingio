			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they definitely exist. Gogo’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gogo_Inflight_Internet#Air-To-Ground_(ATG)" target="_blank">air-to-ground</a>  system works this way. In a lot of ways, it’s similar to a cell phone network- there are towers all over the US, and planes are able to jump from tower to tower as they move. </p>
<p>Satellite systems actually have to solve a similar problem, since the antenna on the plane needs to be able to locate a satellite as the plane is moving at high speeds.</p></div>		</li>
