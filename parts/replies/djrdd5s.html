<p>I can't help but feel like sticking your hand on a hull breech to seal it would cause a painful amount of suction, would it not?</p>
<p>Also, just on the off chance that you know. If decompression is less violent than it is in the movies, then why to planes crash when they rapidly decompress?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means that your skin is stuck to the hole with a force of one hundred kilograms. It's literally your skin stuck to it. And if you can pull it away with more than 100kgs (220lbs) force, you would immediately release the pressure difference, and it would suck you only weakly. So you'd be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is accurate in the static case, but I think that the effects of airflow are going to be substantial if the volume of gas being vented is large enough.</p>
<p>If we ignore things like friction and compressibility for a second, venting a reservoir of stationary gas at 1ATM into a vacuum causes the gas to accelerate to an alarming 400m/s. Let's clamp this to 340m/s because that's the speed of sound at room temperature, and things get weird when you go supersonic.</p>
<p>Let's say you punch a hole of area A1. Mass flow rate must be conserved, so if you are walking down a hallway of cross-sectional area A2, the air around you will be moving at a speed of 340 * A1 / A2.  If we imagine an access corridor that is 1.5m wide and 2m tall, and subtract off the area of a typical human being (Google says 0.75m^2), we have A2 ~ 2.25m^2.</p>
<p>If you want to hold your ground, you need to withstand the drag force caused by that wind. This force is ~0.5 <em> A </em> Cd * v^2. An approximate guess for the coefficient of drag of a human is 0.6 (probably higher if they occupy a large fraction of the hallway).</p>
<p>Let's start punching holes of various diameters and look at the wind speed/force:</p>
<p><strong>2cm:</strong> 0.0475m/s (speed of a sloth), negligible drag.</p>
<p><strong>10cm:</strong> 1.19m/s (adult walking speed), 0.3N of drag (33g of weight; barely noticeable)</p>
<p><strong>20cm:</strong> 4.75m/s (marathon running speed), 5N of drag (500g of weight; noticeable but trivial).</p>
<p><strong>30cm:</strong> 10.7m/s (Usain Bolt's record speed), 25N of drag (a few kilograms; not typically a problem).</p>
<p><strong>40cm:</strong> 19.0m/s (Moderate tropical storm), 81N of drag (10kg of weight; walking becomes difficult).</p>
<p><strong>50cm:</strong> 29.7m/s (Category 1 hurricane), 198N of drag (20kg of weight; some people cannot continue walking, and will be stuck in place until all the air has vented)</p>
<p><strong>60cm:</strong> 42.8m/s (Category 2 hurricane), 412N of drag (42kg of weight; beyond the strength of some individuals and will result in tumbling towards the breach)</p>
<p><strong>70cm:</strong> 58.2m/s (Category 4 hurricane), 762N of drag (78kg of weight; equivalent to holding yourself against gravity; most people will eventually accelerate toward the breach at 1g, which will feel like falling)</p>
<p><strong>80cm:</strong> 76.0m/s (Category 5 hurricane), 1300N of drag (133kg of weight; beyond the strength of most people; causes acceleration toward the breach at 2g, substantially faster than falling)</p>
<p>These affects will be amplified for smaller corridors or larger people, and diminished for wider corridors/smaller people. A smart individual could also turn sideways or crouch down to reduce drag if they heard it coming.</p>
<p>I think this is <em>mostly</em> in line with the static case in that fist-sized holes are pretty trivial, however the effects start ramping up quickly if the ship is large enough to sustain steady state flow.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't do this. Compressibility is literally the thing that constrains how fast you can vent a fluid. It can't exceed Mach 1 at a throat. </p>
<p>The other numbers are interesting, but you're neglecting the fact that the faster the peak flow rate, the faster the pressure is going to equalize. Unless you have an absolutely enormous ship with a ton of air to supply, you're not going to have 76m/s air moving for any significant length of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly it. That acceleration, plus debris, could equal a much larger hole very quickly. Much larger hole = more acceleration, more force, more debris. Think of what happens to homes in Category 5 hurricanes. Enough of an air reservoir, and the effects could be rather catastrophic </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this means Neal Stephenson had it right in SevenEves. The vacuum is only so strong, and a sufficiently large enough(and i suppose rigid/sturdy enough) can seal a breach?</p>
<p>[spoilers] Dinah uses her hand to seal a small hole created by what was probably a fragment of the moon, which only had enough pressure to create a &quot;space hickie&quot;. She is then able to use a bandaid to cover the hole which mostly works and then supplements it with a layer of plastic bag over that. She also uses the body of someone killed by the bolide to seal a larger breach caused by the fragmented pieces of that rock after it made the first hole and tore through that persons body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Expanse deals very well with ship damage from things penetrating the hull. No vacuum panic and other SciFi tropes<br />
In one scene the dust free floating in the punctured cabin is highlighted by light from otherside of the hole and when the engines kick in the duststream visibly fall down.      </p>
<p>Things like that is a treat for the people who love hard scifi.</p></div>		</li>
