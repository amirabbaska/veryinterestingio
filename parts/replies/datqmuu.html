<p>It's less that people are aware of and following the rules you mention and more that there is a set of natural laws:</p>
<ol>
<li>Validating conflicts to an entity's claims will piss that entity off.</li>
<li>If you do things that piss off an entity, that entity will be less likely to work with you.</li>
<li>Your well being is aided by the size and number of entities that collaborate with you.</li>
</ol>
<p>What that translates to is that most countries will, no matter what, tend to agree with majority opinions or very powerful entities (e.g. the US) about who is a state. In some cases (e.g. the cold war) this means that it may be advantageous for these conflicting ideas to coexist because different entities are under the allegiance or influence of different factors. Neither is following some global law; instead they're following the lead of those they need to impress or not piss off which is necessary to their own well being. This is an important distinction because it more clearly recognizes how there isn't a right side and how the rules can rapidly and arbitrarily change. Changes in a large entity's stances (i.e. Nixon) will naturally cause smaller entities to follow that change in their own interest even if it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>While in 1970 it was pretty absurd to claim that Taiwan governed mainland China, it's equally absurd today to claim that mainland China governs Taiwan. By the rules you mention, Taiwan has long not been a part of mainland China's permanent population or its effective borders. Taiwan has proved a powerful, independent trade entity. Additionally, it has (sometimes formally, sometimes not) been recognized in a variety of ways. So, under the rationality of the rules you provided, it makes as much sense to recognize an independent Taiwan today as it did to recognize an independent mainland China in 1970. Mainland China's claims to Taiwan are largely invalid for that reason. At the same time, we know that's largely because, as polite as we chose our public words, the Taiwan Relations Act's existence shows in practice that we essentially recognize and defend the existence of Taiwan.</p>
<p>This isn't the story of the US following some global rule about how to classify Taiwan, it's the story of the US trying to appease China by not actively working against its claims. In a way, the story of Taiwan explains both why the US needs to and why it doesn't need to follow these rules. Its unilateral redefinition of China way back when was possible because the current global norms were outweighed by the proposition of appeasing communist China. The fact that the US is such a global leader who has so much weight in determining recognition and engagement in trade by the states of the world allowed it to redefine back then just as it can today. The challenge to the US here isn't the backlash of the world itself based on some global code, it's that it ends the strategy of appeasement toward China and impacts Chinese-American relations in a way that stops diffusing a conflict in their military commitments.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And this is quite important. Nation states work with nation states because they both agree with each other's borders. For example, France and Germany have to BOTH agree with each other on which part of it is France, which part of it is Germany, otherwise, they have to go to war to settle who belongs to whom. Now, if we are to discard the facade of the one-China policy (which I assure you everyone understands) then we have the issue of two nation state on hand THAT CANNOT agree on EVERYTHING. If you are to accept that the PRC and ROC are separate nation states, then they will have to settle their disagreement through war and treaties since one of them is just a gigantic beast of a nation, treaties will probably be the same outcome as a war. So you can't have your cake of maintaining a democratic Taiwan and eating it too. Pick one. </p>

<p>No, it doesn't.

<p>This is exactly how it was framed by China, and everyone including the US agreed. This is a debate of China as a nation state, and its borders as nation state. Both China &amp; the US agreed to the concept of China as a nation state and the border of that nation state, while they disagree with exactly which China everyone is talking about. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Cake? Pick one? I'm not advocating anything or trying to say what ought to be, I'm just saying that the rules the original comment mentioned are not the ones the nations are playing by. The idea that those rules hold any authority at all or that anybody is truly playing by them is not well founded. They are frequently broken and align more closely with what I said... which is a much less idealistic method of decision making.</p>
<p>As for war, the other option is a continuation of the situation where the US and China don't want to go to war with each other and so a US commitment is enough to keep Taiwan free regardless of what anybody does or doesn't recognize about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, it doesn't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it does. Reading the treaty which you linked to was why I made my claim in the first place. I stand by what I said. The act creates an in-name façade that we don't recognize and define their existence, while still saying things that indicate that, in practice, we do. For example, it says &quot;The absence of diplomatic relations or recognition shall not affect the application of the laws of the United States with respect to Taiwan, and the laws of the United States shall apply with respect to Taiwan in the manner that the laws of the United States applied with respect to Taiwan prior to January 1, 1979.&quot; In it we talk about promoting &quot;extensive, close and friendly relations&quot; with Taiwan. We also say things like (1) &quot;that peace and stability in the area are in the political, security, and economic interests of the United States&quot;, (2) &quot;to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States&quot; and (3) &quot;to provide Taiwan with arms&quot;. In practice, that description is completely at odds with the idea that Taiwan is an internal affair of China or that we don't think it's its own valid state actor. We're saying that the use of not only military but economic leverage to retake Taiwan is not acceptable to us and that we will arm Taiwan. While in name we're calling it something else, that treaty repeatedly affirms what I said: That, in practice, we essentially recognize and defend the existence of Taiwan.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;this&quot;, but it's important to remember that &quot;how it was framed by X&quot; is not the same as the truth of the matter. My point was that it's not really accurate to only talk about what is said in official communications and treaties when you also admit that the one-China policy is a façade. This is the same problem with the initial comment. It is a way to talk about what's happening, but by oversimplifying things such as stances, reasoning and frame of reference, it quickly falls through. It turns out that neither side is as clean cut in what it thinks/agrees to, why it thinks that or how its philosophy evolves over time. So this way of looking at things tends to greatly oversimplify matters, misunderstand the intentions of people and I think is a perfect recipe for bias (i.e. conflating gentle coercion with some sense of objective validity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great summary, but I have one issue with it. The PRC started establishing diplomatic relations with other countries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dates_of_establishment_of_diplomatic_relations_with_the_People's_Republic_of_China" target="_blank">since 1949</a>. The first countries that recognized it were other communist countries, but starting from 1950, non-communist countries like Norway and Sweden were already recognizing the PRC. It's true that the US only started recognizing them in the 70s, but under the Westphalian system, those other countries' recognition is just as valid as that of the US.</p>
<p>Similarly, today there are still a few states that recognize the ROC. Even though they're mostly inconsequential on the world stage compared to the major powers, their recognition is still valid. So this thing between the ROC and the PRC is still a legitimate dispute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes,  Norway and Sweden recognizing the PRC is just as valid in a theoretical or legal sense. In reality, after WW2 the dominance of US industrial production, size of its population, and centrality in the post war financial system meant that it carried the most weight. Real world realities undermine the  validity of recognition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, but as I've said, I was trying to summarize as best I could. There are always a few outliers here and there, but &quot;generally&quot; recognition occurred on the timeline I put forward. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taiwan is lacking the same thing the People's Republic of China lacked until the 70's - recognition. Giving recognition to an entity with the first three elements of statehood wasn't overturning the system when the PRC was recognized and it won't be overturning the system when Taiwan is recognized.</p></div>		</li>
