			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Some people think it's based on observation, and that we learn to become right handed based on people we see doing things with their right hand more than their left. Other people think it's just randomly decided or a part of our genetics. Maybe it's a combination of all of the above, who knows.</p>
<p>Also, happy reddit birthday u/bazmonkey!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, my nephew is the only left handed person in my family. Even from a few months old he always used his left hand first. </p></div>		</li>
