			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on a bit of the science the speed of the cars is governed by sensors that measure how the track is reacting.  Imagine heat sensors that measure track temperature , and if they are getting too hot they speed up.</p>
<p>In physiological terms the cells lining the GI tract release serotonin , which is measured by the 5-HT(3) receptor.  This is absorbed by receptors in the intestine and causes contractions to move things.  The more there is the faster things move.</p>
<p>If there is so much the local receptors can't absorb it all some reaches the same type of receptor in the area postrema of the brain which then starts the chain of events to cause you to vomit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lack of serotonin is seen as one of the causes mental illness. So, if somebody constantly eats bad food, and there is insufficient serotonin, could it contribute to one's likelihood of developing mental illness? Does it mean that SSRIs can actually help the GI in this situation?</p>
<p>[edit] And could taking SSRIs be used as a preventive measure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further note, a bunch of other stuff like salt gets flushed out with the water as well.  Thus if you just drink a ton of water in response, you could theoretically get hyponatremia or hypokalemia (low salt, potassium), etc and die too, so you also need electrolytes.  That's why it is recommended you drink something with electrolytes liked Pedialyte or Gatorade or whatever.  The potential problem with Gatorade is the sugar, which can further aggravate the GI tract and also can be bad if you have sugar issues such as diabetes.</p>
<p>This is also why a standard IV is say 0.9% salt, and why &quot;banana bags&quot; exist.</p></div>		</li>

I've always told them that while it doesn't feel good now, they're body is trying to get rid of something bad.  I think next time I'm in that situation, I'm using this explanation.

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>I only got a few hours of sleep and got a bit lost reading this. So I modified it a bit in case I wasn't the only one.</strong></p>
<p>So your bowels are like a long track, literally your digestive track, and the time your food takes to transit between your mouth the pooper is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.</p>
<p>When you eat, food enters your mouth, is chewed, mixed with saliva, and becomes a bolus. When the bolus reaches your stomach it is dissolved in gastric juices / acid and turns into chyme before entering your intestines. The chyme loses nutrients at various points in the small intestine. The journey has already altered the shape of the food into a sludgy liquid, and giving a rusty colour, but it isn't complete yet. Once in the large intestine the fluids are extracted from the chyme and thickens into feces as the last of the nutrients are extracted. The surface of the feces are moistened so the transition out your butt isn't so bad. Normally, the feces waits at the end of your large intestine so it can exit when you consciously choose to.</p>
<p>Now, all of this goes fucking nuts when you eat some bad food. Your sensors, located everywhere along the track, detect this potentially harmful bolus/chyme (probably KFC) and sends a distress call to your brain. The brain wants to handle the situation without alerting your consciousness about the craziness in your digestive track and also wants to make sure you never know it was there in the first place. It has to make a choice now: send it violently back to your mouth and somewhat painfully risking tearing the your esophagus, or send it to the pooper as fast as fuck? Either way it needs it out of your body before it has a chance of harming you. Depending on where it's located, it'll choose the best route.</p>
<p>Let's say the destination ends up being the pooper. Your brain hits the panic button and puts your digestive system into overdrive. Your intestine is flooded with water and lubricant to speed everything up and get it the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Everything collides with each other, and previously well formed feces are churned and mixed with water and lubricant, becoming just a soggy, sludgy reminder of their former glorious state.</p>
<p>Your pain receptors start going off and sending messages to your conscious mind at this point, trying to alert you of what is to come. It also serves as the messenger for the rest of your body that is trying to tell you &quot;Hey stupid! What the fuck did you eat?!!&quot;. Meanwhile you just sit there with a stupid look on your face and watch the horror unfold, and cannot do anything to stop it. At this point your brain just decides &quot;fuck it&quot; because it tried not to bother your consciousness but it got out of control when your pain sensors started firing off and switched it onto autopilot (your subconscious) while it focuses on tightening your butthole and getting your ass to the pooper as fast as possible.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question.</p>
<p>TL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another. There are no passing lanes.</p>
