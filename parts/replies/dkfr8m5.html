			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, think of the size of Low frequency sound waves. It's much larger and does more damage over time. </p>
<p>A speaker pushes and pulls Air to create Sound Pressure and we measure it as Sound Pressure Level. High frequency sounds are small waves traveling quickly and low frequency sounds are really big comparatively and travel slower (and take more time to develop and be fully audible). </p>
<p>So equate this to a piece of metal. A needle will go through your arm and cause a little damage, while a large piece like a Baseball bat can go through your arm, but cause a lot more damage. </p>
<p>Since our ears &quot;zero out&quot; and reset after temporary expose, it's not a huge issue most of the time if you leave loud areas to get some actual quiet for a bit in an open area. But every 10 decibels of pressure above 80 or so (I forget exactly) will shorten the time you can be consistently exposed in that sitting without per moment damage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High frequency waves have a lot more energy than low frequency waves. Correspondingly, <em>short</em> waves have more energy than large ones (since the speed of sound is roughly constant in air, and frequency and wavelength are inverse proportional to each other). It's high-pitched noises that cause the most damage.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I guess you mean for the same amplitude, since for the same energy... they have the same energy.</p>
<p>Energy = amplitude * frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question I've asked on a few occasions in various places and never gotten an answer.</p>
<p>I can 'reverse-pop' my ears by holding my nose and sucking in instead of blowing out, and it completely takes away half my hearing, nearly as good as actual earbuds. </p>
<p>Are you in a position to tell me why or why not this works out if I'm just imagining it.</p>
<p>I've used it a few times to stand right next to massive speakers at gigs and have had people signal to 'let's go stand somewhere else' where, while it's loud, it hasn't bothered me so much.</p>
<p>I've always wondered if I've just been fooling myself or what..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be creating a lower pressure in your middle ear, which might be tensing your eardrum and making it less sensible to external vibrations, which would in turn transfer less sound intensity to your inner ear.</p>
<p>This might be dampening the impact on your inner ear by several dB, but if you're standing &quot;right next to massive speakers&quot;, chances are that this dampening won't be enough to lower the volume to safe levels, and that you are going to experience permanent hearing loss no matter what.</p>
<p>Additionally, by putting extra stress on your eardrum, you might be risking a puncture, hardening, scarring, etc. which might also screw up your hearing.</p></div>		</li>
