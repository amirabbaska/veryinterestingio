<p>For instance, let's say I was working in GCHQ and was concerned about some aspect of our work - we're overstepping our authority and doing something immoral, illegal or hiding something from the oversight committees. Instead of leaking to wikileaks I send evidence or disclose my concerns to my MP.</p>
<p>My MP raises it in Parliament - Parliamentary Privilege means that they cannot be prosecuted for anything they say in Parliament, even if it is libellous or classified. It's down to them to make such judgements as to what is appropriate.</p>
<p>If they are choosing to raise this (they've looked at it and said &quot;this is outrageous/illegal and I'm going to raise it in the Commons&quot;) then <em>they</em> are protected by privilege, but they also need to be able to protect their source (me), in which case their official office and Parliamentary correspondence needs to be protected from embarrassed security officials who want my head. Which is why the Police cannot simply walk into Parliament and tear someone's office apart without permission from the Serjeant at Arms (in the case of the UK, it derives from the fact that Westminster is a Royal Palace, the Crown is the Law, therefore the Police cannot act within a Royal Palace in the same way they could in any other building or mess with Her Majesty's Government - same as the Police can't arrest the Queen).</p>
<p>Or substitute NHS/Police/other government department. Doesn't have to be GCHQ. I could be whistleblowing on a healthcare scandal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, in the United States it is not all that uncommon for certain groups to engage in &quot;disinformation&quot; campaigns--either through planting some evidence of malfeasance against a congress member, or by spinning stories which misrepresent a congress member's political positions.</p>
<p>Given that, in most cases of controversial bills the voting margins can be just a handful of votes in a House of 435 members, it doesn't take that much disinformation to flip a vote. </p>
<p>This also happens at the local level. My brother served in political office at the city council level--and was approached several times by women who seemed to be trying to entrap my brother. My parents have also been similarly approached. (I remember my father being approached by what appeared to be a high-end escort, apparently in order to try to seduce my father--all during a campaign.)</p>
<p>Without some degree of immunity it is conceivable that this sort of &quot;tit-for-tat&quot; would become a regular aspect of politics as each party seeks to entrap members of the other party and have them tossed into jail.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why? Because, unlike in the US, it has been relatively common for dictators to arise from the executive branch of govt in which case the parliament is either obedient from the start or the dictator removes problematic MPs because police found &quot;evidence&quot; that they're criminals so that they can be removed and replaced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's actually in a US-style Presidential system that these kinds of dictatorships manifest. It's extremely rare for a Parliamentary system to produce a dictator, because the leader of the executive (the Prime Minister) is not the head of state (monarch or elected figurehead President). They can usually be dismissed through a simple Parliamentary vote of no confidence, or even internal Party vote. In a Parliamentary system, prospective tyrants are deposed before they have an opportunity to become a dictator...which they'd do by introducing a US-style Presidential system where the President is essentially an elected King.</p>
<p>Now, cast your eyes back at the US, where the President is:</p>
<ul>
<li>leader of the executive</li>
<li>head of state</li>
<li>appointer of the federal judiciary</li>
<li>commander-in-chief of the armed forces</li>
<li>the holder of a legislative veto</li>
<li>able to unilaterally author and pass legislation (executive orders)</li>
<li>able to modify legislation (signing statements)</li>
<li>able to unconditionally pardon anybody</li>
<li>able give honours (medals) to anybody</li>
<li>able to cling on to the job in spite of corruption, as it's almost impossible to get rid of a sitting President</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see why such a system results in dictators and tyrants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good point and the proof of it can be found all throughout history of Southern America, where those countries attempted unsuccessfully to emulate the US system simply because too many dictators arose.</p></div>		</li>
