<p>During autopsy, looking at these cells can be a helpful clue that significant hypoxia occurred prior to death.</p>

<p>How do the cells appear different compared to non-hypoxic cells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different cells will look different due to hypoxia. The cells I mentioned (neurons) begin by looking shrunken and more pink than usual, with smudged nuclei.</p>
<p><a href="http://neuropathology-web.org/chapter2/images2/2-anoxic.png" target="_blank">Hypoxic neurons</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/images_dictionary/cerebral_cortex__1__example_1__1_100_1.jpg" target="_blank">Normal neurons</a></p>
<p>At this stage, the neurons are damaged - depending on the degree of hypoxia, they could recover, but may also die, be cleared by immune cells (macrophages), and that area of brain becomes gliotic (brain's version of scarring).</p>
<p>Edit: This is a microscopic appearance, seen under a microscope, on a slide, after special preparation. You would not see this after cracking open the skull and cutting into the brain. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there a stain in those slides or is just what a thin slice of brain tissue looks like?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;...a poor definition IMO, since it argues that death is the absence of life.&quot;</p>
<p>out of curiosity, what makes you find this to be a poor definition of death? we define darkness, slowness, and cold in similar ways</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A definition that is basically the negation or the inversion of its related concept is considered, dialectically speaking, to be of poor form.</p>
<p>Yes, darkness can be defined as &quot;absence of light&quot;, but a better definition would instead talk about a threshold of measured photons below the human eye's sensitivity. </p>
<p>Same with slowness: motion whose measured speed is below a certain threshold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a vague definition that doesn't add much to the concept of death.</p>
<p>The other definitions I mentioned have a component of the same concept - <em>a cessation of function of the organ</em>, but adds other information and is more specific.</p></div>		</li>
