			<div class="markdown"><p>people often conflate time being the fourth dimension with time being the fourth spatial dimension. The first is correct, the second one is not. In other words, time is like spatial dimensions in some but not all ways. Usually what you're describing would not be considered a hypercube, but it can be a neat way of conceptualizing it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, essentially.</p>

<p>Time seems to be qualitatively distinct from the three spatial dimensions we're familiar with, so the idea of a 'correct' amount of time might just be meaningless. I mean, the point of measuring other physical dimensions with the same units is that things supposedly work the same way regardless of how they're oriented within that space.</p>
<p>Probably the closest thing we have to the 'correct' conversion would be to use the speed of light as the conversion factor. That is to say, a cube roughly 300000 kilometers on each side existing for one second (or a cube 1 meter on each side existing for about 3.36 nanoseconds) would be a close approximation of a tesseract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure a 3D cube is still a 3D cube no matter how long it sits there, because we're not free to move along the timeline.  &quot;Time&quot; is just a measurement for change, rather than a literal fourth physical dimension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. Just one thing that 0-dimensions is not a point. It's simply how we represent it. In reality, &quot;nothing&quot; is 0-dimensional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, a point is a 0-dimensional square/cube equivalent. And in almost all uses of the word dimension in math. Spaces with dimension 0 consist of one point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about it logically, it can't have a length, it can't have a width and it can't have a height. It basically has no measurement.</p></div>		</li>
