			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true in isolation, but only explains things running slightly slower.</p>
<p>In general, when you see a noticable slowdown it is bc you have apps at odds with each other.</p>
<p>For example, two Antivirus products on the same system.</p>
<p>AV1 sees AV2 is doing something.  AV1:  &quot;I must check out this activity!&quot;</p>
<p>AV2:  &quot;there is new activity I must check!&quot;  (Which is AV1 checking AV2)</p>
<p>Feedback loop started </p>
<p>Add in other apps, and you now have these apps doing the electronic version of sniffing all the other dogs in a circle </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Bob_Sconce is right, and the reason some antivirus software seems to not bog down your computer is because the mail room sends out the mail to the office, and then as it goes out the encyclopedia guys wait until it is night time (when your computer is doing something computationally intense) or you explicitly tell them to go out and check the mail. Sure some people have read their mail and already thrown it away. Yet most mail is still sitting around, and they take that mail check it in their encyclopedia and throw away anything that doesn't look good, and dispose of any packages they don't like. That being said, I would highly recommend MalwareBytes program as it tends to take the night shift route.</p></div>		</li>
