			<div class="markdown"><p>But how many rads would one get from going through the machine? Is it equal to a CT scan (10 mSV) ? Or to say a procedure like coronary angiography that uses fluoroscopy? (15mSV) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without using specific numbers CT would have the highest radiation dose as the mAs is a product of time and Amperage and the CT is on for a few seconds resulting in a high mAs. Also CT produces a lot of scatter radiation that is secondary to the primary beam radiation. A CT is the equivalent of quite a few xrays. Flouroscopy used in angiogrophy has a much lower dose because even though its on for a length of time like CT it uses an image intensifier that allows you to use a much lower mA thus the mAs is lower and thus dose. The airport security scanners use some sort of surface absoption with xray to get an image but at a much lower dose then medical Xray because they don't need to use enough radiation to makeout fine structures like bone or soft tissue. They're just looking for the outline of objects. I am not familiar with the exact physics of this but she most likely got more X-radiation from the sun during her flight then she did from that scanner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These scanners are not looking for just the outline of objects. They are meant to penetrate so that you can potentially identify structure, as well. It is solely a 2d image vs the 3d from a CT but still far more powerful than the body scanners they use at the airport now.</p>
<p>Interesting note: the CT machines at airports for checked luggage are far stronger than medical CTs. People try to bring items through in &quot;shielded&quot; bags inside their luggage. You can see riiiiiight through them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fluoroscopy doses are by far the highest. You can receive hundreds of milliGrays, but it's mostly localized to the skin. Still high enough to get deterministic effects in some cases (erythema). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So tldr we used to use live x-rays in higher concentrations to fit shoes and stopped because 'hey, that's probably not a good idea' and this lady got a much smaller dose due to technological advances requiring lower energies? </p>
<p>Soo.. she'll probably be fine, develop cancer later in life as she normally would have anyway, and blame it on the exposure?</p>
<p>Check.</p></div>		</li>
