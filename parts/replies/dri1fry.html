			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really clear explanation, thanks. I have a follow-up question: How would having low blood pressure as your normal change things? Even when I am anxiety ridden with a mug of coffee in me, my BP is still quite low, though not enough to be problematic. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I would imagine your body's feedback loops and self-regulations would be tuned so that &quot;normal&quot; blood pressure would just be subjective to you as an individual, and relative increases would have similar results. But, everything I stated was specifically covered in a physiology class I took, and we never discussed the possibility of significant individual differences, so I would defer to someone more knowledgeable than myself.</p></div>		</li>
