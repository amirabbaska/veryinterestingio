<p>And unfortunately for most of them at least they are getting attention at school even if it's bad. Home life is almost always terrible for the worst behaving kids.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That includes being Expelled in 3rd grade and transferred to another school district that same day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dang. My brother got expelled in 6th grade and it took 2 months to be able to transfer him schools. He is also autistic and we were trying to send him to an amazing school FOR kids with special needs. The main reason he got expelled from school number one: they didn't have he proper resources for children with actual delays so they labeled him as a trouble maker and had him removed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why isn't this higher up? It's so obvious that the misbehaved kids more than likely have a bad situation at home. They want to go to school to avoid that and be around more positive people. They seek attention at school because they don't get any at home. So yeah, I bet a suspension for some kids is bad for them. Add that with child abuse, and parents getting mad at a child for being suspended? It probably is a punishment for a lot. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are also a few schools around here that don't even tell you exam dates, so you're left in the dark. All tests are surprise tests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to me.  It evolved into a pretty good story.</p>
<p>I was in middle school (grades 6-8) not certain of my age, probably do to the 'festive spirits' i've been drinking tonight.  I don't even remember the kids name, but for some reason he wanted to fight me.  So we fought, and both ended up in the principals office.  Both battered and a little bloody, told not to fight and slapped with OSS.  I still think I inflicted more damage to him then he did to me.   A few weeks go by and the kid cornered me and I let him pound on me until a teacher broke it up.  I did notice that he only punched with his right arm and he'd always pull the arm back before throwing a punch.  Principal's office again, another speech about not fighting, but after the other kid was dismissed the principal asked why the other kid didn't have a scratch on him.  I told him that I didn't fight at all because its not allowed.  He told me that it was okay to defend myself.</p>
<p>Kids seemed to pick on me more the next few weeks.  Eventually my bully decided I needed another thrashing.  This fight I went full kung fu master and deflected every punch he threw, which in retrospect was really easy due to him pulling his arm back before trying to punch.  I never threw a punch or kick myself.  Eventually a teacher yelled at us to &quot;Stop fighting&quot; and I inquired &quot;Do you want me to stop this?&quot;.  After the teacher responded with an affirmation, on his next punch I grabbed his arm and slammed him into the locker.  He slid down like a sack of mashed potatoes.  And back to the principal's office we go....  Told my story and most of the time was spent with the principal trying to convince the other kid to leave me alone.</p>
<p>The fourth and final time was after the kid had made some remark at me.  I found him at his locker in a deserted hallway.  I proceeded to unleash the fury of 1000 nerds on his ass.  Multiple faceslams into the lockers, kicks to the nuts, you name it and I did it.  Kid had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance.   My story to the principal was, he started it, I have had enough of it, and I didn't know what really happened as the rage and adrenaline took over.</p>
<p>Found out after the kid got back, the only thing the principal asked him was &quot;Are you going to leave Kishandreth alone now?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I totally know the feeling. I wish I could've defended myself. The one time when I did try we both got detention. </p>
<p>This was the early 90s so there was much less of an anti-bullying mindset than there is now. The teachers knew I was being bullied, but did nothing because I needed &quot;to learn to stand up for [my] self.&quot; I don't know if I've ever forgiven those teachers, but I've since had the chance to forgive some of the bullies, which have since become friends of mine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was in 7th grade middle school. I had been taking wrestling for three years to prepare myself after finally finishing elementary school and entering the emotional/physical tornado that was middle school. There was this one kid, always picking on me for my height and being an instigator of other things such as pick block swarms during the short lived reinstated recess in 7th grade (as if they needed any more excuse to torment me) which you'd think they would stop with after elementary school. That winter I noticed he had joined the wrestling team in town, and being the considerate upperclassman and re empowered victim I was, demanded my coach to let em wrestle against him (me being 4'9&quot; and 75 lbs on a good day, and him being about 200 and a few inches taller than me). I ended up pinning him with an ending score of 14-2 and getting one of my only two chances to show that I wasn't a weakling despite my size.</p>
<p>Later that week, when arriving at school, I approached the usual crowd of people, waiting to be let into the school by a &quot;teacher's assistant&quot; (whatever the person's function was) and overheard him bragging about how good he was at wrestling. Of course, I took advantage of this by calling him out about how I beat him with ease. Here is where I earned a sucker punch from him and a tackling, stomach punching, headlock thing into the carefully trimmed bushes in the front of our school (in indent which you could see from pictures on the normal website still). Of course I was caught off guard by his lashing out in front of everyone, as was everyone else, so not only did I end up not being able to fight back, but everyone including the &quot;teacher's assistants&quot; just watched for what felt like several minutes. Telling my story, which involved just involved awkward starting between me and the principal, and would have been apparent from the camera footage and several eyewitnesses and teacher's assistant, almost cost me that day's field trip since the buses were leaving early.</p>
<p>I don't think I've let my guard down with anybody anywhere ever since that incident. Later that year I had a confrontation with him in which he pinned my shoulders against a wall. But due to my paranoia I was able to lift my small legs up and leave two shoe marks on his shirt while knocking far away enough to get into my wrestling stance, acknowledging hat I would be willing to risk groundfighting on hard tile. Luckily he backed off long enough for a teacher to &quot;break it up&quot;. As far as I know, 7 years have passed and he may be in that &quot;Limbo class&quot; as I call it, where kids never move on from that grade.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long post, I saw other people talking about their experiences with bullying and felt it'd be nice to tell somebody about this before I eventually push it down again.</p></div>		</li>
