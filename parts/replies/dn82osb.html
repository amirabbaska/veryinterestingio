<p>There are air compressors on the locomotives that are connected to each car through the use of air hoses and the entire system is controlled by the engineer at the head end of the train. The speed of the train can be controlled by either taking away air (setting the brakes) or adding air (releasing the brakes). I know that sounds backwards but that's how the system was designed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually a good example of what's called a 'fail-safe' design. To put it simply, the philosophy of a 'fail-safe' is that following a failure, the system goes to the safest position. There are a whole number of possible events that could cause the air pressure to stop working - compressor failure, hose disconnected, a leak, jammed valve, etc. Since you don't want a runaway train, you architect the system so that if any of those failures happen and you no longer control the brakes, the train slows itself down.</p>
<p>The alternate design approach is 'fail-fixed', where the system is designed that following a failure, it stays in its current state. In some cases that is preferable, but it really depends on the specific application.</p>
<p>And of course there's 'fail-dangerous', which I don't think anything is actually designed to be, but I've seen it a couple of times when an engineer didn't really think things through. </p>
<p>Edit - I double checked and the only thing that is supposed to be designed as 'fail-deadly' are nuclear weapons, which are designed such that if the command and control systems are destroyed, they are supposed to launch. That's a little chilling. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sort of a dark irony, as the design of the weapons themselves (i.e. the warheads) are meant to be 'one-point safe,' a sort of related concept to 'fail-safe' design where an accidental means of detonation at a single point (like the high explosives in the weapon detonating due to fire or impact) should be unable (less than one in a million odds) of creating a significant nuclear yield. Not to say that goal has always been achieved; there's a terrifying number of known incidents (and likely many more) where dumb luck prevented an accident from becoming an accidental domestic nuclear event. The book <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/books/review/command-and-control-by-eric-schlosser.html?mcubz=3" target="_blank">Command and Control</a> by Eric Schlosser and the associated <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/command-and-control/" target="_blank">documentary</a> are a really informative and engaging place to start if you're interested in learning more!</p></div>		</li>

The spring that holds the door open is under tension when it is closed and not when it is open. So if the spring fails it is going to do so when the door is closed.

<p>Another is the Otis elevator safety mechanism.  Otis built a system with the elevator riding between pillars with teeth on them.  The elevator was attached to the cable by two sprung arms.  While the weight of the elevator was on it the cable would pull on the arms, canceling out the spring in them and retracting them from the teeth on the pillars allowing the car to move.  If the cable broke the spring in the arms would push out forcing the prongs on the arms to engage the teeth on the pillars, stopping it almost immediately.  Otis would demonstrate his invention to the public by standing on a platform and having someone cut the cable.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/dunnkw is 100% correct...and also 100% wrong!</p>
<p>Clearly trains can be automated.  The Docklands Light rail is fully automated.  There are plenty of &quot;people movers&quot; at airports that are fully automated.  However dunnkw points out some of the differences, you'll notice people movers are 1-4 cars, often with electrically activated anti-lock braking systems.  Not mile and a half long air-brake monsters.</p>
<p>There are technologies that could solve almost every problem mentioned.  Electrically activated brakes with sensors to confirm operation without walking the train.  GPS &amp; strain gauge on each car to measure forces and insure proper train handling.  </p>
<p>At the end of the day though, it's cost.  What the train has going for it is that it can move 200 cars, each with the load of 4-5 semis, with <em>2</em> operators.  </p>
<p>Compare with 1000 semis carrying the same cargo, with 1000 people driving them.  Eliminating those 1000 people provides a lot more ROI.</p>
<p>So unlike dunnkw, I'm sure the technology exists to solve all of the issues he mentions.  But it would be too expensive; and in the fine print the union is good at lobbying against such things; so there's simply no ROI for it.</p>
<p>TL;DR The trains ratio of cargo to people makes eliminating the people a small win.  This is not true of trucks and cars.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the real answer. /u/dunnkw gave a great and detailed explanation of why trains are not currently automated, but didn't address the crux of the question, which was &quot;why is nobody trying to automate trains compared to trucks/cars&quot;.</p>
<p>Automate a train and you get rid of a few drivers, automate automobiles and get rid of many drivers. That's really what is comes down to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/dunnkw did address the crux of the question but didn't elaborate on it - the Engineers Union.  Trains around the world are driven by people who are members of public-sector unions.  The technical issues are eminently solvable but it won't be done, because there's no political will to tackle the unions.</p>
<p>Train travel is relatively expensive compared to air travel in the USA and other places because of high labour costs.  Train travel takes a lot longer than flying so you've got to pay the staff on board for all those hours.  While you can't so easily automate the jobs of the people cooking and serving food on board, you could (in principle) automate the jobs of drivers and conductors, making train travel a lot cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US freight railroad system is the largest and most advanced (far and away) of any country on the planet. What's BNSF's rolling stock at? like 90K or something rediculous? each car is worth like $80k-$200k? I imagine the air bake system is a hefty percentage of that total cost and retrofitting even one of the class I railroads would be a ludicrous proposition. Do think over the coming years you'll begin to see some sort of hybrid system that has newer braking systems on new rolling stock purchases in the hopes that eventually you'll be able to automate braking or is the lifespan of these cars to long for that to be practical?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that. It's also the state of the rail, which is not great in a lot of places and cannot be repaired and kept immaculate all at once. U.S. has LOTS of track. My husband is maintenance of way (repairs/places rail and all the parts that go along with it) and they can only get to so much each year. The company allocates a certain amount of money, and only gives them permission to do certain track at certain times so that freight isn't delayed. Certain trains get delayed, like UPS and FEDEX trains during the holidays it costs MASSIVE amounts of money. Trains may get slowed or diverted and someone needs to tell the train what to do, so even if automated someone is going to need to be around. In many ways railroad companies are penny wise and pound foolish because like many other companies they go by quarterly profit and have stock holders. It may cost more in the long run to let certain tracks go and then need more extensive repairs, but they need to show profit RIGHT NOW. </p>
<p>You may ask &quot;well what about passenger trains?&quot; and I see some people already have. Passenger trains in the U.S. still have to usually run on track that runs freight and is owned by freight companies at least portions of the time. So they can't run consistent speed for long distances, which OP mentioned being a problem for automated systems. A passenger train may be able to run nearly 100mph on good high speed track, but only realistically be allowed to run 30-60 and anywhere inbetween depending on where. </p>
<p>Trains that run only passengers, and on track that are specifically devoted to those trains can be much more easily automated. In parts of europe and in Japan this is completely doable, and has been done somewhat. The state of the track is better, better maintained, often newer, and the trains run more smoothly. This is because the government subsidizes passenger rail transport, and people are ok with their tax money going to it because LOTS of people ride trains in those places. The u.s. only has small portions of track regionally, usually very locally actually, that are like this because the U.S. as a whole doesn't have a lot of rail passengers. It's a larger land area and we're much bigger on automobiles as transportation. Getting trains automated nationwide whether passenger or freight, where they can run 24/7 without personnel onboard would be extremely difficult and expensive. Expensive is the key word, because taxpayers aren't willing to subsidize costs that high when most people aren't going to see a benefit, and the freight companies certainly aren't going to pay for it; they are already tightwads with the money they allocate to maintenance, so they certainly aren't going to put MORE money into upgraded technology that isn't going to give them a large monetary payback. </p>
<p>And I understand this got extremely long and didn't answer all questions, just like OPs post, but that's because it's much more complicated than people think when discussing rail technology in regards to the U.S. I'm not sure there IS a good way to ELI5 it. </p>
<p>And it's not like some redditor is coming up with stuff that none of the bigwigs that work in the rail industry have thought of (I'm seeing a lot of &quot;well they just need to...&quot;). Management come up with novel ideas all the time that sound good in theory and try to implement them, while guys on the ground like my husband are going &quot;Uh...that's not gonna work like you think...&quot; and then inevitably they DO hit snags. </p>
<p>TL;DR:
State of the rail (it's shitty in a lot of places), Expensive (taxpayers don't want to fund/enough people won't see benefits; Rail companies don't have incentive to spend that much money on this), Size of rail system in U.S. is way too extensive and sprawling for it to be feasible (much easier to implement on smaller systems devoted to passenger rail). </p></div>		</li>

<p>We've figured out algorithms that solve this problems decades ago. And even if we let engineers decide in real time, they don't need to be on the train. They could control it remotely, and many trains at once.</p>

<p>The next step will be a system known as Positive Train Control (PTC). This system uses GPS to monitor the location of trains and will put the brakes of a train into &quot;emergency&quot; to prevent collisions.</p>
<p>You can roughly estimate the railroad spends $800~$1000 in crew cost every 250 miles. But those two crew members can be pulling the equivalent of 200-250 tractor trailers. As you can see, the cost of the crew is just a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>Oh, and on the subject of fixing brakes...
You'd have to either make the new system compatible with the old, or replace the current system on every rail car in the US. The current system works very well, so why spend the money? The cases of having a defective car are not common, but they need to be looked at by a human when they do break down.  </p></div>		</li>
