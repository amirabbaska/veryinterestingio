<p>Its the basis weight. So paper is measure by a standard pounds/area. In the US it is pounds/3000sqft.</p>
<p>So 3000sqft of 20lb paper will weight 20 pounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't even know there was a different way than what you describe as the &quot;alternate&quot; way.</p>
<p>Grams per square meter is very convenient, as the A0 paper size is exactly 1m². A4 size (almost comparable to the us &quot;letter&quot; size)  is A0 divided in half 4 times, so 1/16th of a square meter. With a default 80g/sqm paper, this means 1 sheet is exactly 5 grams.
Very useful information if you need to calculate postage for a thick letter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's &quot;simple and intuitive&quot; if you remember all of the &quot;real simple conversions.&quot;  However, very few people are going to keep in mind that because a single A4 sheet is a mass of 5g, and the French postange rate is .8 per 20g, I can send 4 sheets. wait, 3 sheets, because there's an envelope...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lots of the non-metric system things are based on human proportions and less base-10 things.  So a foot is about a foot.  A yard is about a step.  Do 1000 left-right steps and you get a mile.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Weights are trickier, but they've always been trickier -- notice that even the metric system screwed them up -- the base is &quot;meter&quot; &quot;second&quot; and &quot;KILO-gram.&quot;  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For cooking, if you pull a spoon out of your drawer that you use for stirring tea, you have a &quot;teaspoon&quot;.  If you use one that people commonly eat soup with, you have a &quot;tablespoon&quot;.  If you take a common coffee cup, you tend to have a &quot;cup&quot;.  This made recipes very simple to write down prior to everyone having a scale in their kitchen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And time is still very non-metric.  Nobody talks about &quot;hectoseconds&quot; &quot;kiloseconds&quot; or &quot;megaseconds&quot;, but instead &quot;minutes&quot;, &quot;hours&quot;, and &quot;years&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This isn't an argument saying that the non-metric systems are better.  For every scientific and trade endeavor, metric is absolutely better by far. For every engineering endeavor, metric is better, except for how much tooling still exists from a hundred years ago.  But, for people on a common everyday use, you can see the non-metric does have some uses.</p></div>		</li>
