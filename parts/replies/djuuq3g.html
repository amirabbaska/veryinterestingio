			<div class="markdown"><p>The CMB frame <em>is</em> physically meaningful and it <em>is</em> a preferred frame in cosmology in the sense that the time since the big bang is largest in the CMB frame and strictly smaller in all other frames.</p>
<p>It is not correct to say that &quot;there are no preferred frames&quot; or suggest that the choice of frame is arbitrary. That is, at best an incomplete statement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if theres an imaginary object X traveling, lets say 55% the speed of light , and another object Y  traveling 55% the speed of light in the opposite direction. Is X's speed 110% of c relative to Y?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This question is answered about 15 times in the FAQ. As a consequence of the invariance of <em>c</em>, it must be the case that relative velocities do not add linearly. In your particular scenario, if A observers B to move at 0.55<em>c</em> and B observes C to move at 0.55<em>c</em> in the same direction, then A observes C to move at about 0.84<em>c</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula" target="_blank">velocity addition</a>. In order to calculate their relative velocity, we should move from the reference frame that sees both travelling at 0.55c to one of the objects' reference frames.</p>
<p>Their relative speed to each other would be (.55c+.55c)/(1+.55c*.55c/c^2), or approximately .84c</p>
<p>This is, as /u/ZippyDan said, due to time dilation and length contraction. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor" target="_blank">Lorentz Factor</a> is what gives rise to the denominator in my calculations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, for the reasons mentioned otherwise in this thread. However, if you're stationary, and these two objects are both moving away from you, you will measure the distance between them as increasing at 1.1c.</p>
<p>But that doesn't break the rules, because your POV here isn't particularly relevant. </p></div>		</li>

<p>remember there is no such thing as absolute speed - except for the speed of light</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the speed of sound has to be relative to an object?</p></div>		</li>
