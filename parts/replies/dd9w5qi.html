<p>In the trial the prosecution either:</p>
<ul>
<li>proves you are guilty</li>
<li>not proves you are guilty</li>
</ul>
<p>The trial never proves you are not guilty.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. You cannot be found to be innocent because you are already presumed to be. The question being asked is whether you are guilty or not.</p></div>		</li>
