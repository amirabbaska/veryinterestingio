			<div class="markdown"><p>Two of the main components in wood are lignins and cellulose, both of which have melting points around 300 C. I found this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The melting point of lignin is 482 to 527°F (250 to 275°C). So lignin can melt. What about cellulose? from wikipedia, “Cellulose requires a temperature of 320 °C and pressure of 25 MPa to become amorphous in water.” So… it looks like wood might actually “melt” at least somewhat in water under high pressure and temperature.</p>

<p>So it may be &quot;possible&quot; but even simple wood components appear difficult to melt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is in fact possible to melt the lignins and cellulose in wood - there is an experimental industrial process called Wood Welding that uses friction welding equipment to bond slabs of wood together the same way that slabs of metal can be friction welded. Here is a link to the article from U. Tennessee - <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~mtaylo29/pages/Wood%20welding.htm" target="_blank">http://web.utk.edu/~mtaylo29/pages/Wood%20welding.htm</a></p>
<p>And here are a couple of videos of the process in action - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0k04hjdYuQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0k04hjdYuQ</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ho sheezy that's awesome, thanks for the extra effort! Having something like environment effecting the &quot;meltability&quot; of an object is crazy to think about when you apply it to different materials. All the things we could easily miss because we were just off with the procedure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a guitar maker, the sides of the guitar are bent using a form heated to around 200 degrees C. At this temperature the wood becomes pliable and can be bent into complex forms before it cools and becomes rigid again. Not exactly melting, but I just thought I'd mention it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I make wildfired pottery and use wood ash as a glaze from time to time. Being very basic, the wood ash is all the things in the wood that don't burn off and is generally magnesium, sodium, alumina, silica and some other stuff. At around 2300* F these will start to melt and form a rudimentary glaze on a pot. So in a sense, I would say you could melt wood (once what would burn off burns off).  </p></div>		</li>
