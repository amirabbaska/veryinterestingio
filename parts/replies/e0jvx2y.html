It also pisses down its own leg to sterilize its feet when they are covered in nasty stuff. Regardless they are essential to the world and remove dangerous bacteria like anthrax. So just remember kids, he might be ugly and a walking bag of gross, but the vulture cleans our planet for the good.</p></div>		</li>

<p>intoxicated male homo sapiens do that too, but I never knew that it was for  sanitary purposes. makes sense though. thank you!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the very reason why farmers use Bt pesticide for killing many classes of insects (especially Lepidoptera aka caterpillar/moth/butterfly). Bt is a bacteria that's harmless to us, but gives insects &quot;stomach aches&quot; and eventually their death. Because of our biological differences, Bt is so safe that conventional <strong>and</strong> organic farming use it as an effective pesticide. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, but generally not.  While the bacteria will be destroyed, the toxins they produce that will do harm have already been made, and if they are not denatured by the heat from cooking they will still cause harm.</p>
<p>I'm having a bit of trouble finding a scholarly article to back this up, so unfortunately it may be removed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microbiologist here. It depends on the toxin, but what you said is generally accepted as a way to play it safe with questionable food. In theory, some toxins could be  completely inactivated by cooking spoiled food at high temperature but there is no way for the average person to characterize what toxins are present so it's just not worth taking the chance.</p>
<p>Here's a paper that looks at the effects of heat on various Staphylococcal toxins related to food poisoning:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting, I never thought about that. Are the toxins we associate with bacteria necessarily proteins? I'm wondering if it's even possible to denature all toxins through applied heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's the thing. If you cook food that has already reached an unsafe level you will still kill the bad bacteria that was there. However you do not kill the bacteria's waste products (toxins); its poop. It's these waste products that make us sick. In conclusion even if you cooked it it would still make them sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better strategy is fermentation. You &quot;spoil&quot; the food with a microorganism that doesn't produce toxins before anything nasty can get to it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That would explain the teensy homebrew setup I found in one corner of the spiderweb outside my window.  I've been watching the most adorable production of &quot;3ml imperial stout&quot; but couldn't figure out why until now.</p></div>		</li>
