			<div class="markdown"><p>Rabies is a horrible, horrible thing. By the time identifiable  symptoms show, it is nearly always fatal. There's been less than a dozen, iirc, that have survived after becoming symptomatic; usually all treatment from that point on is palliative. </p>
<p>The incubation period is typically 30-90 days, but has been seen to last as little as 5 days or as long as 2 years. It tends to be shorter in children, those who are immuno-compromised already, and when bitten someplace close to the central nervous system. Next is the prodomal period, which is when clinical symptoms begin to show, but they're vague and hard to diagnose as rabies: malaise, fatigue, aches, fever. This progresses as it moves into other systems in the body; respiratory (cough, sore throat, dyspnea), gastro-intestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysphagia), and/or central nervous system (headache, vertigo, anxiety, apprehension, irritability). Sometimes more remarkable symptoms appear in this stage, such as priapism, photophobia, insomnia, nightmares, increased libido...and sometimes at this stage the diagnoses range anywhere from encephalitis to psychiatric disturbances to brain conditions. Parasthesia and pain around the area where the bite occurred should suggest a possibility of rabies if the physician is aware, but since the incubation can take months, sometimes the bite is forgotten. </p>
<p>The next stage is the acute neurologic period and this can take 2 forms: furious rabies, which manifests as hyperactivity, manic behavior, hydrophobia (fear of water), delerium ...or paralytic rabies, which results in a slow progressing paralysis that begins at the bite site and spreads throughout the body. At this point, all treatments are palliative, meaning their only aid is to relieve pain and make the patient comfortable. </p>
<p>If you're ever bitten by a wild animal, wash the site immediately and go to the doctor. If the animal can be found, it can be tested for rabies. If not, the doctor will most likely chose to go with postexposure prophylaxis, which includes a shot of rabies immune globulin, administered close to the bite wound, and a series of shots with the rabies vaccine over a period of a couple weeks. All of this is designed to prevent the rabies virus from taking hold. Once it does, there's little that can be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was bitten by a German Shepherd when I was around 12 and was admitted to the hospital for two days for wound care (salt-water treatments followed by re-dressing the wounds repeatedly throughout the day since it's inadvisable to stitch animal bitesâ€”lest you seal the infection). We knew the owner of the dog so we waited a period of time to see if the dog became symptomatic. If it did, the shots were coming for me. Fortunately the dog did not have rabies and I did not get an infection in my hands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a horror movie story. I thought rabies either kills you within several days or you're fine, but 2 years... omg. How is it even possible for it to progress so slowly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, those symptoms are crazy, it sounds like an episode of House MD.</p>
<p>I looked it up and sure enough, season 1 episode 10. The episode is notable for the first time the patient died.</p></div>		</li>
