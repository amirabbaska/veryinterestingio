			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so not everyone has this?? I always just thought it is how eyes work in the dark. It would keep me up at night when I was a kid because I never knew what the heck I was seeing. </p>
<p>Edit: Even in the daytime/dim lighting I notice it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup everyone else sees just black in the dark, supposedly. As a kid I used to think that it meant we were all in the matrix. </p>
<p>It's pretty distracting when stargazing, some stars get as dim as the noise which messes with my perception and causes them to jump around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the link.  The wikipedia article doesn't explicitly say it, but it sure seems like chronic ever-present ongong &quot;fight or flight&quot; triggering stress could be a obvious upstream cause of this.  </p>
<p>Sympathetic nervous system activation involves intense mental activity, some of which is self-reinforcing, and it certainly would normally include massive amounts of visual cortex stimulation, or overstimulation, possibly leading to this condition, no?  </p>
<p>Humans need real and regular rest for all body systems, including visual, in order to be healthy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting. I have GAD, SAD, insomnia, and depression, and also some pretty annoying visual snow (and &quot;ice-pick&quot; headaches, just to throw that in there too since the only other person I know who has visual snow, ALSO gets ice-pick headaches).</p></div>		</li>
