			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to comment that the &quot;hemispheres of plutonium&quot; is why in certain &quot;spy&quot; movies when the bad guy is going through his plan to blow up a location with a nuke, they open a case holding 1-2 half-spheres of material (usually referred to as plutonium).</p>
<p>There was a particular James Bond movie that showed a hemisphere of plutonium, I've seen a couple others as well.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Their estimated explosive forces are of the same magnitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would argue that they are on the same <em>order</em> of magnitude, but Little Boy had a 15 kt yield, while Fat Man had a 21 kt yield.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fat Man used an implosion-type design that pushed two hemisphere of plutonium together</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was actually only one sphere of plutonium; the shaped charges around it compressed it, the higher density being what made it go supercritical.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You have that backwards.  The Cup was accelerated onto the Rod.  <em>Little Boy</em> was female.</p></div>		</li>
