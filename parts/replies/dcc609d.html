<p>I'm not sure I understand this.  An hour does not equal an instant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instant as in after that dosage you fall over dead, you do not die of radiation poisoning a week later, months later, or of cancer in 20 years.  If you receive that dosage that takes an hour to absorb you will fall over dead.</p>
<p>So, no not enough of a dosage to be exposed by walking into the room and instadeath but stacked against the length of a human life 1 hour is pretty instant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It means you would drop dead from the effects at that point during exposure, as opposed to expiring later from lingering effects of a smaller dose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As in after a few minutes exposure, you are dead, but it will take a week or two to die, give it an hour and you will be dead by the end of that hour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That quote from the beginning of the article radiation data from around the time of the disaster. This quote further down says it was measured again 10 years later and it was emitting 1/10th of that radiation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this photo was taken, 10 years after the disaster, the Elephant’s Foot was only emitting one-tenth of the radiation it once had. Still, merely 500 seconds of exposure at this level would bring on mild radiation sickness, and a little over an hour of exposure would prove fatal. The Elephant’s Foot is still dangerous, but human curiosity and attempts to contain our mistakes keep us coming back to it.</p>
