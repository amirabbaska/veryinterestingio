			<div class="markdown"><p>People like to talk about how the government is awful at its job and fails all the time. But lots of the time the reason is that what they are trying to solve is simply hard to solve. </p>
<p>As an example: You sound like a person who cares about the environment/global warming. But I bet you're still using electricity produced using a mix of coal and other means. You are probably still driving an internal combustion engine and buying food and products produced and transported using an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>You are probably pretty similar to me. I DO care about the environment but I still drive a car. If the government legislated that I could no longer drive my car, I would not suddenly have a better option, I would have <em>fewer</em> total options and it would get much harder for me to get around.</p>
<p>I think the government could be doing more, but I will keep in mind that the solution is not easy or simple. </p></div>		</li>
