<p>Movies have to do all of these steps before they are released and, generally, have to do each one every time they make a movie. </p>

<p>To expand on this, GOT is kind of unique in having a 52 week a year production schedule. Most shows have lengthy breaks in production, and frequently operate only a couple months ahead of their air dates. GOT however multitasks its crews, so while you've got VFX and post production people working on one season, the showrunners are already writing the next. Nobody (except maybe the showrunners) is working constantly, but the production is never not in gear. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think there's something fundamental regarding the studio+director system as opposed to the network+showrunner system? Perhaps because tv has more help, in terms of staff (costume, cameras, etc.) instead of assembling a squad piecemeal? I wonder too if there isn't a sense of preciousness with a 2-hr film vs. a 10-hour (or 26-hour) season. It's not such a big deal if you get a scene &quot;wrong&quot; with a weekly drama. There's still time to correct the plotline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking at VFX jobs about a year ago for that film that had a contract end-date three weeks from release.  Long gone are the days of waiting for reels to go to print with digital copies on hard drives being distributed to theaters. </p>
<p>&quot;Picture lock&quot;, meaning the the visual edit of the film will happen pretty far in advance so that the composer and audio mix +dubbing have time to work. </p></div>		</li>
