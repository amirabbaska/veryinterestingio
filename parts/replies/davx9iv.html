			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's all the countries (no states ((or territories like Greenland)), former countries) if anyone wanted</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>Scotland</p>
<p>Finland</p>
<p>Netherlands</p>
<p>Ireland</p>
<p>Poland</p>
<p>Switzerland</p>
<p>Swaziland</p>
<p>Thailand</p>
<p>New Zealand</p>
<p>Germany (Deutschland)  </p>
<p>Edit: So because I included England, it's not <em>technically</em> independent according to some as it's part of the UK, the same reasoning as excluding Greenland. So I have to include Northern Ireland too. Also, I forgot</p>
<p>Iceland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of those don't have land in their original language. Suomi, Die Schweiz. A lot of languages don't seem to do this much. German, English, Dutch use land a lot.</p>
<p>How about 'stan'. Is it used in Pasjtoe too? Edit: reading other comments, it seems they do.</p>
<p>Does 'ska' mean 'land' in Polish? (Cause it's Polska over there.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, -ska is just -ish (not that -ish that is 'somewhat', but just  adjectificator). The full name is Rzeczpospolita Polska which directly translates into &quot;Polish Republic&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also German is a good example though I should mention in your list 'Die Schweiz' is in fact German and so is Österreich- reich meaning kingdom or domain- somewhere down below someone also mentioned Sweden ending in rige/rike which may also be the same. </p>
<p>Deutschland refers to the area we call Germany. In this area there are different member states called bundesländer note again land. Each of them have names like West Rheinland. Though it should be mentioned not all of them end in land. </p>
<p>The name Schweitz most likely came from the city Swych which was a prominent feudal town since the 1200's though in Swiss its Schwiiz for the country and swych for the city... </p>
<p>Oddly the state was also named Helvetia by the Romans and if you look back many states ended in -(t)ia in Latin. </p>
<p>Edit: punctuation </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some countries are lost in translation. Sweden is Sverige in Swedish,  and derives from &quot;Svea Rike&quot;, meaning &quot;land of the Svea&quot;. So you could do a rough translation and say &quot;land of the swedes&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that English did use to use something similar to &quot;swedeland&quot;  when referring to Sweden however during Sweden's rise to prominence within Europe it was dropped to be just &quot;Sweden&quot; similar to what Dutch and German did with Poland (Polen) but English didn't (Poland).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Either way I'm pretty confident it's not pretentious.</p></div>		</li>
