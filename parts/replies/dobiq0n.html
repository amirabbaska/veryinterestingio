			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you might have missed that OP wrote &quot;<em>mammals</em>&quot; because there are no examples of female mammals being larger than their male counterparts in the link you provided. Plenty of examples in other animals though. Under Mammals there is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, the males are significantly larger than the females at birth in sea lion pups</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And additional some explanations as to why it's usually so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The large sexual size dimorphism is due to sexual selection, but also because females reach reproductive age much earlier than males. In addition the males do not provide parental care for the young and allocate more energy to growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick google did lead to this [warning pdf]: <a href="https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/11651/Ralls1976c.pdf" target="_blank">https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/11651/Ralls1976c.pdf</a></p>
<p>Page 6/250, the list of animals have all been given a number:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Status categories: 1, females larger than males; 2, females possibly larger than males; 3, statements in literature that females are larger than
males but with few or no data; 4, difference in size between females and males not or probably not significant; 5, although statements exist
that females are larger than males, best data available show that males are larger or probably larger</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are several examples of mammals being larger than males.</p>
<p>Some examples of category 1 and 2, often with a bunch of subspecies:</p>
<p>Shrews</p>
<p>Bats</p>
<p>Marmosets</p>
<p>rabbits</p>
<p>Flying squirrel</p>
<p>Golden Hamster </p>
<p>Mice</p>
<p>Chinchilla</p>
<p>Various whales</p>
<p>Spotted Hyena (but not striped or brown hyena, they're category 4)</p>
<p>Seals</p>
<hr />
<p>It's funny how there are several category 1 seals, with the females being reported larger than males, but in elephant seals, you find some of the most striking example of males being larger than females. Spotted hyenas also seems weirdly out of place, there're plenty of sea mammals, then small rodents, bats, and then hyenas. </p></div>		</li>
