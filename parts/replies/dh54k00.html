			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a fair comparison between steam and water - firstly, only a small amount of water is actually in contact with your hand in the case of liquid water, and steam deposits a <em>lot</em> of energy very quickly by condensing and releasing latent heat. That's why steam is so effective at transferring energy and why 100^(o)C steam will scald much more than 200^(o)C air.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're right, I didn't intend to compare their energy qualities, just give an example of the volume of the same mass and how far spread out the mass is. Water is more relatable than liquid air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But none that makes ovens bad. It just makes them different. A microwave can't bake up a crispy crust on a bread or a pizza, nor oven fry delicious chicken. But a microwave is great at cooking fluffy eggs,  heating water or beverages, or reheating most things; you can even roast a chicken in it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>poster above worded it awkwardly but i think they meant to say &quot;slow&quot; rather than &quot;bad&quot;... as in everyone is talking about why microwaves are fast but nobody is talking about how ovens are actually pretty slow at transferring heat, compared to other methods. </p>
<p>not bad as in make bad food but bad at heat transfer. relatively. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you are confusing rubbery vomit inducing substance with fluffy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See my edit and u/cptahb is correct. In the context of the question, it is 'bad' relative to microwaves when the question focused on time required.</p></div>		</li>
