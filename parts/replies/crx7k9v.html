			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, suppose we wanted to know how many coins we'd need smashed one atom thick to cover Earth's surface. Working backwards through the aforementioned calculations, it would require 50.2 billion coins. For comparison, everybody alive on earth today would need 7.7 coins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After reading this I wanted to see how much silver there is on Earth</p>
<p>so with the power of google I found there's apparently <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-01/visualizing-all-silver-world" target="_blank">1,411,475 tonnes of silver, currently in existence and &quot;lost throughout history&quot;</a>, and unless I'm stupid that's 45,379,975,000 (43 billion) troy ounces of silver. So that'd cover about 90 percent of earth.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the amount of silver is accurate (it was the first result, maybe you have a more accurate number) and I think it only includes mined silver, I have no idea how to figure out the un-mined amount of silver left (can that even be figured out? or estimated at least?)</p>
<p>again, this is back of a napkin math mostly based on your two posts, and I don't want anybody thinking I know what I'm talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. Or another idea along that line, if you mined all the silver (or any element) from earth's crust and processes it to be one atom thick, how much surface area could we cover. It's an intriguing concept to consider how much of some elements we have, and how little of others, when thought of as a single piece.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically HCP only refers to bulk materials because it implies stacking order of the atomic layers.  Surfaces simply use a 2D hexagonal lattice.</p>
<p>Excellent answer, though.  Nice to see another materials scientist on here.</p></div>		</li>
