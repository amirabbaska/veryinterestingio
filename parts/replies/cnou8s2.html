			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, a 2nd main reason is Day 1 DLC. Its the business practice of giving us 75% of a game then charging us extra for the other 25%. In the past, any extra DLC came months if not years after the initial release. It was always fun to buy the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; Edition of Elder Scrolls, or Fallout  years later because it had all of the extra stuff that wasn't around when I first played through. Now the extra is around, just not given to included.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This game is the reason I don't buy immediately after release anymore.  It's kind of like the media industry in that they beat a show into the ground just milk every last dime. Thank God that Firefly died early so that it didn't see the last season horrors that Scrubs endured. </p>
<p>I know that Battlefield 4 is meant to be more of an online game but next time just don't even release a shitty campaign and focus on debugging the multilayer. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Preordered the game, bought season pass, bought dlc characters, bought some cosmetics for Zer0, and the headhunter. When I permanently switched to PC from the 360, I wanted to play the games again. Well, I bought Borderlands GOTY but Borderlands 2 GOTY was missing out on a bunch of content. Some that was released before GOTY came out.</p>
<p>I randomly found the complete edition at MacGamesStore when buying Civ V and bought it. Fuck not having all the content in a GOTY edition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Preorders allow devs to make money off of bad games. There's no reason for them to change their business structure if their lazy method is currently profitable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>FTFY. If you have never heard of working conditions in gamedev studios, it is generally push, push, push from management to ship, regardless of current issues. 12 hour days, 7 days a week (EA, I'm looking at you) due to unrealistic release dates with no time to fix bugs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>He lives like 10 minutes from work and frequently works late and comes home to just crash and do it again.  Sleeping under desks is common from what I hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But don't preorders just magnify the issue for specific ship dates, forcing devs to release extra buggy games just to get them out the door in time?</p>
<p>Wouldn't easing up on the things that force games out buggy, and help hide bugs when they are released, help buy more time for devs to find and fix the bugs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pre-ordering is also an obsolete system in the era of being able to day one digitally download a lot of AAA titles. Pre-ordering was only a worthwhile thing when you could guarantee yourself a physical copy of the game. </p>
<p>I've preordered like four games over the course of my life, most of them in the PS1/N64 era. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of this, when was the last time a retail store did not have enough copies for a game? When GTA 5 came out, there were plenty of copies left over at the store I went to a few days after release. The whole concept of demand overwhelming supply is pretty much gone. Now they throw in stupid extras and meaningless additives to entice people to still preorder.</p>
<p>Edit: people are making anecdotal claims that Nintendo games do have shortages on release. Because nintendo releases more unique exclusive games and has a more niche platform gaming structure, it doesn't necessarily reflect the other gaming systems and PC. Therefore, Nintendo can still be worthwhile for preordering. However, Nintendo has much more control over AAA Exclusive releases, and would never resort to the problems we are discussing in this thread with PS4/XBone/PC titles that are big on debut, multiplatform, and typically promote pre-orders to a much higher degree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. You can thank GameStop for preorders still being a thing.</p>
<p>However, <strong><em>remember that gamers demanded preorders remain a thing</em></strong>. Microsoft was set to remove companies like GameStop from the XBOne market completely. They caved after Sony released that &quot;this is how game sharing will work on PS4&quot; commercial where one guy handed a game to another guy because <strong><em>gamers</em></strong> made noise about it.</p>
<p>Pre-orders will die when gamers stop pre-ordering. Not before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It honestly doesn't help when they offer a preorder &quot;bonus&quot;, namely x amount of extra campaign missions. If this trend continues you're gonna have to preorder a game that has the last storyline campaign mission vital to the story of the game.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is why I think stop or at least lower the amount of pre-ordering is good now because if they can get away with less in the future they will have less room to pull moves like that. An individual is next to powerless as a group we are a giant.</p></div>		</li>

IG gets even shadier when you realize that the content you paid for was already on your disc/installed on your computer.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. And Ubisoft is taking this to a new level. Instead of getting extra content they just give you a mild cheat. The Watch Dogs &quot;bonus&quot; I remember was an ATM hack that gave you more money. The bonus on The Crew was an early unlock of a couple vehicles. They literally changed a zero to a one and called it a preorder bonus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my new mantra too, for the past year now. there used to be a time where i would gladly hand over $60 for a pretty looking well polished game before it came out.</p>
<p>then dead island came out and was unplayable for 24 hours.</p>
<p>i was finding it more and more true that these blockbuster games werent as good as some of the indie games that cost 1/4th the price. as of now i havent purchased a single $60 title since Dark Souls 2 came out. and i dont know when i will. (bloodborne and xenoblade chronicles for sure)</p>
<p>i have been buying a lot more handheld titles too. so theres that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Games are simply not worth $60 any more. There is ALWAYS something wrong with games these days when they get released. So yeah I'll wait, I'll wait a year or so when the game is fully patched and ready, includes all DLC's and whatnot at 75%. Let others pay the full price it's their problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hell yeah.  I've never preordered a game in my life.  I don't really care about day 1...I usually just wait for the first sale on something new and get it then.  Hell, now that I think about it, I think that I've only bought a game at full price once.  And that was Bioshock: Infinite.  Totally worth it, but the older I get, and, ironically, the more disposable income I have, the less I'm willing to pay $60 for the privilege of a timely game.</p>
<p>If the game is worth playing, it's worth playing 2 months after its release.</p></div>		</li>
