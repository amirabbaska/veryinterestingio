			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also a matter of transferring nervous energy.. So is foot tapping, leg shaking etc. If you're anxious your body is pumping adrenalin into your blood, if there is no real threat and you are in class or work you need to dispel the excess energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Youve obviously never been to new jersey or new york</p>
<p>The cops get called for false shots fired tips all the time because some schmuck is smacking their gum so loud</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chewing gum is so disgusting. Think about it. What the gum is actually doing is removing tiny particles of food stuck in your teeth and you're chewing on <em>that</em>. shudder</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was taking a pretty big test where there was moderator hired to come in. Any talking whatsoever would mean immediate fail. This girl next to me was chewing a piece of gum like a puppy gnawing on a new bone. The dead silent room made it even worse. I raised my hand, the moderator came over and I told her &quot;the girl next to me needs to stop chewing that gum right now or I'm going to flip out.&quot; She walked over to the girl and made her spit it out immediately, then she cried (the girl not the moderator.)</p>
<p>I know that story wasn't very interesting and I'm not even sure why I typed the whole thing but it's been a couple years since it happened and I still can't get over how obnoxious it was. Her trick to chew gum and concentrate better destroyed any concentration I hoped to have. I would have been more focused with an air horn directly in the ear. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once looked up during a physics exam to my teacher holding a roll of duck tape and moving towards my foot. Apparently I had been tapping my foot unconciously at a very high speed since the test started a few minutes prior and since I had headphones in I didn't hear the desk squeeking or notice the entire class staring at me. Perfectly justified tbh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently ended a class wherein I sat next to a (mid 40s woman, older than old enough to know better) who would chew gum every class. Wait...not chew, SMACK. She would smack her gum for the entire 5 hours. I gave her &quot;the look&quot; a few times...she'd just glare and, even more loudly, SMACK. Worse than a cow chewing cud...rolling it around in her wide open mouth...SMACK!</p></div>		</li>
