			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you believe that segmenting my sleep the same way you did would affect my cognition? Say I get 4 hours of sleep and then go to class, won't I be impaired cognitively even if I will be sleeping 4 hours in the afternoon?</p>
<p>Smart note on the entrepreneur thing, never thought of that, that would motivate them to work harder, in YOUR company, lol.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that link, so personally I got used to feeling tired around 4 am, so is it wrong if I sleep at that time if there is no REM sleep at that time in the table and more later like at around 4:40am? I know little about sleep, and would like to make sure I get the most of it. Currently, I am trying to adjust my sleep from 11:30 am and wake up at 6:30am.(7 hours of sleep) I am no longer going to sleep 3 hours or less than 7 hours regularly, I learned it's making me inefficient even if I have more time awake available.(I thought otherwise)</p>
<p>Thanks alot!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You won't know unless you try... but it did affect me.</p>
<p>I could be active physically, but mentally I was hazy until after my afternoon sleep cycle.</p>
<p>You also need to account 30-60mins for each sleep session because you need time to rest and fall asleep, which is also time wasted.</p></div>		</li>
