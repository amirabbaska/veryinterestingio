<p>we almost never find cancer in the heart is because the cells have terminally differentiated and mostly stopped dividing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun fact: IIRC according to one theory, during the due course of evolution, humans traded off the capability to regenerate heart cells—which require the heart cells to be in a more &quot;primitive&quot; state wherein they aren't as good at contracting and expanding—to make sure large enough mammals like humans can maintain healthy blood circulation and proper pressure to have blood reach our extremities (especially since we stand up against gravity and our all-important organ, the brain, is at a much higher level). One by product of this was that now our differentiated heart cells were less susceptible to heart cancer, and hence was &quot;naturally selected&quot; for. If cells don't keep dividing and replicating, there can't be uncontrolled cell division and growth, and hence it can't ever give rise to a &quot;cancer&quot;. So while a lot of our smaller friends like zebrafish, newts, even neonatal mice, (yes!) can successfully regenerate heart cells, humans can't. </p>
<p>A small price to pay perhaps? :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Large animals that aren't sexually mature until after reaching full size have every reason to have anti-cancer measures; elephants have IIRC redundancy in their genomes for that.</p>
<p>After all, elephant cells, human cells and mouse cells are about the same size, so total cell count is a factor. The more cells you have, the more likely it is for one of them to become cancerous. If you have to have several tons of cells before being able to reproduce, you better invest in avoiding cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is certainly less selective pressure against cancers that affect older people. But, it is generally thought that humans have long lives because they confer survival benefits past &quot;passing on their genes.&quot; To the extent that parenting and grandparenting provides survival benefit to kids, there are selective pressures against cancers at this age. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly humans have evolved to favour longevity as a survival benefit. Where as animals like salmon die immediately after passing on their genes we don’t, I believe that the prevailing theory is that older humans have experience and could help protect and teach younger humans. According to this theory families where the elders survived longer were more successful in passing on genes and as such here we are with lifespans that last much longer our reproductive prime. This isn’t limited to us by any means and actually applies to some primates and elephants, who also have a developed sense of family.</p></div>		</li>

<p>we do not yet know how to repair the dead part of tissue, since the cells do not divide to do it by themselves. Cancer needs cells that are proliferating to gain traction, so these won't do!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you use stem-cells to grow the part required, like they did initially?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what you mean by ‘clinically’ but we can certainly turn embryonic stem cells to cardiac cells. I routinely do so in my research. The challenge is in turning the cells into functional, aligned tissue that will integrate with an existing heart. As well as the risks and ethical issues associated with embryonic stem cell transplantation and the rejection risk associated with any transplant that isn’t autologous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That 0.0017% number is from an autopsy study that is quite a bit lower than other estimates of incidence, which suggest somewhere between <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1556086415306304" target="_blank">0.03% and 0.07%</a>. This is far from being something that basically never happens, and means that there are on the order of hundreds of cases a year. I myself have seen two of these cases. Again, they are rare, but they do happen. There are cancers so rare that there are only a handful of case reports in this single digits. These are closer to what I think of as basically never happening. </p></div>		</li>
