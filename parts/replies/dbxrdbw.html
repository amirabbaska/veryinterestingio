			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically he needed to charge a path into the ionosphere, because that would essentially clear the way for the energy transmission. A somewhat similar concept is an electrolaser, which uses a laser beam to excite particles in the air and allow a bolt of electricity to travel down that path of charged particles. That's probably why he was trying to use UV spotlights at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice explanation!</p>
<p>Now, assume the apparatus was built and put in operation. What would the safety by like for us ordinary people, living between two conductive plates? Any vertical conductive rod would become charged, would it not? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, given the assumptions in the description, direct danger would be low actually. You can't reach high enough to complete the circuit without building a conductor reaching upwards from skyscrapers and such. Might give lightning storms a dangerous kick though.</p>
<p>Practically speaking however, space travel, satellites, etc. would all be screwed over and probably wouldn't work at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why would this break space travel, satellites, etc.? Would it just fry anything going through the atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rods already become charged.  But it's DC, from thunderstorms.   You'll get about 100 to 300 volts per meter of elevation.   (People often get shocks from ham radio antenna towers.)</p>
<p>The big difference is that Tesla's version would be AC, not a constant DC high voltage like the Earth's constant &quot;clear-weather voltage.&quot;</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.rexresearch.com/jefimenko/jefimenko.htm" target="_blank">project article about building plastic DC motors</a> which are powered by a hundred-foot antenna lifted by a balloon.  They're run by the distant thunderstorms all over the earth.   Less than one-thousandth HP though.</p></div>		</li>
