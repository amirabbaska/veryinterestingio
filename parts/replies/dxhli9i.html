			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe that figure of $2B-3B market for REMs is correct. <a href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/rare-earth-metals-market" target="_blank">This recent industry report and forecast</a> states in 2016 it was  over $9B  and and projected to surge to $20B by 2024. Even the rare magnetic market alone is nearly $2B and expected to get to $5B by 2024, largely due to use in hybrid cars.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Growing demand for magnets in automobiles, and energy generation will majorly contribute to the growth of global rare earth metals market over the forecast period. The demand for rare earth magnets is majorly increasing by their consumption in electric and hybrid vehicles, and wind turbines. Increasing focus on utilizing clean and renewable energy is giving a substantial pressure on the electricity providers, to generate energy through renewable sources, which in turn will show a positive impact on the growth of this market.</p>
<p>High performance of rare earth magnets at very high temperatures, coupled with high corrosion resistance will significantly help the market to grow at a higher rate over the forecast period. These factors will also increase the demand for rare earth’s in wind turbine applications, as other metals cannot substitute them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With over 90% of the global production of REMs currently just from China along with continuing increases in demand, other nations/companies will be more aggressive in seeking out their own means for production -- with deep sea mining likely a top source. </p>
<p>Deep sea oil drilling operations are abound and only increasing. And despite better safety regulations in the US (only after the BP/Deepwater spill) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-drilling-offshore/u-s-government-proposes-easing-offshore-oil-drilling-safety-regulations-idUSKBN1EM1XJ" target="_blank">they may not be long-lived with proposal to ease them.</a></p>
<p>Many insiders and analysts are expecting a boom in deep sea mining in coming years as greater depths being increasingly viable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/robots-part-of-a-gold-rush-under-the-sea-1.3019107" target="_blank">For example, Nautilus based in Canada will be mining for copper/gold/silver etc. using a first -- robots -- at depths of 1,600 meters near Papa New Guinea in early 2019.</a> </p>
<p>That's when the ISA plans to complete its safety regulations and licensees can move from exploration to  actual mining.</p>
<p>If demand/prices of certain REMs increase to a certain point, it seems that deep sea mining operations will be in the works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is mined and when will come down to metal price and costs, says Wheeler. “Economics will determine whether this goes ahead,” says McClenaghan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>China has several exploratory licenses from the ISA -- and have alrdy acquired mines from  Nautilus as well as similar deep sea ROV technology companies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“China has more mining exploration areas in international waters than any other country — in line with its higher mineral demand,” says Stef Kapusniak, an engineer at SMD, a UK-based company that is one of the largest manufacturers of remotely operated deep-sea vehicles. SMD was acquired by a subsidiary of Chinese state-owned railroad and manufacturing behemoth CRRC, in 2015. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They used to say similar things about the manganese nodules found all over the ocean floor, sometimes in high concentrations.  ... The nodules are much easier to harvest than the mud this article refers to, but despite people having been working on it since the 1970s no economically feasible method has been developed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, a lot of the hype about the undersea riches of manganese nodule mining in the 1970s was related to the Glomar Explorer, a ship that was supposedly going to study ways to mine manganese nodules, but which was actually a cover story for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Azorian" target="_blank">Project Azorian</a>, a secret CIA mission to recover a sunken Russian submarine.</p>
<p>Point being, this rare earth deposit is less practical to mine than a resource that was only useful as a Cold War cover story.</p></div>		</li>
