			<div class="markdown"><p>Some guys still tackle violently in Rugby. There was one player, whose name I can't recall at the moment, who played for a team in the pacific islands, maybe Tonga or Fiji, who was nicknamed The Assassin because he hit guys so hard during tackles. I remember watching a compilation of his tackles and I honestly thought he killed someone with one of them until the guy got up a minute later.</p>
<p>But yes, by and large, Rugby Union players don't use excessive force and, also, high tackles are illegal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In rugby if you try to play at 100% you're going to hurt yourself just as much as the other player.  So most players don't play full out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Playing rugby you have to commit to tackles though, if you don't you get hurt. You have to play at 100%, it's just that the 100% is lower</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true at all. You better be going at 100% or you are going to get trucked and/or hurt. You can definitely go 100% and destroy a guy without being injured yourself. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, without padding, rugby players are less likely to launch themselves into each other with reckless abandon.  </p>

<p>This is an understated effect of padding and such in sports. Boxing became many times more deadly once the gloves were added, because people stopped breaking their hands on heads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of responses defending rugby's violence, but the point stands. American and Canadian football are the hardest-hitting team sports in terms of quantity and force of hits, period.</p></div>		</li>
