<p>Each half of our eyes goes to opposite hemispheres. Very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's crazy. Are the two paths from each eye related to particular areas of the retina? Like the left field of our left eye goes to the right hemisphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The brain separates our vision based on field of view which is determined by location in the retina. Even more, the brain separates contrast, color, and motion and sends that information to different areas in the brain. They are recombined after individual processing.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>since the brain uses the minuscule time difference between the sound arriving in each ear to determine location.</p>

<p>ohhhhhhh is that how that works? I always wondered how it felt like I could close my eyes and still see the sound source, and then also marveled at how it felt like I could see the sound source with my eyes open even when there was no visible movement to link it to, like looking at a speaker and not seeing any movement but knowing it's coming directly from that speaker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also how &quot;virtual surround sound&quot; works in headsets and other stereo setups. The left and right speakers adopt a tiny delay between them to try to mimic what you might hear in real life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I always wondered how my Logitech virtual 7.1s worked. Do they add some kind of reverb or some other effect as well? I swear the spacing sounds totally different when I flip the switch, it sounds more distant and surrounding. Yet at the end of the day, keeping it on regular stereo mode sounds higher quality.</p>
<p>It's weird how real the spatial differences sound when doing the surround test though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question. Homonymous Hemianopsia. Since the visual field is missing one half, how does this affect things? Does it affect anything at all? It's my understanding that it results from a stroke, so the region of the brain wouldn't receive anything anyway.... Curiosity is running away with me. But, even if the reason the field of vision is halved is because that portion of the brain is dead, would that affect anything else? (in a scenario where the damage was limited to just the visual area.)</p></div>		</li>
