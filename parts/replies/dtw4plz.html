			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be amazed at what the human body can adapt to. There was once a guy in Scotland I want to say, he got his car stuck in the snow in some remote area, and was stranded. He basically hibernated in his car and lived for like a month without food just eating snow to stay barely hydrated.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more amazing to me that people who are that obese can afford to be that obese.  It costs a lot to eat 10,000 calories a day.  It costs money to not be able to work.  Welfare/disability doesn't make you rich and you'd have to be to afford that much food every day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the fact that we never got that fat is why we can now get that fat.  If we'd spent the last million years dealing with the ability to get morbidly obese it's a lot more likely that we'd have evolved a limit to size or a reaction to obesity.  It's only a thing now because it's such a novel situation. </p></div>		</li>
