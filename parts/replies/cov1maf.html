			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first point is entirely correct, and answers the question.</p>
<p>Pot, however, is a decent amount of cartel income.  <a href="http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/study-legalization-cut-cartel-profits-by-30" target="_blank">This</a> is a good article on it.</p>
<p>The TL;DR. is that many estimate about 30% of cartel profit comes from marijuana. </p>
<p>I think that actually <em>would</em> be a good dent, and makes an argument for the U.S. to legalize marijuana.</p>
<p>edit: changed &quot;decriminalize&quot; to &quot;legalize&quot;, because only legalization cuts funding from drug cartels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You mean legalize.</p>
<p>Decriminalize = still illegal, but users only get a fine. So it's still sold by the cartels.</p>
<p>Legalize = sold by legal companies / the government, not cartels.</p>
<p>It's the difference between Al Capone selling your alcohol and Jim Beam/Budweiser selling it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my neck of Colorado, weed has been decriminalized for the last forty years or so. I've had the police to my apartment (unrelated) and they didn't bat an eye at the Gandalf bubbler, ashtray and pickle jar of herb on my coffee table. However, if you get violent, drunk behind the wheel or other socially unacceptable behavior you would likely be charged with the possession. They only used it to strengthen the charges against people that are causing problems.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose decent is a subjective term in this case... </p>
<p>As for the articles I have read, marijuana is not really a decent part of their income... cartels have in fact moved past drugs as a main source of income, and they now rely on kidnapping, extortion, theft of oil which is then sold to companies in the US and other countries at a significant markup. Also the cartels have moved into the realm of illegal mining, since rare earths are extremely valuable. </p>
<p>So 30% of a given cartels drug profits may come from pot, but drugs make up less of a portion of their total profits than they used to. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also extremely unlikely that it would blank their marijuana income.  Mining minerals is perfectly legal yet the <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/03/17/mexican-drug-cartel-moves-from-meth-to-iron-ore-mining/" target="_blank">drug cartels make an estimated 1-1.5 Billion off of it per year</a>. </p>
<p>Make marijuana legal and the cartels will just find a way to skim off the top while simultaneously fulfilling the black market desire for cheaper weed.  </p>
<p>People keep saying &quot;Take away 30% of their income!!&quot; but that's a fallacy.  Legalizing marijuana might make a small dent, but you're crazy if you think they're going to go &quot;well, it's legal, time to pack it in...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah uh no. that's like saying mark cuban would go bankrupt if he lost 30% overnight. when you are filthy rich, you can live without it. as far as the cartels, a 30% loss would be nothing. we are talking billions billions billions and billions a month become billions billions and billions. they will continue their work and continue to make more money than they know what to do with. that's like budweiser not being able to sell bud heavy anymore. their money maker is bud light anyways, they'd be fine</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would make a dent... 20-30% if memory serves.</p>
<p>Not a magic fix all, but it is a decent chunk.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit:  I hate spouting numbers without offering <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-us-marijuana-legalization-would-hurt-mexican-cartels/" target="_blank">sauce</a>. </p>
<p>It should be noted though that these ARE businesses and they're not idiots.  They will diversify their assets and not lose a full 30%.  It's just that this 30% is really low hanging fruit for them.  Easy, stable, printing cash type of money.  </p>
<p>So definitely not a silver bullet, but I'd rather that money be legal, taxed, and used to fix potholes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed and making the business with drugs legal woudn't reduce their income by 30% (assuming that's really the income from drugs). Only if you assume that they would stop selling drugs alltogether. But I bet they would still keep on selling drugs. So, the income from drugs might sink a little but not completely. Heck, if they have good businessmen they might even get more money from drug trade, as the number of customers might even rise. And legalizing drugs wouldn't eradicate the black market for drugs. E.g., there is a huge black market for cigarettes in Germany, even though cigarettes are legal  <a href="http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin-aktuell/article123566770/Wo-die-illegalen-Zigarettenhaendler-in-Berlin-operieren.html" target="_blank">http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin-aktuell/article123566770/Wo-die-illegalen-Zigarettenhaendler-in-Berlin-operieren.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it is people smuggling rather than trafficking as such. It's all a bit mixed together and the smuggling of people as &quot;slaves&quot; does happen as well but a lot of the people the coyotes are bringing in actually want to go to the US and are paying the cartels to be smuggled across the border. Most of it probably isn't what you are thinking of when you say &quot;steal a person&quot; although there is certainly exploitation. </p>
