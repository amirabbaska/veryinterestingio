			<div class="markdown"><p>90% of the things you &quot;can't get out&quot; are tiny scratches from the actual object, that keep irritating the eye and hurting although the object itself fell out long ago.  (These scratches heal pretty fast, the cornea has amazing regenerative ability.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing ever goes behind your eyeball. Your eyelids are actually attached to the eyeball so there are only small pockets where eyelashes can end up. So if you get eyelashes stuck behind your eyelid you will usually find them by just pulling back the lid until you see the bottom of the pocket. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not quite true. That dried crusty stuff is actually the tears and protein that normally lubricates your eyes. When you're awake, and your eye is moving, all of that lubricant goes across the eye from the lacrimal gland in the upper outer part of the eye to small ducts that take it from the eye to the nose. When you're asleep, not only does gravity pull that lubricant out of your eye before it can exit the proper way, but your eye also doesn't move, which keeps it from traveling appropriately. Instead, it comes out of the eye and dries up and boom! Morning eye gunk.</p></div>		</li>
