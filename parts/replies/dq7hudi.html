			<div class="markdown"><p>Why are we protesting Verizon stores? That will do nothing... we should be protesting at city halls and outside our representatives offices, you know government buildings since they're the once enforcing this. Verizon is not suddenly going to back off if we protest their stores and what about Comcast and AT&amp;T you dont think they are involved? These protest are going to be a waste of time if they are at random stores in shopping centers and malls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And? Like I said Verizon isnt gonna just give up if we protest random stores, we have to protest to people who can actually do something about it, like our representatives.</p>
<p>If we truly want to stop this we have to get laws put in place for the this to never happen again, which is fairly unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually even more moronic than that. Most Verizon stores are franchised, so... yeah, they use the branding, they sell the product, they happily <em>help</em> Verizon put you over a barrel, but they're <em>not</em> Verizon. </p>
<p>All that's gonna do is get some idiots arrested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering why every site for protests I viewed on one site just showed verizon after verizon store. I guess it's also a cheap and effective way to populate a map like that. Just trigger events for each of their stores, basically throwing darts at a map, and seeing what sticks.</p></div>		</li>
