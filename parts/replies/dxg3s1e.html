			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to mark your response as my accepted answer as I think I understand your explanation. The one element of the equation I'm missing is why using a half silvered mirror inside the eraser part of the experiment helps to somehow divide up the waveforms into the two phases. How's the mirror so smart that it can reveal the interference pattern's two opposite phases?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The beamsplitter does nothing but what it says: it gives each photon a 50/50 chance of passing through. What causes the phase shift is a difference in the <em>path length</em> that the photon goes down. In the experiments, the path length is modified to maximize the interference signal, in principle you could make it so the photons are perfectly in phase, in which case you see no interference pattern.</p>
<p>The reason you see the <em>opposite</em> interference pattern at each detector is because the two entangled photons have opposite polarizations (call it 0° and 90°). At each detector we measure in a different basis (+45° or -45°) so we see an equal mixture of both polarizations of photons, and thus interference patterns. However, +45° and -45° are <em>also orthogonal to each other</em>, so they must sum to the same simple diffraction pattern that we see with no interference. Therefore the interference patterns measured in +45° and -45° must be perfectly out of phase. By cleverly picking which detectors measure in which polarization, we can work out the path information as is presented in those videos.</p>
