<p>mosquitoes genetically manipulated to be resistant to the parasite performed <em>better than normal mosquitoes</em> when feeding on infected prey</p>

<p>Did this significantly affect malaria dispersal?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not tested in that study, as the mice the mosquitoes were reared on were all already infected. (When feeding on non-infected mice, transgenic and non-transgenic mosquitoes performed equally well.)</p>
<p>Theoretically, though, the biggest effect on malaria dispersal should come from the fact that the mosquitoes are less able to carry the parasite in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mosquitoes that are immune probably have a way of killing the parasites in their system and the chances of it spreading the disease is extremely unlikely, if there is any conceivable chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further semi-related question. Is there anything that vertebrates are non-reactive/immune to that would harm mosquitos that prey on us?  Example, I know copper is toxic in many inverts. Would a person with a high copper diet harm a mosquito that feeds on them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohhhh my friend told me about gengineering mosquitoes months ago but he kept getting pissed that I didn't understand why the mutants should out-compete the wild type. Your explanation makes sense then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also possible your friend was talking about the specific case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_drive" target="_blank">gene drives</a>, which have been suggested as a tool for this kind of purpose.</p>
<p>In addition to any competitive advantage of transgenic mosquitoes, a gene drive would spread faster than normal inheritance would allow anyway, by converting heterozygote carriers into homozygotes. (Essentially, any mosquito that inherited even with a single copy of the gene drive would pass it on to <em>all</em> of its offspring.)</p></div>		</li>
