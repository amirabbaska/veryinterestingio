			<div class="markdown"><p>Having three doesn't mean he's necessarily a litigious person. I mean, he might be, but not necessarily. I'm in my 20's and have 3 lawsuits where I am listed as a plaintiff. The first two were from being stalked by a schizophrenic guy who stated he was trying to kidnap and rape me, and kill all my friends. Scary as shit. He tried twice and both times ended up in jail. The only thing I wanted out of it was for him to get treatment. I didn't want money or anything else.  I haven't seen him in a while, but with this post now I'm concerned he may have access to my new address. GREAT. The third time was when I got rear ended and got pretty nasty whiplash. It's standard in that situation to lawyer up, collect all your medical bills, and file a lawsuit once you have a final number on money spent for treatment. </p>
<p>I don't feel like I'm a litigious person. Bad stuff just happened and I dealt with it. I hate the whole process and I don't like doing it. I would do it again if it became necessary, but I really hope it doesn't. It's stressful, and it sucks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the whole &quot;lawyer up&quot; thing for accidents really weird. In Australia we have compulsory injury insurance as part of our car registration cost. Any injury claims would be made against the governing body with no lawyers and no expense. Medical bills would typically be free anyway unless you need to see ongoing specialists. It's possible to claim lost days of work as part of it too. I rear ended someone and did $5000 worth of damage to their car... They claimed weeks later to have been injured too and I had to give a statement which basically said &quot;I am not aware of them being injured&quot; and I assume they got a payout. Personally I think they lied as they didn't say anything at all at the time. But I didn't care as all up it cost me $400 excess to repair their car (my car was undamaged), and the injury side of things was taken care of. No need for lawyers or courts... Just a 5 minute letter and everyone is happy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really this common to be in so many lawsuits by the time someone is in their mid twenties?</p>
<p>As far as that guy knowing your address, isn't there an intimidation law that could protect you?</p>
<p>Also, for the car accident, don't you have to pay for the lawyer bills? All of this does sound horrible, sorry you have to go through with it. I hope you get compensated for the stress too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do Anti Money Laundering for a major bank. We used it it in every case, it's one of the more reliable information databases out there. It's not considered definitive by any means, mistakes can be made, but usually if you are doing something shady within your bank account you either have lots of odd stuff in LexisNexis or none at all which can be it's own red flag.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am curious how?</p>
<p>Is it that they have all the addresses registered to cellphone accounts on file, or use IP addresses when devices are on wireless, or cell tower records, or what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, your name and address come up to make sure it's your phone, the Lexis Nexis then allows us to send a text with a number to your phone you read it back to me and then that verifies that I'm speaking to you. Really there's nothing creepy or weird About it is all information that can be gathered from public records.</p></div>		</li>
