<p>I mean,  there's a slight pressure difference,  but not much. You can hear some bubbles when they pop,  but it's really quiet. Fit example,  you've probably heard them pop when doing the dishes </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The air inside the bubble is not highly pressurized. If a bubble gets too large it will pop due to the increased pressure and thatâ€™s why you can sometimes hear a small pop when a bubble bursts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine it's because the air in a bubble is very close to normal air pressure at the surface of the water it's rising in. So when it pops, there's almost no pressure wave created.</p></div>		</li>
