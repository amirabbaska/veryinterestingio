			<div class="markdown"><p>If you read the article, the scientists were astonished to discover that there were no birds up there, but there were a LOT of butterflies.</p>
<p>They found evidence that some humans HAD visited the area sometime in the 20th century - some German climbers, IIRC - but apart from that, no other evidence of human interaction. I mean, a 3,600 steep rock wall isn't an easy thing to climb, and Mount Lico is surrounded by nearly impenetrable forest. It's not an easy place to get to.</p></div>		</li>
