			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!  It's fascinating that bitrate and syllables-per-second seem relatively uncorrelated (at least, for those 7 languages).  It's difficult to interpret the differences present (i.e. &quot;how much higher (if any) is the bitrate in English compared to that of French&quot;) without any knowledge of the noise, but it's super cool that research has been done in this direction.  I'll have to give the actual paper a read!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>unfortunately, I have no clue. the link below from Claire_resurgent to the Long Now Foundation report seems alright, but I haven't read the original article. it's hard to keep up on the sprawl of new and unique research that comes out every year.</p></div>		</li>
