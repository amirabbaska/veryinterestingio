			<p>I think part of it is that it's a big name company doing it, which makes it mainstream.  Kinda like Apple announcing their watch.  Lots of companies had already had similar products on the market, but when a big name company known for innovation does it, it's a big deal.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't get this. Everyone keeps acting like lithium ion batteries have never been mass produced before. Its done ALL OVER in China. The batteries in Tesla cars and this new pack aren't any different. Its just a bunch of cells in parallel. <br><br>This isn't some new economy of scale for the battery industry. Its just that Tesla built a big factory, can't sell enough of its luxury cars, and is now selling off the excess batteries as high priced home batteries.</p>		</li>

			<p>as with any product,   commercial and industrial use is where the big $ contracts are.   but consumer market is where the visibility is and where the markup (aka profit) is made.  <br><br>put a bunch of lead acids in a stainless steel shell and it'll get big attention too.<br><br>thing is with lithiums is that they maintain their ability to output power.  where as leadacids, under heavy load, they offgas hydrogen and need distilled water maintenance.  </p>		</li>

			<p>But that's not the case with SGM (sealed glass matt) batteries. The exact problem you mention was engineered around many years ago and the public just seems to have forgotten.<br><br>SGM batteries offer 80% of the deep cycle ability of li-ion. I will admit that the energy density is 3 or more times better for lithium ion but for something in your garage it's probably not a huge deal. <br><br><a href="http://www.pvpower.com/mk-battery-sealed-agm-12v-244ah.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.pvpower.com/mk-battery-sealed-agm-12v-244ah.aspx</a><br><br>three of those and you are near the 10kW hours of the large tesla battery. But at half the cost (imagine the fraction if these were mass produced).<br><br>I digress, at the end of the day the public will just buy the shiny thing from tesla. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>i would agree with you, but <a href="http://www.powertechsystems.eu/en/technics/lithium-ion-vs-lead-acid-cost-analysis/" target="_blank">this analysis</a> tells a different story.<br><br>Also the cool toy from tesla includes charge management, cooling and the inverter.<br><br>i'm still scratching my head tho, trying to understand why people consider this revolutionary: then again, i felt the same the first time i heard of the ipad.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well shit. I didn't realize AGM batteries wore out so quickly. I'll have to look into this more. Thanks for sharing</p>		</li>

			<p>The revolutionary comes from the fact that it's new for the main stream market. Sure, HP palmtops and tablets already existed before, but it was Apple who made them available to and useful to the mainstream user instead of just prosumers or businesses.</p>		</li>

			<p>thanks for the link you saved me time explaining life cycle I agree with everything you said but for one quibble.<br><br>they include charge control but not an inverter. which is understandable if you don't know how many packs will get linked or how big an array someone has or if they need pure sine AC or if modified sine will do.</p>		</li>

			<p>oh yea.  people in the know know that.   but you're right.  consumers buy shiny, either white or black or stainless.     problem is a marketing within the lead acid battery industry.   it's not glamourous to have a lead acid battery, even if it is an AGM.  </p>		</li>

			<p>If you're curious about renewables and their impact locally and especially on a residential home this is a fascinating and not too technical book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Environment-Roger-Hinrichs/dp/1111990832/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430591331&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=energy+textbook" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Environment-Roger-Hinrichs/dp/1111990832/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430591331&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=energy+textbook</a><br><br>It covers solar, nuclear, combustion, power transmission, wind, insulation, etc. <br><br>As for batteries most of my experience comes from my electrical engineering undergrad. but this site has good references <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/" target="_blank">http://batteryuniversity.com/</a></p>		</li>

They currently can't satisfy the demand with the current production rates. Try ordering a Tesla and see how many months you've got to wait.. On top of that they're building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigafactory_1" target="_blank">a factory</a> which will double the world supply of Lithium-Ion batteries. </p>		</li>

			<p>Find one person in your immediate area that has battery backup for their house. If you were able to do that,  (chances are you can't,) then there's about a 98% chance that they're using lead acid batteries. Lead acid is far less efficient and requires lots of maintenence and space, the only advantage is price. Now tesla is decreasing the per unit cost of lithium polymer batteries (you're welcome.)<br><br>Tesla's idea is to reduce the load on the grid and allow people to completely disconnect if they have solar panels. All in a beautiful, low profile, wall mounted battery pack that's efficient and mass produced for consumers.<br><br>Why is everyone shitting all over tesla for trying something new? And providing it at an honestly great price. If you're bitching from your computer seat that it's too expensive, then here's a crazy idea, DON'T BUY IT! Wait a few years until everyone is doing this and the prices drop. <br><br>Elon Musk is a visionary. Just because you can't afford his products immediately when they come out doesn't mean they're not doing their job perfectly. This guy doesn't run Apple, his products aren't supposed to make you happy and be affordable, his ideas are changing the world that we live in more rapidly than the average person even knows! </p>		</li>

			<p>I wanted to know the price difference with li-ion laptop batteries, just did the math with a 56wh Dell laptop battery of 120$ - it's 6 times more expensive than what Tesla is offering. Of course, that's calculated purely on capacity, without the overhead of the enclosure, controller, etc. per laptop battery. But still.</p>		</li>
