			<div class="markdown"><p>definitely worth pointing out the social factors women have to contend with.
Even well educated women who don't want kids talk about the growing awareness of the pressure to have children. </p>
<p>From parents who want to be grand parents, and from an entire world that be default assumed having a child IS your destiny and you will never know true adult womanhood until you are a mother. </p>
<p>and then we talk about see so much talk about how its the hardest job/ most fulfilling job/ how family matters etc. </p>
<p>If you don't have a lot else going for you in life, and you its seen as inevitable you will eventually become pregnant. You become more lax about birth control. </p>
<p>People don't really take risks, they calculate risk differently. people prone to 'risky' behaviour like unprotected sex are perceiving less risk.
If you perceive pregnancy as not the end of the world, its not a risk to have unprotected sex. </p>
<p>I knew a girl from high school, all kinds of messed up, mother died when she was young, self harming, dropped out of school at 15.
Now at 25 she has 5 kids, and is a complete mombie (obsessed mom in a zombie like state) on Facebook. but hey, she seems happy and fulfilled? She's busy, she has something to focus her life on. </p>
<p>Knew another guy, who got a girl pregnant after he hooked up with her the same night he met her.
The girl is non-stop posting excited baby statuses, talking excitedly about 'starting our family&quot; with the guy she has dated only as long as she has been pregnant. </p>
<p>Again, didn't have a college education, working menial jobs,  mid 20s, living at home with parent. To her now her adult life has began.
I don't know is she is just ignorant, or wanted this to happen (apparently neither of them knew you could get morning after pill from a pharmacy on a Sunday? )
She was just waiting to one day be a mom with a family, and she got her opportunity. </p>
<p>Guys struggle to see this perspective. They see it as a financial burden,
women are way more likely to see it as &quot;embracing their destiny&quot;, or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think attitudes toward educated people are also a factor.  I see many uneducated or poorer families who discourage education in their children and make upward mobility of daughters more difficult because the parents feel like educated people are snooty or don't treat lower class folks with respect.  Furthermore, they don't empathize or understand the amount of work it takes to succeed in high school or college courses and as a result have unrealistic expectations for balancing schoolwork with chores, farm work, or working at a job.
As a result, even intelligent children end up in a cycle of poverty and have a larger number of kids because their parents have no little respect for education and don't want their children to be 'uppity.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I came to say. As a high school teacher, I have seen so many girls who struggled in school go off to pursue a post-secondary education, usually in health-care, then flunk out, return to our small town and get pregnant. They tell themselves that they are taking a semester off. In reality, it is too hard to return because they might fail again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things at play here, I think (this is just anecdotal from my experience):</p>
<p>1.) Most underestimate how much chemistry they will have to get through for their coursework.</p>
<p>2.) There's a selection effect at play. Nursing, like teaching, has an implied status as &quot;women's work&quot; so young women are encouraged in that direction by guidance counselors, career consultants, vague societal messages, and the fact that they probably have family and friends in nursing. So it's a popular field for women to enter, thus a large percentage of female dropouts have dropped out of nursing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't think &quot;easy&quot; but manageable. Under perfect circumstances, they are right. However, if they come from a low-socioeconomic family, a lot of things can go wrong. You don't want to know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my son at 17 and went into the nursing field because originally I had planned to be a doctor but after becoming a mom, a doctorate seemed like too much school while nursing was slightly more reasonable and still allowed me into a medical setting. However I dropped it cause it just wasn't my thing and now I'm about to have my bachelors in psychology. </p></div>		</li>
