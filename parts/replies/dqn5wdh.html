			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually proves it was not in a given state beforehand, in an experiment called the violation of Bell inequalities. You can find a measureable difference between both interpretation -- weird entanglement+superposition and prior unknown state -- and it's been verified numerous times experimentally. It's an undergraduate lab experiment now, with an over 60 standard deviation violation of the inequalities.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose what you're pointing out is that Bell and his colleagues had pointed out that their are only two options...absolute determinism in the universe - thus making the choice pre-chosen - or a FTL communication channel between the particles; but the actual answer is neither of those things, and it has been experimentally shown to be so.</p>
<p>I guess what I find to be interesting about the delayed choice experiments that I've read is that the results always correlate, even into the past.  This implies that the wave function must account for  all potential observations, including those that could be made in the near future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one can prove without any doubt that there's no book outside the universe, a global variable or sort, that describe the whole history of the universe and that we're just acting in a play, that the illusion of randomness is simply our lack of knowledge of this elusive book. That said it's impossible to prove otherwise too, so it's a matter of philosophy really, not of physics.</p>
<p>In the delayed choice experiment, it may look like it correlates in the past in the referential of one of the measurement, but it doesn't really make any sense to say what measurement was made first because of the relativity of simultaneity. So for both measurements, it can look like the measurement correlated in the past with the other, neither will think the other is in the future. Furthermore, a third observer might disagree with both POV. All of them would be right in their own referential frame.</p>
<p>I tried to explain this in that comment: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7gyg4k/comment/dqnei8y" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7gyg4k/comment/dqnei8y</a></p>
<p>A neat way to think of it is that an entangled pair is a single indivisible object, when you look at half of it, you learn a property of the whole object.</p></div>		</li>
