			<div class="markdown"><p>Experienced lifter here but i don't know anything scientific. I just do compound lifts, I have competed in powerlifting but now just do it as a hobby so i don't really periodise or isolate any muscles as I don't feel it does much for my strength. Given your explanation, I presume that feeling the burn has no correlation to muscle growth? Just because you're accumulating metabolic waste product doesn't mean you're actually microtearing the muscles are you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypertrophy (muscle growth; increase in cross-sectional area) is stimulated by total volume of resistance training above a threshold of about 60% of your one rep max.</p>
<p>So as long as you're doing at least 60% of maximum force, muscle hypertrophy will be correlated to higher training volume.  So, for example if you do 5 reps at 200, you'll stimulate the same value of hypertrophy with 8 reps at 125, so long as both of those resistances are 60% or greater of your one rep max.</p>
<p>Below 60% 1RM, you'll be training predominantly muscle metabolic function; not stimulating growth.</p>
<p>But over the course of an entire workout with multiple sets and exercises, even though you may be hitting that 60%+ threshold in each set, over the course of the entire workout you're likely accumulating metabolic waste and getting 'the burn'</p>
<p><em>This is all a guideline.  Obviously it's not going to be </em>exactly* 60%; chemical reactions are probabilistic in nature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just want to point out that if 200 is a fraction of his one rep max, then 125 will almost certainly be below 60% of his one rep max (since it's barely above 60% of 200). </p>
<p>A better example is if he could do 5 reps of 200 or 8 reps of 160, assuming that his one rep max is 250.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This has been shown to increase strenght, but is not necessary for hypertrophy.  </p>

<p>In fact, aerobic training can amplify muscle hypterophy as well.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good explanation. While I ran competitively while I was in school (I'm working on my masters now, so I'm now out of eligibility), I ran cross country and mid-distance in track, and depending on the distance I had to run, I definitely knew the difference between the &quot;burning&quot; tired legs of a shorter distance, vs the fatigue &quot;lead legs&quot; of a longer distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still an oversimplification of what happens. </p>
<p>/u/PaleChick24 might also be interested in this. </p>
<p>Different muscle fiber types have different oxidative metabolic capacities, and are recruited for muscle activation in an order from most oxidative to least oxidative (depending on the force production required for the activity). </p>
<p>So, at low force production and low intensity, you can rely on type 1 slow twitch oxidative fibers to produce the bulk of the force, and it can take a very long time to fatigue because energy expenditure is low (i.e. relatively low intensity endurance events). You will not experience much (if any) lactic acid build up in this scenario. </p>
<p>As the force demands go up, type 2a fibers will be recruited to help the type 1 fibers meet these force demands. These fast fibers have a decent oxidative capacity (compared to type 1). If the duration/intensity is low enough, the combination of Type 1 and Type 2a fibers will handle the energy demands primarily with oxidative metabolism. If the intensity/duration is high enough, oxidative metabolism will not suffice to maintain that level of energy expenditure, and anaerobic glycolysis will kick in to supplement. Lactic acid will start to accumulate at this point. It is still being consumed by oxidative metabolism, but glycolysis is producing it faster than the mitochondria can oxidize it. Maintaining this level of exercise will eventually lead to acidosis that requires you to lower the intensity, or cease exercise. </p>
<p>If you increase force demands even further, Type 2b fibers will be recruited. These are your untrained fibers that are not recruited very frequently, and as such, do not have much capacity for oxidative metabolism. They produce lactic acid in earnest, and do not have many mitochondria to oxidize it as fuel. If you are exercising at a level that requires recruitment of these fibers, lactic acidosis will occur relatively quickly. </p>
<p>So, with this in mind, activities that rely on muscle that are primarily slow twitch, and are done at low intensities, won't really ever get much of the acidosis burn. Even if they are done at high intensities, the slow twitch fibers have a high capacity to remove the lactic acid from the muscles. </p>
<p>If you are doing an activity that uses faster twitch fiber muscles at a high level of force production, acidosis burn sensations can occur rapidly. </p>
<p>This was very rushed, so I'm sorry if this makes no sense. Let me know if I wasn't very clear on something, i'll have more time to go in more detail later. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could someone explain why it's the opposite for running then? Is it something to do with slow vs fast twitch fibers? I've always been told sprinters experience metabolic waste build up with shorter faster distances and longer distances run out of energy stores/sugars. I've also experienced these sensations myself, so I would be interested in an explanation.</p>
<p>Here's a couple sources talking about this and theyre not the greatest, but they're all I could find in a time crunch.</p>
