			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice explanation, thank you. One thing I've always wondered was the 'sovereignty' of embassies vs consulates. Can you ELi5?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about the specifics of embassies, but I know that the consulate I worked at was outside the reach of some US laws, labor laws in particular. </p>
<p>I was essentially an employee of the government of Japan, and as such we were subject to different laws. If my superiors had fired me unjustly or sexually harassed me, for example, I would have been unable to sue them in American courts.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean consular staff are exempt from ALL local laws. It's different for ambassadors and consuls general, but the day-to-day flunkies had to pay their parking tickets like the rest of us. One guy even got arrested and nearly went to jail for a <em>ahem</em>, &quot;domestic incident&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
