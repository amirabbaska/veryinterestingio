			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes ! That would look really amazing  kind of scary but would/ could look really cool.</p>
<p>In the Movies people get powers from Lightning or Gamma Rays etc.  but unfortunately people who have survived Lightning Strikes are usually never the same....some are mild mental changes and some more severe  but there are groups of survivors who meet....and it's almost always negative...
nobody got to be an Instant Genius ...at least so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. And this would be protect you. However anytime you poke your head up you are at a very great risk since at that point you're standing taller than the water and you are far more conductive than water. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Where did you get that nonsense? Seawater has a conductivity of about 5S/m. Humans are <em>much</em> (orders of magnitude) less conductive than this...</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't really think that many people believe water to be non-conductive. I thought that it was pretty well known that water is conductive in practice (hence pop-culture references like &quot;toaster in the bathtub&quot;).</p>
<p>While truly pure water may be non-conductive, it picks up contaminates that make it conductive very easily. It is safe to assume that most water that you encounter will not be a good insulator. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's the first time I read about this, as it's actually a common misconception that water by itself is a conductor ..</p></div>		</li>
