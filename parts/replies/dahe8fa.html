<p>How the heck do you have worldwide collective planning without a government?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, communists see a difference between a state and a government. IIRC, a state has a monopoly on physical violence, but a government can just be more like people organizing together to mutually benefit each other. A state is a type of government, but a government doesn't have to be a state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then a couple more questions...</p>
<p>Who enforces criminal codes in this system? Without a government monopoly on legitimate violence, do you just have no enforcement (ie: no violence at all) or everyone is a vigilante (violence, but no state monopoly)?</p>
<p>And what happens when there is disagreement or lack of consensus? The West wants to have no environmental regulations while India and East Asia do not. And let's say the West has the popular vote, 60/40, but factories in India decide not to comply.</p>
<p>Or just to put this more broadly: What is the dispute resolution mechanism, other than just hoping there won't be disputes?</p></div>		</li>
