			<div class="markdown"><p>You produce matter and anti-matter in equal amounts. The Anti-matter and matter will annihilate and turn back into energy if they get close though, so you'd need a way to safely dispose of the antimatter. (Or something you wanted annihilated.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, now if only they could explain why everything doesn't have an anti-particle, their theory is something asymmetrical happened during the bigbang. Why? How? Will we find evidence in the hundred years? Fairly certain symmetry is fundamental in space science and if that rings true, is it more likely that we're an accident or an experiment? </p></div>		</li>

<p>So mass of chair you want x speed of light squared would give you how much energy you need. I guess there would be more need for the manufacturing process. Either way it a very large amount.</p></div>		</li>
