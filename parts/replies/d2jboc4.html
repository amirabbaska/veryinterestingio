			<div class="markdown"><p>I also can't really think of any other hard limit that would be completely general.</p>
<p>Having said that, depending on how you are accelerating the water in the first place (relative to the tube it is flowing through) you can try to come up with some theoretical and practical limits. If you just use pressure to push a liquid in a tube, the best you can get is the speed of sound in that liquid. The reason is that as you push on one end of a column of liquid, this &quot;push&quot; has then to be transferred to the next layer of molecules, and so on and so on. The speed at which this push can propagate is just the speed of sound in that medium. While this is not a small number (for example for water you get ~1500 m/s), it will still be smaller than the speed of light by about five orders of magnitude. </p>
<p>edit: Removed a part about resistance heating being a large practical concern. While increasing the speed of flow does lead to faster heating, as others have pointed out, reaching flow speeds close to the speed of sound is still easily achievable using commonly used machines.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens if you try to push water with a plunger that is moving faster than 1500 m/s? (Watched a video on sonic booms and all I can tell is that water ahead of the plunger would be under normal pressure, e.g. the information that a push was coming would not have arrive before the push itself)</p>
<p>Would the pressure on the water being pushed create a state change?</p>
<p>Related, are microwaves essentially doing this? Hitting water molecules with particles/waves moving at the speed of light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manning_formula" target="_blank">It really all depends</a>! Depends on the liquid, type or tubing, size of tubing, open or closed system, gravity based or pressure based. So many variables that you would need tons more information to solve this problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it still does as long as the fluid has viscosity.</p>
<p>What has very large effects on real life fluid flow in a tube are the wall effects on the boundary layer of the fluid and whether the flow stays laminar or trips to turbulent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are the main factors, as well as the &quot;roughness&quot; of the interior of the tube (to account for friction and shear stress of the liquid against the tubing). If these factors are known, then the velocity of the liquid is calculated via the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manning_formula" target="_blank">Manning equation</a>: V = n <em> Rh^2/3 </em> S^1/2, where n is the Manning coefficient (measure if surface roughness), Rh is the hydraulic radius of the tube, and S is the slope. Obviously, this is generally used for gravity fed systems, but there are modifications of the equation that can take into account artificial acceleration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but based on the type of tubing, you will be able to define how &quot;rough&quot; the inside is. If we had all of the information, we could definitively define the potential max speed.</p></div>		</li>
