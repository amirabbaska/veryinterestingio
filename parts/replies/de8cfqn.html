			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh gotcha - so how come when you turn a key in the ignition, the car kind of 'stutters' to life? It goes like &quot;eh-eh-eh-eh-vrrrrrm&quot; not in like a bad &quot;there is something wrong with your car&quot; way, I've noticed pretty much all cars do this. Kind of like how when you turn on a light switch for a fluorescent bulb, it flickers to life, but a regular lightbulb will just flick right on or off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit more explanation, there's two &quot;motors&quot; in your engine - the gasoline engine, and an electric motor. The electric motor is small  - usually about the size of your forearm. This electric motor has a gear on its shaft that slides out when the electric motor turns on.This gear connects to a big toothed ring on the plate in between your engine and transmission, which has teeth all around its outside. The electric motor spins really quickly, which turns the bigger wheel much more slowly, and as it turns, it starts the engine moving.</p>
<p>If you've never seen how an internal combustion engine works before, this old ELI5 thread has some really good explanations, including a wonderful set of animated infographics in the top comment: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2ih8x5/eli5_how_does_an_internal_combustion_engine_make/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2ih8x5/eli5_how_does_an_internal_combustion_engine_make/</a></p>
<p>To get one of these engines started, you need to get it turning. there's no way for an engine to start on its own - which is why you have that electric starter motor. The noises you hear when turning the key are a combination of things: The electrical motor making noise as it turns, the engine starting to suck in air and try to ignite it, and the pulses of exhaust leaving the engine. The reason it takes a few seconds to start up is that the amount of air and fuel being compressed and burned during startup isn't all that high - each time a cylinder ignites, it just gets things moving a little faster. Then the next one gets it moving a little faster still.</p>
<p>While these ignitions are speeding up the engine, your little starter motor is still zooming away, helping to keep things moving and not slow down in between the short bursts of energy the gasoline engine is creating. Finally, once the ignitions are happening close enough together because the engine has reached a high enough speed, the starter won't need to turn anymore because each cylinder's pulse of power is coming quickly after the last one, not giving the engine the time to slow down in between the pulses.</p>
<p>That's when your car has started up, and you let the key fall back to the 'on' position!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit I just learned so much stuff, thanks so much - it's a major deficit in my knowledge that I know pretty much fuck-all about cars, so I'm super, super lucky that there are people like you out there who can explain some stuff in basic terms without having to do like an entire course on mechanics &lt;3</p></div>		</li>
