<p>Exactly. It can win when playing against itself, so that means it can lose, just not against humans (maybe).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. But if both sides play perfectly then you would expect each match to go the exact same way, or for the slightly disadvantaged side to always lose (in a game with no random elements).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For example, the first player to move often has an advantage, such as chess where empirically white has a small advantage. In Go this is often compensated for by a small handicap to the second player to move, so it is unclear who would have the advantage in perfect play.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go is not EXPTIME-hard. Claiming that is just extremely misleading. Go has a finite number of possible board positions, which means that we can solve the game in constant time, by just looking at every possible move and chosing the one that will lead to a win. So Go isn't even NP-hard.</p>
<p>A generalized version of Go where the board has size n*n is EXPTIME-hard, but that doesn't have anything to do with what AlphaGo is doing.</p>
<p>Another example: Tic Tac Toe is obviously solvable. Even as a human you can easily play a perfect game every single time. The generalized version of Tic Tac Toe with a n*n board is PSPACE-complete though, which is (probably) much harder than any NP-complete problem. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is misleading at best.  &quot;Constant time&quot; is usually taken in this context to mean &quot;the time taken is independent of the size of the input&quot;.</p>
<p>A better way to say this might be &quot;If we're considering a fixed size board, algorithmic complexity analysis of how the computational time relates to the size of the board is not applicable.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is exactly what the technical term &quot;constant time&quot; means. Granted the original commenter should've explained it for those unfamiliar, but calling it misleading is unfair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, actually EXP time is a larger set than than NP. NP is the subset of EXP time problems that can be verified in polynomial time. It's a common misconception that NP stands for non polynomial time. It actually stands for non deterministic polynomial time, which is to say that it's solvable in polynomial time by a non deterministic machine. Also, as pointed out in another comment, solving go is actually a constant (not NP or EXP) time problem, given that the board is finitely big and there are only a finite number of board configurations. The problem is that these constants are astronomically huge, and running a brute force algorithm is just not practical, but in a theoretical sense, it is a constant time problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is NP a subset of EXPTIME?</p>
<p>I thought the time hierarchy theorem proves  P ⊊ EXPTIME and NP ⊊ NEXPTIME  but it doesn't relate deterministic with nondeterministic complexities.</p>
<p>Could there be a problem which has a solution that can be verified in polynomial time, but which a solution cannot be found in exponential time? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a subset, but (probably) a strict subset.
However the class of EXPTIME hard problems (unlike NP hard), is known to be strictly harder than P - in fact, there's no way to solve an exptime hard problem in subexponential time.</p></div>		</li>
