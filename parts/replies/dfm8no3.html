			<div class="markdown"><p>You're definitely correct in that it is a mistake. I saw a Huffington Post article that states people eat 11M pounds of food every <strong>minute</strong>. </p>
<p>To be honest, this seems like a lazy mistake since this number is orders of magnitude off the correct number that lies somewhere in the billions of pounds (Using Huffington Post's number, we would get 15.8 billion pounds of food a day).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there are 1 bilion people in the developed world, a small estimate would already prove it wrong. Im pretty sure they eat at least a pound a day, i do anyway. You cant eat negative amounts of food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can project the average though ;)</p>
<p>I once heard that if people would eat the amounts and sorts that people ate in India, world could sustain 15b people; and if same would go for United States, planet wouldn't be able sustain 2b at all. It was somewhere on a TEd talk.</p></div>		</li>
