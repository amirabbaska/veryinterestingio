<p>that's not an &quot;amount of heat&quot;. it's just a high temperature and the point is that the total energy in the system isn't very big (certainly not enormous). heat is a way of transfering energy and since there's not much energy in the system, you'd find it hard to transfer much heat to the facility to the point where its temperature would rise significantly.</p>
<p>i mean put a drop of water on an oven surface and see how much its temperature decreases while the drop evaporates. also drop a hot needle into a glas of water and notice that the water doesn't boil.</p>
<p>&quot;what do you need high temperatures for?&quot;</p>
<p>for instance we would want to be doing nuclear fusion, for that we would want to heat a plasma so that the conditions are such that fusion reactions are likely to occur within the plasma. again you then just have a small quantity of matter at that temperature and when it touches the surroundings of the reactor it cools down immediately, while not melting the reactor (because it's not a significant amount of energy).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine the other answers have covered this, but there's an important distinction between <em>heat</em> and <em>temperature</em></p>
<p>If something is very hot, it has a high temperature, but that doesn't mean it has a lot of heat. To have a lot of heat you need a lot of mass at high temperature.</p>
<p>Temperature is sort of like density, it's like a measure of how much heat something has per unit mass.
(While heat is more like weight, it's a function of both the density of the object, and how much of the object there is)</p>
<p>So something with barely any mass at all (like a spark from a welder) can be thousands of degrees in temperature, but you can't even feel it when it lands on your skin because the amount of actual heat inside it is tiny, and you can't even notice the change in temperature to your skin.</p>
<p>Imagine dropping an ice cube into a lake, it doesn't matter if that ice cube is 0C or -200C it is not going to make any difference to the temperature of the lake because it's tiny. </p>
<p>That's why it's possible to have something at a super super high temperature without melting the Earth.</p>
<p>Hopefully some of that was meaningful / helpful and not just confusing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is only true because the material containment has been designed to let the heat/energy dissipate such that it doesn't (needlessly) damage the machine and surrroundings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature generally speaking is just &quot;average temperature&quot; of matter. If it is 30 degrees C outside a sunny day, it's not 30 everywhere. Even room temperature water have molecules above boiling point. Water is &quot;room temperature&quot; because your reading is broad and inexact. Could you read the temperature of single molecules you would find molecules a lot hotter than you'd expect. But even still, the water is room temperature. You could zap a few molecules of the glass with a laser, into million degree hot plasma (example), but it would have no effect whatsoever because of the large amount of room temperature water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really &quot;average temperature&quot;, it's closer to &quot;average motion of molecules due to energy&quot;. I say &quot;closer to&quot; because I'm not fresh enough to know if this is totally accurate. However, temperature is just a measurement of the amount of energy in a certain system. The system in OPs example is incredibly small which is what you're describing in your example.</p>
<p>Just had to nitpick that. </p></div>		</li>
