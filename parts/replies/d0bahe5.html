			<div class="markdown"><p>Adagio is my favorite... But I gave up on it after I lost my teapot (ingenuitea), then found it 4 months later with the last brew in it and quite an impressive mold colony. Tried getting back into tea a couple years later, but I had $50 worth of tasteless, old tea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Matcha-iri Sencha would be what it's called. Perhaps of interest to you, Costco sells a decent quality tea bag which is a matcha/sencha blend under its Kirkland Signature brand as seen here:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Matcha-Blend-Japanese-Tea-100/dp/B000WB1YSE" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Matcha-Blend-Japanese-Tea-100/dp/B000WB1YSE</a></p>
<p>Another variance on this theme is one of my favourite teas; genmaicha. This is sencha mixed with popped, roasted rice. It smells like popcorn when brewed and has an almost buttery flavour to it. You can often find it with matcha added as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i don't know about the US(assuming that's where you're from) but here in Singapore, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf sells both sencha AND genmaicha and they're really good. bought a retail can of 20 bags and they'te pretty cheap as well at S$14.90 which is ~US$11. and typically, as a cafe they serve matcha drinks as well. so i might just request for the Matcha-iri Sencha drink next time! didn't know they could be mixed like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't care for genmaicha, oddly. It's got a weird, malty taste. I really should like it, by all previous tastes. Thanks for that name! I love the grassy, almost floral sort of green taste of shaded teas.</p></div>		</li>
