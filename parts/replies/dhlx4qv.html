<p>Only model rockets. Virtually all modern solid propellant rocket engines use Ammonium Perchlorate as the oxidizer (It also auto decomposes, like a monopropellant adding some additional energy). And aluminum powder as the fuel, with a small amount of polybutadiene rubber to bind it into a solid.</p>
<p>Liquid oxygen has already been mentioned. The two most common fuels used with it are either kerosene or liquid hydrogen. These require an igniter.</p>
<p>Another common liquid fuel combination is Nitrogen Tetraoxide as oxidizer and monomethylhydrazine (or some other mixes of methyl hydrazines) as fuel. These two have the property of being hypergolic. They burn on contact with each other. So no igniter is needed. They are also very long term storable. LH2 and LO2 have to be used immediately. They do have problems that you have to trade off in design. The N2O4 is corrosive. Both are highly toxic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just an addition, ethanol has often been used as a liquid fuel, some new rockets are using methane because it doesn't leave carbon deposits when it burns (important for reusable engines).</p>
<p>Both Ntiric acid (all kinds) and high-concentration hydrogen peroxide have been used for rocket oxidizers in the past (as they're liquids and reasonably stable for storage in the short-ish term).</p>
<p>If you saw weird space-suit things being used near rockets on the ground, that's usually due to how very toxic hydrazine is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen Tetraoxide is worse. I was once told one good whiff of it and you get instant emphysema. Just about everything that burns or oxidizes has been studied for rocket propellants. Some weird ones: Cow manure, Chlorine Trifluoride, berylium, borane, news paper, and on and on. A good read on the history of propellants is the book <a href="https://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/ignition.pdf" target="_blank">Ignition</a> (a long PDF) or <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/677285.Ignition_" target="_blank">http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/677285.Ignition_</a></p>
<p>I have worked at Cape Canaveral. They warned us about parking our cars near launch pad operations, due to the corrosive nature of some propellants. Even the Ammonium Perchlorate, which by itself is not very toxic, leaves HCL gas (Hydrochloric acid) in the exhaust plume.</p>
<p>Edit: A comment on one of your other statements</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some new rockets are using methane because it doesn't leave carbon deposits</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kerosene used with LO2 has been traditionally a form called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP-1" target="_blank">RP-1</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RP-1 (alternately, Rocket Propellant-1 or Refined Petroleum-1) is a highly refined form of kerosene outwardly similar to jet fuel, used as rocket fuel. RP-1 has a lower specific impulse than liquid hydrogen (LH2), but it is cheaper, stable at room temperature, far less of an explosion hazard, and far denser. RP-1 is significantly more powerful than LH2 by volume. RP-1 also has a fraction of the toxicity and carcinogenic hazards of hydrazine, another room-temperature liquid fuel. Thus, kerosene fuels are more practical for many uses.</p>
<p>Alkenes and aromatics were held to very low levels. These unsaturated hydrocarbons tend to polymerize not only at temperature, but during long periods of storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition they tend to lead to &quot;coking&quot; or leaving carbon deposits in the fuel passages. Sometimes clogging them. Especially in the passages of the regenerative cooling jacket and injector holes. Getting the alkenes and aromatics to as low as possible helps prevent this. Because kerosene is basically a light oil, it also lends itself to film cooling of the thrust chamber walls. This is different than regenerative cooling in that the kerosene is spayed along the inner walls of the chamber. As it vaporizes off, it helps carry heat away. On the <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/f7/0a/d4/f70ad4d8723d451f673545d2ce4d5f87.jpg" target="_blank">Saturn V engine exhaust</a>, you can see this film continuing a few feet from the nozzle, before it catches fire and burns off. It looks like a dark curtain around the nozzle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No! Mass just has to be ejected in the opposite direction you want to go in. The overall momentum has to be conserved, so the rocket gains an equal momentum to that of the ejected gasses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're standing on a frozen lake, wearing ice skates. You throw a baseball. This causes you to start moving backwards. Why? Is it because the baseball was &quot;pushing&quot; against the air? Nope. It's because your hand was pushing against the baseball. The force you're applying to it is applied in an equal but opposite direction to yourself, and you move. When a spaceship expels mass, it's pushing against that mass, just as you pushed against that baseball.</p></div>		</li>
