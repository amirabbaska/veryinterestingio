			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with Spotify was always that the more you listen to a song, the more it assumes you like it. But, if you tend to listen for short durations, such as car rides, etc, when you may hear fewer than 10-15 songs, then each time you listen it would play at least some of those 10-15 songs, which persists until you have this subset of just a few songs that Spotify is convinced you absolutely love, whether you do or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly the problem I have. My favorites playlist has 800 songs but I hear the same 40 or so every day on my ride home. It's infuriating. </p>
<p>Goddam self fulfilling prophecy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a playlist of nearly 1000, Spotify has decided that not only do I want to hear The Coasters' &quot;Down in Mexico&quot; every time I use the app, but often 2-3 times within any 30-minute period.</p>
<p>And don't even get me started on the fact that Punk radio starts with a Clash song 9 out of 10 times I tune in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Humans have a knack for finding patterns in things where there are no patterns and so truly random algorithms (which can theoretically result in the same song being played constantly) can seem less random than modified algorithms (modified algorithms usually decrease the chance of a song being played that was played recently.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle#Generalizations_of_the_pigeonhole_principle" target="_blank">Pigeonhole Principle</a> effects going on here:  If you randomly play 30 tracks from a 150 track playlist <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-%28150!%2F120!%29%2F%28150^30%29" target="_blank">the odds of at least one repeat are over 95%</a>.  Or even more than that if you count same artist/album as matches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also there are two additional effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if you hate the song, you will be annoyed by it and thus potentially skip or regret the song choice.</p>
</li>
<li>if you love the song, its playing will stick in your memory more than a mediocre song and thus a repeat will certainly be noticed or remembered for longer than a less known song. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you mean randomly selected with replacement.  But most people when they select random probably want random without replacement.</p>
<p>The random function should produce a randomly selected arrangement of the playlist, and work its way through that arrangement.  It should remember that arrangement until the last song in the arrangement is played, or until a new arrangement is selected.  Songs added to a playlist should be randomly arranged and appended to the end of the arrangement.</p></div>		</li>
