			<div class="markdown"><p>But typically sensors have enough pixels to be able to capture 1080p video, even if it is held vertically. For example, a 12mp photo is ~ 4Kx3K pixels. Plenty of headroom to shoot 1080 pixels on the 3K plane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When held it vertically (portrait), it is still using the entire sensor as it works right now. Hold it portrait, get a portrait picture or video.  The OP wants to hold it in portrait mode, but take the picture in lanscape landscape. In that case, you won't be able to use the entire sensor, you're going to cut like, 50% of the vertical pixels. </p>
<p>So you're going to lose a lot of resolution vertically, even though yes, you will retain it horizontally.</p>
<p>My answer, at least, was based on the idea that I would want the entire resolution available to me, not just a portion of it. If that's all I want, I can shoot in portrait mode and crop to landscape, and end up with the same number of pixels.</p>
<p>To get what the OP wants, you either need a square sensor (then you'll get crops vertically and horizontally depending on how you're shooting) or a much larger rectangular sensor that can deliver the same resolution vertically even with 50% of the pixels lost.</p></div>		</li>
