			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a dumb question, because there's still debate about whether things like viruses are alive or not.</p>
<p>A short simple answer is that the cell takes in nutrients to fuel processes to maintain and (possibly) replicate the cell.</p>
<p>Rupturing the membrane of the cells kills it because many cellular processes rely on there being different concentrations of chemicals inside and outside the cell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>oxidative phosphorylation</p>

<p>I had to look this up but that's referring to part of the aerobic respiration cycle, right? I like the specificity of this but doesn't that discount every organism that uses a different metabolic process, like anaerobic bacteria?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cells need antifreeze so they don't die in the cold, but if you put the antifreeze in when they're too warm, they'll drink it and die.</p>
<p>Assuming you freeze them safely, you have to safely remove the antifreeze as they warm up so they don't drink it and die. This is pretty simple for a couple of sperm cells or skin cells or any other kind, but not so simple for a whole human body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My interpretation:</p>
<p>Cells wake up feeling better if they eat some sugar at bedtime, but they wake up feeling sick if they still have sugar in their tummies. So we get rid of the sugar when it's time for them to wake up, and they usually feel fine.</p>
<p>If a person eats a lot of sugar before bedtime, it's really hard to get them to eat the right amount of sugar, and it's hard for us to get rid of the sugar when they wake up because people are big and have lots of small parts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plot twist: DMSO is also... <strong>poison</strong>!</p>
<p>So, we use this one weird trick (invented by a single mom):  Freeze em first, <em>then</em> add DMSO. Works great...</p>
<p>...except when you thaw em out. the DMSO kills everything. shiiiit. :/</p>
<p>Don't worry, we finally figured out the answer! When you thaw 'em out, tip a whole lot of water on. That means the DMSO poison isn't strong enough to kill all the cells.</p>
<p>Works* 90% of the time!</p>
<p>*works great on sperm, eggs, little bundles of cells. YMMV on a whole person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact. The LD50 for DMSO is 14.5 g/body kg. That means you can drink about double the amount of DMSO than ethanol before actually dying. </p>
<p>Wouldn't recommend it though, the garlic taste would be epic.</p></div>		</li>
