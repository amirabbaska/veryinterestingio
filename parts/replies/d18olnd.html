			<p>Actually, that is a myth. We use a small portion of our brains for cognitive function, but the rest of our brain is used for everything else that goes on in our bodies. We need at least 50% of our brain though, because of the fact that our other half can run the other side of our bodies too.</p>		</li>

			<p>This was interesting and gives me reason to believe that of all sci/fi technology this is one I'll actually live to see happen, at least on an experimental animal level like cloning. So we'll freeze a sheep. But it sounds like all that's missing is a replacement for whatever DSMO is that isn't so highly toxic, or failing that a cryo chamber capable of removing the toxic DSMO immediately and effectively, probably with some nanobot technology programmed to gather it and keep it from coming into contact with the organism during the thawing process.</p>		</li>

			<p>I also want to add that a huge reason for the cryoprotectants is to prevent ice crystals from becoming large and then destroying shit like an alien popping out of your chest.  That is why the quick freeze is best, the ice forms disordered crystals (vitrious ice) that are not really dangerous.  That is fine for a cell, but there is no way to get that kind of freeze going for a large number of cells.</p>		</li>

			<p>Cells need antifreeze so they don't die in the cold, but if you put the antifreeze in when they're too warm, they'll drink it and die.<br><br>Assuming you freeze them safely, you have to safely remove the antifreeze as they warm up so they don't drink it and die. This is pretty simple for a couple of sperm cells or skin cells or any other kind, but not so simple for a whole human body.</p>		</li>

			<p>My interpretation:</p>
<p>Cells wake up feeling better if they eat some sugar at bedtime, but they wake up feeling sick if they still have sugar in their tummies. So we get rid of the sugar when it's time for them to wake up, and they usually feel fine.</p>
<p>If a person eats a lot of sugar before bedtime, it's really hard to get them to eat the right amount of sugar, and it's hard for us to get rid of the sugar when they wake up because people are big and have lots of small parts.</p>		</li>

			<p>The above reasons are valid, but you don't necessarily need to use DMSO, you could use a compound which is gooey but less toxic (such as glycerin). <br><br>The main reason you can freeze individual cells is because they are small enough that cryogenic liquids that contact them can freeze them essentially instantly.  Basically, you can cool things quickly enough to prevent damage if there is a very large surface area exposed directly to the coolant (relative to the mass of the tissue you're cooling).  Individual cells and thin slices of tissue for example.  When freezing larger tissues, the cryogenic liquids have to transfer heat away through the cells on the surface before the interior cells will be cooled.  These cells transfer the heat slowly compared to liquid nitrogen for example, so ice crystals can form in those cells, shattering their membranes.  <br><br>The organism would also need to thaw as quickly as it was frozen without being damaged by heat.  For example, imagine if your limbs were thawed out but your heart and lungs were still frozen.  The cells in your limbs would be deprived of oxygen because there's no blood pumping from your cold, icy heart. <br><br>Source: Molecular geneticist with experience freezing mammalian organs and regenerating colonies of fungi and bacteria from cryogenically frozen samples. </p>		</li>

			<p>The chemicals that allow cells to survive freezing are toxic to the body.  Keeping the cells cold minimized the damage that this chemical does to the cells.  With single cell solutions, adding the chemical at ice-cold temperatures and immediately diluting it out when you thaw the cells can keep 90% of the cells alive.  There's no way to do this with an intact body.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; I work in a lab where we freeze down cells all of the time. We freeze our cells in a medium that contains 5% DMSO, which among other things can be used as a cryoprotectant<br><br>Why don't you use glycerol?  Much less toxic, and much less threat of permeation introducing any contaminants in the DMSO into you (or the cells).  Also cheaper.

			<p>DMSO in aqueous solution does not freeze at room temperature.  My understanding is that its primary mechanism of cryoprotection is simply disruption of the crystal lattice of ice.  The solution instead freezes into something more like an amophous solid that accomodates the cells rather than puncturing them.</p>		</li>

			<p>Wow thanks for the quick answer! Yeah I read something about this and it said that it's the ice crystals that are the biggest problem as when one crystal forms it sets of a chain reaction of sorts (the word nucleating was used) and ends up messing everything up. I study hibernation in ground squirrels so this stuff interests me. European ground squirrels usually don't fall below 4 C but temps of -2.9 C have been recorded in Arctic ground squirrels so... AFAIK they have these antifreeze and ice-nucleating proteins which help keep the crystals under control.</p>		</li>

			<p>In our lab, we quickly thaw the cells, which are in a cryo vial, in a warm water bath and take the solution and add it to some type of FBS (fetal bovine serum) + DMEM medium.

			<p>This is correct.  I would add that when you thaw the cells, you thaw them until there is only a small piece of ice left (to ensure that the solution is still ice cold until you dilute out the DMSO).  This will melt when you add additional medium.<br><br>Additionally, some cells are sensitive enough to require that the medium is added drop-by-drop to avoid popping the cells through osmotic shock.  This is very cell line dependent.</p>		</li>

			<p>If anyone is wondering, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) dissolves in both nonpolar/polar compounds, meaning it can penetrate the cell membrane (since cell membrane have polar/nonpolar parts) and prevent ice crystals from forming in that space and therefore preventing cells from bursting/dying! </p>		</li>

			<p>Really depends on the cell line and the freezing/thawing conditions to be honest. If you're talking cancer cell lines, those fuckers will withstand anything. Accidentally snap freeze them? 95% yield! Forget DMSO? New, extra hearty cancer cells! Thaw them and forget them on the counter for 30 minutes after thawing? They've mutated to love DMSO and evolved into cognizant beings that resent you for neglecting them on the counter. Meanwhile, trying to get primary endothelial cells to survive is a nightmare. You add cold medium with 5% DMSO and place them in the -20 C freezer. After 30 minutes you place them in the -80 C freezer. Then 30 minutes later you place them in liquid N2. You thaw them quickly and transfer to a culture treated dish while diluting in warm media and then allow them to grow under perfect conditions for 3 days. One passage later they stopped growing and decided they hate you now.<br><br>I can't comment on sperm or eggs as I don't work with them and I'm a shit biologist (I'm a chemist/engineer who pretends to be a biologist so they'll let me start my MD/PhD next year), but I imagine they don't need nearly as many as they freeze, so the yield is probably inconsequential. A whole person is far more tricky. You'd probably die in the slow thaw process though, and your cells would freak the fuck out in a fast thaw due to osmolarity and crystal structures and shit.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think it should be known the method used to freeze. When you freeze small samples of cells, you must do so rapidly so sharp abnormalities do not form in the ice and rupture the cells. Freezing quickly, with, say, liquid nitrogen, creates very &quot;smooth&quot; ice crystals, while freezing slowly creates &quot;sharp&quot; crystals. You can freeze small samples fast. It is very hard/nigh impossible with today's technology to freeze a body that fast. Abnormalities in the ice's crystalline structure would form inside the body/brain and a large percentage of cells would be lost due to their fracturing at the hands of ice crystals. </p>		</li>
