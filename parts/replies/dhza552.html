			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not the OP, but I'd wondered before what the strips of high-resolution versus low-resolution segments in Google Earth's ocean views represented. Now I know, and it's very neat. It's especially cool to zoom out and actually make sense of the shipping lanes. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said, often when people say things like &quot;we've only explored X% of the ocean&quot;, they are talking about a much more substantial definition of &quot;explored&quot; than just a depth map.</p>
<p>In particular, our understanding of deep sea life is unbelievably incomplete. For example, in the mediterranian sea (where we have fairly high-res/high-coverage depth data) we only discovered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Atalante_basin" target="_blank">L'Atalante basin</a> fairly recently. It's a brine lake at the bottom of the sea that is host to a whole bunch of bizarre life.</p>
<p>It's not even that deep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be curious to learn more about the Mediterranean Basin prior to its filling. From what I understand, the summer extremes the lowest elevations in the basin were so high that non-extremophile life was impossible, and today's islands were almost as isolated accordingly.</p></div>		</li>
