			<div class="markdown"><p>It's something I've always had. But it's strange, my hearing was never a problem and every year through elementary school I could always hear every pitch and decibel of the hearing test. I still have perfect hearing and can hear some pitches most people can't, but when I get that random special pop (I can pop whenever I want it just doesn't do anything) it's magical hearing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think your hearing is actually better than usual. I think your hearing is WORSE before the pop, then returns to normal, but you're more aware of the contrast and of your hearing in general post-pop so your normal hearing feels amazing. And then as you get used to your normal hearing you stop noticing it again and it doesn't seem particularly special anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Otolaryngologist here. The fact that he can equalize the middle ear pressure is a sign that the Eustachian tube is functioning properly. If he/she felt significant pressure and was unable to equalize the middle ear, that’s when problems develop. A persistent negative middle ear pressure can cause body fluid in the tissues to exit the tissue and occupy the middle ear space. This would cause a conductive hearing loss and potentially harbor bacteria that could cause an infection. </p>
<p>Also, in general, we don’t recommend the use of q-tips, ear candles, or at home irrigation solutions. They all carry various negative consequences. Q-tips can dry out the ear canal, cause eczema and itching, abraded the thin skin of the bony ear canal, and even push wax against the eardrum. I can’t tell you how many times people come in with a piece of q-tip stuck in the ear or a hole in the ear drum from a q-tip. Ear candles are just a hoax. And irrigation can also push ear wax deeper in the ear and cause a hole in the ear drum when done without proper visualization. </p>
<p>In the office, we have a microscope to examine ears with proper binocular depth perception, as well as micro instruments and suction to clean the ears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are your thoughts on peroxide? That's what my mother used to do.  Lay down on your side, pour a little peroxide in the ear and the ear was would break free and bubble up to the top.  Maybe a couple of minutes on each side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Peroxide works well to soften the ear wax. When the wax is softer, the ear has an easiest time cleaning itself. It’s also easier to remove under the microscope. </p>
<p>There is an over the counter medication we typically recommend for people with very hard wax called Debrox. It’s carbamide peroxide. I’m not really sure of any difference in regards to effectiveness compared to regular peroxide.  But regular peroxide is cheaper than Debrox.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is gross, but also possible in OP's life: sometimes the popping is an earwax thing. If you have too much, it will make popping &amp; blocking sounds. Your regular doctor can remove it &amp; bring hearing back to normal.  </p></div>		</li>
