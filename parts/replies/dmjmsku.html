			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why, in the waters around Kwajalein (Marshall Islands) it sounds as busy as Times Square underwater. It is a pretty solid tone and fades into white noise very quickly but damn it was a shock during my first open water course how loud it was underwater.</p>
<p>So much life. So much noise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your vocal chords have evolved to produce sound in air, not water. By screaming under water, you're creating soundwaves expelled within air from your lungs - when that hits the water, the energy of the sound waves is not high enough to transmit the sound at full strength to the water. So the amplitude is reduced, and the &quot;volume&quot; gets quieter.</p>
<p>If, however, you go the other way - for example from solid to air - you get things like tuning forks. Vibrations in solids are more readily transferred to the air, and you get fairly high-volume sound as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To illustrate this I suggest you and a friend duck under water at opposite ends of a swimming pool then have one of you crack his/her knuckles. Sounds almost like a gunshot even from accross the pool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what would happen if you had someone underwater and you hit a tuning fork and put it in the water, or you some hit it well enough underwater? Is it possible that they could get some kind of hearing loss? Or pain anyways?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does. This is why well built recording studios, for example, will have walls built with multiple materials. I.e. Gypsum, then a substantial air gap, then cinder blocks filled with sand, then another air gap, then Gypsum again on the other side. The different density (not to mention other properties) of various materials serves to kill the energy of a sound wave making propagation through the entire wall very difficult. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that a soundwaves (which are just kinetic energy) move well through solids is the reason we can tell what the Earth's core is made of. Also, earthquakes move as energy through the ground and can be felt even hundreds of miles away     </p></div>		</li>
