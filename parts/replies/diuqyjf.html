			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most upvoted comment.  Did no one who upvoted it notice that it didn't address OP's question at all?  Y'all disappoint me.  It doesn't really make any sense, either.  Just kinda rambling.  This sounds more like a drunk philosopher who talks about their pet theory.</p>
<p>What is &quot;least energy&quot;?  You never defined exactly what you're talking about.  I have a background in physics, and I have no idea how you're relating repeating segments to anything physicists understand in terms of a principle of least energy.  Let alone how you would prove such a connection, unless you've enumerated all the other myriad ways of organizing a body plan and why they're &quot;more energy&quot;.  In most other physical sciences, optimizing for some metric usually results in complex designs that resist human compartmentalization, abstraction, reductionism, and understanding.</p>
<p>Check out researchers who used genetic algorithms to optimize an FPGA chip to differentiate between sounds.  The best solution found had a component which was electrically isolated from the rest of the circuit, but nevertheless, the circuit only worked with that isolated component.  No human with top-down hierarchical thinking could design that.

<p>Or an &quot;evolved&quot; antenna (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved_antenna" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolved_antenna</a>) that outperforms every human-intelligence-designed antenna, but doesn't display any hierarchical structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, Karl Friston has confirmed LE as a major part of biological evolution. He's Chair of the neuroimaging at Uni.. Coll. London, &amp; his colleague, John O'Keefe shared the Nobel for Med./physiology with the Mosers out of Trondheim for how geographic memory is encoded in the hippocampi. The ONLY working model of how memory is encoded and quite important.</p>
<p>Here's Friston's article on evolution driven by least energy:</p>

<p>Here's O'Keefe's bio; Friston's also on Wiki...</p>

<p>The science is good. But yer not informed about what's going on.</p>
<p>As a physicist, you're not working with lifelong complex systems like we do in biology and medicine. Of course your lack of biological complex systems and the methods we use to investigate them are not being used in physics.</p>
<p>Evolved antenna are NOT biological systems, which is what's being talked about there. False ID is the problem. But ignoring the hierarchies in living systems which are everywhere is clearly a problem, even tho the neurovascular bundles in every major living organism of  mammals have those, including your own limbs, bronchi and so forth.</p>
<p>Ignoring events in existence, such as the huge number of naturally occurring hierarchies is simply not on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>look at this guys post history.
so you were a physician for 45 years and biologist for 55 AND worked in the car industry for 20 years? bullshit.</p>
