			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, one thing to note is that the kidneys cannot give out pure water either - some minerals and such will go out with it even if your urine is perfectly clear. If you drink a lot of water, but do not take in minerals, especially salt - as you might do during, say, a marathon, where the loss of salt is also made worse by sweating - the level of sodium in your blood might drop to dangerously low levels. That is why you need some salt - but not too much, obviously - in your diet, and why you shouldn't drink five liters of water in one sitting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your urine can also be clear if you have too much diuretics in your system, as it promotes extra water in your urine. Which is why when you are drinking alcohol you need to pee more often, your pee is clearer and you become dehydrated quicker. Just because your pee is clear does NOT mean you are well hydrated from drinking all night, which is one of the causes of a hang over.</p>
