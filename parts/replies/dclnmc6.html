			<div class="markdown"><p>Although right from a EILI5 standpoint, sandboxed doesn't necessarily mean &quot;run authorized code&quot; but rather that each application / function is &quot;sandboxed&quot; from the rest of the device. So say you DO get a magic high end virus through some kind of Snapchat exploit, well it can't do anything, the sandboxing prevents anything in that application from communicating with other applications of data. (But yes, there is far more to it than that. But in a simpler sense, that is actually why it's called &quot;sandboxed&quot;)</p>
<p>And as for more reasons why mobile devices don't get as many viruses is difficulty/money. Sure, find the right exploit chain and escape sandbox then you can now sell to the highest bidder of that exploit chain. (As iOS for example, no one exploit will gain you with instant root read/write access. You need, for example, a Snapchat exploit first, then a sandbox bypass, then user land bypass, then from there the chain could go different ways usually ending in kernel patches to run custom code.) And although this is similar in desktop, desktop simply doesn't have as much security or the need for multiple exploits to cause harm. Desktops are mostly a &quot;one and done&quot; deal, so exploits are found often and sold cheap because of their commonality. iOS exploits for full RW for example go for $1-$2million USD, while a simple browser / flash exploit that takes accounts, steals PayPal/banking etc could go for a measly $200-$10,000. (On the black market.)</p>
<p>It's simply about difficulty and in turn, ultimately security. Mobile devices (at least iOS) are highly sandboxed, that being a very effective security measure.</p>
<p>(For those perhaps still confused about sandboxing and happen to somehow know what virtual machines are, take this: imagine you are running a Windows VM. If that VM gets a virus, it cannot touch your main OS. (Unless of course you get a exploit chain that can bypass the VM/virtual sandbox you just created!) Compare the VM to an iOS application.)</p>
<p>I hope this helps any confusion.
