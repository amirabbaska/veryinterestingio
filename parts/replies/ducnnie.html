			<div class="markdown"><p>Any idea why certain foods/medications are more prone than others to creating allergies? E.g. peanut, shellfish or penicillin allergies (anecdotally) seem far more common than, say, broccoli, chicken, or ibuprofen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is exactly what happened. Based on the above explanation, you can only develop a new allergy after being exposed to something for the first time. </p>
<p>In other words, nobody is allergic to something the very first time they come into contact with it. It may only take one exposure or it may take repeated exposures to the substance, but one day the immune system just decides all of a sudden that substance is a pathogen, and then from that day on, you will be allergic to it. </p>
<p>For example, many first responders and health care staff develop allergies to latex mid-career just because they're in contact with it so frequently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno about this. Never ever was prescribed codeine for anything growing up (heck, was never prescribed any sort of pain medication other than OTC stuff like ibuprofen) and then I was prescribed it for a wisdom teeth extraction and developed hives within minutes of taking the first pill. Like all over hives and the codeine didn’t even relieve the pain. I had to double dose ibuprofen after that just to be able to open my mouth to eat something.</p>
<p>No one else in my family is allergic to codeine, there is no history.</p>
<p>My sister found out she was allergic to a specific UTI medication the first time she took it when she was 15. Never took it before.</p>
<p>I’m not allergic to that medicine and I’ve taken it several times before I learned to prevent UTIs to begin with</p>
<p>We are twins so it freaks us both out when we find something that one is allergic to, yet the other is not. I can eat food that she is allergic to and she can eat food I am allergic to.</p>
<p>We are both allergic to mangoes, however, but that is due to overexposure (we grew up in Hawaii where there’s practically a mango tree on every block). My neighbor had 3 mango trees and we’d steal mangoes when he forgot to harvest them. </p></div>		</li>
