			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is more of an answer than all the people talking about black &quot;playing to draw&quot;. Chess is very binary - it's not like Go where you're adding up a ton of points and you can win by 0.5 points. In chess, when you win, it's a relatively overwhelming win - you have a significant material or positional advantage at the end of the game, or a pretty enormous positional advantage in the mid-game. So you have to make a pretty significant mistake to lose the game - drawing is relatively easy by comparison. </p>
<p>(Obviously, by &quot;pretty significant&quot; in a world-class chess game, I'm talking about mistakes that your average player wouldn't even notice - not just moving your queen into a position where it can be taken or something.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a much better way to put it. Looking at the end of a game, a king and a bishop can't win against the king. Even though a bishop is a lot of material, it isn't enough if that's all there is against a lone King.</p></div>		</li>
