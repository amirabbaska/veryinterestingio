			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why it's almost impossible to get good instant coffee? I've never understood why you couldn't just evaporate the water out of coffee, and package the dry remnants in a little container.</p>
<p>I guess the actual drying process would cause you to lose the volatiles that give it its distinctive flavor?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. We think of water as something that's easy to evaporate off, but it's actually quite difficult compared to some organic liquids. Water molecules are &quot;sticky&quot; while aromatics are much easier to pry apart from one another. Drying by simple evaporation will lose the good stuff long before the water goes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;solution&quot; is then to fractionate it, process it, then add back the aromatics in the proportions you think should be there. That cup of coffee would be stupidly expensive though, which kind of defeats the point of instant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude. Cold brew. A giant French press is $20 on Amazon. Get it and a giant plastic 2 gallon pitcher. </p>
<p>All you do is pour in some coffee grinds and water into the French press. Let it sit for 12-24 hours and then pour it into the pitcher. Ends up being perfect cold brew and because you're buying the beans, your saving money compared to some fucking k cups or whatever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coffee in ice cube trays, cover with parchment or wax paper, and use as the ice cubes for your next iced coffee. </p>
<p>Also a good trick with lemonade, orange juice, etc. </p></div>		</li>
