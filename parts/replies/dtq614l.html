			<div class="markdown"><p>While things heated up further will begin to emit even higher energy light, they will still emit lower energy light as well.</p>
<p>The sun is very hot [citation needed], and emits all sorts of crazy high energy light. However, it also still emits plenty of light visible to humans as well as low energy light like radio and microwaves as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not as much as you might think, actually. The surface of the sun ranges in temperature from &quot;only&quot; about 7,500° to about 10,000°. That's why the sun is the color it is — pale orange-yellow. It very closely approximates a blackbody at about 5,700°K.</p>
<p><em>Inside</em> the sun is much hotter, up to millions of degrees, but the interior of the sun is opaque, so we can't see it. Thermal radiation from the interior of the sun makes its way out via conduction and convection, so the surface of the sun is much cooler than the interior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The peak electromagnetic frequency emitted by the sun is yellow, which is right in the middle of the light spectrum. </p>
<p>Our eyes are just electromagnetic detectors, that detect a bandwidth we’ve determined as being “light” because..... eyes. </p>
<p>We evolved to yellow being the centre of that frequency due to the biggest emission object being the sun, and we use the reflection of “light” on objects to detect where they are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As temperature goes up, the light emitted doesn't ride straight up the electromagnetic spectrum.  I honestly don't know <em>why</em>, but if you look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation#/media/File:PlanckianLocus.png" target="_blank">this image from the Wiki page on blackbody radiation</a>, as temperature goes up to infinity, peak wavelength settles on a very (VERY) bright blue color.</p>
<p>Note, this is the <em>peak</em> wavelength being emitted.  Objects don't just give off a specific wavelength of light due to their temperature: they give off a range with a peak wavelength.  Very hot things give off other wavelengths of light along the spectrum, but the wavelength emitted the most will remain a visible color.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Funny you should say that. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh–Jeans_law" target="_blank">Rayleigh-Jeans</a> says why it is shaped that way, but the law is partially wrong in the ultraviolet range. And at the beginning of the 20th century, when they thought they had all of physics explained, that was a big problem. So big, in fact, they called it the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe" target="_blank">ultraviolet catastrophe</a>.</p>
<p>How did they solve it? They - Max Plank, Erwin Schrodinger, Albert Einstein - blew up physics as they knew it and rebuilt it from scratch. They created quantum mechanics, which solved the problem, but opened whole new areas of study. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the electrical arc, not the steel itself. An electrical arc spews enough ultraviolet radiation to give you sunburn in minutes. Molten steel OTOH gives off plenty of ordinary visible light and a ton of infrared (both of which, especially the latter, can also damage your eyes), but negligible amounts of UV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atoms wiggle around. This wiggling is what we call heat, and it is a measure of how much energy the atoms have. Light is also energy. So an atom can give up a little wiggle energy in order to create a little bit of light energy.</p>
<p>ELI-more-than-ten: On the small scale, particles have some probability of changing how much energy they have if there is some way for them to get or release energy. Because it's probabilistic, you can use some statistics to work out how much energy you expect a whole bunch of these particles to give off as, say, light. If you do this you get something called Planck's law. It's that second equation found <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/PlanckLaw.html" target="_blank">here</a> if you're curious. If you draw this equation out on a plot of amount of light emitted vs wavelength, you get a graph like <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/imgmod/uvcatas.gif" target="_blank">this.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure that is the same as giving off energy to its environment from its internal energy source / temperature..its an edge case at most.</p></div>		</li>
