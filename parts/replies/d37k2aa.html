			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also no science behind it.  Slight correlation in some studies (many simular studies dont see any correlation at all) doesnt satisfy anyones definition of a burden of proof.  </p>
<p>This thread is about science and all he mentioned was that it was reported.  You should take it with a heafty amount of speculation and not that he acknoleged that weed causes a lng term psychiatric effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I don't know if you'd call this proof or just anecdotal, but I myself smoked heavy amounts of weed from the age of 15 up until I was 21 (23) now.</p>
<p>This resulted in me having a moderate (in the grand scheme of things) mental breakdown, and left me with daily panic attacks, and I'm currently taking anti anxiety medication for that.</p>
<p>My family doctor told me that I was genetically more at risk of mental illness than the average person, and my heavy smoking kind of unearthed my current mental state.</p>
<p>Again, I know it's not proof, but other people in this thread are believing the positive anecdotal evidence, so I thought I'd throw my hat in as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more than anecdotal reports. Ask any psychiatrist about the long term effects of weed. It can absolutely destroy a person. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This certainly isn't coming from a scientist, so take it with a grain of salt, but from what I've read, the psychiatric issues may be triggered by an excess of THC firing the endo-cannibinoid receptors in the Amygdala, the fight-or-flight security center of the brain. </p>
<p>This in turn may be because some strains have little-to-no CBD, which helps to regulate THC's impact on the thought process. I've tried this out with dispensary weed, cross referencing it against leafly strain data to see how the various compounds are EXPECTED to act, and it has generally proven to be true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is your number two correct? Anecdotal, of course, but aren't most pot heads skinnier? We noticed a strong correlation between heavy users and weight. This can be explained because heavy users won't want to eat without it, perhaps they sleep in past breakfast, lunch you can't light up so you eat light, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that people who smoke weed rather than drink tend to be thinner because alcohol packs on calories.  In the US, &quot;the munchies&quot; are associated with smoking weed but in my personal experience this gets no where close to the calorie count involved in getting drunk.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>The reason heavy users don't usually see the weight gain is because the initial effect of marijuana is an appetite suppressant. During the &quot;come down&quot; is when the munchies kick in. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As u/THE_CHRONIC_GARDENER said, marijuana is a stimulant that initially supresses your appetite but then causes your body to enter a state where it feels that it should replenish the energy that was consumed during the 'stimulated' time. This is effective in patients who are losing weight due to malignancies and are often nauseated due to chemotherapy. Here, marijuana can allow them to tolerate the nausea better and replenish their energy.</p></div>		</li>
