			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, the appellate courts were also called &quot;Circuit Courts&quot; because originally the 3 judges would be pulled from a rotating pool of all the district judges in that area and do a &quot;circuit&quot; of all the district courts in that area to hear the appeals cases. They still do in some larger Circuits, but they fly now.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 94 US Federal Judicial Districts, with between one and four in each state. However, there may be more than one district court per Judicial district, and more than one judge per court. For example, the Southern District of New York has two courthouses (White Plains and Manhattan) that house approximately 43 federal judges, plus fifteen magistrate judges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I'd say is that it was the Supreme Court that decided that they have the ability to strike down unconstitutional laws: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison#Introducing_judicial_review" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison#Introducing_judicial_review</a>.</p>
<p>The constitution doesn't give courts that responsibility explicitly.  The constitution restricts the power of the executive and legislative branches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marshall reasoned that the Constitution's provisions limiting Congress's power...meant that in some cases the judiciary would be forced to choose between enforcing the Constitution or following Congress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judicial review of laws and executive orders is more of an implicit thing.  It makes sense that there would be laws in conflict with the constitution and that the courts would have to decide between the two.  However, the constitution doesn't have anything in it that says that the courts will be the arbiters of whether laws are constitutional.  It's more that the courts decide what laws say and when laws conflict with each other, well, you gotta go with the higher law - the constitution.</p>
<p>Also, I think it looks random because it is random to an extent.  Someone files a case in some random district where they happen to be and it gets assigned to a judge out of lots of district judges nationwide.  They rule and it can get appealed often to one of the circuit courts and then possibly to the Supreme Court.  Usually if something is being appealed, a district judge will stay their judgement pending the appeal.  If something is contentious, they know their ruling probably isn't going to be the last word on the matter and so nothing goes into effect until the appeals process happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, look at this article from the Constitution, delineating one of the powers granted to Congress:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s say someone challenges a federal law, based in part on this article of the Constitution. The court has to determine whether the law complies or conflicts with the Constitution. In order to do that, the court must decide what “necessary and proper” means - they are not, as written, objective standards that can be objectively applied. </p>
<p>Or Article III, Section 1: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is “good behavior”? Does it mean abstaining from drugs, even on the weekend? Not getting parking tickets? Does it mean not going on NPR and criticizing SCOTUS or Congress while still in office? </p>
<p>Or from the bill of rights: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What constitutes “abridging the freedom of speech”? If you say that people can’t shout “fire” in a crowded theater, are you abridging it? (No)</p>
<p>What about the right to peaceably assemble ... is that right standalone (people can assemble for any purpose), or contingent upon the assembly “petitioning the Government for a redress of grievances”? </p>
<p>Statutory laws, written by Congress and states, are often just as vague. In some cases, they can be literally applied as written (and they generally are when that is possible), but often they must be interpreted to some degree. The court decides “the law says ‘necessary and proper’ and ‘necessary and proper means X.” Both the law as written - the statute - and the court’s interpretation of that statute - judicial or case law - become the controlling law (in the appropriate jurisdiction; for SCOTUS, that’s the whole country). </p>
<p>Courts also play an important role in making sure we have good laws. Most of the laws governing interactions between people - like contract and tort laws - were developed and are continually refined by the courts. Unlike legisatures, courts have the massive advantage of seeing many different types of cases - this allows them to fine tune laws based on real experiences that lead to real cases before them. For example, think of murder. The law is that it’s a crime to intentionally kill someone else. But if universally applied literally as written, that’s a bad law ... we don’t want to punish the person who intentionally kills someone out of legitimate self defense - we have the right to not <em>let</em> other people kill us, after all. By seeing many cases of murder over many years, courts developed fine tuned “exceptions” (affirmative defenses) that essentially “erode” the law on murder to exclude situations where the killing is deemed justified. In many cases, the states have officially adopted (turned into actual statutory law) many/most of the contract, tort, and even criminal laws that were in fact <em>developed</em> by courts over decades and centuries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other side of that, the federal judge who extended DACA admitted that it was illegal to do so, and that Congress needs to codify it into law if they want it to stand.</p>
<p>I understand his reasoning for doing so because allowing DACA to lapse would be a really bad thing, but this could also be read as setting a precedent for allowing the POTUS to rule by executive decree given that DACA was an executive action and not legislation. </p></div>		</li>
