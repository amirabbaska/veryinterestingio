			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome thanks. This goes some way to answering questions people have when they see these sorts of tests. The main one I am thinking of is &quot;would it perform differently/better if it was secured firmly in place like it would be in a real application?&quot;</p>
<p>I always thought it would perform better if the glass was mounted in a steel frame and secured so it couldn't move like it would be in an armoured vehicle, while others often think because it can move that allows more energy to be dissipated. My thoughts were along the lines of what you said in that holding it in place is probably part of the design and it counts on the forces holding it in place being there to help with dissipating the force. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firmly attaching the glass is unlikely to help much, unless you're talking about a very tiny window. The impact of the bullet is just a whole lot of force on one point, it's almost always going to cause the glass to bend somewhat, and glass doesn't do well with bending (since that creates tensile forces within it). </p>
<p>Maybe if the bullet hits very close to the solid frame, it could keep the glass from flexing too much. But generally, no, a very strong mounting won't make normal glass bullet proof. </p></div>		</li>
