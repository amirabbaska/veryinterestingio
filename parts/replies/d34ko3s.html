			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering now.. If you'd go into a black hole (and survive it)... You go along those &quot;walls&quot; to the bottom (i know its infinite.. i mean going along with them just for some time).. What would theoretically happen if you cross those walls back into &quot;normal&quot; space assume you'd be able to? would you get back into space (there wasn't an answer to this, no?) at a different time since you where distorted in space or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. You'd probably end up with a gradual indentation, then a sudden vertical drop at the event horizon, which would be the start of the black hole. The surrounding indentation would represent the gravity well before that event horizon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>sudden vertical drop </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sudden or vertical. The slope should continuously curve and always be less than vertical (vertical is infinite slope which requires infinite mass, which black holes don't have).</p>
<p>And the event horizon is simply the slope on a trampoline that is sufficiently steep for nothing to be able to roll up it, wich wouldn't necessarily require a discontinuity, but more detail than that is I'd say one of the places where the bad analogy breaks down, since the analogy doesn't really account for relativity, light speed, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Force is proportional to the mass, just like in Newtonian gravity.</p>
<p>The alternative view is that the force is the gradient of the potential. The trampoline picture is a good way to visualise the gravitational potential, and the gradient of the potential well for a black hole is only infinite at the 'centre'.</p>
<p>This is where r=0 in Newtonian gravity, so that would be infinite there as well.</p></div>		</li>
