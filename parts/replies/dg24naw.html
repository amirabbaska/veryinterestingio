<p>For example, Fermions are the &quot;mass&quot; particles, and the gauge bosons mediate 3 of the 4 fundamental forces.</p>

<p>This isn't strictly accurate, as the W and Z bosons also have mass. The real difference between Fermions and Bosons is that Fermions have 1/2 integer spin and Bosons have integer spin. The implications of this are probably beyond the scope of a ELI5 thread, but basically it means you can cram as many Bosons into the same state as you want, but you can't do that with Fermions.</p></div>		</li>
